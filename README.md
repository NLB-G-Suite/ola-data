# Ontario Legislative Assembly Data
Data from [Ontario Legislative Assembly House Documents](http://www.ontla.on.ca/pas/house-proceedings/house-documents.xhtml?locale=en), from 2014-07-02 until 2018-05-08 (41st parliment)

- Raw html files in [`html`](html) directory
- Processed json files in [`json`](json) directory

## Example json
File path: `/json/transcript/2016-03-02.json`
```json
[ {
  "speaker" : "The Speaker (Hon. Dave Levac)",
  "text" : [ "Good morning. Please join me in prayer.", "Resuming the debate adjourned on March 1, 2016, on the motion for second reading of the following bill:", "Bill 172, An Act respecting greenhouse gas / Projet de loi 172, Loi concernant les gaz Ã  effet de serre." ],
  "anchor" : "para25"
}, {
  "speaker" : "The Speaker (Hon. Dave Levac)",
  "text" : [ "Further debate?" ],
  "anchor" : "para31"
},
...
]
```
Link to original text may be reconstructed following this pattern:  
`http://www.ontla.on.ca/web/house-proceedings/house_detail.do?Date=2016-03-02#para25`  
where `2016-03-02` is the name of the file and `para25` is the anchor tex

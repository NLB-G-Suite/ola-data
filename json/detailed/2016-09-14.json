To the extent that it benefits our economy over the long term, that’s good for our families, that’s good for our children and that’s good for our grandchildren.", "So what has the government done to get the electricity system on a strong and sustainable footing? We have provided a way to reduce electricity costs for the typical consumer. That is done through the mechanism of a rebate on the provincial portion of the HST. In addition to that, there are other mechanisms to relieve the burden of costs on industry.", "We are addressing the needs of the average consumer. We are addressing the concerns of industry and we are also, then, keeping an eye on the long-term planning to improve the infrastructure of the electricity system in Ontario. There are a variety of mechanisms that were referred to in the throne speech that will provide a stable electricity system for the province of Ontario, which is something that we all need.", "My last comment: I would say that this is a challenging file. It’s a difficult file, but this government is up to the challenge. The plan is outlined in the throne speech.", "Thank you, Speaker, for allowing me my remaining two minutes and six seconds." ],

Here we have a government that has been in power for 13 years, and it’s like driving a 13-year-old car where the muffler is shot, it needs new brakes and the tires are bald, but they think that by putting a new starter in, that car will be just perfect. Well, you still have a 13-year-old car that’s old and tired.", "They talked about hydro rates and giving relief to Ontarians. It’s rather disappointing: They referenced HST, but really and truly it’s the provincial portion of the HST, which is 8%. Now, I have been asked, “Does that really provide some relief for people?” Well, sure. But keep in mind, a little over a year ago, this government took away the 10% benefit that consumers were in fact enjoying. They voted to take it away—the 10%—and now they’re putting 8% back on. So I have a challenge with that.", "The other thing that I was really concerned about and that was alarming to me was the fact that there was not one mention of natural gas. Now, keep in mind, Union Gas is head-officed in Chatham. They employ hundreds of people in Chatham, thousands throughout Ontario. Not once did they mention natural gas. That was a big kerfuffle back when they first leaked it out several months ago. Now, having not mentioned it, my concern is that the delivery charges should in fact be a separate line item." ],

They were crying. The people were crying. They were screaming. They were angry. They were throwing their bills at the organizers. What happened on Monday was really quite incredible because the Wynne government’s response to this pain, this anguish, this turmoil that they have put the people of this province through, is to offer them 36 cents a day in relief with this rebate—this rebate which, really, will make no difference in the lives of the people of this province.", "So to change the channel—that didn’t work. The news yesterday was very clear. This was just an exercise in public relations. The people of this province deserve so much more. You know, 66,000 Ontarians were cut off their hydro last year—66,000 who could not pay their hydro bill. We all know, as MPPs, because we deal with these issues in our offices, that it costs $40 to $100 to actually hook up the hydro once again.", "This is a government in free fall who have forgotten who they work for, who have forgotten who they serve.

We’re going to introduce electoral finance reform. We’re also continuing to make sure that our young people have the right tools for a changing workforce.

By doing that, we are going to give parents the support they need in their daily lives, but we are also going to create a healthy environment for our young people to thrive and flourish.

That investment alone represents $160 billion over 12 years.", "We are also playing a significant role in reducing our debt-to-GDP ratio, which, if you analyze it closely, is levelling out.

I know that that’s what we’ve been doing. New Democrats go back to our ridings when the House takes its breaks, go back and listen to the people in our ridings and listen to their priorities.", "When I heard that the Premier was proroguing the Legislature so she could deliver a new throne speech, I hoped that we would see a real change of course for this government. I hoped that the Premier had been listening to people too and that she’d heard the same stories that I’ve heard. I hoped that the Premier would be making big changes and taking bold steps right now to make life better for the people of this province.", "As New Democrats—and as Ontarians, frankly—hope is in our DNA. We believe passionately that together we can all do better. We can build a better future together and we can make sure that everyone shares in the opportunities that this great province has to offer. That sense of optimism, Speaker, that desire to lift each other up so we’re all better off together, is what drives so many people in this province, each and every day. And it never fails to inspire me.", "I’m thinking about the incredible health care workers—the nurses, hospital workers, technologists and technicians, PSWs, doctors—everyone who takes our hand when we’re not well and helps us through our most vulnerable moments, helping us to heal, helping us to live better. They believe that we’re all better off when we take better care of each other.", "I’m thinking of the remarkable education workers—the teachers, the support staff, the early childhood educators and the child care workers in this province—who pour every ounce of themselves into doing what’s best for our children. There is nothing better, as a mom—I think pretty much anybody would agree that there is nothing better than watching what our kids can do when they get a new opportunity. And we owe it to the fact that so many education workers devote themselves to making sure our kids get the support they need to succeed, inside and outside the classroom. Our publicly funded schools are founded on our belief that every child and every young person should have the opportunities that they need to reach their full potential no matter where they come from, no matter how much money their parents earn, no matter who they are.", "It’s that same belief that together we stand taller, together we reach higher, together we are stronger when all of us are stronger too. It’s that belief that leads so many women and men to work long and hard, to give everything they’ve got to build a better future for their families and, at the end of the day, to reach even deeper and give back to their communities. Ontarians have this incredible desire to build a better province and a better future. It’s that unwavering optimism, Speaker, that genuine belief that tomorrow should be better here in Ontario that drives millions of Ontarians to do the work that we do.", "Everyone who lives in Ontario knows what a great place it is, and people are working hard to make this province an even better home, now and for the next generation. But to realize our potential, we need a government that makes the right decisions, day in and day out. We need a government that does everything it can to take down the barriers that stand in people’s way. We need a government that takes action to help folks lift their families up and improve their lives. We need a government that protects the public services that people count on, like our hospitals and our children’s schools, so they’re there when families need them.", "Most importantly, we need a government that makes the right choices for the next generation. As I listened to the throne speech on Monday, I wanted to hear about the specific actions that this government was going to take to help people. I was waiting to hear the priorities of Ontarians reflected in firm commitments and detailed plans by this government. After 13 years, we need action.", "Il faut agir pour améliorer la vie des gens.", "Good words just are not good enough. Because for all the hope and incredible optimism that people have about our province, the truth is that more and more people feel that we’ve reached a tipping point here in Ontario. People can see that we need to have big changes. Big changes need to be made soon if we want our kids, our young people, to have a better future right here in Ontario.", "Speaker, people see it in their own lives. They see it when they try to find opportunities for their kids or help their aging parents get the care that they need. For a lot of people, life is actually getting a lot harder. People have less security, and good opportunities are few and far between. For so many people, no matter how hard they work, they just can’t get ahead. Costs keep going up and people are struggling to keep up. When the bills come every month, people literally hold their breath, and at the very same time as that, costs are rising.", "We have costs rising, bills increasing, but wages remain flat in the province of Ontario. So when the Premier talks about our economic recovery and growth, a lot of people wonder who the heck it is she’s talking about, who exactly is getting ahead, because people don’t see it in their own lives. But instead of helping, this Premier keeps making choices that actually make things worse.", "In our schools, we see cuts to special education supports. We see teachers and education workers who have to pay for supplies out of their own pockets, and parents see a government that refuses to fix our schools and maintain them properly. There is a $15-billion repair backlog in our schools today, and it’s the result of years of neglect and underfunding by Liberal and Conservative governments who did not share the priorities of parents.", "When young families need care, they should be able to find a spot in a high-quality, licensed public child care system, where the costs are affordable for every family. But that’s not what we have here in Ontario today. Over the past few years, this government has actually forced municipalities—Sarnia, for example—to shut down their child care centres and close those spaces for families in those communities.", "On issue after issue, instead of helping people, the Liberals are making life more difficult. In this year’s budget, the Liberals tried to nearly double the cost of prescription drugs for seniors, and they only backed down because seniors and New Democrats spoke up and forced the Liberals to change course.", "When it comes to the costs that people face every month, now the Liberals are planning to plow ahead with the sell-off of Hydro One. They’ve already gone too far down that road, Speaker. But against all evidence, against all the advice of the Financial Accountability Officer, against the will of 80% of the people of this province who say it is not the right thing to do, the Liberals are plowing ahead with the sell-off of Hydro One. Hydro One should belong to the people of Ontario, now and forever. But this Premier has decided to sell it off to private investors who have one objective, frankly, which is to make higher profits off the hydro bills that Ontarians are paying. Over and over, this Premier keeps making choices that make life harder for the people of Ontario, and that has got to change.", "You know, Monday’s throne speech could have gone a long way to help. It could have done so much to give immediate relief to families, to improve the quality of work in this province, to stop the sell-off of Hydro One and to make sure that everyone has health care they can count on and our kids have the supports that they need to succeed in the classroom. But that’s not what we heard, Speaker.", "After listening to the throne speech, I can tell you that New Democrats will keep working for the real action that people need to see on health care, hydro, jobs and all of the priorities that matter the most to the people of Ontario. Without real action now to make a difference in people’s lives, we won’t be able to build a future that we know is possible in Ontario, a future where we actually reverse the growing gap between those who get ahead and those who fall behind, a future where workers can actually find good jobs that lift them up into the middle class, a future where our economy is more sustainable and the prosperity that we create is shared by everyone who calls Ontario home, a future where we continue to welcome the world and do everything we can to fight inequality, tackle racism and eliminate systemic discrimination.", "That’s the future we want, Speaker. That’s the future that we need to build here in Ontario, a future where every First Nations community has clean drinking water, where they have safe, affordable housing in every First Nations community and proper health care in every First Nations community, and where we lead the fight against climate change and make sure that northerners and low-income families aren’t stuck paying the highest price while big polluters are left off the hook. It’s a future where we work to eliminate poverty and solve homelessness in all our communities, where we do everything we can to lift people up, and where people can see every single day that their government is actually working for them and actually making a positive difference in all of our lives.", "There is no doubt in my mind that we can build a future that is more fair, more just, more prosperous and much more sustainable, and we can do that together, but to get there we need big changes, starting right now.", "Let me focus on health care for a minute. Health care is something that you don’t think about until you need it, but then it needs to be there for you. That’s why we built our universal public health care system, where the care that you get is based on what you need, not how deep your pockets are. In Ontario today, the Liberals are making choices that actually undermine the future of public health care and put it at risk for the next generation.", "Patients are waiting longer in emergency rooms. They’re waiting longer for surgeries. They’re waiting longer for the home care that they need. The wait time, in fact, for folks who are waiting in hospital to go into long-term care has increased by—get ready for this—280% since the Liberals took office.", "And our hospitals are facing cuts year after year by this Liberal government, which promised the opposite. More than 1,400 nursing jobs have been cut. That’s just since the beginning of 2015. Hundreds of health care workers have been laid off, from Windsor to London, from Kitchener–Waterloo to Hamilton, North Bay, Sault Ste. Marie, Timmins, Barrie, Ottawa and here in the GTA; hundreds and hundreds of health care workers are no longer looking after my family and yours.", "I’ve talked to patients like Jeff in London, who said that he had to wait months on end for his hip replacement. He’s not able to do the things that he loves to do in the meantime, and that wait is affecting his ability to work. His big concern, on top of all of that, is that the only answer he gets is more prescriptions to take away the pain, instead of actually dealing with his physical problem and his hip replacement surgery.", "I’ve talked to nurses like Rebecca. Rebecca told me that her workplace is so short-staffed and working conditions are so overwhelmingly overcrowded in their emergency rooms that the situation right now is worse than she has ever seen in her considerable career as a nurse in this province.", "Our hospitals are closing beds, contracting out services to private companies and laying off workers and health care professionals. That’s the Liberal health care system in the province of Ontario.", "It was New Democrats who revealed just last spring that many of our hospitals are, in fact, running at over 100% capacity month after month. The gold standard for capacity of hospital beds being filled is 85%. That’s not even the gold standard; that’s the worldwide standard for hospital occupancy rates—85%. In Ontario, it is over 100% consistently in most hospitals.", "We also revealed that more than $3.2 billion in unfunded, urgent repairs that need to be done inside our hospitals are sitting and waiting for that work, but the Liberals still refuse to tell us how each local hospital shapes up. So much for transparency.", "There is a growing crisis, a silent crisis in our health care system, but the throne speech said almost nothing. That was the most deafening of silences.", "The Liberals have no plan to tackle overcrowding in our hospital hallways. We have hospitals now where, in the hallway, there are labels that say, “Hallway room 1. Hallway room 2. Hallway room 3.” I don’t remember having that, Speaker. For years and years, we didn’t have that kind of problem in our hospitals, but under the Liberals’ watch, we have hallways that are now labelled as if they were rooms.", "What kind of dignity and what kind of privacy does that allow the people in Ontario who need hospital services? None whatsoever. Shame on this government for letting things deteriorate to that point.", "They have no plan to stop the cuts in our hospitals. They have no plan, as I said, to tackle the overcrowding. They have no plan to protect public health care and make sure that our local hospitals are actually there when people need them.", "New Democrats are going to keep fighting to change that. We’re going to keep working to build a health care system that actually puts people first. Our hospitals need to be stable. We need to have stable and predictable funding for our hospitals that keeps up with the growing costs of inflation and population growth. At a bare minimum, that’s what this hospital system in our province requires. Each and every year, at a bare minimum, that’s what’s needed. We’re going to keep fighting to protect and strengthen our public health care so that it’s there not just for our parents as they age, but for our kids too and, yes, for their kids.", "We need action now, and it can’t stop with health care. We need to see real action to make life more affordable, too. I don’t know if the Premier knows this, but since she was elected leader of the Liberal Party and took office as the Premier of Ontario, peak hydro rates have increased by more than 50%—just since she’s been the Premier of this province. That’s her record on hydro: higher costs for families and seniors and higher costs for businesses, which makes it harder for them to hire new workers.", "Six years ago, in September 2010, the New Democrats were the party that called on the Liberals to take the HST off the hydro bills as just a first step to lowering the bills. Six years ago, when the Liberals brought the HST to Ontario, something that the majority of Ontarians were against—six years ago, we said that we shouldn’t be forced to pay a sales tax, an HST, on a basic necessity like keeping the lights on. The HST should never have been put on those bills in the first place, and the only reason we have the HST on hydro today is because the Liberals put it there.", "For 75 months, people have been forced to pay the HST on their hydro bills and now, finally, finally, six years later, the Premier says she’s going to start giving folks a rebate on their HST. I guess that’s good news. It means a bit of relief for people when they pay the bills. But the Premier’s rebate also raises a lot of questions. Why make people wait for four months? Why force folks to pay the HST on hydro for four more months before getting the relief? How long is this rebate really going to last? What’s going to prevent the Liberals from cancelling it at any point? People need relief now.", "C’est maintenant qu’il faut agir.", "So my message to the Premier is clear and straightforward: Take the HST off hydro once and for all. Do it already. Get rid of it for good. When families and seniors open up their next hydro bill, they should see an 8% cut in their costs. They should see that the provincial portion of the HST has been removed, effective immediately. That’s what should happen.", "Don’t stop there. We have to do so much more to lower hydro bills for the long term and prevent those costs from getting any worse. We have to stop the sell-off of Hydro One—stop it in its tracks. We have to stop any further privatization overall of our hydro system. Privatization has been the biggest bane, the biggest problem in our electricity system. For 20 years, Conservative and Liberal governments have privatized critical parts of our electricity generating and transmission systems. That’s what has happened. It is no secret. It is no curiosity. There is no kind of smoking gun somewhere that we have to find to determine why things went wrong in our electricity system. It is as plain as the nose on your face. It was the Conservatives that started privatizing the generation of electricity—they wanted to go a lot further; they held back—and the Liberals came in right behind them and finished the job and continued privatizing more and more. And now they’re privatizing Hydro One. It has driven costs up for everyone.", "Today, our neighbours, the bookend provinces which we sit in between, Manitoba and Quebec, both have public hydro systems—completely public hydro systems like we used to have. And you know what? They pay half or less than what we pay. They pay half or less of what we pay in their hydro bills, so it’s no secret. There’s no secret. The bottom line is that the mess in our hydro system started with the Conservatives and has continued under the Liberals, and it’s time to make big changes in our hydro system. It’s time to put the people of this province in the driver’s seat and make decisions that don’t just work for the government’s friends, whether it’s a Conservative government or it’s a Liberal government, but decisions that actually work for all of us. That’s what needs to happen. The throne speech on Monday should have announced that the government would stop privatizing Hydro One, but once again, the Premier was silent when it comes to the kind of real action the people need to see.", "Let me talk about jobs for a minute. We need to take action now—now—to protect and create good jobs in this province. In fact, action should have been taken long before now to improve the quality of work for millions of people across this great province and to make sure that every worker can actually support their loved ones and build a better future for their families. That’s not a lot to ask. This might have been the biggest disappointment in Monday’s throne speech, at a time when so many workers are struggling to find good jobs, when young people are working full-time just trying to find work, when so many workers have lost their good jobs and now find themselves too young to retire but too old to start over, and when so many of the jobs being created don’t come with the decent pay and security that every worker needs.", "I’m disappointed and frustrated beyond belief by this government’s failure to act, and by its lack of focus on one of the most pressing challenges faced by young people and workers of every age. We’ve lost 300,000 good manufacturing jobs in this province over the last decade—again, while this government was at the helm. And across Ontario, between 2003 and 2011, while this government sat in office, the share of employees in that time—this is important—working for minimum wage in the province of Ontario more than doubled. Nearly one in every 10 workers is now taking home a minimum wage today that is simply too low to get by on, never mind to get ahead. Worst of all, the explosion of precarious work in this province is entrenching the very inequalities that social democrats and progressives are committed to eradicating.", "Now, the good news here is that we can change this. We have everything we need in Ontario to make sure our economy actually works for working people. We just need to see bold action from the government. We need to see the kind of action that the Liberals refuse to take. We have to protect temporary workers from predatory temp agencies by guaranteeing equal pay and fair treatment for every temporary worker. The government needs to bring forward changes in the Employment Standards Act to ensure that every worker has the ability to care for their loved ones and spend time with their family, and can share in all the benefits that this province has to offer.", "We have to lift people up, raise the bar and make sure that no working family is stuck living in poverty. We have to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour in Ontario. Yesterday, Premier Notley and the NDP government in Alberta passed regulations which will lift Alberta’s minimum wage to $15 an hour. Ontario should be leading too. We should raise our minimum wage to $15 an hour.", "On top of that, on top of these real changes that will make a difference in so many people’s lives, we have to make it easier for the next generation of workers to join a union and join the middle class. The facts are clear. The facts are very clear. When workers can join together, speak up together and bargain together for a better deal, it’s not just those workers and their families who are better off; our entire province is better off, too. Workers and unions always stand up to make more room for people inside the middle class, and that’s exactly what we need today: more room for people inside the middle class.", "We need action to make it easier for young workers, struggling workers, part-time workers, contract workers—workers across the board—to join a union and see the benefits of joining the middle class.", "Nous devons renforcer notre classe moyenne.", "We can’t let barriers stand in the way of a better future for the next generation. Joining a union and obtaining a first contract is the best ticket into the middle class, and growing the middle class is the best way to build a future for all of us in this province.", "This is the kind of action that we need to see in Ontario today, and the Premier’s throne speech could have done so much more to make a difference in people’s lives right now.", "I was hoping for change on Monday, but that’s not what we saw. The Premier decided to keep on cutting hospitals, keep selling Hydro One and keep on refusing to take real steps to improve the quality of work for millions of Ontarians. We will hold the Premier accountable for those decisions, but even more importantly, New Democrats will stand up with Ontarians. We will speak up for what matters to the people of this province, and we will be the voice for action and the bold changes that people need to see. We will push this government hard to take action that improves health care, makes life more affordable and more secure, and makes the quality of work so much better for so many more workers. We will put forward a positive vision, based on real action that will improve life for people across this province.", "New Democrats know our priorities, Speaker. We know our priorities very well. We know them very well because they’re the priorities of people. New Democrats are working for this generation and the next, and we are not going to stop until we build a better future for all our young people, for all people, right here in Ontario." ],

We continue to persevere to address those issues and to highlight where the Wynne government has continued to fail glaringly. We know that hydro rates in this province have just recently cost the Wynne government a seat in this House. The Scarborough–Rouge River by-election was a message sent to the government that, frankly, if the direction isn’t changed, they’ll soon be on their way out of this building. And it couldn’t happen soon enough, Speaker.", "We know that across this province, from one quadrant to another—the north, the northwest, the east and the south—people are having to choose between paying their hydro or paying for food. This is Ontario. This is the most prosperous province in Confederation, and yet we’re at a point now where one of the most basic amenities is no longer affordable.", "Speaker, I’ll bring you back to 1905. Some on the Liberal benches may remember the government of the day. It was the government of James Whitney, who was a Conservative.", "The minister of energy and hydro at that time was a gentleman called Adam Beck. We should all know the legacy of Adam Beck. We should all know the history of Adam Beck. Often, when I think about hydro rates and I think about the nature of hydroelectricity generation and distribution in this province, I go back to Sir Adam Beck, because he is the father of public hydro in Ontario. Sir Adam Beck knew at that time that electrification and distribution of hydro and access to electricity was not only vital for the growth of this province and the prosperity of the province, but he knew that it had to be affordable. In that light, he has left us with not only a legacy of public power and the growth that has ensued because we had a public power system, but he has left us with some great quotes that I’ll give to you right now for the benefit of the House.", "Speaker, he’s quoted as saying, “We must deliver power to such an extent that the poorest working man will have light in his home.” That’s Sir Adam Beck, a Conservative, talking about the working man, at that time, in 1905. We would be hard-pressed to hear those words, I believe, from the right wing at this time.", "Another quote from Adam Beck, as he flipped the switch on Ontario Hydro: As he flipped the switch to light up this province, he said, “For the people.” That was top of mind for Adam Beck: “For the people.” And shouldn’t it be that in perpetuity? Shouldn’t we continue to honour that legacy, to understand the benefit that we have in a public power regime?" ],

We have examples of it dating back to 1999, where, in a brief moment of time, the Conservative government of the day, Mike Harris, allowed himself to be a full Conservative—showed his true colours—when they went full privatization. They deregulated the industry. We saw power costs at that time increase almost overnight. Immediately, we saw power jump 30%, in a time where the province was struggling economically, in a time where interest rates were certainly higher than they are today. We saw power costs explode in this province. What did they do? They hightailed it back to some measure of public ownership. They cut their losses, but we are left with that legacy and we see it every day on our hydro bills as the stranded asset, the stranded liability that we see. That’s about a $19-billion price tag that we have yet to fully eradicate.", "Our leader, Andrea—I referenced that that should make up the context of a speech from the throne. If people are listening today, they will find hope in that message, that there is a political party in Ontario that has their needs as a priority, that has listened. And how do you know that? Well, let’s look back six years, when then-Premier Dalton McGuinty and Finance Minister Dwight Duncan, who was from our neck of the woods down in Windsor, decided it was a great deal to partner with the Harper government at the time to bring in and impose the harmonized sales tax on Ontarians. Now, New Democrats joined with the people of this province to fight tooth and nail, to fight the imposition of the HST. It was a fight that ultimately was not won, but at that time we said, “If you’re going to bring it in, at the very least exclude hydro and natural gas, exclude those from the harmonized sales tax, from the HST.” These are inevitable requirements to live in this province. You have to heat your home and you have to keep the lights on. So it was a common sense proposal. It was something that we thought, at the very least—as we knew that costs were going to rise for everyday items in this province—the government could understand that they could do for the province.", "Now, six years later, we see they have finally come to their senses and have understood that people need some remedy. They need some relief. You’re offering them 8% after we’ve seen, under the Kathleen Wynne Liberal government, a 50% increase over the last four years in hydro rates—a meagre, measly 8%.", "I’m having a fun time reading the comments, the editorial comments, as of the last couple of days on this plan, because it is indicative of the fact that this government has done so very little for the people of the province that I don’t think there is anything you can do from here on in that will reverse your fortunes. You are in a tailspin. Your government has made the wrong decisions, time and time again. Whether it’s the privatization of Hydro, whether it’s the cancellation of gas plants, whether it’s eHealth, whether it’s public-private partnerships that have cost this province $9 billion, you fail the province every time. It’s time to reverse the course, and the New Democrats will be doing that.", "The speech—the would-be speech from the throne—can we call it that? The would-be speech from the throne that we should anticipate after the next election—we can’t wait. The speech from the throne that our leader Andrea Horwath will deliver will present a remedy—" ],

We all talk to the same people and when it comes down to it, the health of their family, their friends, their community is paramount.", "Yet, again, under the Kathleen Wynne government, we have seen a degradation of our health care system to the extent that we’ve never seen before. People are being warehoused in our hospital system, as we’ve heard. We have hallway health care, where you’re lucky to get a room, you’re lucky to see a physician for a brief time, and you are warehoused in overcrowded hospitals. That’s your legacy.", "We have an infrastructure deficit where our hospitals are falling apart and the government doesn’t even want to recognize its own failure. You can’t bring yourself to actually see those numbers, let alone present a clear picture of the infrastructure deficit that exists in our hospitals. I’ll give you an example just in Windsor, the other day. We know that they are struggling with an antiquated, outdated sterilization system in a hospital that certainly predates my birth and many others in the city—I think it’s over 100 years old—Hôtel-Dieu Grace hospital. But the system that is there is breaking down. That is directly as a result of the cuts that this government has imposed on our province and on our system. We see front-line care workers being fired, nurses being fired in every community across this province, directly affecting the health and the well-being of our friends and family.", "That’s your legacy. That’s the legacy of Kathleen Wynne. That’s what we have come to expect. But we can expect so much more. We can expect the next speech from the throne, from an NDP government, to address the priorities of the people that we hear so clearly, not address the priorities of the profiteers that have been knocking on the door and having that door swung wide open by the Kathleen Wynne government for years and years.", "Our leader, Andrea Horwath, spoke about the quality and the nature of the employment and jobs in this province. Anyone who is entering or re-entering the job market these days knows that it has never been more challenging. Access to good-quality employment, a good job, let alone a career, is almost unattainable. We have an explosion of part-time, precarious work. We have an explosion of temporary agencies that are now the mainstay of employment recruitment.", "I can remember a day when the back pages of the classifieds were full of help wanted advertisements, and these were good jobs. At 18 years old, you could find a decent job. You could find something that allowed you to support your university education or your post-secondary education. You could find a job that could pay the rent and pay the utilities and maybe give you a little bit of leisure spending.", "No longer, Speaker. People in this province are having an absolute challenge to find gainful employment, and why is that? Well, under the Kathleen Wynne government, we’ve seen a lackadaisical approach to employment standards. We’ve seen neglect on the part of supporting improvements through organized labour. We have seen a government that frankly is a neo-Liberal government that has a laissez-faire approach around economic development: Let the market create itself. Let the market spur its own economic development.", "Well, let me tell you, you have a role to play. You have a role to play in supporting job creators who are there, who are innovating, who are looking to hire. You have the ability as a government to enable and enact supportive measures, like my colleague from London, in work-integrated learning through our post-secondary institutions.", "You have great ideas. You have the ability to ban temporary agencies from paying workers less than their colleagues make, working right beside them. You have the ability to do that, but you haven’t. You have abdicated your responsibility. Why? Because we believe that you just don’t care, or you’re tone-deaf to the needs of workers in this province.", "That’s why New Democrats, time and time again but particularly now, faced with this crisis, have presented you, as a government, with some really tangible ideas, some real tangible, attainable ideas. One: Ban the ability for temp agencies to pay their workers less than the workers they work alongside. You could do that today. You can do that today, and it’s something that workers are wanting." ],

Then I got married. There was always a good job there for me through the union. I made a good wage. I probably made 25 bucks an hour as an apprentice, getting up towards 30, 32 bucks an hour as a journeyman labourer. It enabled me to provide for my family. It enabled me to pay off university debt. It enabled me to have benefits like dental and health care and prescription drugs. It enabled me to be protected at work so that if I was hurt or injured, they couldn’t fire me.", "I was able to be a part of that union because the construction sector in Ontario is a card-based certification process.

Why is it that one sector, one industry in this province has the ability and others don’t? Do other sectors not work as hard as construction workers? I would argue no.

From Dr. Trout and Dr. Stowe to Dr. Frederick Banting, CPSO members have a strong track record of achieving what once seemed improbable and now imminently possible.", "Some of them were also war heroes.

Calvin grabbed her and threw her to safety between a couple of vehicles as the team of horses then mowed him down.", "In his words, he flipped and flopped as the horses trampled his back and head.

Calvin, make sure you wear those scars proudly, because in July 2016 you were a hero.", "Calvin dislikes being referred to as a hero.

  "text" : [ "I’m very pleased to take part in this discussion this afternoon on the throne speech, because it gives me an opportunity to tell you, from the point of view from my community in Kitchener Centre, how the throne speech is going to impact people and businesses that are in Kitchener Centre and Waterloo region.", "We’ve told you that the focus of the throne speech is helping people in their everyday lives and creating jobs. In my community, we’ve got two of the nation’s leading universities. We have an outstanding college, Conestoga College. In fact, the member for Kitchener–Conestoga, I believe, is a graduate of Conestoga College. We have a soaring high-tech sector. Manufacturing in my community is at twice the provincial stats, so it’s 10% in the province and 20% in Waterloo region. We really have generous, caring people in Kitchener who volunteer, and they support our social services. These days it’s really a very dynamic place to live. I always appreciate hearing from my constituents and stakeholders who are working hard every day to make our community a better place to live.", "Although we are seeing this kind of growing affluence in K-W, and it’s tied to our emergent tech sector, there are people who, because of their financial circumstances, are looking for ways to save. What does the throne speech have for them? You’ve heard of the 8% rebate on hydro bills that kicks in January 1. On average, it’s going to mean a savings of about $130 a year for the typical residential consumer, and that also applies to small businesses. Bigger businesses are going to see a break on their hydro bills. We’re expanding the industrial conservation initiative, so if you have a business that’s using more than a megawatt of energy, you qualify. It could save you up to 34% on your energy bill. People at home might be asking, what exactly is a megawatt of energy? It’s equivalent to the amount of energy used by 1,000 homes. That’s a lot of energy. Large businesses are going to save one third on their energy bill. Businesses asked for this. Homeowners have asked for this. We listened. We delivered.", "Mr. Speaker, there are members of the opposition who were calling for relief on hydro costs, and here it is, delivered to the people of Ontario. So why are they complaining? This is what they asked for. Now they’re caught criticizing something they wanted. It doesn’t make sense. Why don’t they want people and businesses to get a break on their energy bills?", "For families who are looking for help with finding child care, we’re creating an additional 100,000 licensed daycare spaces over the next five years. Is the opposition against this too? When those kids grow up, we’re offering a new Ontario Student Grant that’s going to help tens of thousands of low- and middle-income students attend university and college. In fact, if your family is earning $50,000 or less a year, your tuition is going to be free. That’s a game-changer. Is the opposition also against this?", "We’re investing a record amount in repairing and building brand new schools, hospitals, roads, bridges and rail. You only need to visit my community of Kitchener-Waterloo to see evidence of this. You’re going to see a lot of construction happening everywhere. I know there are a lot of people complaining about this, but I tell them that it’s short-term pain for long-term gain. You heard me mention some of these initiatives in my member’s statement this afternoon, but just to restate, we’re investing $300 million for a new LRT system in Kitchener-Waterloo. We’re well into that; we’re halfway through the construction. There is a new $43-million transit hub, a new Highway 7 being built between Kitchener and Guelph, a $35-million advanced manufacturing consortium at the University of Waterloo, $15 million for the Lazaridis school of business at Laurier, and renewed funding for the Perimeter Institute. All of these are critical investments for Waterloo region that our municipal leaders, educators and stakeholders lobbied for—that advanced job creation—and are making us an innovation leader in Ontario, in Canada and the world.", "And yet, there are opposition members who represent Waterloo region who have tried to obstruct these initiatives. But let me tell you, when there’s a groundbreaking or a photo opportunity for these important events, guess who shows up to get their picture taken? What do you call that?", "Interjections." ],

They support—in fact, they’re the ones who are driving these initiatives.", "It’s unsatisfactory—in fact, it’s unacceptable—that the opposition, especially those members who are from Waterloo region, don’t support these programs, these many initiatives that are in the throne speech. People in my community are watching and they’re taking note of this apathy and how some are playing politics. This throne speech is good for Waterloo region and it’s great for the province of Ontario. It’s a plan that does help people and businesses." ],

Sometimes there’s so much going on in here, in government and in our lives that we forget the importance of child care. Because every family—it’s not a matter of choice anymore—both husband and wife have to go to work, and therefore, when you have children, you have to have a safe, proper environment for them. So we need to look at, in any way we can, ensuring that there are appropriate, affordable child care spaces available in all our communities so that working families and these young children can have a safe and, again, a copacsetic learning environment to be in.", "On top of that, as you know, Mr. Speaker—I don’t have to tell you—the cost of child care is extremely prohibitive for families of modest income. Any kind of break they can get in the cost of child care would really make it much more affordable to live in our cities and towns and communities. So the one aspect of the throne speech that I think deserves a great deal of support is the commitment to increase substantially the number of child care spaces in this province. That really will make a difference to families and children across the province of Ontario." ],

They’re dropping it $135. They call that a win. The reason why we’re using tax dollars to make some points on this hydro rate—which is now four times what it was when they came to power.

They’ve realized it.", "The Premier said, “This isn’t just a Toronto issue; this is everywhere.” Well, I have to say to the Premier and the Liberal Party, for five years, we on this side of the aisle have been talking about the crisis in energy. We have brought example after example after example. I can tell you, Speaker—I’ve used this example maybe 30 times in the Legislature and it never seemed to sink in: When we—many of us, Liberals, NDP and the PCs—were travelling Ontario in the pre-budget consultations, in Ottawa we heard from Jennifer. I’ve used this example. Jennifer sat in front of us. She’s an ODSP recipient. She said, “I have to decide whether to heat or eat.” She told us the times that she shuts the power off in her apartment completely so that she can save enough money to buy food. That’s the reality. They were there; they sat in that hearing. “No, there’s no crisis. There’s no crisis in hydro.”", "I can tell you, Speaker, that in November 2011, just after the 2011 election, the Auditor General came out with his report and he said to us at that time, “Man, we’ve got a real crisis in the energy file.” A couple of things: He said that the debt retirement charge has already been paid off. We paid $8.7 billion of the debt retirement charge and it was only $7.8 billion, yet it was on the bills. He wondered, “Why are you still charging the people of Ontario a billion dollars a year in the debt retirement charge?” So the government, this year, took it off and it wants a pat on the back: “Well, we reduced your bill by taking off the debt retirement charge.” Well, they’re five years late. They’ve collected another $5 billion, and they’ve wasted that money and mismanaged it, and lost some of it in scandals. It’s this patting themselves on the back for these things that have gotten us nowhere that they don’t deserve. They didn’t deserve to keep that money from the people of Ontario.", "The Auditor General also told us, “There’s this thing called global adjustment. You had better start paying attention to it.” At that time, it was several hundred million a year. He laid out a plan for what it would escalate to in 2015, and he said, “If you do not make a major change in your strategy, in 2015, it’s going to hit a billion dollars a year.” Well, lo and behold, in 2015, it hit a billion dollars. I think he was about $20 million off from his number. That’s pretty good forecasting, five years out.", "Did they listen? Not a peep, not a word—nothing. They didn’t change anything, and lo and behold, now we have a crisis. They just realized now that there’s a crisis. So what do they do? Now they’re trying to lay blame: “It wasn’t us.” This is another one of these “the dog ate my homework” moments: “It’s not us. We didn’t do anything. We inherited an old system. That’s the problem. We had to fix 10,000 kilometres of transmission line.”", "Two things on that: First of all, whether they laid that much transmission line or not, I don’t know. I don’t believe them. But I can tell you that what they did in Ontario was to get to these far-flung wind turbine and solar projects that needed thousands of miles of transmission lines. So if they did put it down, it wasn’t to fix the system, it was to get to these ridiculously expensive wind and solar contracts.", "They’re telling us now—the Premier repeated it yesterday—the new talking points: “No, no, we inherited the system, and that’s why your bills are where they are.” But that is not what the Auditor General told us. Only in December, on page 220 of the Auditor General’s annual report, she said, “Most of the increase in what consumers pay for electricity has come from generation-cost increases.” That’s not these transmission lines the Premier’s talking about. They account for “60% of the overall cost of electricity.” So never mind what the Premier and the energy minister are making up in these new talking points of theirs; let’s look at the facts from the auditor.", "She went on to say, “Generation costs have increased by 74% over the last decade, from $6.7 billion in 2004 to $11.8 billion in 2014, and they are expected to grow to $13.8 billion by 2022. In particular, global adjustment fees have increased significantly, from $650 million in 2006”—$650 million in one year—to $7 billion in 2014. It’s actually $7.03 billion. That’s where I said the auditor said that if we’re not careful, that could hit $7 billion by 2014. Well, lo and behold, it did because they didn’t change anything. Absolutely against what the Premier said, it is not these transmission lines. It is, according to the auditor, that “From 2006 to 2014, electricity consumers have already paid a total of $37 billion”—this is in generation, Speaker—“and they are expected to pay another $133 billion in global adjustment” in the next 17 years.", "Speaker, you can talk all these talking points and try to lay blame. It is all about the flawed Liberal policies that they brought in that created this crisis five years ago that they only finally noticed last week.", "The Auditor General tells us a couple of other things, too. The Liberals have been using the energy file as their play toy for many, many years. Whenever they need to raid a piggy bank, that’s where they go. The Auditor General told us in fact that—this is on page 214—“The ministry has issued a total of 93 directives.” This is when the energy experts tell you one thing and the energy minister says, “I don’t like that. That’s not going to help me. Let me issue a ministerial directive.” These are very rare, but this government, from 2004 to 2014—93 directives. I’m quoting the auditor: “Through them, it has made a number of decisions about power generation—decisions that sometimes went against the OPA’s technical advice....” The auditor stated, “It is our view that the ministry did not fully consider the state of the electricity market or the long-term effects different supply mix scenarios would have on Ontario’s power system ... A number of them have resulted in significant costs to electricity consumers.”", "Speaker, you can’t deny the facts from the auditor. It is the generation that they put on and it is their own directives telling the ministry, “I don’t care what you said. I’m doing it my way”—93 times they told them that, and it resulted in significant costs.", "One of them is a great example. These are the auditor’s words: “Expensive wind and solar energy—we calculate that electricity consumers have had to pay $9.2 billion ... more for renewables over the 20-year contract terms under the ministry’s” new price compared to the old pricing model. That’s for the same amount of green energy. Absolutely purchasing the same amount of these renewables—$9.2 billion to do it their way because they issued a directive that said, “I don’t care how you want to buy it. I don’t care that you want to buy it at an efficient rate and at a proper price. I’m going to fritter away $9.2 billion for whatever reason.”", "Now, of course, we have learned later that all of these contracts to Liberal-friendly companies have given them millions and millions of dollars in Liberal coffers. That, of course, is not the Auditor General. That’s me sharing what we’ve learned over the last few months.", "Speaker, the auditor has a couple of other examples. When the Premier yesterday—I was startled. I almost fell off my seat when she said that we make a profit selling power to the United States and Quebec. I thought, now I completely understand why the Liberals don’t see anything wrong with the pain that the Jennifers have, because they think the revenue they get from the States and Quebec, paltry as it is, is profit. They forget that there are expenses against that. But the Auditor General doesn’t forget. She told us that since power is exported at prices below what generators are paid, the province has paid $3.1 billion to Quebec and the United States to take our surplus power. This is the Auditor General. The Premier says we make a profit at it. When you pay somebody to take your power, I don’t know how you make a profit. The Auditor General said that it’s $3.1 billion that we pay. We are the best economic development generator that New York and Ohio have. Those companies that now buy this cheap power from Ohio and Quebec compete against us, and I’ll tell you, they’re eating our lunch. It’s absolutely unbelievable, what’s happening.", "I can tell you that the government may not hear, so let’s look at a couple of examples. Let me look at a letter to the editor in the energy minister’s own riding. This is in the Sudbury Star. I’ll look at a couple of things—because, of course, you’ve heard the Premier and the energy minister say, “We spent all that money fixing the system.” Well, of course, the auditor said that that’s not true. We know that that’s changed now, so we understand that. It’s not these transmission lines. Then they said, “That’s because we don’t want any more brownouts.” Well, I can tell you, the letter to the editor in the Sudbury Star to Glenn Thibeault says:", "“I’m sure that Thibeault”—they call him “Thibeault”—“is now fully aware that nine downtown Toronto high-rise condominiums have had four power outages in the last two weeks.” This is just from this week.", "“On Sept. 7, 2,000 customers were affected....", "“Thibeault should be asking them if the electricity ... under his leadership is reliable and if they’re experiencing blackouts.", "“Not only do we still have blackouts and brownouts under” this “Liberal leadership, but we’re also paying thousands more.”", "Maybe he’ll listen to his own residents who are writing letters to the editor. But I can tell you that this new system that the Premier seems—she forgets the day a year ago when she was running around giving gift cards to the people in Toronto when they experienced the blackouts. It’s convenient to mentally black out the days, but the physical blackout lasted.", "I can tell you, every Friday morning when I go down to my office at home, I have to reboot my computer because my power has flickered. I live out in the country; I’ll admit that. I live in Corbeil—a beautiful place—but we do have unreliable power. Every single Friday, I go through a routine. I have to reboot my computer and keep tapping my phone to get the light back on. These are the little things you have to do. I have to reset the flashing clock—all of these things, because every single Friday morning, when I get home, one day throughout the week the power went off.", "I can tell you, on Christmas Day—it was the worst Christmas we ever had this year. We had 20 people coming over on Christmas Day. On Christmas Eve, around 11 in the morning, the power went off. It was off for two days. The Christmas meal, we had to—literally, Patty went out and barbecued as much of what she could barbecue. We live in the country. When we lose power, we don’t have running water because there’s no pump. You can’t flush a toilet because there’s no pump. There’s no heat in the house because even though we’re lucky enough to have natural gas, there’s no blower on the furnace that works. I didn’t see the Premier running around in North Bay or Corbeil when we had no power. This is the reliable system that they brag about today. This is the kind of arrogance that we face here. I can tell you: All those new talking points that they have—they don’t fly because they defy exactly what the Auditor General said.", "It’s sad in the province of Ontario that when you listen to a Premier or one of the ministers, there’s nothing you can actually believe. It always takes the Auditor General, the Financial Accountability Officer or the OPP to tell us the truth. I’ll tell you, we’ve got to be getting awfully tired of that in Ontario, when you can’t even rely on anything that these people have to say.", "I’ve been running a petition. I read the petition today. I read it yesterday. I have 1,500 signatures. I can tell you, in my hometown, when I started my petition, here’s one of the letters that I received. It said:", "“Thank you for giving us the chance to be heard. Some of us are apartment-dwellers and are terrified our rents will have to rise substantially in order to cover this obscene hydro rate that the Liberals have stuck us with. I wish you success with this petition.", "“PS. We’re all seniors.”", "I thank Sheryl for sending me that note.", "I got an interesting letter from a Sudbury business. I won’t mention the Sudbury business name or who it is. It said:", "“Mr. Fedeli,", "“I write this letter in support of your petition. Managing a small business in Sudbury, I have seen first-hand the skyrocketing cost of hydro in the past few years. When we opened the business at our current location in 2004, our average hydro bill was $250 a month. Last week, I received a bill for over $900.”", "Then he goes on to talk about all the energy savings they put in: timers, lighting, LEDs; they disconnected a hot water tank, and they go on and on with all the savings they tried. But he said, “I’ve had to lay off an employee last January because it was either hydro or the employee.” Then he talks about what I should tell the energy minister, which I won’t be able to read in the Legislature.", "But I can tell you, Speaker, in my hometown of North Bay, we’re really hearing it loud and clear. The headline in the North Bay Nugget two weeks ago now: “Hydro ‘Out of Control.’” The kicker is, “‘If she (Premier Kathleen Wynne) was the CEO of a company, she would be gone.’” Then it goes into some awfully sad stories of families who are affected by their skyrocketing hydro rates.", "This one: “Soaring Hydro Rates Killing Jobs.” That’s the headline of the North Bay Nugget on August 27. It gets into the story of a woodworker who is forced to lay off a staff member just so he can afford to pay his hydro bill.", "That’s why “Soaring Hydro Rates Killing Jobs” is the headline. It is what’s happening. It’s not unlike anything we have been saying here for the five years I’ve been here. We’ve heard from the Ontario Chamber of Commerce, who wrote a special paper; the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, who wrote a paper—ignored by the Liberals, completely ignored until, in their own minds, we are now at a crisis. Well, we’ve been at a crisis for years. Why do you think we have lost 350,000 manufacturing jobs in Ontario? We have the highest energy rates in North America.", "We’ve always talked about our hydro rates at home. They’re even more expensive than Hawaii’s. Most people here, especially on the Liberal side, where they don’t have too many northern or rural members, don’t understand the difference. The peak rates in Ontario are 18.6 cents a kilowatt hour, but where I live in Corbeil—I live in a medium-density centre, not a high-density one like Toronto—I pay 22 cents. Just down the road from me, about two miles down the road, is a friend of mine, Phil Konig. He pays 26.5 cents a kilowatt hour in peak times. That’s because he’s in what they call low density.", "There are three different levels here, and many people, especially on the government side, would absolutely not be aware of that. In fact, many people in Ontario would not be aware of that. That is a higher rate than hydro in Hawaii, an island thousands of miles away, where they have to generate their own power. But all of these experts have been telling us that.", "I want to say a special thanks to Global TV for the phenomenal exposé they did this summer. Some of the headlines of their stories were called “Energy Minister in the Dark,” “The High Cost of Soaring Hydro,” “Hydro Horror Stories,” “Families Struggle”—and the list goes on and on. I attribute a lot of the changes in this Liberal government to what happened in the exposé on Global TV and other media who have finally looked and said, “Wow, we really do have a crisis here in Ontario.”", "Speaker, in the remaining seconds that I have, I can tell you that, as finance critic, I look at this billion-dollar band-aid—and I asked the Premier and did not get an answer: Where are you getting the money? They’re not fixing any of these problems that the Auditor General and other experts have outlined; they’re just borrowing a billion dollars to give us a billion dollars, and hopefully we’ll go away for a while. Well, that just does not work." ],

I’m hoping they’re watching on TV. Last night, we had a meeting in Port Colborne by a local distributor that services Fort Erie and Port Colborne to talk about rates going up less than $2. People came and listened to the presentation for about 45 minutes. Then single moms, single dads and seniors started talking to the VP. They started screaming about their hydro rates and how they could not pay their bills. They weren’t there about the $2; they were there about their bills that have increased by 50% and 75% and 100%. They broke down crying—and I want you guys to hear this—in front of a hundred people that they don’t even know. They may know a few there, but they don’t know them.

He responded to the throne speech by addressing one of the major concerns with this government, or this throne speech, which was the issue of electricity. To put it very bluntly, it’s very clear, through what the member spoke about and what we know, that the issues in the energy file lie directly as a fault of this government’s failed policies. That’s absolutely correct. In fact, the key piece to the member’s speech, which I want to highlight, is that not only is it the government’s failed policies, but a specific policy, and that is the privatization of Hydro One.", "Now, the Premier likes to call this an ideology, a question of ideology, a question of, simply, philosophy. Let’s look at the facts. We have independent evidence—and I believe in evidence-based decision-making—that states very clearly that selling off Hydro One, not because it’s an ideologically wrong thing, is independently, on an evidence basis, going to put the province in a worse economic position. It’s going to make it more difficult for the province to fund the essential services that the province needs to fund. It is a bad decision, based on evidence—not based on ideology but based on independent evidence and the independent opinion of an officer of the Legislative Assembly.", "In addition, we have other examples, other jurisdictions where energy was privatized and rates increased. We have this very jurisdiction, where we’ve seen what happens when you deregulate electricity. Right after the deregulation of electricity by the previous Conservative government, rates went up. That is evidence. We know this. This is what happens. When you deregulate, when you privatize electricity, rates go up. This is one of the key reasons why we’re in the hydro crisis we’re in, and this is why the government needs to take a strong stance to stop the sale of Hydro One." ],

When we heard from the Premier again yesterday, in answering both our leader’s, Patrick Brown’s, questions and my questions, she talked about, “Well, the sale of Hydro One is not going to increase your hydro bill.” I can tell you two things. First of all, I draw your attention to the Financial Accountability Officer. Again, hearing something from the Premier and the ministers is one thing, but actually hearing the truth from the Auditor General, the Financial Accountability Officer or the OPP is generally where we have to get our material.", "The sale of Hydro: The Financial Accountability Officer told us that there will be a long-term negative impact on the province. He said that “the initial 15% sale of Hydro would significantly reduce the province’s deficit in 2015–16.” So we know, through the Financial Accountability Officer and, in fact, the latest budget, that they’re using this money to artificially balance. So when they say, “We’re going to balance by 2017-18,” the Financial Accountability Officer told us that we will plunge back into deficit immediately after the election because they’re using this one-time money to balance the budget.", "But taking that money—they’re taking $5 billion and using it against the debt of Hydro, but taking $4 billion away. We still have a mortgage to pay at Hydro, and so they have to go to the hydro ratepayers and raise rates to pay the mortgage. There’s no money left to pay the mortgage when you don’t have an asset. So yet again, I use the Financial Accountability Officer to correct the record here." ],

It’s really interesting because the whole goal of this throne speech was to promise this restart, this moment of humility and this moment of recognizing that there were people in this province—because it’s really interesting that I brought up the Building Ontario Up throne speech from July 3, 2014. It says, “Building Ontario Up,” and now this speech is building “Ontario up for everyone.” They remembered that they’re here to work for everyone. I guess that’s an encouraging step.", "It’s interesting, because you look at the language from the first throne speech and there’s lots of talk about openness and transparency, although I must mention that the FAO, the Financial Accountability Officer, might have some challenges to that language.", "I actually had to introduce a piece of legislation so an independent officer of the Legislature could access information that he should have access to. That’s how open and transparent the Wynne government is. I have his report here, and I may get a chance to quote from it.", "Also in that original throne speech from 2014 we heard about this activist centre where people of this province were going to be part of the solution. It was going to be an inclusive process around policy development. Meanwhile, as late as four weeks ago, the new Minister of Energy said that there was no crisis on the energy file—no crisis, even though I would say northern communities have been disproportionately hurt by these high energy costs, because they don’t have other options. The previous Minister of Energy, not that long ago, actually was talking about the fact that the increase in hydro costs was no more than the cost of a cup of coffee. It’s astounding. That’s where this Premier considers the activist centre to be.", "The language in this throne speech had all the right touch points, I must admit. There must have been a better speech writer for the 2014 throne speech, because the throne speech we heard on Monday was really a public relations exercise in trying to manage the image—really an image-control public relations process. Here we are, as legislators in the province of Ontario, and it is Groundhog Day at Queen’s Park because we are going to see the same pieces of legislation come to the fore day in and day out—almost 200 pieces.

I was listening very closely to see if there was a change in the tone from the government post-throne speech. We saw nothing.", "I must point out that the Minister of Energy was in Kitchener. He was on the local CBC News. “Glenn Thibeault Says Liberals Aren’t to Blame for Soaring Kitchener Gas Rates.” On Monday, there was an acknowledgement: We hear people, but you will never address a problem until you admit that there is a problem. The problem is the policies and the actions of this government on the energy file. The minister goes on in this interview to—this was with Colin Butler of CBC News:", "“Kitchener homeowners have been told they’ll face a possible $80-a-year hike on their gas bills thanks to the Ontario Liberals’ new cap-and-trade system, but Energy Minister Glenn Thibeault suggested his government isn’t to blame.”", "He goes on to make a few excuses. He says that they don’t dictate what’s happening in the energy sector, even though political interruption and intervention has been the new culture in the energy file in the province of Ontario.", "It goes on to say—I mean, basically the city of Kitchener is looking for more clarification on the energy file. They want to know how this is going to impact the citizens of Kitchener.", "It says in here, “In order to fall in line with the new system, Kitchener Utilities said it would have to raise rates by upwards of $80 a year for the average Kitchener homeowner in 2017 to buy credits in time for when cap-and-trade comes into effect in 2018.”", "Councillor Scott Davey told CBC News on Monday, “All that’s happening here is we’re going to be passing on a large bill from the province to the ratepayers of our gas utility.”", "That’s pretty interesting, that a municipality has weighed in, because municipalities, based on the latest meeting at AMO, end up picking up a lot of these pieces. I’m sure the councillor from Scarborough could attest to that. They’re the very local-level politicians, and the cost of energy was the consistent theme that we heard at AMO.", "The throne speech on Monday promised a little bit of relief. I think we’ve done the math. It’s about 36 cents a day—much less than the cost of a cup of coffee—and it is not going to provide true relief. If we’re honest about it, that really isn’t going to address the crisis—the newly recognized crisis—in the energy file that the Premier has finally woken up to.", "What we did hear in the throne speech—and you have to pay attention to language, I think—is that the Liberals are saying that they had to increase the cost of energy and that they had to make these investments because of aging infrastructure. Yet, when the Auditor General did a review of the Ministry of Energy—this is from an Adrian Morrow piece from just less than a year ago—the Auditor General said, “‘We found that the electricity power planning process had essentially broken down over the past decade,’ Ms. Lysyk said at a Queen’s Park news conference. ‘The [energy] ministry has made a number of decisions about power generation that went against the OPA’s technical advice. In addition, these decisions did not fully consider the state of the electricity market or the cost impact on consumers.’”", "So this is really a wilful intention to ignore evidence on the energy file. And who ends up paying the price? The citizens of this province.", "That leads me to the discussion around energy poverty. Energy poverty is sort of a new concept. I think the activists and advocates around the province had to come up with some language and some terminology to define what is happening. Because when energy policy goes so wrong, as has happened in the province of Ontario, the poorest people, the poorest people—the most vulnerable people in the province—end up paying the price. It is so unfortunate that that is actually the reality for people in this province of Ontario.", "I do want to say, though—I want to make sure that people do understand what energy poverty is. Canadian households spend—this is interesting—at least 10% of their total expenditures on home energy use. “That’s almost one tenth of Canadian households putting 10 cents of every dollar towards electricity, natural gas and other forms of energy ... This situation has come to be known as energy poverty, when basic energy needs such as heating, lighting and running appliances become a substantial expense and burden.", "“And unfortunately, energy poverty is regressive, hitting lower-income households harder. In 2013, almost 16% of households earning $27,000 or less, and almost 17% of households earning between $27,000 and $47,000, were in energy poverty.” These are the people that we have been talking about for years, Mr. Speaker.", "Finally—at least there’s an acknowledgement, but it goes on to say, “Provincial and federal governments should also note how policies can affect prices. Perhaps the most striking example of government policies leading to higher electricity prices comes from Ontario, the province with the third-highest percentage of households in energy poverty. Ontario’s electricity prices grew by more than 50% between the winters of 2005 and 2015.” They doubled. They doubled from 2005 to 2015. That has left people hurting.", "Every throne speech should have at the centre of it a reminder to everyone in this House that we are here to serve the people, and that has been lost on this government. The throne speech that was delivered on Monday had some pocketbook items, looking to soften the blow of 13 years of painful policies, but you have only to look at the communities and truly listen to the voices of people in this province to actually hear what they are experiencing. It is a combination of frustration and anger, but there’s also fear, because when energy poverty is so real for people, they see how this will prevent them from reaching their potential. And you’re never going to build Ontario up when you leave the most vulnerable behind. That is what this government has done with their energy policy.", "I’m going to read you a couple of letters so that it’s not just me speaking. This is from the Kitchener Post, a letter to the editor. It says, “Humbug to Ontario Hydro Rates.” This was actually written by Harry Watts, who is a World War II veteran who lives in our region and in Kitchener. He says:", "“I live on my own and my income is from two pensions: Old Age Security and Canada pension. These I have to stretch a bit for any extras.", "“In 1992, I was paying $50 every two months for my electric bill. Then along came the smart meters and my costs climbed to $85 for two months. Then along came the gas plant boondoggle and my costs have risen to $180 every two months. Then Hydro One is sold and now my bill is $105 for one month.", "“I have just turned on my one Christmas tree light and found my old Coleman camp stove and two Coleman pressure lanterns.", "“Merry Christmas to the Grinch family.”", "I think it took a lot of courage for Harry Watts to actually write that letter and share his story, because it isn’t a story that any of us should be proud of, and it isn’t a story that should be happening in the province of Ontario.", "Here’s another writer, Vic Snowden from Kitchener. It says “Humbug to hydro rates” again:", "“I read Harry Watts’s letter in the Record where he commented on the ridiculously increased cost of hydro making life very difficult for people who only get Old Age Security and Canada pension. They should get a break on their hydro bills.", "“Watts is a Second World War veteran and I am sure there are others just like him who are struggling to survive and it seems that it is going to get worse under Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne.” That is from December 21.", "Another one from Glenn Reist:", "“When we received notice in the mail that Kitchener-Wilmot Hydro will change bimonthly billing to monthly billing, I responded by expressing concern. Such a move would be compromising the current popular green philosophy, resulting in additional use of paper and cutting down of trees, and an increase in administration costs to the consumer. The reply from KW Hydro was that this is mandated by the province for all municipalities. Why? Bimonthly billing has served us well for decades.” We would be in agreement with that.", "“I now have received the first of the one-month billing, and wow: a 5% increase immediately. Basic economics demands an increase, but I didn’t expect that much upon first billing. I expected a more subtle increase....", "“Seniors on CPP and OAS—with a 1.5% annual increase—will soon fall far short.”", "This is actually happening. This is happening in all of our communities across Ontario. And what do we have? We have a throne speech which promises—it’s really interesting. They’re going to publish the rebate on their bills, but they’re not going to publish—actually, they refuse to show—the cost of cap-and-trade on natural gas and energy bills. This is a very convenient level of openness and transparency on behalf of the Liberal government.", "I will say that since the prorogation and since we’ve all come back—we all, I’m sure, have this sense of anticipation about coming back. This is an amazing place to work. It’s a privilege to represent your communities here. I would also like to extend my congratulations to the member from Niagara. It’s his last day tomorrow. And I do want to pass along my best wishes to our House leader, Gilles Bisson, as he recovers from surgery. He’s had a hard time. We miss him and we do send him our best.", "But quite honestly, when you come back here and then you deal with a throne speech like this and this prorogation process, where we have to revisit all of these pieces of legislation, it’s discouraging. It’s discouraging because there’s such a lack of action on the very issues that all of us care so deeply about.", "To top it all off, Mr. Speaker, just to finish this point on how strange this place can be, the Liberals have a petition to themselves. The petition reads, “Support lower hydro bills.... Add your name to support lower hydro bills for Ontarians.”", "I just want to say I’m going to affix my signature to this because I fully support the lowering of hydro. I can’t table it because it’s not in official petition format, but they have a majority government. They have a majority government. If you really wanted to address in a substantive way the high cost of energy in the province of Ontario, you could do so. But it didn’t happen in that throne speech; it did not happen on Monday. On Monday, what we had was essentially a public relations exercise that will, once again, fail the people of this province.", "Now, there are other issues, of course, that were touched on in that throne speech. For us, though, this false choice that you have to sell Hydro One to fund infrastructure when we’ve also heard from the Premier recently that you have to sell Hydro One to fix Hydro One—and then we’ve been told that the sale of Hydro One will actually find efficiencies and make energy less costly in the province of Ontario. Nobody believes that. I would encourage the government to try to stop selling that to the people of this province because they’re not buying it; nobody is. Then, the whole cost of why energy is so high. This is from the Auditor General: “Ontarians have paid $37 billion more than market price for electricity over eight years and will pay another $133 billion extra by 2032.”", "This is from the AG’s report and Adrian Morrow, the Globe and Mail: “The Liberal government has repeatedly overruled expert advice.” If you are blaming the fact that you had to increase the infrastructure and maintain the energy infrastructure too, and that’s why energy costs are so high, that is not true. The reason energy costs so much in the province of Ontario is because of a fundamental mismanagement of the energy file by successive energy ministers, who clearly thought that the billions of dollars—I mean, to be fair, $37 billion is so much money, it’s sometimes lost on people. But you know what they understand? They understand that hydro bill that they get every single month, and they know the truth now. The people of this province know the truth.", "I want to end by addressing one of the comments that was made by my colleague from Kitchener Centre. She talked about those of us who attend events for announcements. Well, I must tell you, I don’t get invited to those events and I don’t think a lot of people, actually, in the opposition get invited to those events. Now, we should attend those events, because it’s not your money. It’s not your money. It is the people’s money, and you should invite us so that if you actually did something good, we could say it. Instead of making a reannouncement about an announcement or having a press conference to make another promise to honour another promise, if you actually were doing something that we could say something positive about, I would go to those events. Of course, I’d have to know about them and I’d have to be invited.", "I just want to say it makes it awkward. It seems petty and small-minded. It must be socially awkward for the members when they’re in my riding to not have the MPP there. But more important than that, it’s disrespectful to the voters who elected us in those ridings. That is really disrespectful, and they see it.", "Anyway, I must be doing a really good job because the cabinet ministers are in my riding all the time, announcing money. So I’m shaking that cage and I’m getting results for the people of Kitchener–Waterloo." ],

We find out from the Auditor General that the OEB and the IESO were recommending all along that these same changes not be made, but the government chose not to listen to them and it has resulted in much higher costs. So what did they do? They changed the legislation so they no longer have to provide this advice, because it’s embarrassing when your agencies tell you not to do something because prices will go up and you shouldn’t do it, and you ignore it. Now you have to explain to people why you’ve got the highest prices in North America.", "These are problems that are there.

I will only say that in my two years serving as the Minister of Transportation—in fact, not long after becoming Minister of Transportation—that member specifically was in attendance at an event I did in Kitchener regarding the wonderful Kitchener-Waterloo ION LRT project, a project that our government, thanks to the advocacy of my colleague from Kitchener and her predecessor and this Premier, is making a significant contribution to.", "Secondly, I see that my dear friend, my opposition critic, the member from Niagara Falls, is here with us today. Not that long ago, thanks in large part to the blueprint, the balance plan that is contained in the throne speech with respect to moving the province forward and building it up, the member from Niagara Falls was there when the Premier—thanks to the Premier’s leadership—the current chief government whip, the member from St. Catharines, myself and others were actually in St. Catharines to announce that we will be extending GO train service to Niagara Falls.", "I guess this is my way of saying to the member from Kitchener Centre and others that there are opportunities for opposition members to be there to celebrate the good news, because there is so much good news to be celebrated, particularly with respect to the transportation and infrastructure investments that we’re making across the province of Ontario.", "I could spend quite a bit of time this afternoon talking just about the transportation pieces that are contained in the throne speech, and I’ll come back to those in just a quick second.", "I also wanted to point out, on page 8 of the throne speech itself, it was contained that since 2013, seven new hospitals have been built in five communities. I think everyone, on both sides of the House, amongst all three caucuses, would understand the importance of making sure that fundamentally top-quality health care and hospitals are provided for the people of Ontario.", "I am so proud, as many in this chamber would know and have heard me say in the past, to represent the community of Vaughan. Not that many weeks ago—thanks again to the Premier and to this government with respect to how we are building the province up, and thanks to the balanced plan we have that is contained in the throne speech—we were able to announce that the hospital that will be built in my community, in Vaughan, a project that many of us have worked hard on for a number of years—that the contract has been awarded to an organization, to a company, and we expect that groundbreaking will happen a little bit later this year. That’s just one of many examples that we have, both in this throne speech and within our government’s general agenda, to move the province forward.", "There was a discussion earlier this afternoon from colleagues on this side of the House with respect to the 100,000 daycare spaces. We understand, of course, that if we are going to provide support for those individuals across the province who are looking for more opportunities, it’s so important to make sure we are there to provide them with that support. That is a key element that goes right to the heart of providing that support.", "Right off the top, I did reference transportation infrastructure. I don’t think any of my remarks in this chamber would be complete if I didn’t spend a little bit of time talking about that part of our agenda, which is, of course, a part of my mandate letter from the Premier to deliver on. Whether we’re talking about wonderful communities like Hamilton—which, as we all know, recently in media has been showcased as a community, as a city that’s going through a renaissance, which is fantastic news not only for Hamilton but for all of Ontario. I think, of course, of the Hamilton LRT project.", "I referenced the ION LRT project, GO train service to Niagara, GO train service that we are going to be providing all the way out to Durham, to Bowmanville, thanks to my colleague from Durham and because of his advocacy. I look at members, whether we’re talking members in the government caucus or members in both opposition parties—there isn’t a community in the province of Ontario that does not have an infrastructure need. There is not a community in the province of Ontario, anywhere, in all 444 municipalities, that does not have a transportation infrastructure need.", "Thanks to the investments, thanks to the leadership of Premier Kathleen Wynne and everyone else on this side of the House, as is contained in this throne speech that we all heard just a couple of days ago, we can not only celebrate all that we’ve achieved over the last two years, but we can look forward to the next two years and beyond those next two years to make sure—whether we’re talking about GO regional express rail, delivering two-way, all-day GO service, electrified, in up to 15-minute intervals in terms of that service on core segments of our network; whether we’re talking about four-laning Highways 11 and 17 in the north; whether we’re talking about roads, bridges and waste water infrastructure right across the province of Ontario.", "I see my friend and colleague the Minister of Infrastructure. He is someone who has been working extremely hard with his provincial, federal and territorial counterparts to make sure that we can go forward, that we can continue to make sure that those investments provide those positive benefits.", "I look at my very good friend and colleague the MPP from Barrie, who has talked to me regularly, has been a staunch champion and advocate for her community to make sure that we do deliver—and we will deliver—two-way, all-day, electrified GO service all the way up the Barrie corridor to Barrie, as we committed to over the next number of years. And the list goes on. The list goes on, whether we’re talking about communities like Windsor—I already referenced Niagara Falls. I’ve talked about Hamilton. We certainly have, in Peel region, an LRT that will be built along Hurontario. We have the single-largest public transit project in Ontario history currently under construction in midtown Toronto along Eglinton, the Eglinton Crosstown LRT—a commitment to build, first at the table—a commitment to build the Scarborough subway extension and so much more.", "To sum up, with the remaining few seconds that I have on the clock before my colleague from Scarborough Southwest will come to his feet and will provide us with his impressions of the throne speech, Speaker, I just want to say I get why my friends on the other side of the House want to focus on their agenda; I understand it. It’s part of the cut and thrust of the undertaking of this profession here in this chamber. But I would ask them to reflect for just a moment and understand that this plan is the best way imaginable to move the province of Ontario forward—a stronger economy, whether we’re talking about the community of North Bay or others.", "I know it’s troubling. I know when you’re in opposition you don’t like good news for your own province, because it’s counter to your own motives and objectives. But I’m asking you just for a moment to do what’s unusual for people in your position: Put your crass self-interest aside and support the people of Ontario and support the province of Ontario and support this throne speech." ],

I had the opportunity to work with him in the city of Toronto as a councillor for many years. I know that he’ll be a good contribution here to the Legislature. I look forward to working with him in the next few years. I wanted to get that on the record.", "I just want to speak about a few issues about the throne speech. Of course, people are focused on the main issue, which was the electricity rates, but there are some other things that were mentioned. One of the big ones was the creation of an additional 100,000 licensed spaces in the next five years for child care. I think it’s a very important contribution. Child care is a very important issue and 100,000 spaces is quite a large contribution.", "I just wanted to move to one story that is quite interesting. I was reading an article by an Italian journalist who writes for an Italian newspaper. She was commenting on the fact that the Italian government is trying to get the Italian birth rate up, because it’s going down quite a bit. So they’re having a day, which actually translates to “have more babies day,” in Italy, which is later in September. This journalist—a woman—mentioned the fact that she had two children. She said, “My husband and I would have more children, but we don’t have anyone to take care of the children. We both work.” The husband and the wife both work. She’s a journalist, her husband has another job, and they have two children. She said, “The main system of child care for children in Italy are the grandparents,” with the grandparents taking care of the children when they’re first born for the first few years. The same thing could be said in other jurisdictions around the world.", "But here in Ontario, we recognize the importance of proper child care. Grandparents do a lot of that work, I know, because my mother and father did it for eight different grandchildren. People have to work more and more hours these days, the workforce has changed, and we want to make sure that children are well taken care of. So the creation of 100,000 child care facilities is quite significant, I think, for the province of Ontario.", "I also wanted to mention—it was mentioned a bit in the throne speech briefly—the issue about the election finance reform. I sat on that committee as well, Mr. Speaker, for two days during the summertime. It’s long overdue that we make election reform. The government has listened to the opposition, listened to what they want to include in the new legislation. There was extensive travel by the committee to get opinions of various people across the province. We’re listening, and we’re going to have several amendments introduced.", "The bill was reintroduced yesterday after the prorogation. I think it’s important to be able to contribute to that committee and to bring some reforms. It’s long overdue. The federal government has done it. The city of Toronto, where we are right now, has made changes as well with regard to contributions. I’m glad to see that our government is moving on this issue as well.", "I also want to mention briefly the issue about young people in our province. We’re continuing to make sure that young people have the right tools for a changing workforce. We’re putting new emphasis on math skills, expanding experiential learning and encouraging more young people to turn their good ideas into start-ups.", "When I went to high school, I always wondered, “Why do I have to study calculus? Why do I have to study other mathematical courses?” Algebra, and there was another one—relations and functions. There were complex formulas we had to learn, and I thought, “What does this have to do with the workforce or life in general?” But it creates a way of thinking. Those mathematical courses create a way of thinking where you analyze things and you organize things in a certain way, which is helpful.", "People come to my office, young adults come to my office, and they’re looking for jobs. It’s an issue in my riding of Scarborough Southwest. There are a lot of young people who can’t find good work. A lot of them drop out of high school. They’ll drop out earlier. Even if they drop out at the age of 18, they won’t take the courses they need to take to get into the workforce and be able to contribute to society.", "We’ve always been focused, since we came into government, on education. We created the junior kindergarten and senior kindergarten child care. Every school in my riding and schools across the province were forced to put in some kind of child care component. I think it’s very important that we continue to focus on that issue.", "Speaking of the next issue, health care, we’ve been involved, since we got elected back in 2003, in improving the health care system. We know—and I won’t repeat; people have spoken about it earlier and it’s been spoken about many times in this House—how much this government has helped improve the health care system here in Ontario. We’re investing in front-line workers. We’re helping seniors with the cost of prescription drugs and reducing wait times for specialists. Anyone who has older adults—when my parents became older, they needed cataract surgery. The cataract surgery was done very, very rapidly and their vision improved. There was a very short wait time for that.", "We’re also expanding hours for nursing care and 1.3 million hours of personal support, enhancing home and community care. We gave the personal support workers a raise two years ago with a budget that went through just after our re-election back in 2014. I think it’s really important to give respect and to give proper remuneration to the personal support workers here in Ontario. They do a lot of work.", "Just to make it personal, on my own issue: My father needs help. He’s at home by himself, and a personal support worker comes to the house—not enough for my dad, according to him, but he is getting some help, at least. They come in, and they’re paid for by our government to make sure that people who are older are properly taken care of. They get their showers and they’re cleaned properly and well taken care of. My dad even gets the personal support worker to shave his face twice a week and cut his toenails—things that are important that seniors can’t do on their own anymore.", "This is not just for myself but for senior citizens across Ontario. It’s very important that we provide that help to senior citizens, the health care help, and to recognize them by giving them the proper amount of money and paying them properly and not just looking at them as people who are not that important. They are very important.", "It’s been mentioned several times that we’re investing in new hospitals, schools, roads, bridges and transit. I know that my friend the Minister of Transportation already spoke about the fact that the Eglinton Crosstown line is being built. Every time I drive across Eglinton, I can see construction going on. It’s quite extensive. It’s going to go right across Eglinton, ending up in the riding of Scarborough Southwest, which I represent, at Kennedy subway station. From there, someone can either take a bus or the Scarborough rapid transit system all the way up to Scarborough Town Centre and the Scarborough Civic Centre as well, which is very important.", "A lot of that’s been left behind in the transportation stuff. We’ve picked it up since we came into power. We’ve made a much better job of improving transportation.", "There’s a lot more I would like to say, but time’s run out. So perhaps, on another occasion, I’ll have a chance to speak some more, Mr. Speaker." ],

One of the hospitals in my region—big expansion to the Winchester hospital. Shortly after it was completed—we had a big opening and a lot of people down to speak—they closed 22% of the beds. I guess you wonder, if you’re building an expansion and then planning to shut the beds down a year later, why are you building it?", "They built a brand new ICU unit.

That’s just a waste.", "Two years ago, they were looking at losing their chemotherapy, except the political fallout would have been too great. This year—we heard about the 1% increase—they’re talking about losing $1 million in funding. So this is what we’re seeing from this government.", "They talk about the daycare shortage and how they’re going to fix the problem. They created the problem in the first place by all these licensing requirements that shut down a lot of the facilities.

Make no mistake about it, it’s the number one issue in the province of Ontario, and our party realized that a long time ago. We’ve been going around the province for up to six months, maybe even longer, talking about hydro and having meetings with community after community, whether it was in Windsor, whether it was in Sarnia, or whether it was in Kitchener. It didn’t matter where it was—Welland—we were having meetings right across the province. Some would say to me, “Why would you do that?” It was easy for us, why we did it: We wanted to listen to the residents of Ontario, because that made sense. We wanted to know what they really felt about what was going on with hydro.", "The difference between what we did and what the Liberals did was that they never once went to the province of Ontario and the voters to say, “Can we sell hydro?” It was never asked. I won in two elections and not once was it raised by the two candidates who ran against me from the Liberal Party—not once. So what they didn’t do is ask the residents what they said. Independent people have done studies and surveys. Think about this: 85% of the residents are saying, “Don’t sell Hydro.” Did they listen? Unfortunately, no.", "Municipalities right across the province of Ontario have all said no to the sell-off of Hydro One. You heard it loud and clear at AMO.

As a matter of fact, while we’re spending between $13 billion and $15 billion a year on infrastructure, the record low in the history of Ontario and in Canada of any province was in that 10-year period when you spent a total on highways, hydro, schools and hospitals of between $1 billion and $3 billion.

How far do you want to go back in history?", "The Premier’s reset button, I believe, has failed. It was a faulty, faulty button. One of the things that they need to do is they need to stop the sale of Hydro One. In addition to that, they need to stop paying these exorbitant contracts for what we’re paying for the industrial wind turbines, solar panels and so on.", "I kind of look at it and I say, “Why is that? Why must they stop all of this?” It’s very simple: The government’s policies are simply driving business and industry out of the province. That’s why we have an overabundance of energy right now, whereby they’re either selling it cheaply, or they’re actually paying jurisdictions to take our energy. I could say, I suppose, to the last business or industry to leave the province, “Please turn out the lights.” But then again, that might be an oxymoron, because with the global adjustment and/or delivery charges, they’re going to be overcharged, and they’ve already left the country. So who gets stuck with that? Let me guess. It will be the consumers of Ontario, people like you and I, Speaker, for sure.", "The other thing I want to point out is that the hydro rates are so high right now, it’s penalizing seniors and it’s penalizing people on ODSP and Ontario Works and so on. They can’t afford—“Do I heat or do I eat?

There’s no doubt about it, and I’m not downplaying it.", "But when I spoke, I mentioned some other things that were in the throne speech that were important. Creating 100,000 new spaces in Ontario is very, very significant. We had unregulated child care spaces in Ontario that were not run very well. But we’re making sure that these 100,000 new spaces are regulated. That’s very important, as I mentioned earlier in my speech, the whole issue about parents having to go to work and leaving their children in the hands of people that they can trust. That’s very important to do. The last thing you want to do is leave your child with someone where you’re not sure what’s going to happen. I’ve seen unregulated child care facilities in Toronto and Scarborough Southwest. It’s dangerous when they are unregulated.

One thing to mention about hydro that I think is very important is that we’ve shut down all coal-generated plants in Ontario. Especially in Toronto and the west end, it’s very important. We had summers where we had smog days, and it was so bad that seniors and children were asked to stay indoors. Those smog days are gone. The plants were shut down, and the smog days are gone because coal is no longer being burned.

Not 50, not 100; this is the 167th time that I’ve actually brought up electricity, energy crisis, energy poverty in this House. You know what? I’m sure the member from Nipissing has brought it up twice as many times as I have. I’m sure our energy critic from Renfrew–Nipissing–Pembroke has brought it up a million times in the House over the many years that he’s been here, because it was the PC Party that was opposed to the Green Energy Act from the moment that it was even decided upon, on the back of that napkin that George Smitherman handed to Dalton McGuinty one morning in 2007, which has led us to where we are today, and that is in a deep, deep, deep energy crisis in Ontario.", "It’s unbelievable, really, that we are where we’re at right now in Ontario. In 2003, we had the cheapest electricity in North America. The factories were humming in Hamilton; they were humming in Oshawa; they were humming in St. Thomas, in Windsor, and all across the province. People were working. They were going to work, and the biggest reason why was because energy was affordable. We were a low-cost jurisdiction. The government of the day was cutting red tape, making sure that people could actually earn a living, that people could actually live in their homes, and if they wanted to buy a new home, they could afford to do so. If they wanted to renovate their home, they could actually afford to do so.", "But instead, now, 13 years later, as a result of this government’s policies—these guys have been in there for 13 years. This is the government that took Ontario from having the cheapest electricity to the most expensive electricity in North America. God bless them. Mission accomplished. Just a terrible, terrible record when it comes to management of our electricity grid.", "You know, there have been a lot of moments where this government could have seen the light on the road to Damascus. It’s been a long, long trip from wherever they were going to get to Damascus. But they never, ever saw the light. They didn’t see the light when Auditor General report after Auditor General report came out and said, “This government has to stop its policies in the Green Energy Act where we are paying—not millions—billions of dollars more for electricity projects that we don’t need.”", "Interjection." ],

But it would have been nice if the government had realized that we had an energy crisis in Ontario after the first Auditor General’s report that said that, or after the Ombudsman’s report that said that, or after numerous stories in the media said that or after all kinds of different motions from the NDP and the PC Party calling on the government to change their ways. But they didn’t do it. They didn’t do it.", "In that first week that I was here in November 2011, there was a private member’s bill that was brought forward by the member from Algoma–Manitoulin. Mr. Mantha brought forward a private member’s motion. You here were, sir, in the Chair. You remember what that motion was. It said we should remove the HST from hydro bills, right? The NDP, of course, supported it because it was one of their members that brought it forward, and the PCs thought it was a great idea because we knew five years ago that we were in crisis when it came to energy prices.", "Guess who voted against that bill, Mr. Speaker? Take a guess. It was Kathleen Wynne and the Liberal government. Twenty of those ministers are currently in the cabinet that voted against that private member’s bill to take the HST off of hydro bills way back in November 2011. Suddenly, they have seen the light, however. But the light should have gone off in November of 2011. Unfortunately, it didn’t.", "It has taken story after story in the media this summer—Global News did a tremendous bit of journalism, and it’s nice to see that they were out there actually talking to the people of Ontario, like we on the opposition bench do every day. I was at the grocery store on Saturday morning. I must have had 50 people come up to me while I was trying to help my daughter sell Krispy Kreme doughnuts for her Belleville Bearcats midget hockey team: “When are we going to get rid of those guys because they don’t get it when it comes to electricity prices?”", "They had high hopes that maybe, when we arrived here on Monday morning like we did, that throne speech was going to give them the relief that they were looking for on their hydro bills. Nothing. It’s a joke, what they have proposed when it comes to electricity prices. It’s a joke. The price of electricity is going to go up 10% or 12% this year. Thank you very much for taking the 8% off the HST and not doing anything about the real cost of electricity. They’re just not doing it.", "But thanks to Global for doing that story over the summer. Thanks to the Toronto Star. They did a really nice story about a lady in my riding. She’s a 74-year-old lady, Peggy Mills, who lives in McArthurs Mills, where the elk roam, just east of Bancroft, in the beautiful hills of North Hastings. She was cut off from her hydro—a 74-year-old artist living on a $17,000 income. She took her oven out of her house and her refrigerator out of her house. She went to her neighbour’s house to have a bath, for goodness’ sake. The hydro was cut off.", "The Toronto Star did the story, and I know tomorrow morning, when we resume this debate on the throne speech, I will have an opportunity to tell Peggy’s story a little bit more—and some of the people I’ve talked to in Bancroft.", "But 60,000 people have been disconnected from hydro services in Ontario. This is Ontario. It’s completely unacceptable. The wake-up call apparently needs to be louder than what was the result of your throne speech on Monday." ],

These bonds are currently used on both public and private projects, but there is no legislation that mandates contractors to post them. By posting mandatory surety bonds, subcontractors and suppliers will be protected and paid in case of a project’s insolvency.", "In addition, specific bookkeeping requirements will be set out to better protect subcontractors if the contractor becomes insolvent or can’t pay its debts.", "Also, the act is to be kept simple and cost-effective. So our bill is proposing that construction lien claims under $25,000 could be referred to Small Claims Court, so that the subcontractor—the electrician, carpenter or whoever—gets paid as soon as possible.", "Again, I look forward to this going to committee.

She made a comment that consultation does take time. She mentioned how this legislation has been around in its current form for 30 years. It shouldn’t take 30 years to make sure that workers who do the work and do it within the terms of a contract actually get paid for the work that they’ve done. I’m great with consultation. I think that it’s important that we talk to the stakeholders. We see far too often that the government side, who says consultation takes time, rushes bills through, rams through legislation, without doing enough consultation. So I think they should take their own advice and sometimes slow down.", "But it’s important to note that, although consultation takes time, in 2013 their current Minister of Transportation brought forward legislation around this—four years ago. It was actually his own caucus, it was the Liberal government, that quashed his proposed legislation. So they had an opportunity in 2013 to support one of their own members, and they didn’t.", "Then, in 2014, my colleague from Windsor–Tecumseh brought forward a motion that was supported—it passed—talking about this very thing again. So, three years ago the member from Windsor–Tecumseh brought this up. It was supported in the House and it went nowhere after that. In fact, he went a step farther and said that when you have a project like the Herb Gray Parkway that was grossly mismanaged by the government at the time—they allowed a Spanish consortium to take off, back out of the country and not pay our subcontractors and our suppliers. They should never have gotten another contract until they actually paid the workers and the suppliers." ],

My dad started a construction company in March 1953, so my whole life, I grew up in a construction family. My dad started with, I think, one backhoe, then maybe one employee. Over the years he built his company into what was one of Canada’s largest construction companies. I am happily familiar with the industry. I actually spent a few years myself working for that family company.", "I came to really admire the people who work in that industry: people who take such pride in their work, people who work very hard both physically and mentally, people who work together, because the way the construction industry works is, every construction company actually works with a lot of other companies who do part of that job. It’s really important that we have rules in place that protect those various companies that contribute to the construction of a building or a road or a bridge or whatever, and that’s why I’m really happy to speak to this bill today.", "The construction industry is huge in Ontario. It is a very large and important industry, with 400,000 jobs in construction today, Speaker; that’s 400,000 families being supported by the construction industry. Of course, much of that construction is government construction, government investments in infrastructure creating many, many jobs. Some 7% of our GDP is in the construction industry. So we need to make sure that our construction laws are up-to-date, and that they reflect today’s realities. It’s only fair, Speaker, and it’s important that we get this right, because it is such a vital industry.", "I’m going to speak a little bit about that consultation process. It has taken time to get this right, but we are at a point where I would say that there is a broad consensus that we are doing the right thing, that this is the right step to take. I would say that in this House we have a very happy situation of violent agreement—violent agreement, Speaker—that this is the right step to take, and also in the industry there is support.", "Last fall, the government met with 25 key stakeholder groups and an expert advisory group in the construction industry to hear their feedback. We continued to work with that advisory group throughout the drafting of the legislation. In addition, the government requested feedback on Bill 142 in the summer and received a number of submissions with recommendations on how to improve the legislation, because we always want to make it as good as it can possibly be.", "The review convened more than 30 meetings, attended by over 60 key interested stakeholders. There were many lively and spirited discussions, as one would hope with a bill of such importance. We also received over 70 written submissions, and the Attorney General met individually with over 30 different stakeholder groups. So we have done our homework to make sure that this bill is as strong as it can possibly be. It has taken us 34 years to get to this point, and until now—and this is an important point, Speaker—no one has been able to achieve consensus on these proposed changes, and now we have achieved consensus.", "We do have a broad consensus on three core issues of the review: that we are maintaining and modernizing the lien and holdback process; that we are establishing a new system for prompt payment; and that we are creating a targeted adjudication system to resolve disputes. There is, as I say, a broad consensus that these are the right steps to take.", "Let me just read a few quotes from people who are supporting this. OSWCA, the Ontario Sewer and Watermain Construction Association, says that “Striking the Balance (the report) makes a number of recommendations that will (on paper) significantly improve the construction payment and construction lien processes in Ontario, if they are fully implemented.”", "“The Surety Association of Canada enthusiastically supports the transition to digital bonding and has been instrumental in facilitating this transition. From a technical standpoint, there’s good news. The technology to create, record, execute and deliver electronic bonds is readily accessible and there are a number of commercially available electronic surety systems.”", "Again from the Surety Association of Canada: “We sincerely appreciate your resolve in taking on this complex but critical initiative that is long overdue and will have a profoundly positive impact on the construction industry and the economy of our province. Again, I pledge the full support of the Surety Association of Canada.”", "“The Ontario Society of Professional Engineers ... appreciates the opportunity to submit commentary to support the review and enhancement of Ontario’s Construction Lien Act....", "“Minister, OSPE wishes to acknowledge your effort to ensure the proposed legislation is fair, balanced, and reflects a diverse array of perspectives by thoroughly consulting with industry and stakeholder groups.”", "Then they go on, and I’m very happy that they acknowledge the work of the “staff, the ministry, and Bruce Reynolds and Sharon Vogel for their thoughtful work on this significant piece of legislation. In the months and years ahead, Ontario’s CLA will prove critical to our ability to capitalize on historic foreign, federal, and domestic investment in the brick and mortar projects that enable our provincial economy to flourish.”", "The Ontario Road Builders’ Association says it is “pleased to see the final report of the review of the Construction Lien Act and commends BLG and the ministry on this comprehensive work.”", "The TTC—Speaker, I could go on and on with positive quotes supporting the assertion that there is broad support for this. And it’s not just industry that supports this; there is support from labour as well.", "I would like to read this into the record, just to remind people that even within this chamber this is a bill on which we have broad agreement.", "The member from Lanark–Frontenac–Lennox and Addington said the following: “I think we were at a place where we had a bill that industry was satisfied with, that the members of this Legislature are satisfied with. Although there are some improvements that could be made, it’s a good bill.” It’s not always that I find myself in agreement with the member from Lanark–Frontenac–Lennox and Addington, but this is one of those times where I completely agree with him.", "We had further support from the NDP critic, the member for Timmins–James Bay. He said, “I just want to indicate that it’s something that we, as New Democrats, support. We have been pushing for it and we look forward for this process to continue ... and we can do it justice when it comes to prescribing a bill that is prescriptive, that is clear, that allows a mechanism to work that’s not going to be too onerous and that we have some sort of enforcement mechanism ... that works for people.” Again, I am in complete agreement with the member for Timmins–James Bay.", "But there are other quotes that I would like to remind members of the House of.

Given the impacts we heard repeatedly indicated at the committee table, I really feel that it’s important to put some of those issues and impacts here today.", "Speaker, I’ll start where much of the discussion has focused over the course of this debate:", "—the, of course, serious impact of a 30% wage hike over a year and a half;", "—this government’s refusal to provide an independent economic analysis to verify those impacts; and", "—this government’s use of the minimum wage escalation as a cornerstone to drive negative reaction towards opposition.", "Time and again at committee we heard the earnest pleas of small business owners indicating their concern for the rapid pace at which this government is proposing to force this 30% minimum wage hike onto their shoulders. It’s a weight that many admitted, regrettably, they will have difficulty in bearing.", "I think of Little Short Stop Stores presenting in the committee hearings out in Kitchener–Waterloo. Little Short Stops may not be familiar to those outside of our area, but to those in Kitchener–Waterloo, Guelph and Cambridge, the Little Short Stops are mainstays of our communities—or what my kids like to call the “treat store”—a third-generation, family-owned chain of convenience stores providing everything you’d expect from your favourite corner store for almost 50 years, with 20 stores and over 230 employees.", "As co-owner Jamie Arnold told us, Little Short Stops are not opposed to a minimum wage reaching $15. They did question, “[H]owever, what would you do if you found out that your mortgage was going to increase 32% over the next 18 months? Your income hasn’t changed, most other expenses are increasing roughly with inflation, yet your single biggest expense is going to....” He then added, “Well, my mortgage is about to increase $1.5 million in the form of payroll costs.”", "As to what Little Short Stops plan to do to mitigate that hike, Mr. Arnold was clear:", "“Step one: We will cut hours in our stores. Cutting hours is not creating jobs; cutting hours is cutting people. The first hours that will be cut will be our 24-hour shifts. Secondly, we’ll be forced to automate.” We already see that happening now; just go to a local McDonald’s or even to a movie theater.", "They’ll have to look at health benefits: “We have a benefit plan that covers dental, drugs and health benefits that insures about 150 people as we speak. We simply cannot afford this ... plan.”", "So that’s really what we’re talking about here: a 50-year-old, family-owned business forced to make choices that will hurt the very people this government has indicated they want to help with Bill 148.", "The result, of course, is fewer jobs, fewer hours and fewer stores. Mr. Arnold’s request at the committee was simple: “[I]f we are going to a $15 minimum wage, give us more time to get there. Eighteen months is dramatic and crushing.

  "text" : [ "Thank you. I do hope that the other side is paying much attention to this because I don’t think that they seemed to actually be paying attention during committee. We heard committee for two weeks right across the province. They said they’d be listening, but I’m just not sure if they actually did.", "Where was I here? He talked about 18 months being dramatic and crushing. The same solution the Premier herself believed in just a few short months ago—in fact, it was just January that the Premier stated it very clearly. That’s likely, because as we’ve often heard from the Financial Accountability Office and the Toronto-Dominion Bank, the impact of this 18-month race to $15 will be 50,000 minimum wage jobs. Of course, as I noted, we heard these same concerns at every stop of the committee.", "I do remember the Premier saying—when she was asked back as early as January or February of last year, if she was going to agree to the $15 minimum wage call, she said, “We’ve got a predictable plan or a predictable format already in place. We need to give those employers predictability.” She said no at that time. But, of course, do you know what’s happening next June? An election, of course: We know that that’s what really this is all about.", "Back in Kitchener, of course, it was later echoed in Hamilton when the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters told us “a sudden escalation without corresponding growth in corporate revenues and profit could have significant unintended consequences, including loss of employment, loss of paid hours and a decrease in hiring under-represented groups in the workforce such as women and youth who typically start careers at those positions.”", "That’s why we continue to call for that independent economic analysis, a very simple yet vital request given the concerns we heard and one that there should be no reason to ignore. Really, what is the fear from the government side? If the government is right, and the analysis shows that this rapid rise will help people and won’t impact job numbers, then we move ahead with blinders off. On the other hand, if the government is wrong and Toronto-Dominion, the Financial Accountability Officer and others are right about the unbearable impacts and job implications, then you go back to the drawing board, of course. I mean, even out in BC, the NDP have seen their way through to a more stable pace of increase.", "The question remains as to, what is the government really afraid of? Could it be because they know once they open the cover of this book, the story will speak to the further implications we heard at committee of the series of other measures Bill 148 proposes to create “fair workplaces”? As the Cambridge Chamber of Commerce told us in Kitchener, “While the media concentrates on the $15 an hour, and advocates of this bill concentrate on this, this is only the tip of the iceberg that will cause irreversible damage to Ontario’s economy.", "“The more dramatic impact is the other 173 changes to the workplace environment outside of the minimum wage increase.”", "Of course, we heard from businesses concerned with the emergency leave proposals. “Let’s look at the impact of a few items on ... businesses,” as the Cambridge chamber stated, “such as the personal emergency leave making it mandatory for 10 eligible days off, two of which must be paid, and the employer is no longer able to request medical verification. The costs to large employers would vary from $1.25 million per year with 1,000 employees to $11 million” a year for employees roughly around 9,000. This is an enormous change to employers.", "As a local coffee shop owner wrote me, “As it currently stands, we cannot allow employees to collect this benefit after only eight days of employment ... that will bankrupt small business ... We had 356 sick days recorded by our employees in 2016.” That’s just one coffee shop. While Bill 148 would see the employer paying out for about 70 of those days, the curious thing is that this provision is completely absent from the government’s Changing Workplaces Review recommendations the Liberals have used as the basis, in fact, for Bill 148.", "I do also want to mention, on that note, there were other deputations, of course. One that I think was glaring was that of one of our largest employers, Magna. I want to read a bit of Magna’s written submission. Of course, it didn’t get an opportunity to present at committee.", "They go on by saying they “are one of Ontario’s largest and most successful private sectors employers, operating both unionized and non-union facilities. Magna’s annual payroll in Ontario is in the range of $1 billion, and we invest approximately $320 million ... annually into the Ontario economy in terms of capital investment and research.", "“We also consider ourselves a very responsible employer. All of our employment and compensation practices meet and in most cases, are well in excess of Ontario’s regulatory requirements. We are proud to provide our employees with a competitive livelihood—and by sharing in the profits of our organization, each Magna team member is an important and valued stakeholder in our company.", "“Having said all this, for the first time in our 60-year history we find ourselves in the very untenable position of questioning whether we will be able to continue to operate at historical levels in this province. Ontario has increasingly become a very challenging global jurisdiction in which to conduct business, and the recent policy direction of the Ontario government adds further to the already heavy regulatory burdens that exist here. These challenges include:", "“—uncompetitive hydro costs;", "“—increased payroll and pension costs;", "“—cap-and-trade policies; and", "“—some of the highest personal income tax rates in the G7.”", "They go on by saying, “We believe the tipping point for Magna may well be the Fair Workplaces, Better Jobs Act, 2017, the proposed labour and employment law reforms that are extremely one-sided in terms of their scope and impact on the Ontario business community.”", "That’s a statement by Magna, and I think it’s gone unheard, clearly, by this government. Knowing that the compounding regulatory burden, high hydro—all these things are forcing jobs not into the province, but out.", "I look forward to finishing my two-minute rebuttal. Thank you for your time." ],

Rightfully, the member from Kitchener–Conestoga referenced that we are in a globally competitive economy, but who, in fact, are we competing against?", "At this point in time, auto manufacturers can set up in Ciudad Juárez and pay their workers $2.50 an hour. Ciudad Juárez has an enormous amount of multinational corporations that have set up there for that reason, to be able to pay some of the lowest wages on the planet.", "There is also a correlating demographic, or data set, that shows the rate of crime, specifically murder. Ciudad Juárez is one of the highest murder capitals on the planet. When you lower your standard of living, when you lower a person’s ability to earn a good wage and to live a decent life and when you lower the standard for your social services, it has a domino effect on a society. You’ve got drug cartels running that area and running rampant.", "Is that what we want to compete with? Or do we focus, as an economy, on the good things that we’ve built together—our health care, our infrastructure, our education system—and focus on those as strategic incentives to entice business to come here? I think we can do that and I think that’s a better and more progressive path." ],

Here is the discussion that happened over about two or three months, when I first met with them. They understand where government is going, they understand the social fabric of this province and of this country, and they’ve asked me to relay that we committed to some offsets to help the transition. He said, “That’s all I would ask for.”", "Even more importantly, one of the grocery chains in my riding—I met with the owner about a month or a month and a half ago. It was his approach to me. He said, “Lou, I’m sure you folks are dealing with the fair minimum wage, that piece of legislation.” I said, “Of course.” I’m going to try to paraphrase what he told me. He has a couple hundred employees; it’s a big chain.", "Speaker, what I would say to you is that he said, “What don’t people understand about disposable income? Disposable income is what the minimum wage is basically all about. People are going to spend that money as they get it. It’s going to be good for the economy. I might sell an extra loaf of bread”—or whatever that might be—“because now people can afford it.”", "Frankly, he surprised me. But, frankly, I asked him, “Did you do the math?” His math was that if he raised food prices by one cent, he’d be able to accommodate the minimum wage requirement and he’d be able to give a raise to the folks who are already at that—plus it will leave some money for him.", "So, there are some challenges.

We want to make sure that in this case, in this bill, we have a really fulsome debate, because it did take this government a long time to get to this place.", "We had the labour minister set up the Employment Standards Act, where they had many, many consultations and then they came up, obviously, with their legislation. Then they toured the province in the summertime. Granted, I know we’re not sitting in the House during the summer, but we were working in our ridings. I think a lot of people felt that they were on vacation, so the type of consultation—they really had to work around their schedules to make sure they could contribute to this bill during the summer. A lot of people had to do a lot of finagling around their summer vacations and their schedules to do that.", "But in the end, it got done. The government did do a consultation in London specifically. There were many people who came and presented. Of course, there were labour groups and there were advocates—poverty advocates, housing activists—coming out to let people know that we need to change the minimum wage. People cannot live on the wages they have presently. This government did listen; in that particular part of it, they did listen and they changed the minimum wage to $15.", "Of course, there’s debate between the Conservatives on whether or not this is the right thing to do, what we should do and how fast we should do it. One of the members recently spoke up and talked about how we are going to be losing jobs if the minimum wage is increased. But he seems to forget that under his leader Mr. Hudak, in 2014, they wanted to cut 100,000 jobs from the province, good-paying jobs that had benefits and retirement packages. They wanted to cut those jobs out of the province. When we hear that the Conservative are concerned that we’re going to lose jobs, it’s ironic, because they wanted to cut 100,000 jobs during the last election.", "When this bill was first presented, I got a phone call. I got a phone call from Fanshawe College, from the broadcasting department there. A student reporter called me. At that point, we hadn’t looked at the bill. We hadn’t examined it, we hadn’t reviewed the whole entirety of it, so I couldn’t really express to her what would happen around student wages. That was something they were very concerned about. So I said, “We’ll have to look at the bill when it comes out.” Sure enough, I said, “I wouldn’t be surprised if that won’t be in the bill, but I can’t confirm it at this time.”", "Now I can call her back. She hasn’t called me to follow up, but I can certainly call her back and let her know that there is still a two-tier wage in place in this bill, paying servers in bars and restaurants substantially less than everyone else. Of course we know many part-time jobs, when students are attending college and university, are usually in the service industry. So it is tough. We know that students are struggling to make ends meet: rents are expensive; hydro is expensive, as the member from Algoma–Manitoulin pointed out; and since this Wynne government has been in power, there’s been an increase in precarious work. There has been an increase in people working multiple jobs just to pay their bills.", "I was speaking to someone just yesterday afternoon. The young woman here said that she’s going to be leaving Queen’s Park because she has another job in a restaurant in Toronto—and the member from Algoma–Manitoulin was with me at the time. She was expressing that she had to work two jobs to pay the bills. She works at the Spaghetti Factory, very hard, and then she comes here and she works in the dining room in the restaurant area, in the service part, at Queen’s Park. She said, “You know, I have to work these two jobs to get by.”", "Having a minimum wage in that industry—these are the people who we are trying to help lift up out of poverty—to try to make their lives financially secure so that they can feel that they can continue to have a roof over their head and feed their children. So having the two-tier system is a disappointment when it comes to looking at the labour bill, and there are other things that are missing under this bill as well.", "When we’re talking about jobs, you can’t help but think about the CAMI auto workers in Ingersoll who are on strike right now, because they are striking not just for themselves; they are striking for job security. One of the biggest premises that they are talking about is that they want to be the lead plant so that they always have one shift more than Mexico, because that will guarantee that the work stays here. These are good-paying jobs. They are jobs with benefits. I know single moms who work at CAMI, and they can afford to put their kids through school, have a mortgage and buy a car. But if we keep deteriorating the auto industry in this province, there won’t be good jobs like this anymore.", "I went to the picket line, and I saw the workers who were there. They are out there every day, 24 hours a day, in shifts, fighting for job security. They are not just protecting their jobs, as I mentioned before, but they are also protecting and fighting for what the result will be: the feeder jobs that come in to CAMI, the seats and any other car parts, that rely on making these products for CAMI. It’s a trickle effect: They are going to have job security and so are those feeder plants. So it’s thousands—literally, thousands—of jobs throughout Ontario.", "It’s really important, when we talk about this legislation—what’s missing from that? We have CAMI that is on strike, fighting for job security. Some of the pieces that aren’t in this legislation speak to not giving workers the opportunity to have a union in the workplace.", "What’s missing is that there’s no card certification for all sectors of workers in this legislation. I mentioned before that students, interns and liquor servers aren’t brought into parity with the minimum wage. There are no real paid sick days for personal emergency leaves. There’s no sectoral bargaining for every sector. There’s no explicit protection for employees from reprisals during the bargaining-unit-organizing campaign period. There’s no meaningful definition of “employer” or a mechanism to enforce that employees aren’t misclassified as “independent contractors.”", "So here we have the CAMI auto workers fighting for job security, making sure that, when our kids grow up, there will be places for them to get good-paying jobs and also have diversity in our job economy. Because we don’t want just tech jobs. We don’t want just manufacturing jobs. We don’t want just farming and agriculture jobs. We want diversity. We want to make sure that we keep all those things in Ontario, because we know that, when an industry is struggling, there’s a domino effect throughout. So having diversity and making sure that we keep our auto sector strong, cultivating our tech industry and building that up—we even want to make sure that, in the north, we have job security for the Ring of Fire. We have been fighting for that. What a game changer that would be, if there was the Ring of Fire in the north, to have that diversity in natural resources.", "So, Speaker, it’s not just the CAMI auto workers that we are saying need job security and need job protection. We think that everyone throughout Ontario should be experiencing and having the benefit of going to work every day, being able to make a living working 40 hours, and coming home and being able to support their family. When you can’t do that, there’s a serious problem, because then you have the haves and the have-nots, and that’s no way to have a healthy society.", "The member from Windsor-Essex talked about the society we want to build and the society we want to build for the future for our children. We acknowledge there are many people who are disadvantaged because they can’t find work, for many reasons. Those things have to change. We have to make sure we open the door so that we have good-paying jobs for everyone who is looking, and then we have to make sure we build those opportunities for everyone to have the same level playing field when they access a job, and make sure that it’s a safe work environment for everyone as well.", "I look forward to further debate on this bill. I hope the government is going to allow a robust debate and exchange of ideas and not just the Conservatives focusing on one part of this bill. There is so much more to this bill to make sure that when you go to work, you get equal pay for the job that you’re doing to the person beside you. Equal pay for equal work." ],

When does it kick in?”", "Here is the interesting thing. I have also received my share of calls from business, and it has never been about the minimum wage, because most of the businesses in my riding say that they are already paying the minimum wage. But there had been some misinformation around scheduling, some misunderstanding. When I was able to sit down across the table and explain to them what the intention of the bill was, whether it was sick leave, paid sick leave, whether it was around how you don’t need the doctor’s certificate anymore if you’re off sick, whether it was around scheduling—once I sat and explained to them, they went away saying it’s a fairly reasonable business proposal that we have put forward.", "I think the thing that gives me the most confidence is that this morning and yesterday afternoon, I heard the PCs saying that this is all terrible, and then I heard the NDP saying we are not going far enough.

I have a lot of small businesses; 95% of them are the job creators in our area. The chamber in Haliburton did its own study, and they figure over 200 job losses just in the Haliburton county area. Now, they are very concerned, the businesses there. They are very seasonal. The fish and chips spot, Baked and Battered, wrote letters to the editor. They said they work at a loss all winter, but they keep their employees full time because they want them to have full-time jobs. They say, “I’m not going to be able to stay open this winter.” In fact, I think they are officially announcing that.", "Their employees are devastated. When I spoke to them, they realized that—up in Haliburton county especially, it’s very seasonal—their employers run at a loss in the wintertime to keep them employed, and they appreciate that.

That’s the CEO of that company, Frank Dottori. The mill is privately owned. It’s operated by Pic Mobert First Nation and the White River Economic Development Corp. A big shout-out to them for having done that.", "Here’s the other problem in White River: In that community, you have restaurants, you have hotels, you have grocery stores, and because of the success of this company and the recent success of the new mine that is opening in that community, most of the businesses that are there are already paying or looking to attract employees at $15 an hour. They won’t be able to attract anybody else to come into the community. One of their biggest challenges that they have is, “Where are we going to put these people?” They have housing shortages.", "The point I’m trying to make is, when you are bringing in the $15—which has been a consistent message from the NDP for a very long time—you have to bring in all the other programs which will help small business, which will help the grocery store, which will help that hotel find the workers that they need, which will, hopefully, build their economy, which, luckily, they are.", "But if we keep throwing sticks in their wheels with higher hydro bills, further taxation on them and always looking at creating hardship for them in growing their economies, we’re going to be back here debating other bills at another time.

With these now eliminated, Ontario companies will experience greater market access in the EU, leading to more domestic jobs and higher wages.", "Speaker, our province’s information and communication technology sector has undoubtedly solidified itself among leading global jurisdictions, with Toronto, Kitchener-Waterloo and Ottawa being recognized as the go-to hubs primed for research and export opportunities. In 2016, Ontario exports to the European Union in the ICT sector amounted to $587.2 billion.", "Based on the work of my ministry’s in-market services, we know that there is a demand for cutting-edge ICT products and services in the EU.

It is this opportunity that makes us a globally competitive force worldwide, and it will be the key in advancing our presence well into the future.", "During the negotiations, Ontario actively engaged with the federal government on behalf of its businesses and workers to ensure their interests were reflected within this historic trade agreement. My ministry will continue to represent the interests of Ontario businesses, workers and communities as the international trade landscape evolves.", "Diversifying and expanding trade is a key component of my ministry’s international trade strategy and part of Ontario’s plan to create jobs, grow our economy and help people in their everyday lives. The unlocking of 28 new markets for Ontario SMEs means greater potential for diverse revenue growth that often leads to expansion within the province.", "Today, CETA now joins NAFTA and free trade agreements with South Korea and Chile, among a host of others, as our trading corridors globally. Canada is also in free trade discussions with growing economies like India, China and Japan. With these agreements in place, Canada has preferential market access to over 1.2 billion consumers. Given the diversity of our province’s sectors, engaging in trade agreements with multiple jurisdictions makes sense for Ontario.", "CETA is the most aggressive agreement that Canada and the EU have ever negotiated.

It is my great privilege to have the opportunity to rise in this Legislature today to recognize October as Hispanic Heritage Month in Ontario.", "I apologize, Mr. Speaker. I’ll translate.", "I would be pleased to speak for my time today in Spanish, but I know that in this great chamber, we can only speak French or English. Today, however, that is a shame.", "This is a month to highlight the impact and influence of Hispanic Canadians and to celebrate and share Hispanic culture and heritage. I went to high school in California, where I had the opportunity to study Spanish. In addition to the language, we also studied culture and heritage. I was lucky to gain a broader appreciation of a community outside of my own.", "Canada is a place of marvellous diversity and shared stories, and Ontario is only made stronger because of this. We celebrate that fact this month, and we must work together to ensure that the dream of Ontario is achievable to all those who seek it.", "Though it is important that we recognize the many diverse communities in Ontario, let’s not forget our mandate to address the issues that affect all communities in every corner of this province. Let’s recognize the contributions that Hispanic Canadians have made and will continue to make to our province by taking action on the issues that affect members of their community.", "Of the many reasons that I am proud to call Ontario home, our diversity of language, culture and heritage are perhaps the greatest. Diversity is a core Canadian value. It is a core value of New Democrats, and a core value of the community I live in as well. Every June, in my riding of Oshawa, we celebrate Fiesta Week, a week-long multicultural festival that gives Durham residents the opportunity to experience various cultures from across the globe and celebrates the richness of our diversity.", "This month is for the wide Hispanic community and for all of their friends and neighbours. We want to explore, know and celebrate Hispanic culture and heritage together. On behalf of Ontario’s New Democrats, we wish everyone a wonderful Hispanic Heritage Month. Gracias." ],

New Democrats, both at the provincial and federal levels, continue to have some very serious concerns about CETA and its impact on Ontario businesses, provincial and municipal procurement, and Ontario workers and Ontario farmers—the investor-state provisions specifically.", "In February 2016, during CETA’s legal scrubbing phase, the minister announced changes to the ISDS, the investor-to-state dispute settlement provisions that are supposed to improve transparency and strengthen measures to combat conflicts of interest of arbitrators. However, the new investment court system still allows foreign investors to seek compensation from any level of government over policy decisions that they feel impact their profit. This is no more evident than in our current NAFTA arrangements, where investor-state provisions allow foreign entities and foreign conglomerates to sue national and subnational jurisdictions for impediments to their profits, as we see a $250-million legal suit against the province of Quebec for their ban on fracking.", "These are the cautionary tales that you’ll only hear from New Democrats when we talk about CETA or any trade negotiations. We’ve heard today, and I listened quite closely to both the Liberal and other provincial parties—it’s nothing but roses and rainbows when it comes to free trade agreements. People in our ridings and in our communities across this country understand the implications of free trade and the impacts that they have on their communities. We see devastation in our agriculture sector, we see offshoring of good manufacturing jobs and we see no balance and fairness truly ingrained in these trading agreements.", "For once and for all we would love to see our country and our province play an active role in ensuring fair trade agreements where we protect those natural resources, where we protect those good-paying jobs and raise the bar for our partners in trade, where we don’t set the standard at its lowest common denominator and where we can all prosper and profit from trading agreements.", "It’s high time that this government do its due diligence when it comes to the impacts. We will see a bill come forward because those are the rules under CETA implementation—all the provinces have to agree and enact enabling legislation—but I urge this government and I urge the Liberal Party to do its homework on the impacts that this will have on our communities. We can’t afford to lose good-paying jobs and we can’t afford to compete against jurisdictions that don’t want to set their standards as high as we have and deserve here in the province of Ontario." ],

  "text" : [ "I know. I’m just teasing.", "It would amend the Excellent Care for All Act to strengthen patient-centred care by protecting the integrity of Patient Ombudsman investigations and by enabling Health Quality Ontario’s collection, use and disclosure of personal health information.", "That’s a great deal of ground to cover. I don’t propose to do that all here today, because I want you all to stick around, but I do want to start with one particular aspect of this bill, and that’s transparency; specifically, transparency around payments, or what are called “transfers of value,” from the medical industry to health professionals or health care organizations.", "I want to give some context by way of explanation, because this is an important step that we want to take, and I hope it receives the support that it deserves. We know, and have known for some time, that there are relationships and certain types of interactions between the medical industry and elements of the broader health care sector—and by “medical industry,” I mean manufacturers of pharmaceuticals, medical devices, biologicals and supplies. Within the broader health care sector, we’re talking about individual practitioners, organizations, associations, patient advocacy groups, pharmacies, researchers and so forth. And in terms of interactions, I’m referring to things like funding for research, fees for speeches, paying memberships on advisory committees, or travel expenses to international functions. These are transfers of value, and the concern obviously is, at what point does the accepting of these payments and transfers constitute a conflict of interest?", "An interesting thing is, I’m going to be speaking on a panel at a health care conference in Ottawa that Bruyère Complex Continuing Care is putting on, and in advance of being on that panel, I had a questionnaire that was about a page long that went through a series of conflicts very similar to the things we’re talking about in this bill, because the organizers of the conference wanted to make sure that those who were attending the conference knew if there were any potential conflicts about the advice or the ideas that people were giving. I think that’s something we would all expect. That’s something that I understand now, inside a lot of medical conferences in communities, is becoming standard, so I wanted to mention that.", "You’d be aware, along the lines of this, as well, of the Open Pharma campaign that occurred nationally a few months ago. It was a campaign led by a number of prominent Ontario physicians, researchers and academics. They wanted the federal government to mandate public disclosure of all payments and transfers of value from drug companies to doctors. Further, they wanted Canadian patients to have the ability to check an online database to see if their doctors had received funding from the drug industry.", "I think this is critical, that we know what relationships exist inside these professions and these organizations so that we can make informed choices about the care we receive. Actually, Mr. Speaker, this is something that patients in several other countries, including the United States and France, are already able to do. In the United States, the Physician Payments Sunshine Act of 2010 requires manufacturers of drugs, medical devices and biological medical supplies covered by Medicare, Medicaid, and the State Children’s Health Insurance Program to collect and track all the financial relationships with physicians and teaching hospitals at or above $10, and to report these data to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.", "In France, the Bertrand act of 2012 mandates that the producers or marketers of pharmaceutical drugs and medical devices and virtually all regulated health and cosmetic products, regardless of whether the products are reimbursed under the French social security regime, must disclose payments of €10 or more to health care providers for fee-for-services sponsorship and research arrangements. All of this was in order to promote transparency and allay concerns about conflicts of interest in the study, marketing and prescription of drugs.", "Open Pharma was a laudable campaign, made even more impressive on June 20 of this year, when 10 brand-name pharmaceutical companies released partial details about $50 million in payments and value transfers that had been made to Canadian health care professionals and organizations in 2016. That’s a partial disclosure, and that’s $50 million. The size and the value of what we are talking about are of course much larger than that.", "We saw in Open Pharma a campaign, an opportunity and an inspiration to pursue a transparency initiative of our own that goes beyond even the Open Pharma idea. Shortly thereafter we opened consultations with key stakeholders this summer within both the medical industry and health care sector to discuss ways of establishing greater transparency across the health system.", "You might ask, “Why is this such a big deal?” The answer really is, Mr. Speaker, our relationship with the medical industry is extremely important. The industry supports critical research. It supports professional education programs and it funds services and equipment in hospitals and other institutions. The industry frequently partners with consumer groups to support initiatives around health advocacy and disease awareness. These are all valuable and much-appreciated contributions to our health care system. It is clear that our relationship with the medical industry is extremely important.", "The Strengthening Quality and Accountability for Patients Act will, if passed, bring about the following changes.", "The medical industry will be mandated to disclose all transfers of values they provide to named participants. Those recipients will be prescribed in regulation later on, and could include all regulated health care professionals, health care organizations, their executives and others.", "In speaking of others, I was on the general government committee, where the issue of diluted drugs came up about four years ago. It was very interesting to look at the relationships that existed inside some of those group-purchasing organizations that one might see as a conflict with the mission that they had. It’s very important, I think, that we take a look at these regulations—take the time to get a broad enough scan of those individuals and organizations and institutions that need to be covered by this piece of legislation.", "Speaker, there would be a set dollar-value threshold above which this regulation would kick in and the transfer of value would have to be reported. At that point, the data would have to be made available on a public, Internet-based, searchable database that would show the names of medical industry firms that provided benefit, as well as the names of the health care professionals and health care organizations that were recipients.", "This bill also provides for a regular evaluation of the legislation and data to be undertaken by the ministry so we can be sure that events are unfolding as we intend.", "The bill also provides for appropriate enforcement measures to enable us to address non-compliance. These measures would also include inspection and audit powers—again, so we can be sure that things are unfolding as we believe they should be.", "This focus on transparency should not come as a surprise. The government, led by Premier Wynne, is fiercely committed to making Ontario the most open and transparent jurisdiction in Canada. Open government is not just the name of an initiative; open government is our goal, because open government is good government, and good government is what we owe Ontarians.", "I’d just interject on a personal note: My first private member’s bill was about transparency and accountability in members’ expenses, which was included in that broader accountability bill. I appreciate the support of those members of the Legislature who supported that bill.", "Through our Open Government Initiative we are creating opportunities for civic dialogue and engagement so people can weigh in on government decision-making about programs and policies that affect their lives. We’re doing a better job of sharing government data so that researchers, app developers, not-for-profit organizations and others can help to solve problems that Ontarians face every day.", "In addition, through our Open Government Initiative, we are providing Ontarians with the information they want and need to help them better understand how their government works. We believe that our system is the strongest when Ontario patients have access to all the information they need so they can make informed decisions about their health care. For that reason, we are committed to strengthening transparency across the health care sector.", "My colleagues have heard me speak many times about Patients First, Ontario’s action plan for health care. Central to this plan is a commitment to transparency and openness. We call it Open by Default, and it perfectly mirrors the approach that’s being taken through open government. Through the Patients First plan, we have taken a number steps to enhance transparency and accountability of the health care system, and we’re measuring and publicly reporting the current wait times for major health services.", "Speaker, you would remember that before 2004-05, we weren’t reporting on wait times. There was no coordinated effort to try to ensure that people were getting access to timely care by measuring it. This initiative, of course, has evolved over time and has led to a reduction in wait times but also some innovation in terms of how we manage those resources. For instance, in Ottawa, we have a single queue for orthopedic procedures like hips and knees that has drastically reduced wait times.", "We’ve also taken steps to improve patient safety by having hospitals report on nine patient safety indicators. Hospitals are now required to establish expense rules where expenses are reimbursed from public funds and to post information about expense claims on their public websites. Hospitals are now subject to the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act. We are ensuring higher quality and greater value for the health care system through the Excellent Care for All Act. Under this act, hospitals now publicly release their annual quality improvement plans, and their executive compensation is tied to the fulfillment of those plans. In addition to all that, we have asked Ontario’s public health units and health regulatory colleges to make transparency and increased public disclosure a priority.", "Transparency is a watchword in Ontario health care, just as it is across the Ontario government. Several countries in the world have already taken action to increase the transparency of the relationship between the medical industry and their health systems. Until now, Canada has not. No Canadian jurisdiction mandates the medical industry to report transfers of value to health care professionals or organizations, and we want Ontario to be the first.", "We want to strengthen transparency in Ontario’s health care system and increase public trust and confidence. We also want Ontarians to have no doubt whatsoever that the health care system has their best interests at heart. We want to provide access to all the information Ontarians need to make the best possible decision when it comes to their health. We want to improve the ability of health care leaders to engage in health system planning. We want to give health care leaders an important tool with which to protect the reputation and credibility of their organizations. We want to allow the ministry to better understand the financial relationship in the health care system through health system research and analysis.", "We want all of those things because they add up to better care for patients, and because our government is committed, and will always be committed, to putting patients first.", "This legislation, if passed, would mark an important continuation of the transformation of health care delivery in this province, which this government has laid out in detail in Patients First: Action Plan for Health Care. The bill before this Legislature includes 10 schedules of legislation that would, if passed, improve quality, accountability and transparency within the health care system, all toward one goal, and that is to deliver a better patient experience.", "It is my firm belief that we will achieve this goal by relentlessly challenging ourselves and our partners to look beyond our own specific areas of responsibility—in health care, many of those jobs are not just crucially important; they are potentially life-saving—and instead see everything we do from one point of view: the point of view of the patient.", "To our patients, health care should be a single, seamless experience, whether they are receiving care in a hospital, in the community or at home. That is the driving philosophy behind our Patients First action plan, and it is the driving philosophy behind the bill before this Legislature today.", "I want to focus the remainder of my time here today on aspects of the bill that relate to the strengthening of the inspection and enforcement framework for Ontario’s long-term-care homes as well as the issue around the rules of resident confinement.", "I do want to say, just before I begin this section, that I’m very fortunate in my community to have two excellent long-term-care homes: The Perley and Rideau Veterans’ Health Centre as well as St. Patrick’s. That’s about 750 beds all together. They provide excellent care, and I’m very proud to have them in my riding. I want to thank all of the staff and the volunteers and the board members for the work they do, and for caring for the people that we care for most.", "I’d also like to say as well that I have family in long-term care, and family who are approaching long-term care, and I think most of the members of this Legislature—because a lot of us are around a certain age—have that happening in our lives too. This section of the bill is very important. Long-term care is, I think, equally important to all of us here. I know that all members share the same concern.", "Also, I know very well from many conversations that I have had first-hand as well as feedback we’ve received from government—I speak to many people in my community. There is great sensitivity and concern to those living in our long-term-care homes as well as those who care for them. The critical thing about long-term-care homes, the critical word in there is “home.” That is what we want to achieve: It’s a home. The ideal is to have people living in their home in community. In community, everybody is there; they look out for each other. It strengthens the care that people are able to give to each other when everybody is looking out for each other.", "Let me set the context for this from a legislative point of view: The Legislature passed the Long-Term Care Homes Act, 2007, after a long and extensive consultation process with residents, caregivers and other stakeholders. We undertook that work out of a profound sense of duty to our seniors—those people to whom we owe literally almost everything. They are our parents, our grandparents and our family members. Our principles, our prosperity, for many of us, our very lives are dependent on these people—on the seniors, the people who are being cared for in long-term-care homes. Our seniors are the people who gave us care, love, and protection before most of us had a few words for asking. So it’s our collective responsibility to ensure that our province’s seniors live safely and with dignity.", "We, as a government, had heard that request, and I want you to know, Speaker, that we, as a government, are resolute in answering it. The Long-Term Care Homes Act, 2007, enshrined that commitment into law, but as we often say in government, our work is never done, and there’s always more to do. What is good can be made better, and what is better can be made best. We are never above listening to or acting upon good advice and sound evidence.", "Mr. Speaker, in 2015, the Auditor General conducted a value-for-money audit around long-term care in Ontario. As a result of that audit, it was recommended that the ministry (1) strengthen its enforcement process to promptly address homes with repeated non-compliance issues, and (2) evaluate the potential use of other enforcement measures, such as fines and penalties.", "The safety and security of Ontario’s long-term-care residents remain this government’s top priority, and we are committed to ensuring that we have in place the necessary tools to ensure that safety, which is precisely what the long-term-care component of this bill is designed to do. The proposed amendments to the Long-Term Care Homes Act, 2007, would expand an already strong legislative and regulatory oversight system for Ontario’s long-term-care homes sector for the benefit of Ontario’s 78,000 long-term-care home residents.", "The financial penalties and new provincial offences we are proposing are intended to send a clear message to those long-term-care home operators with ongoing care and safety concerns. It also makes changes to improve the overall quality of care and safety of residents in your homes, or face the consequences. Those consequences are up to and including the revocation of your licence to operate a long-term-care home in this province.", "As you know, Speaker, each of Ontario’s long-term-care homes undergoes an annual inspection to ensure that they comply with the Long-Term Care Homes Act and Ontario Regulation 79/10. In addition, our ministry inspects homes based on complaints from residents, their family members, staff and the public. The evidence we have gathered in the years since the Long-Term Care Homes Act came into force tells us our approach is working well. But as I said earlier, we as a government firmly believe there is always more we can do, and that is especially true when it comes to the care and the well-being of our seniors.", "What we are proposing in the bill are amendments to the Long-Term Care Homes Act, 2007. That includes strengthening the inspection and enforcement framework. Specifically, what we are proposing not only includes the financial penalties and new offence provisions that I have mentioned, but also the power for the minister to issue directives to long-term-care homes on areas of critical importance to residents, for example, those related to medication management.", "We have one of the strongest inspection programs in North America and one of the most highly regulated programs in North America. Bringing in these new enforcement tools will strengthen inspections by helping us direct resources to where they are needed most, so that inspectors can respond and address critical issues.", "That isn’t the only improvement we are proposing in this bill, if passed. We are introducing the ability to suspend a licence, providing the opportunity for a long-term-care home to address critical non-compliance issues while minimizing the impact on residents. In addition to this bill, we are undertaking key investments in long-term care for an improved resident experience.", "As we announced in the 2017 budget, we have committed $10 million in new funding for Behavioural Supports Ontario in order to provide enhanced supports for long-term-care residents with challenging behaviours and those who are at risk for developing these behaviours due to dementia and other cognitive impairments. We also have committed up to $15 million in funding for food to enhance the quality of nutrition as well as support the needs of residents with special diets and ethnocultural food requirements.", "We are also proposing improvements to the ministry website to help people make decisions about long-term care. It will feature improved search functionality to help people find the information they need quickly and easily.", "Our government has been working hard on a number of initiatives to put residents first, and this bill is just a part of those efforts. We are also introducing funding extensions for three centres for learning, research and innovation, or CLRIs, which are located in Ottawa, Toronto, and Waterloo. This new funding will enable centres to incubate and spread innovative practices in seniors’ care, resident care and geriatrics across the province.", "Currently, right now, as part of my mandate for palliative and end-of-life care, we’re looking at how we can spread the culture of excellent palliative care inside long-term-care facilities. We know there are many great centres of excellence. We know that we have to spread that culture and that knowledge and those skills and support palliative care in long-term-care homes.", "Through the Enhanced Long-Term Care Home Renewal Strategy, we’re supporting the development of more than 30,000 long-term-care beds in more than 300 long-term-care homes by 2025 and eliminating all four-bed wards in Ontario’s long-term-care homes.", "Mr. Speaker, recently I was in Arnprior with the Premier and, as well, with the member from Renfrew–Nipissing—" ],

You could get that feeling when we were there and when we made the announcement, speaking to the residents and speaking to the staff. They are providing excellent care. And not only are they a great community inside the home, they are really attached to the community, and, Mr. Speaker, you can tell it makes all the difference in the world. I want to tip my hat to them.", "I was really proud and pleased to be able to be at the announcement of that redevelopment to, I believe, 90 beds or 96 beds from 60 and change. Residents will benefit from redeveloped homes which facilitate the provision of quality care and service in an environment that is comfortable, aesthetically pleasing and as home-like as possible.", "In addition, our government has announced the addition of 75 nurse practitioners to long-term-care home staff across this province. To date, 60 of these positions have been funded, starting in 2015-16.", "We know the difference that nurse practitioners have made to the quality and timeliness of patient care, particularly in primary care, since our government first championed their introduction. It only makes sense that we draw upon their skills and expertise to care for the seniors who make Ontario’s long-term-care homes their homes.", "There’s another aspect to the bill before this Legislature that I wish to speak to, as I mentioned earlier, and those are amendments that relate to the safety and security of residents in Ontario’s long-term-care homes. This government is committed to meeting residents’ safety and security needs in a way that respects their rights and sets out clear criteria for when residents may be confined. I should clarify that by “confinement,” I mean restrictions on a resident’s ability to leave a long-term-care home, or an area within the home, unsupervised.", "We are proposing a consent-based confinement framework for a reason, and that is the safety and well-being of the people who are cared for in long-term-care homes. We want to ensure that a resident with severe dementia and at risk of getting lost is safe.", "To implement the changes proposed in the bill before this Legislature, we will fund new rights adviser positions to support residents in long-term-care homes. These advisers will meet with any long-term-care resident who disagrees with being confined or simply asks for a meeting.", "Our research tells us that no other jurisdiction offers rights advice for long-term-care residents who are confined. Once again, this is Ontario leading the way on this initiative.", "Our proposed amendments to the act relating to confinement will provide clarity for care providers, residents and families on the circumstances under which a resident can be confined based on consent.", "Should a substitute decision-maker consent to confinement on behalf of a long-term-care resident who is found incapable of making that decision for themselves, the resident will be informed of their right to speak with a rights adviser. The resident will also be able to seek a review by the Consent and Capacity Board of both the substitute decision-maker’s consent and of the finding that the resident was incapable of making their own decision regarding confinement. The resident will be able to receive assistance from the rights adviser applying to the board.", "Speaker, I truly believe that all of these proposed changes I have spoken to today are steps in the right direction. They’ll build on the work that we’ve done already, and they position us to deliver even better care for our patients and our long-term-care residents where they need it and when they need it. These proposals fall in line with our Patients First action plan and they further demonstrate our commitment to delivering better, coordinated and integrated care—care that is, from the patient’s perspective, seamless.", "As I mentioned earlier, the safety and security of Ontario’s long-term-care residents remain the government’s top priority. It is a duty and responsibility that we take very seriously. The amendments contained in the bill represent the next step forward in fulfilling our obligation to those who have given us so much: our seniors.", "I look forward to the debate.

It takes a lot of things that had to be done with the health care system and ensures that they’re going to happen.", "There are going to be some people unhappy when you make changes. That always happens. There are going to be some people who are going to say, “Why didn’t you do it 20 years ago?” I can say, “Why didn’t you do it 40 years ago?” in my case. But I think there’s a fair consensus amongst the health care community out there that what is contained in this bill is positive. I suspect, though I can never predict, that this might even receive support from all parties in the House. No doubt they’ll want to make amendments to parts of it which would be additions or significant changes taking place, but I do think this bill goes a long way.", "I listen to the question period in the House from time to time, and it deals with these health care issues. I listen to the criticism that comes. One of the things you’ve heard me say, Speaker, perhaps privately when there’s a discussion going on or in the House, is—the question I ask now of people is, “Are you prepared to raise taxes to ensure that we have the new level of service?”", "It’s interesting, when I’m meeting with different delegations and groups in my own riding and other places. I don’t say only, “Are you prepared to accept?” I say, “Are you prepared to campaign for a tax increase to pay for this?” I can count on one hand the number of people who have said unequivocally that yes, they are prepared to do so.", "What governments are trying to do around the world—this government as well, and part of this bill certainly points in that direction—is make changes to the health care system that will improve it without substantially increasing the funding. A lot of this is shifting. For instance, as you know, in many cases years ago, home care was not what it is today. Mind you, there’s a much greater population of seniors because people are living to an older age today. If you look at the people who are now in long-term-care homes, they’re largely much older and frailer and have more medical challenges than would have been the case a generation ago.", "Along the way, there’s a step called home care. If you ask most people, they’d rather be at home. I can recall that my own father had a kidney problem at one time. He was a person who had never been in a hospital in his life, but he had a kidney problem one time when he was about 78 and was not a good patient, was not a patient patient in the hospital and not a happy camper. I would have thought that there was some question of whether he was ever going to come out of that hospital, except at Christmastime they kicked the patients out, of course. When he got to go home, what a big difference. Yes, there was some care that had to be provided and some extra provisions made, but what a difference it made.", "As much as we can, we try to ensure that there are adequate and excellent home care services for people. That is not without a cost, and that’s why I keep asking all the time of all politicians from all parties when they say—“Are you prepared to raise taxes?” I ask that question to do this because there are a lot of really good things that could be done: an expansion of services, making the services better in terms of quality. Often that requires additional dollars.", "One of the problems is, when we talk to people out there, if one of the parties in the House ran in the next provincial election advocating an increase in taxes, it might not be a successful party at the polls. So I think when people are asking you, I and others in this House to enhance and expand services, then we have to make sure that they are prepared to pay for them.", "But one of the things that people have asked for today in the health care system is transparency. Everyone deserves to have as much information as possible, so transparency is good. It’s difficult sometimes because various institutions are reluctant to bare all the facts out there about something that has happened, but by and large you find you can’t go wrong with transparency. Often when people will see why something is done—not just that it’s done, not just the announcement. You and I as members of the Legislature would know that sometimes we sit down with people who will legitimately question why the Legislature would be doing this. It doesn’t happen all the time, but once you sit down with them and say, “This is why this is being done,” you find out that they are more accepting of that. So I looked at the transparency that’s contained in this bill, and the fact that we’re moving in that direction, and I know that that’s very important. We think that information related to health care professionals and organizations should be made available to the public. Much of it is at the present time.", "We know that if this bill is passed, we’ll have a better understanding of the value of some of these services that exist. So what we would be doing—because there’s a lot of discussion of this today even in the House, in questions that are there. We’ll be guaranteeing that all long-term-care home operators are providing safe and quality care for residents. That’s a major challenge. We just saw in the media this week that three such institutional settings have been prohibited from receiving more patients—that was announced this week—because they were not meeting that standard.", "It’s often not the patients themselves in a long-term-care home, but it’s the family of the patients who come to us and say, “We think this quality of care is” either “good,” or, “It’s not up to standard.” Again, I think that people are looking for more in that regard. Again, that would not happen without some additional costs.", "What we’re looking for, as the member for Ottawa South has mentioned, is more robust enforcement tools and a stronger inspection program within these homes. It would also give ambulances the ability to transport patients to more appropriate settings, such as mental health facilities, to best address their individual needs. Sometimes the hospital isn’t the place.", "If you look back—you and I would remember this a generation ago—the qualifications that a person in an ambulance would have were different. These people were very good people, dedicated, but today our paramedics are required to have a far more detailed knowledge of the health care system, and can provide intervention when they arrive or in the ambulance itself. Now this legislation is saying, “You know, sometimes the hospital isn’t where patients should be taken.” There may be mental health challenges. They would recognize a more appropriate setting would take place—so it would give that ability to our ambulance operators.", "We also want to reduce overcrowding in emergency departments, and provide the best care for patients in the most appropriate settings when they call for 911 assistance. Once again, we recognize, any one of us who has been there as a patient, or had family as a patient in an emergency department, that it is sometimes chaotic, depending on how many people are there. We can only imagine, for instance, what it would be like in a catastrophe such as Las Vegas, where you had so many people killed and injured. Those incidents happen from time to time, for a variety of reasons.", "The access that many people have to a hospital system is actually the emergency department. Some people arrive there who should be going to an alternative—sometimes we call them urgent care centres. Being directed there would be valuable.", "I can say as well that when we go there, I think there’s a feeling among some that it’s first come, first served. As we know, in an emergency department that’s not the case. If somebody is coming in with a very serious heart attack, that person is shunted to the front of the line. If they’re coming in with a laceration somewhere, likely that is going to wait.", "Nevertheless, people look to government in any jurisdiction to provide the circumstances where you have good emergency care. That’s one of the goals that we have within this particular piece of legislation.", "The changes to the Long-Term Care Homes Act I think are valuable changes. They would enhance our oversight system for long-term-care homes so families can remain confident their loved ones are safe and receiving the highest possible quality of care.", "I like the fact that there are new enforcement tools to ensure that long-term-care home operators with recurring care and safety concerns are urgently addressing these issues. From time to time there’s going to be something that will arise that’s an exception in one of the homes. There are other homes that may have more than exceptions, and that’s where the enforcement agency has to come down very hard on those people. We’ve all encountered people who have mentioned that to us.", "We need those enforcement tools—financial penalties for homes with repeated non-compliance—to ensure that all home care licensees are addressing these concerns on an immediate basis.", "Those penalties are there. I support those penalties. We know that those who are in these long-term-care homes—they’re are not all seniors; some are other people who are in a very vulnerable situation. But because they are vulnerable in our society, we as legislators have an obligation to protect them.", "Under the Ambulance Act, the changes that are being made are going to be very positive. I mentioned before the ability to have those individuals who should go to something other than a hospital brought there. Many times, as I say, the ambulance attendants themselves—the paramedics—are able to provide some service that may actually solve the problem of the person before they might ever get to a hospital.", "We want to protect children’s health by regulating recreational water facilities like splash pads and wading pools, which are fun for kids, but there can be accidents that happen or there can be, heaven forbid, some kind of a poison that might be found there—E. coli or something of that nature.", "We also look at the fact that we are helping to protect consumers’ health by preventing infection at personal service settings like barbershops, nail salons, tattoo parlours and aesthetic practices.", "We would improve food safety by revising the definition of a food premise to include part of a home that is used to operate a food business. This can be controversial. You will hear people say, “Why is the government being onerous at the fall fair?” or something like that. There is a negative opportunity for people to acquire some kind of serious illness if there are not the proper controls in place. I know that annoys people, but all it takes is one or two deaths or serious illnesses, and minds are changed considerably.", "We looked at the funding of all of these things. I note in the House when opposition members—and I was an opposition member for years, so I know the role of opposition members—get up and talk about cuts. I call them phantom cuts in this case, because every time I look at the health care budget it goes up substantially every year—up in hundreds of millions of dollars every year. I hear questions come from the opposition about cuts. And of course, they aren’t really cuts. Then that forces the Minister of Health to go into history and talk about cuts that were made in previous years. Now all of those cuts—my good friends in the New Democratic Party have asked some questions about funding and have alleged funding cuts that I know have not happened. I won’t bring the Speaker into this because he’s neutral, but I know that they have not taken place.", "The minister lists all of the cuts that have taken place in those years, and the beds closed and mental-health beds diminished and so on, and what I say is, for instance—in the NDP case, not necessarily the Conservative case, because they have a different approach. They didn’t do it to be mean, all those cuts. They didn’t do it to be mean or because they didn’t care about health care. It’s often the circumstances they face, just as—you and I would have as a hero Tommy Douglas and his successor in Saskatchewan, Roy Romanow.", "I can recall in the 1990s that the NDP government was compelled to close 52 rural hospitals. I’ll bet the opposition in those days was raking them over the coals for it, but as Dr. Janice MacKinnon said in her book, Minding the Public Purse—she was the former Minister of Finance of Saskatchewan under the Romanow government. She explained why it had to be done. They did not want to do it, but there were circumstances that arose. So I’m very understanding of when other parties have done that. I know that our government hasn’t done that because we’ve been, at least in recent years, faced with pretty good economic times in terms of revenues coming in to meet the needs of the province.", "I know the opposition members will be commenting on that, but I wanted to put that on record because I think it’s important to know that when other governments have made those cuts—and I know we retort with that—they didn’t necessarily do it to be mean or not understanding of the needs of health care. They did it because the circumstances dictated that that had to be done.", "I like the fact we are increasing transparency and accountability in governance through the following changes: permitting the Auditor General to conduct value-for-money audits of the RHRA—I think that’s exceedingly important; giving the minister authority to require reviews of the RHRA, the Retirement Homes Act; making other housekeeping amendments to improve the operation of the RHRA, such as establishing deputy registrars to maintain business continuity.", "These changes, I think most people would agree, would reinforce our commitment to strengthening consumer protections by strengthening our ability to address unlicensed retirement homes and enforce compliance in licensed homes, making them safer for residents. I think that’s a goal everybody in this House would have regardless of what their political affiliation or their riding might be.", "We know that the other changes that are made are going to be extremely beneficial to people, under the Medical Radiation Technology Act, some of them. The office of the Patient Ombudsman—and by the way, may I say that our government has chosen an excellent Patient Ombudsman? In fact, I thought that person would have been an excellent choice as the leader of the Progressive Conservative Party in Ontario. Had she been the leader, I would have been running for the hills because certainly the party opposite would have had a chance to win the election. There’s more question about that now, but there was a good choice, I thought, the former member of this Legislature from just east of the city of Toronto. Christine Elliott was, I think, an astute choice by the government because she had demonstrated her concern about health care. Unfortunately, she wasn’t able to buy, or whatever it is—sell as many memberships as the present leader, but what a good choice for Patient Ombudsman. I think that it’s a favour to the people of Ontario, in one way, that she was not chosen as the leader of the Progressive Conservative Party, because she was available, then, to serve in this capacity. But it was certainly a loss for Progressive Conservative Party who, I think, would have done very well to have Christine Elliott as their leader. But that didn’t happen, and it’s not for me to make that kind of decision, as to who is the Progressive Conservative leader.", "The proposed amendment that we have is going to allow the government to enable HQO to more fully engage with patients and family members and communicate more effectively with Ontarians. Very often—and we do this as individual members of the Legislature—we benefit immensely by personal communication with our constituents who have had certain experiences with, for instance, the health care system.", "Now, some will say to us, “I had a marvelous experience. It operated perfectly for me. Boy, we’ve got a nice health care system in Ontario.” Others will say, “My experience was different from that.” That’s where we have to be prepared to address that. I think, with the Patient Ombudsman being able to do this, with the Ombudsman able to require the ability to protect any sensitive information that comes to light during their investigation, that allays some concerns.", "The proposed amendment, as I say, will allow government to enable HQO to more fully engage with patients—that’s very important. HQO can use patient narratives—of course, with the patient’s consent—to support HQO’s patient-centred orientation as a provincial agency that reports on the quality of the health care system from patients’ and caregivers’ perspectives. I think there was general consensus in this House that it was good to establish that office and for the choice that was made.", "There were a lot of consultations that took place for this legislation, I think, as the member for Ottawa South, the parliamentary assistant, made very clear. We as a government consulted with the medical industry and associations; with government-related organizations; with patient groups, societies and foundations; health care organizations and associations; the Open Pharma campaign representatives; and the Ontario public service staff.", "Over 60 individuals representing 43 different organizations attended the in-person sessions, while those who were not able to attend were offered to provide feedback via teleconference or written response. The ministry has held three hours of consultations specifically for patient groups, societies and foundations. Because often—not often; I’d say always—the best legislation, the best regulations, the best policy come from consultation taking place, as with the changes coming under the Ontario Drug Benefit Act.", "We’re introducing an amendment that, if passed, would remove the last outdated reference to physicians in the Ontario Drug Benefit Act. This would reflect that other health care professionals, such as nurse practitioners, can prescribe drug products in Ontario under certain circumstances. Expanding the scope for nurse practitioners is something that we wanted to do in the Protecting Patients Act of 2017.", "Now there were many people who commented favourably about the measures that are contained in this legislation. One area I think all of us confront now is the number of people who unfortunately have Alzheimer’s. That is very prevalent now, largely because of an aging population. But it is very, very difficult for families who are afflicted with this. Virtually every family is touched in one way or another—the greater family or friends—with Alzheimer’s.", "I was pleased that Chris Dennis, CEO of the Alzheimer Society of Ontario, had this to say about this legislation:", "“We are supportive of transparency around private sector influence in the delivery of health care and commend Ontario’s leadership on this issue. Quality of patient care is paramount, and we think everyone in the sector has a role to play to ensure that Ontarians are well-informed so they can make the right decisions.”", "How true that is.", "We’ve had a number of those who have said that. Dr. Adalsteinn Brown, interim dean of the Dalla Lana School of Public Health, said the following, “Improved access to information can only reinforce the credibility and reputation of our health care institutions. I support increased transparency within Ontario’s publicly funded health system. Transparency will increase public trust and help providers, patients and their families make the best choices.”", "Family Councils Ontario spoke approvingly; the executive director of the Ontario Association of Residents’ Councils—the list goes on, including Doris Grinspun, who is the chief executive officer of the Registered Nurses’ Association of Ontario—all making positive comment.", "I know there’s going to be a suitable debate; this is just the beginning of the debate, but there will be a suitable debate on this. This is the kind of bill that I think would probably attract the support of all the parties in the House, though you and I know, Speaker, we can’t always make those predictions. To be fair to each of the parties, they have to bring it to each caucus, where there’s a discussion that takes place, and then decide whether they’re going to support the legislation, not support it or make amendments to it and then support it. Often the support is dependent upon whether there are amendments that the government is prepared to accept—and we always hope that everybody is going to be open-minded to those kinds of amendments.", "I commend the parliamentary assistant, who I know has worked very hard on this legislation, as he has on so many bills in committee. I happen to sit on committees where bills have come for consideration and he has been the lead on behalf of the government, as the parliamentary assistant. He understands, I think, exceedingly well many of the challenges that we face in Ontario. He has brought forward private members’ bills in this House which have reflected that personal concern. So I want to commend him for the work he’s done. It’s onerous being the parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Health and Long-Term Care. It has to be one of the most onerous responsibilities, just as being the minister is.", "I look forward with great anticipation to the debate that will take place in this House. Members will be speaking on the bill. I know that they will all be very positive in their approach and not simply rake the government over the coals—especially the member for Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound. He’s noted for being very non-partisan and complimentary of this government, so I’m going to be able to sit down and allow him in a moment, after the two-minute hits, to have his say." ],

The member from St. Catharines talked about how the budget is ever-increasing in health care. Unfortunately, the NDP doesn’t think that the funding takes into account population growth, it doesn’t take into account the aging population, the rate of inflation, the cost of living—all of those things are continuing to increase at the same time as various budgets in health care are being cut.", "The member from St. Catharines also said that the government is guaranteeing that all long-term facilities are going to provide safe and quality care. I say to the members of the government, how are you going to do that without a significant investment in front-line staff? That is actually where the problem lies in long-term care.", "At the end of the day, seniors don’t care about you redeveloping their homes. They don’t care about a fancy new big-screen TV on the wall in the room. What they care about is quality food and somebody to assist them in making sure that they’re eating it. They want quality activities. Their families want them to be engaged in conversation. They don’t want them lying in bed for 18 hours with no one ever speaking to them, turning them, or getting up to toilet them. What seniors and their families want is to make sure that they live with dignity and with respect and with the care that they deserve in those final years, and not withering away in a long-term-care bed with nobody attending to their care.", "I’m going to have 20 minutes on this later and I’ll have a lot more to say about it." ],

It was good to have his remarks and have that support from him.", "I was writing down the other things that are in this bill: the Ambulance Act and the public health care act. Those are all really important.", "I did listen to what the member from Welland had to say—and I want to start by saying I agree with the member from Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound. I think we all have the ideal of how we want to get there. We do see things differently. We do this sometimes in the House, where we throw things out: “Well, remember what you did in 1990 and what you did in 1999?” Well, we all had to make choices. We know what we’re doing right now—but there’s a limited pot of money and we all make decisions about how we’re going to do that and try to utilize it as best we can.", "What I want to say about long-term care, though, is—and this is something I have been thinking about a lot lately. Where I see excellence in long-term care, there are two things that I find: that it’s a home, and that it’s a community where people look out for each other. That’s the ideal that we have to get to. That’s what our long-term-care homes have to be.", "We can build rules, and we’re doing that. We can make sure we have stronger enforcement tools, and we need to do that. But what we also have to realize is that those places have to be communities. We have to put more front-line resources. We always have to look at those things. But our communities actually have to realize they have to help those places be communities as well. It requires all of us." ],

  "text" : [ "I would like to, again, as I did in my response a few seconds ago, thank the minister’s staff for the briefing provided to this very specific piece of legislation just a couple of hours go. It was a little bit of just-in-time delivery, but it was good, it was thorough, and I do appreciate all of the members who participated in that discussion.", "As the PC Party’s critic for seniors, long-term care and accessibility, I am pleased to rise and give input into schedules 5 and 10 of Bill 160, Strengthening Quality and Accountability for Patients Act, as it concerns amendments to the Long-Term Care Homes Act and the Retirement Homes Act.", "From the perspective of our caucus, we want to see a system that upholds safety and equality and is a success for all senior residents in care homes in Ontario. Of course, how could we not want that, Mr. Speaker? As I said in my response, it’s sometimes more the reality of how we get there and the processes we find.", "Mr. Speaker, this is our personal commitment to the seniors who shaped and built this great province we have today—and that will be, should be, and needs to be a priority. There is no greater urgency than ensuring seniors, who are our most vulnerable citizens, have access to care, from home care to long-term care, when and where they need it.", "I think the members opposite know exactly where my concerns lay with regard to their party’s record on long-term care. After all, I have asked 45 questions in question period and twice as many in the estimates committee, while voicing my concern about inadequate access to care, funding and enforcement in long-term care, all of which have led this government to fail our seniors.", "As I shared again to the chief government whip, that is our role. He knows that well because he’s complimented and suggested it in cases—that it is the role of the opposition to be very hard-hitting, to be very much the group that keeps the government to task on all aspects of legislation.", "With 80% of Ontario’s 627 long-term-care homes being compliant with the laws with regard to operations and provision of care, the problem clearly lies not with the operators but with how the ministry is responding—or not responding, rather—to the other 20% who are non-compliant. So before I get into the specifics of Bill 160, I first want to review those key concerns, some of which are being addressed in this bill, albeit not to the full extent of what they should be, in my opinion.", "If you think back to the questions and statements made in the House in response to my concerns with this government’s mishandling of the long-term-care system, you will find they always focused on inadequate access to care, funding and enforcement of seniors’ protections to the full extent of the law. The three areas are connected, as they lead to infractions that would be targeted after Bill 160 is passed.", "With regard to access to care, I’ve been voicing the government’s mishandling of our seniors’ access to physiotherapy.", "After cutting funding and access to physiotherapy in 2013—which, of course, at that time I challenged and was very concerned about the ramifications of that. What was going to happen to the people who lost funding for that care? What was going to be the real reality to the people—not about a budget, not about numbers—the actual people who were losing access to care?", "Ontario’s seniors in long-term care are suffering twice as many falls. This is a problem because falls are a common cause of hip fractures and result in a costly hospitalization. Also, Speaker, as we all know, falls can lead to ministry orders against a home for non-compliance, something Bill 160 is trying to address.", "If you think back again, they cut funding without giving a lot of thought to what the repercussions were. They’re actually saying, “We want to have fewer falls”—they set that as a goal. But it only stands to reason that the chances that you’re going to actually have some kind of a mishap are greater if you have less care and fewer people actually in the facility trying to help you and keep you in a healthy state. So while the Minister of Health has promised to reduce seniors’ falls and set the target at 9%, there is no indication he’s anywhere close to it. As I’ve said in this House many times, it’s interesting when I hear numbers—because I want to know: Did they actually do any kind of a pragmatic thought process? Did they use any kind of science to say that this is actually achievable and what the result is?", "We’ve had so many examples of where those numbers don’t match up. When we heard about the gas plant cancellation, we heard a $40-million figure being used by the government, and they stood there and said, “Absolutely.” And yet we know, today, that it’s $1.2 billion. So when they use a 9% figure, Speaker, I wonder how they use that.", "I’ve asked about the redevelopment of long-term-care beds. They said 30,000. They’re at about 10,000—and, if I’m really kind, I will even give them up to 12,000 or 14,000. How could you not have a plan to know exactly when and where you’re redeveloping over 14 years? They’re still saying, “It’s all good. We’re on track.” You’re at 30% and you’ve been in government for 14 years.", "So I challenge them when I hear numbers.", "Results from the Health Quality Council show that twice as many seniors are suffering dangerous falls in every local health integration network across Ontario, and that falls in long-term care have been increasing steadily since this government cut physiotherapy treatments. Again, they went down an ideological path, people are suffering for it, and they’re still not backing up and saying, “We made a mistake and we’re going to reverse and change that.”", "Mr. Speaker, these are dangerous statistics. We want to know that our seniors’ safety is absolutely assured and that it’s a true priority of government. So why did this Liberal government cut physiotherapy, knowing it would increase seniors’ falls and compromise their health? And is this cut leading to higher rates of non-compliance? These are very legitimate questions and the government needs to address them.", "Secondly, the government has seriously mishandled capacity and seniors’ access to long-term-care beds across Ontario, despite receiving capacity-specific recommendations that called for more beds in Ontario to accommodate our growing senior population and their mounting acuity needs. Mr. Speaker, all of us have heard about the baby boom generation that’s coming at us. This isn’t a new phenomenon that just started a month ago or a week ago. For 14 years, this government has been in power. They have had the lead. This is a file that they should have had absolutely at the foremost of their thought process, knowing that those people, those wonderful seniors who have built our province, are having a need coming at us, and yet, at every turn, there’s not enough beds and not enough funding in the care homes. We’re seeing more falls than less falls. They’re cutting physiotherapy services instead of adding physiotherapy services.", "After 14 years of inaction, we’re left with 30,000 outdated nursing beds—that’s almost half of our entire long-term-care capacity—and a record—high wait-list for beds. I believe the most recent update is 30,000 seniors are on the long-term-care wait-list for a bed. It’s shameful that the government is not increasing capacity. This wait-list is already projected by the long-term-care industry that it’s going to hit at least 50,000 people by 2021, and in the last budget, I saw no money for new beds—nothing that they even talked about that we’re looking to address, even though they’ve known about this for a number of years.", "People in Ontario come to me. They’ve lost trust. They’ve lost hope that this government truly is making seniors a priority, because there is no plan. There wasn’t one word of mention about the beds that are needed. They didn’t do anything to address the actual long-term-care situation—crisis, in some cases. I have families every day coming to me, wondering where they’re going to put their loved one. Who is going to take care of them going down the road?", "In his promotion of Bill 160, the minister has said he wants to implement recommendations from the 2015 Auditor General’s report, the one that also warned of long wait times. He has also said that he wants to make seniors’ care a top priority—wants to make. Why hasn’t he made it, Mr. Speaker? He has been there in that position for a number of years, and those who came before him—the Deputy Premier was health care. Where was that priority under her tenure?", "You can say when you’re only a year into government, “I don’t really know and I don’t have all the plans and I can’t address everything.” But 14 years—does it not seem that you would want to have some trust in your government that this was a priority? Would you not see action showing that that was a priority after 14 years?", "I get asked every day in my critic role whether I believe the government is—because the people are saying to me, “I don’t believe that seniors are a priority for this government. Do you, Mr. Walker, believe?” And I have to sadly say, “No, I don’t think they are.”", "I stand every day in this House proudly to represent and defend those seniors and ask for services, which for the most part are about safety, for those wonderful people who need these services. I don’t know how genuine a statement that says, “I want to make”—when you, again, have been there and when you still have no plan to house the 30,000 frail seniors on the long-term-care list.", "I have asked in estimates for two years. You said you were going to redevelop 30,000 beds. It would only stand to reason, I think, and to give people true comfort and belief that a government is in control, that if you say, “I’m going to build 30,000” or “I’m going to redevelop 30,000,” you should be able to give me a list that says here is how many in each year, what LHINs they’re going to be built in and a time frame of when they should be completed. Yes, it can change; yes, it can move. But would you not at least—Mr. Speaker, I don’t think you would ever ask to have a house built and just say, “Oh, go start building and we’ll talk about the details later.” You would think that you would say, “I want”—how many bedrooms, how many bathrooms, whether you want a basement, what type of cupboards.", "I find it interesting that they throw out numbers all the time but there’s never the follow-up. Whenever I ask those detailed questions, as is my responsibility as the opposition, you would think they would be able to hand it to me and say, “Mr. Walker, here it is. It’s been on the shelf. We’ve had this. We’ve spent lots of time.” They spend all kinds of money on studies. They always talk about consulting and going to the people and spending huge amounts of money on consultants. Do we ever get that study that they actually put in?", "I don’t know how they can stand and say that we’re doing really well with 10,000 out of 30,000 beds completed and no plan, as I mentioned earlier, for new beds, yet we know that that wait-list is going to double in the next five years.", "Finally, I want to remind members opposite that homes require stable and predictable funding to support the needs of residents entrusted in their care, and also to meet the ministry’s regulations. Yet it’s no secret that not only has the government mishandled access to care and capacity and not planned accordingly to accommodate our growing senior population, it has also underfunded the long-term-care system to the point that homes have been struggling to meet residents’ care needs.", "When I put before the government my private member’s bill to provide guaranteed funding for seniors in long-term care, the minister failed to enshrine this protection in law. It’s shameful because everyone knows this government was underfunding the system by so much that even prisoners were being fed better than seniors in long-term care.", "Then you throw on 400% increases in hydro that come out of the same budget. If you’re going to incur 300% to 400% increases, the reality is, if you’re not giving them more money, it has to come from somewhere. Sadly, in many cases, it’s back to that direct care for the patient, and we’re hearing that time and again across the sector from all kinds of people who are feeling that they have had less services than more services.", "We all know that this government has had record high revenues in all the years of their tenure, and yet they continue to run debt and deficit." ],

  "text" : [ "Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Again, what I was suggesting was, I had tabled a private member’s bill, and the minister has continued to fail to enshrine this protection in law. We know, again, how much underfunding has happened when there are prisoners who are receiving more money in allotment per day than our long-term-care patients. Imagine the difference in quality of life and better care this funding guarantee would give our seniors. So I ask the minister time and again: Why won’t he enshrine in law a guarantee that spending on seniors in long-term care will never again dip below the rate of inflation?", "Finally, enforcement of the laws to protect seniors in long-term care was another critical missing piece. Up until the last few months, when the minister moved to cease admissions at a few nursing homes, there was no such enforcement. Two years ago, in 2015, I filed order paper questions with the Minister of Health and Long-Term Care to find out how many orders or fines they issued following their annual inspection of long-term-care homes. Around the same time, Ontario averaged 265 urgent and non-urgent complaints each month. Urgent complaints are the most serious, involving allegations such as abuse or neglect. There were also, on average, 1,150 critical incident reports each month. This was happening at the same time the Auditor General started sounding warnings about the minister’s lack of action in cracking down on repeat offenders of non-compliance.", "Instead of getting assurance that the government was using enforcement tools in the act to achieve compliance, I received a blanket response. The Minister of Health and his Minister of Seniors Affairs wrote to say they were proud of their work on long-term care. Both of them have always spun it as, and I’m using actual quotes and talking points from two ministers: We are “putting patients at the centre of the system,” with a “laser-like focus on long-term care.” We are “indeed providing the highest levels of care.” We have “beefed up inspections ... residents continue to feel truly at home and safe in their homes,” and compliance is up; quality is up. In addition, their response to my questioning of such exaggerated statements was, “That’s a little rich for the party opposite to be asking.”", "The question is, if you had done your job and if all of what you’ve been repeating in the House was true, then why would we need to urgently debate Bill 160 today?", "The truth is, you’re just now, in an election season—strange as that may seem, Mr. Speaker—creating an overhaul of the system via schedules 5 and 10, especially as it concerns oversight and enforcement.", "I’ve again been asking—there’s the Casa Verde case. There was an inquiry done in 2005, and it’s my knowledge—and again, I just asked in the briefing—that less than 30% of the recommendations from that inquiry have ever actually been implemented by this government. So why do you spend the time and the money and give false hope to the families who have already suffered through it and those who may come along, and say that we’ve only got 30% or 33% of the actual actions? You start to wonder, Mr. Speaker: Could we have prevented such things as the most recent tragedy with the Wettlaufer case? That’s what I tried to say when that first happened: Yes, an inquiry is there, but what we want to see is urgent action. What is the minister doing today to give people confidence and comfort that the safety of their loved ones is absolutely paramount?", "Some of the things that are in schedules 5 and 10 are okay. They’re going to address some needs, and I’m pleased with that. I’ve always tried to be, as the chief government whip suggests, a person who’s non-partisan at times and fair to them when there are good things that they do. I’m quite pleased to give them credit. As you are well aware, Mr. Speaker, sadly, that’s not as often or as frequent as all of us would like that to be. If they were doing great things, it would be wonderful. In opposition, often the things that they are mismanaging—the incompetence and the waste—come out, and those are the things where we have to, to be fair to the public we represent, make sure they are informed and aware. Because there is an election coming, they do need to understand the true facts so they can make an informed decision.", "I’ll go back to the bill, Mr. Speaker. Schedule 5 includes amendments to the Long-Term Care Homes Act, the Health Care Consent Act, the Substitute Decisions Act and the Personal Health Information Protection Act with respect to the use of restraints, inspections, and penalties that will punish repeat offenders, proposing, among other things, that restraints cannot be used for the convenience of staff or licensees or as a disciplinary measure. Restraints are allowed only if immediate danger presents. Interestingly—and again, I want to give the government kudos when they do a good job and actually meet a target—they’ve actually reduced the use of physical restraints in long-term care to 6%, down from 16% in 2011.", "The bill also proposes that inspectors can issue penalties to force homes into compliance with the act, but they’ll also have the power to reduce the penalty amount if it presents unnecessary hardship on the home—details to be set in regulation. One of the challenges that my critic provided us with when he did an overall comprehensive summary of this bill is, again, the reality that there’s a lot of this in regulation, which never comes in front of us, which it should. You give a lot of the power to the administration and the bureaucracy behind the scenes to set the rules and regulations, not us, the legislators who are given the privilege to create law. So we have some challenges with that.", "I think it would be good to understand if this is a need. If they find that there’s need for more inspectors, are they going to actually provide those? Because I think, again, what people want to see is—I want to see the actual fruit of the labour of the people out doing those inspections. If there’s a repeat offender, I definitely support going after those, cracking down and not allowing non-compliance to continue unabated.", "They’ll charge fees for inspections for recurring non-compliance. Again, it’s great to charge more fees. It seems to be like a tax. There’s never a tax that they don’t like to add, this government, but at the end of the day, what are those fees going to do? Are they going to add more inspectors so they can get to those inspections in a more timely way to ensure the safety of the residents? Or is it just going to become another fund that comes in and we never know where the money ends up and we don’t know if it ever gets back to front-line care?", "We certainly have some situations in here. They’re going to hike penalties. The first offence is $100,000 or 12 months of jail time; a second offence is $200,000 or 12 months in jail. Again, I think there has to be teeth to this. If people are continually consistent in being in non-compliance, then at some point, fines will be one of the deterrents to hopefully incent them to be better.", "There’s also a little bit in here, Mr. Speaker, where they talk about—I’m starting to run out of time. We pushed for whistle-blower protection. People who are out there that see what’s going on and want to report it: They have to be protected, because those are the people who are actually stepping up. I did not see included in Bill 160 any strengthening of this whistle-blower protection for family members with loved ones in long-term care, people like Diana Pepin in Ottawa. Diana quit her job and became a full-time advocate for better care for her mom, who was in long-term care. She was a nurse, by the way, so she understood the front line; she understood the reality of health care. Do you know what happened to her, Mr. Speaker? She was served a trespass notice and limited access to her mom—unacceptable. Someone standing up and caring for their dear loved one, their mom, and they’re denied access? Something is wrong in the system, and she has to be given true protection. If you’re going to want people to be the guardians of the system, you want people to be able to step up with no recrimination.", "I already mentioned the Casa Verde inquest. Less than 30% of the recommendations have been implemented to date from the Shirlee Sharkey and Gail Donner reports. This government and minister have had hundreds of recommendations from the multiple task forces, inquiries and reports over the last 14 years, and yet many of them have never been implemented.", "Schedule 10: It’s about a rights adviser. If someone isn’t able to make their own decisions, a rights adviser is there and they have the ability. What I suggested in the briefing was that we want to ensure that we have the ability for that person to get the care they need in a timely manner and that the system is consistent and standardized.", "Mr. Speaker, why is this government rushing legislation when the sector impacted by the changes has had no input into its creation? Is it because it’s the election season, because the party opposite has been publicly shamed to the point where no one has any confidence left in how they’re managing the long-term-care system? In14 years, their mishandling of the long-term-care file is terrible for seniors, for their families, for front-line staff, for operators and everyone who trusted them when they said that seniors’ care was their top priority.", "Considering these facts, it is very clear that the safety and security of residents—although they might say the right things, actions, as we know, speak louder than words. We want to see a government that truly puts detail into it, that they actually put those enforcement processes in place. We would not want to forget why, in 14 years, they haven’t done any of this, and yet, all of a sudden, eight, 10 months before election, this is a big issue.", "I will always stand for seniors. I have been doing that and am proud and will continue to do it." ],

There are systemic issues in long-term care that we actually have to address under the public inquiry that’s currently open which is looking at the first phase, which is the Wettlaufer criminal acts, those heinous murders that happened. That needs to be done, of course, to get answers for families.", "But taking it a step further and opening it up into phase two, it will actually address what he’s talking about. He talked about capacity. We say there are capacity issues, capacity availability and access within the region. That needs to be done. There are 30,000 people on the wait-list. We need to talk about what that capacity looks like in each region and how we can change that for people who are waiting for a bed in long-term care, not just shuffle them off into the alternative care beds in hospitals. They sit there for months and sometimes years, waiting.", "What happens is they then don’t get prioritized. For the people who are living in home care who need to get into long-term care, there are no other options. They’re in crisis. They get put into a long-term-care bed and the people in alternative care beds in hospitals stay there waiting because they’re not classified as a crisis.", "Speaker, if we really care about how to address the problems in long-term care and address the wait-lists, about which the member opposite went on at length, let’s look at systemic issues and include in that one of those pillars that we talk about under phase two in the public inquiry.", "I will be addressing this in the late show. I’m grateful I was able to ask for a late show. This morning, when the minister answered my question, I didn’t find it satisfactory, and I’d like to talk about the systemic issues that are really happening. It’s not about fearmongering; it’s about getting to the root of the problem." ],

It’s not understood on the other side that the comparison that you’re making between Ontario’s prisons and the long-term-care system is apples to oranges. Inside long-term care it’s called a raw food diet. Inside our corrections, it’s a prepared food diet. It’s the full cost of the food, preparation and the food as well.

One of those nursing homes was in our community of Fergus in the riding of Wellington–Halton Hills: Caressant Care.

He seemed to be, obviously, on top of it, but I asked him to ensure that our community receives all the information that it needs. This it isn’t a time to keep anything from the public because obviously we would be concerned about the people who would not be going in because of the cease of admissions.", "Certainly we’re concerned about the residents who are there right now.

They are on a two-year wait-list for physio for Carl. Carl suffers from Parkinson’s disease. He has seen a specialist; the specialist has told him that he needs to have physiotherapy. So he got himself on the list at our local rehab centre, the Shaver rehabilitation centre, and it is going to be two years because there is no government funding for outpatient physiotherapy for anyone in this province.", "While the member from Ottawa South says that seniors want to stay at home and we want them to stay at home and we want them to live out as many years as they can in their homes, many of them can’t. The ones who can still need those services. They need physio. They need social programs. They need people visiting them on a regular basis.", "I can tell you that when I talk to some of the personal support workers who actually look after seniors—I had one story told to me this past summer where a senior was in a hospital bed and she needed a nursing home bed, but they sent her home anyway. So she was getting 24-hour-a-day care in the local hospital, but they sent her home with only three hours of care for every eight-hour shift, even though she wasn’t mobile enough to even get up and use the washroom facilities on her own. I can tell you, these personal support workers were so fearful that she was going to fall. How does a government approve and support somebody who needs 24-hour care in a nursing home, and who’s on a wait-list, being sent home with only three hours of care for every shift?", "The tsunami is coming. The member from Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound talked about 30,000 people on that wait-list. In my own area, I think there are 1,400 or 1,500 people on the wait-list just in Niagara, where we have a population of 440,000. And it’s not easy to get on that wait-list. When you actually get on that wait-list, you are pretty old and you are pretty fragile because you have to jump through all these hoops, for which the former CCAC—and now the LHIN—was responsible to even make that list.", "I can tell you that my own mother was 91 and it took us a year to get my mother on that list, even though she was suffering from some dementia and was wandering outside of her own apartment.", "The member from Ottawa South said that, yes, there needs to be some more front-line investment, and that seniors’ facilities need to be their home. I totally agree with that piece—and that the community also needs to be involved.", "But you know, Speaker, seniors’ kids are already seniors. When the seniors are actually getting into a long-term-care bed today, their kids are already seniors. Their kids have already been looking after them for 15 or 20 years. They’ve been providing care to keep them out of a nursing home, so by the time they get to be in their mid-eighties to nineties, their kids are in their seventies and they don’t have the energy or the ability to be coming in and providing more care for parents that they’ve already looked after for the last 15 or 20 years.", "I can tell you that most nursing homes I’ve been involved with over the years, whether it’s a for-profit or a not-for-profit, which my friend from Kitchener–Waterloo just spoke about, have thousands of hours of volunteers already in those homes.", "I know that in the city of Welland we have Rapelje Lodge, named after Doug Rapelje, who was a long-time administrator of the nursing home sector in my city; we have Woodlands of Sunset; and then we have Villa De Rose. So we have three long-term-care homes, and we have the same number of beds today that we had 20 years ago. When they actually redeveloped those beds, it took us seven or eight years to get a new home built. Even though the government announced it in 2007, it took until 2015 to get those 96 beds redeveloped. So the government does need to have a plan for some long-term planning on how we are going to meet the needs of those 30,000 today and 50,000 10 years from now who are going to need long-term-care beds in this province.", "What’s happening in my community I’m sure is happening in communities all across this province—that some of these people are going into retirement homes where they don’t have the staff to look after people who require a long-term-care bed. So they’re putting people on a floor, all in the same wing of the retirement home, and they are bringing in personal support workers to give them a half-hour or an hour of care a day, get them into a shower and get them into the dining room for their meals, perhaps, but that is all the care that they are getting when they really need to be in a long-term-care facility.", "There are huge problems coming down the pipe, and the government continues to invest in for-profit health care. They are allowing the contracts to continue for for-profit community care; they are allowing long-term-care development in the for-profit sector. The New Democrats in this Legislature believe that every government dollar, taxpayers’ money, should be invested for care and not for the profits of people who are making profits off the backs of the taxpayers and the seniors who actually need this care. I think the government needs to move from subsidizing the for-profit sector around health care in this province and take all of those dollars and use those dollars to buy more health care for people in this province.", "Now, I’ve got a few stories, but I only have one minute, so I think that I’m going to go back to the government whip’s comments. He talked about how the opposition parties would be coming forward with amendments—no doubt they would be coming forward with amendments. All I want to say in my last minute here, Speaker, is that no doubt the government will vote down all of those amendments, which they always do." ],

On September 14, the Legislature voted for the New Democratic motion to immediately broaden the scope of the public inquiry into the safety and security of residents in long-term-care homes and address its systemic problems. That was a motion we put forward. We did that, Speaker, because we wanted this government to really take this matter seriously.", "The motion identified eight systemic issues in the long-term-care system. I’d like to take this opportunity, Speaker, to remind you of what those are, as they speak to so many of the issues that we’re talking about today in Bill 160: the safety of residents and staff; quality of care; funding levels; staffing levels and staffing practices; regulation, enforcement and inspections; capacity, availability and accessibility in all regions; the impact of for-profit privatization on care; and government action and inaction on previous recommendations to improve the long-term-care homes system.", "Two of their own government cabinet ministers voted for the motion calling on this government to acknowledge the systemic problems in long-term care. Both of those members have surely faced some of the issues I’ve just highlighted in their own ridings with their own constituents.", "Speaker, our job is to bring the stories of our constituents forward and to ensure that they are heard in the Legislature. I have heard countless stories from people in my riding whose loved ones are living in care homes that struggle to provide a basic standard of care. Many of those families don’t want their names repeated for fear of reprisal or no-trespassing orders—that happens.", "The long-term-care system is in crisis, and our government is answerable to the thousands of families and front-line workers who need the inquiry to be immediately broadened.", "This morning, during question period, I asked about the three long-term-care homes that have been ordered to stop accepting patients. The minister’s response, Speaker, was far from satisfactory. Seniors in homes in London, Mississauga and Fergus are living with such poor standards that this government had no choice but to take action with cease admissions orders.", "This isn’t helping the 30,000 people waiting for long-term-care placement. We want to address these issues in the second phase of the public inquiry so that we can actually find and fix those problems. The conditions in these three homes illustrate the broader problems that are systemic in our care homes in Ontario. As I mentioned this morning, the complaints that have gone unaddressed range from food residents are being served to the violence that’s happening and they’re experiencing in long-term-care homes and the overall unacceptable conditions that seniors are living in.", "Simply cutting off admissions to individual homes that have been brought to the minister’s attention isn’t the solution to fixing the various problems present in every care home in this province. Speaker, rest assured that this is not about fear-mongering. Literally, every care home has these systemic problems to a certain level. Some tilt one particular way, where even capacity, availability and accessibility is a systemic problem throughout this province.", "Instead of increasing funding levels and addressing staffing levels and practices, among other systemic issues, the government needs to take a hard look at the safety and security of residents and front-line workers in the long-term-care system. While it’s imperative for the government to investigate the circumstances that led to the eight tragic murders committed by Elizabeth Wettlaufer, it also needs to immediately address the systemic problems in the long-term-care system.", "So I will ask this government yet again: When will you commit to focusing on the systemic issues that are in the long-term-care system and broaden the scope of the public inquiry into the safety and security of residents in the long-term-care system?", "I hope this government is going to take this seriously, Speaker, and actually address the systemic problems, and not just sweep them under the rug and continually tell us, “Everything’s fine. We’re addressing them through certain measures.” It needs to be a systemic, full picture of what’s going on throughout Ontario. Let’s take a hard look at these problems. Let’s be honest about them. Let’s find them, let’s fix them, and let’s do it for our seniors and the future generations." ],

I think they are great opportunities.", "It’s interesting that we were debating a bill, just before we had the late show, which has particular measures of compliance and transparency around long-term-care homes.", "I want to go back to something I said earlier in response to the member from Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound. In my community of Ottawa South, and Ottawa in general, we’ve had a real challenge that has come up. We have a director’s order for four homes. They are four not-for-profit homes. When you see and hear about some the things that happen in there, they are of concern to all of us. Then, on the other side, I have a mother-in-law in long-term care, and I know that the care that she is receiving is excellent.", "I spend a lot of time in long-term-care homes and I see excellent care being delivered by dedicated people. I know I said this already about three times this afternoon—but that whole sense of a home and community, where that is, you have excellent care. I won’t go back into listing all the long-term-care homes in my riding and in Ottawa that are providing excellent care. We can’t lose that because we have to raise up that excellence. It’s about making everybody excellent.", "I know that the members opposite were looking for an expansion of the scope or another phase to the Wettlaufer inquiry. I firmly believe we have to get to the bottom of how this heinous an act can occur inside long-term care. I think there’s a broad enough scope to look at some other things. That will lead us to take a look at what things we could do to help with those outliers—because they are outliers. It’s not to say that there isn’t need for constant improvement, that we don’t need to expand the availability of long-term care, that we don’t have to take a look at the issues of ALC in long-term care, because they do exist. Are people in the right place or do they end up there by virtue of how the list works and where there is to go?", "We’ve addressed that in Ottawa through supportive housing that’s connected to long-term-care homes, at Bruyère and at the Perley and Rideau Veterans’ Health Centre. There’s a continuum of care, where people can live together—again, I come back to it—in community and can support each other.", "I’m not going to go through the litany of investments and how many new beds and how many beds were redeveloped. It’s happening. But I think what we need to focus on is taking a look at where the risk really is. In Ottawa, they said that we’ve got some risk right here and that’s why there’s a director’s order and there’s another investigation. We have to have the kind of sanctions that can make a difference, especially at a management, an executive and a company level. We have to have those things there. If you don’t have those, there’s not really a penalty. But in actual fact, what we have to get to is that that’s just simply not acceptable.", "I want to relate to one other thing when it comes to long-term-care homes. I have the same concern that the member does. We may see things a bit differently—but I do like to highlight the excellence in long-term care. Many of us read obituaries as part of our daily work because we represent communities. I consistently see in there thanks to a certain home, thanks to the staff, and appreciation of what’s done.", "We have to get to the bottom of these things; there’s no question about it. We also have to acknowledge the excellence that’s happening there. What’s happening in this whole process of some outliers and serious things happening is that everybody is getting painted with the same brush and it’s not right.", "I appreciate the member’s advocacy. I know that she’ll continue to do that. That’s a really important part of what happens here. I appreciate the chance to have a late show." ],

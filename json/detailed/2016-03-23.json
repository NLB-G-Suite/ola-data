  "text" : [ "Good morning to you.", "In preparing for this bill, I’ve really noticed how much we’ve changed over the last 20 years with regard to smoking. I remember back in the late 1970s, I was eight or nine years old, and on Sundays I would go to my father’s pharmacy and do odd jobs just to hang out with my dad, listen to the baseball game and learn about the business. One of the tasks he gave me was taking the great big ashtray, near where people dropped off the prescriptions, and cleaning it. It was chock full of butts from people. It was amazing at the time: You’re in a pharmacy, a health facility, giving medication to people to make them healthy, and you’re allowed to smoke while you’re waiting for your prescription.", "That’s something that’s burned in my memory, because I really can’t stand smoking. It doesn’t sit right with me. It really irritates my sinuses. The fact that it was 30-some-odd years ago—and the pages never lived through this; you missed that, I guess, if that’s excitement for you. But 30-some years ago you were allowed to smoke inside buildings, and waiting for your doctor, you’d have a cigarette.", "It’s really interesting: My family doctor smokes. I do remember going to his building, and he and his staff would be smoking in the side room before they came to see you. He would just stink of smoke when he would come and check my blood pressure and stuff.", "Another aspect I remember is, in the 1990s I went to Poland; we had a family trip to Poland. I flew LOT Airlines, which was the Polish airline. You had to request a smoking or non-smoking seat in an airplane. So at the back of the plane you were allowed to smoke; in the front of the plane, you were fine. I just find it really interesting that we didn’t think the second-hand smoke would just drift to the front of the plane anyway. When you have a lot of nervous flyers, they smoke an awful lot to help maintain their nerve. It was a terrible flight: nine hours there, with people smoking in the plane, and nine hours coming home.", "The other thing that the pages won’t ever get to experience, thankfully, I remember in my twenties going to the bars at night." ],

  "text" : [ "Yes, I did that in my twenties. I kind of cut back after I got married, but in my twenties I’d go to the bars.", "In the morning, you’d wake up and you would just stink of smoke. It was unbelievable. People smoked all the time in the bars. You didn’t realize, at the time, the amount of second-hand smoke you were probably inhaling continually. You’d feel bad for the people who had to work there and put up with it every day; I only had to put up with it on Saturday nights.", "We’ve seen a lot of changes through the years with regard to cutting down on smoking in the system, and ensuring that the people who are smoking are in certain areas that aren’t affecting non-smokers and that they’re not causing any ill effects. Thank goodness they’re not smoking in pharmacies anymore. It was a terrible job cleaning out ashtrays, and it’s terrible for the profession.", "I know a pharmacist in London, Jim Semchism. He owns a family pharmacy. His dad owned a pharmacy, and he’s got brothers and sisters who are pharmacists throughout the London area. Much like my family’s in St. Thomas, his is the same in London. He led the charge to remove tobacco from pharmacies in Ontario. He took a lot of flak for it, but, at the end of the day, I think it was a good message to send to people that pharmacies are a place of health and not a place to be purchasing tobacco products. So I’m grateful.", "The other thing you’ll probably see if you go to the States now—I mentioned the pages—is that in restaurants you’ll get asked, “Smoking or non-smoking?” If you stay in Canada long enough, you forget that, and you’re kind of shocked when you walk in and go, “Jeez, we’ve got to figure out if it’s smoking or non-smoking.”", "I’m also happy that other changes were made here. I brought forth a bill, Ryan’s Law—it will be a year this May that it passed—which allowed students to carry their inhalers in schools. It has nothing to do with smoking, but it has something to do with lung health. I’m proud that it has been implemented through the school system, and I know that schools were quick to act on it and allow their students to carry their puffers.", "I’m glad we’re here to speak about Bill 178. I think this bill is here because something was missed in Bill 45—it should have been included. I know there was a little bit of a rush when Bill 45 came out and this was missed; it’s something that could have been added. I guess my one offer of advice for the government is that when they do have to add something they missed in another bill, maybe they could take a look at other bills that are sitting, waiting to be debated, and incorporate them into the bill so we have a meatier bill, something where we can utilize our time. There are a number of bills that they could incorporate into the healthy smoking bill to kind of take care of the backlog of private members’ business and also ensure that we get passage of the bill and utilize our time here.", "I will make mention of Bill 41, the Lung Health Act. It’s by the MPP from Cambridge. She has brought forth this bill, and we’ve had petitions in the House on numerous days asking the government to bring it forward and debate it. This is a bill that probably could have been included in this smoke-free act. It would create a lung health advisory council, and the purpose of the council would be to make recommendations to the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care about lung health issues. When you’re discussing the Smoke-Free Ontario Act, why not discuss lung health as a whole?", "The council that would be created would include an employee from the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, a member of the Ontario Lung Association—which I admit has been very supportive of lung health measures in this chamber, and was quite supportive of Ryan’s Law and continues to be—and there would also be members of this council who are interested concerning lung health. The Ontario Health Quality Council would be responsible for providing an annual report card, tabled in the Legislature, with respect to the minister’s performance in undertaking the recommendations of this council. Finally, the minister, with the consideration of this council and a report from the Ontario Health Quality Council, would develop and implement an Ontario lung health action plan to target research, prevention, diagnosis and treatment of lung disease.", "That bill is currently in the Standing Committee on Regulations and Private Bills, which is a committee I sit on. We have yet to hear any deputations in taking that bill forward, and we would like to see this bill go forward.", "We understand how important lung health is, and this was an opportunity to include this bill. The government has done it before. The member from Sarnia–Lambton, Bob Bailey—his bill on the tax credit for farmers to give to food banks was incorporated in a government bill that they brought forward, and it took Bob’s bill out of the private members’ backlog. It was passed. Bob was showing me a great email he received that food donations are way up from farmers because this tax credit is available, and it’s providing people who need to use food banks access to fresh produce and meat. That was a plus-plus, and it was something that was worked on.", "So that was my one aspect to the government that was making up for rushing through a bill and having to bring this out. Maybe the next time they can incorporate some of the private members’ bills that are in the backlog. Another one that they have from the member from Etobicoke North is his bill on radon, the radon awareness bill. That’s been repeated over and over and over. It would have been an opportunity to bring that bill inclusive into it.", "I think it’s very, very interesting that we are having this discussion to amend the Smoke-Free Ontario Act. We’re having to deal with this bill because it was missed in Bill 45, this aspect of it. Unfortunately—which we’ve totally done numerous times, especially at committees—when you rush a bill, you run into problems and you have unintended consequences due to the nature of having to expedite a bill.", "Basically, this bill came forth and had to be put forward because back in November, the government was announcing one day that medical marijuana could be smoked wherever they pleased, and then 24 hours later, with the backlash of the public, they decided they needed to take a second look at this. If the proper consultations were done previously into drafting Bill 45, we probably could have avoided that whole situation, avoided this bill being here, and we could have been either not discussing this bill and discussing something else that the people of the province want, or they could have brought this bill forward and, again, as I mentioned earlier, included some of the private member bills that have been waiting and waiting to be incorporated and put through this Legislature.", "Basically, this bill will prohibit the use of prescribed products and substances anywhere where tobacco is currently prohibited. It targets combustible materials. That’s not including e-cigarettes or vape products. That part was done in Bill 45, and the government is currently doing consultation on the regulations in Bill 45 with regard to vaping. I seriously hope they’re listening to the owners of vape businesses and trying to work with them to ensure that they don’t legislate this group out of business. I’d hate to see people having to purchase their vape products online from a vendor—who knows where the product is coming from?—or if they try to mechanically fix their vape product on their own, the chances of the device possibly exploding or other things. I think these people that run the vape products are trained to make sure that the product is operating properly, and I hope the government continues to work with this group as they develop the regulations.", "This bill amends other things as well. Section 10 of the original bill will be repealed. Section 10 states that a person who owns or occupies a place where the smoking of tobacco is prohibited must ensure that signs referring to the prohibition are posted in accordance with the regulations. They’ve reworded section 10 to expand this obligation to include signs referring to enforce the prohibittion and specify how an element of the offence can be proved in a prosecution.", "Subsection 14(2) of the bill is amended to specify that inspectors can enter places where the smoking of a prescribed product or substance is prohibited for the purpose of assessing compliance with the prohibition. Clauses 14(8)(f) and (g) of the original Smoke-Free Ontario Act are amended to specify that inspectors can issue compliance directives to employers and proprietors who fail to comply with their obligations under section 12.1.", "Section 15 of the original bill is amended to provide that each person who violates the no-smoking restrictions or the employer-proprietor obligations in section 12.1 is guilty of an offence and on conviction is liable to a maximum fine ranging from $250 to $5,000 for individuals and between $100,000 and $300,000 for corporations.", "Subsection 19(1) of the old bill is amended to authorize the Lieutenant Governor in Council to make certain regulations respecting prescribed products or substances, including regulations which specify how an offence for smoking a prescribed product or substance in a prohibited place can be proved in a prosecution.", "It’s a lot of words spoken, but basically it’s taking anything that is combustible and inhaled and ensuring that they follow the rules of the Smoke-Free Ontario Act much like they do with cigarettes. So whatever is coming down the line that enters into the marketplace can be dealt with at that time as opposed to having bill upon bill continually coming back, dealing with the same issue.", "This bill is also dealing with the medical marijuana usage that this government originally allowed in November and then turned around and changed their minds on because of the backlash and actually had a second to think about the issue. They stated that the exemption would include everything from movie theatres to restaurants, offices, stadiums, playgrounds and even here in the Ontario Legislature. They noted that employers, restaurant owners and other business owners could overrule these exemptions and cease medical marijuana use within these organizations. Business owners could also voice and demand some sort of verification if they’re allowing the smoking of medical marijuana on their properties. They tried to sneak that exemption through, since it only affected a limited amount of Ontarians. But reading the literature, there are about 23,000 Canadians who have prescriptions for medical marijuana, and even though the ministry claimed to have consulted prior to allowing this regulation, they had to consult again. Four months later, we have this new legislation, and it’s going to prohibit it in certain places where tobacco is prohibited.", "I think it’s a great idea. As I mentioned earlier about second-hand smoke from tobacco, I’m glad it’s moved far away. People have the right to smoke, and I agree with “You can do what you wish.” It’s not always good behaviour, but sometimes people use tobacco not only for enjoyment but also as medicinal to settle their nerves. I know of quite a few of my customers at my pharmacy who need to smoke. It helps relax them. Smoking also is important when you are quitting and you are on different types of medications, so always check with your pharmacy as you’re cutting back. Tobacco smoking can affect the metabolism of certain medications—not a lot of them, but certain ones—and if you decrease the amount you’re smoking, your metabolism is going to change and you might actually get an increase of the medication in your system. So if you are quitting smoking, which is a great idea, it would always link in with your pharmacist; there’s one at every corner of every street in this province, I believe. Work out a plan with them to ensure that your medications are adjusted and to also give you support as you decide to quit smoking.", "So back to the medical marijuana part of the issue, Mr. Speaker. Due to the second-hand smoke, I think it’s not in the public’s interest to have medical marijuana smoked wherever you please. I think there’s a time and a place to take your medication, and that’s what medical marijuana is: It’s a medication. It’s not something for pleasure; it’s something you’re needing to take to deal with a condition, the disease you may have. As such, as with any medication, there are side effects, and second-hand smoke from medical marijuana may not be beneficial for those others around you in the public.", "I think allowing them certain areas, which this bill will allow for them, to partake in their medication is better. I would imagine the majority of medical marijuana users would stay at home anyhow due to their condition. They could schedule their lives around taking their medication, much like other medication forms where people are scheduled taking their medication, ensuring that they’re not smoking in movie theatres or restaurants or wherever. It’s imperative that the public has an understanding and that those needing medical marijuana are smoking in the places that are prescribed for them.", "I mentioned Bill 45 earlier. Last year, when we had a discussion on Bill 45, the government targeted a number of things. One of them, which I mentioned earlier, was the Electronic Cigarettes Act. There were a number of amendments, which included: the prohibition of the sale of promotional items together with tobacco products; the sale of flavoured tobacco products; the list of places that an inspector is specifically empowered to enter was broadened; adjustments were made to the penalty and prohibition provisions; and the power to prescribe places for the purposes of the act was also amended to provide for exemptions.", "There were also a number of amendments to the Electronic Cigarettes Act, which included: the prohibition of the sale and supply of electronic cigarettes to persons under the age of 19; restrictions were placed on the display and promotion of electronic cigarettes; the sale of electronic cigarettes in certain places was prohibited; a provision was made for regulating packaging of electronic cigarettes and for regulating the sale of flavoured electronic cigarettes; the use of electronic cigarettes becomes prohibited in enclosed work spaces and enclosed public spaces; and the amendments that are outlined in Bill 178 should have been included at the same time they did this.", "I’ve spoken to a couple of owners of shops in my riding, and they’re for limiting the sale of electronic cigarettes and ensuring that youth don’t get access to these products. Their concern is—and I know the government is consulting with them; I hope they’re listening to them—the vape device that they utilize: (1) They have to teach people how to use it properly, so they have to turn it on, and (2) when they have to fix it, they have to have the ability to turn it on. Right now, where they’re leaning with the regulations, that might be banned for them to do so inside their shop.", "I’m hoping there’s a workaround somewhere along the line that’s not going to be too expensive to the owners of the shops which allows them the ability to turn on the device in order to teach someone how to use it and/or fix the product. The simple solution of sending them outside isn’t going to do. It’s ridiculous, especially when we have our cold winter days or it’s raining; it’s just not feasible. You can’t really ask a business to do that.", "They sat down and they showed me their business and what they go through to help people quit smoking. That’s the main use of these electronic cigarettes: It gets people off the nicotine and tobacco product to a straight nicotine product, and then they can wean themselves off. It’s much like the patch that you have in pharmacies or the inhaler device. You’re transferring from the actual cigarette to a product that doesn’t have all the cancer-causing agents in it that you’re inhaling. You’re cut down to the nicotine in some sort of solution, probably a water base, that you inhale, and you can slowly cut down your dosage. It’s much like the patch. Quite often in the pharmacy, I’ve seen people have to try quitting numerous times before they’re successful. It’s a tough go. Tobacco is quite addictive; it’s quite hard to get off.", "The pages here—hopefully you haven’t started smoking yet. I would suggest not even trying it, staying away from it. When you talk to anybody who has smoked for a long time, they always regret starting. So to avoid that regret, do something else with your time. Stay away from tobacco products.", "The fact that these devices help people quit smoking is a reason why the government needs to work with these places to ensure that they’re able to continue their business and ensure that the devices are safe and the people utilizing them understand their use. It’s not a complex tool, but the different advantages of using it need to be shown.", "That was in Bill 45, and as I said, this Bill 178 is making up for the fact that what’s in Bill 178 was missed in Bill 45 due to the rush.", "I think the other thing that could have been placed in Bill 178 is the whole issue of contraband tobacco. It’s something that, for some reason, the government doesn’t seem to want to deal with. If you look at the charts, the smoking rates are decreasing, but I think if you went and looked at contraband tobacco sales, they’re increasing. Unfortunately, I think they’ve just switched. The sad part is that we get a lot of tax dollars from tobacco sales that this government needs. They overspend, so they need to make up for that money they’ve overspent. That money is just going to the illegal tobacco trade.", "Interjection." ],

  "text" : [ "We’re just showing you how to spend the money that you have.", "Anyway, so this illegal tobacco trade is flourishing. Anybody in the riding probably sees it day to day. People talk about it openly and the fact that they all access their cheap cigarettes. It’s unfortunate. This was another opportune time. They had a bill which was basically saying, “We’re going to treat anything that comes out like cigarettes, like cigarettes, and make sure we don’t have to deal with it in this bill.” So it’s not a complex bill that we’re debating here, but it was an opportunity to include other things.", "I’ve mentioned Kathryn McGarry’s law, the Lung Health Act, the radon law that we could have added in, but contraband cigarettes are something we could have totally tackled in order to crack down on not only the illegal situation that has grown in the province but also decreasing the harmful risk of smoking within our province.", "Tobacco claims too many lives: 13,000 Ontarians die every year due to tobacco. That’s about 36 people a day. I think everyone probably has a story of someone who got lung cancer somewhere along the line in their family and passed away too early. My uncle Lou died when he was 69. My grandparents lived into their nineties. You just think, if he had the same lifespan, he died 30 years before he should have. He quit smoking. He quit smoking the day after he found out he had lung cancer. That’s too bad.", "So I think there’s something we can do, not only in the normal marketplace but with the illegal trade going on with the contrabands. We need to do better. We have the power here at the Legislature to create rules and regulations to clamp down on the illegal activity which is leading to people’s ill health instead of sitting back and ignoring it. The member from Prince Edward–Hastings—usually behind me, but to my back left; now he’s behind me. He has a great bill out there to help start dealing with contraband cigarettes, and I do have some notes on that; I’ll have to get to that. I will get to the member from Prince Edward–Hastings in a minute, his bill. Anyway, it’s a great bill that he has brought forward, a private member’s bill. It’s another bill we could have incorporated in this bill at the same time.", "But back to contraband, in some areas they estimate that up to 50% of sales are due to contraband; the average is about 33%, which is quite a few. That’s pretty close to one in three cigarette purchases being purchased illegally in Ontario. By comparison, British Columbia is 17%, Manitoba is 15%, Saskatchewan is 11%. That Brad Wall does things well for his province. Quebec has seen great improvements since their police force was given the authority to investigate, seize and restrict cigarette manufacturing equipment in vehicles.", "Many argue that the illegal industry that occurs within the province of Ontario is the worst in the western world. We bring forth legislation continually to raise taxes on the legal products, and that’s the deterrence. Unfortunately, the illegal trade, which does not pay any taxes, is increasing. So I think we can do better in the province. We can do better to deal with the illegal manufacturers, the illegal smugglers and the illegal dealers of contraband cigarettes.", "As I mentioned earlier, the MPP for Prince Edward–Hastings and my colleague from Haldimand–Norfolk, Toby Barrett, our ag critic, also brought forth legislation hoping to deal with contraband tobacco and accessing this illegal product.", "If the government really wanted to get to the root of the problem, they could have done things for the last 13 years that they’ve been in power. You can’t hold on to the old argument of previous governments when you’ve been in power for 13 years. You had 13 years to fix everything that you argue and complain about. So if you haven’t fixed it, you obviously agree with what the previous governments have done.", "In November of this past year, the member for Prince Edward–Hastings, Todd Smith, brought in Bill 139, An Act to amend the Smoke-Free Ontario Act and the Tobacco Tax Act. It was a great bill. I sat in on one of his meetings he had with some public health representatives, and it was a great meeting. The bill targets contraband tobacco and the sale focused on children. It amends the Smoke-Free Ontario Act to require the government to establish a public education program about the public health risks associated with the use of tobacco. It includes amendments to include the prohibition of the sale of tobacco in public and private schools. And the fines to those presenting illegal age identification and those convicted of selling tobacco in designated spaces are increased.", "I know the health inspectors throughout the province are usually designated to ensure that businesses selling cigarettes are selling them to people who are of age. They do a good job, because we get calls at the office saying, “They tricked us. They didn’t look that age to ask if they’re 25 or under.” It’s not going to be 100% across the board, and some health inspectors will be overzealous, but the majority of them do their job.", "When you have contraband cigarettes, you don’t have those inspectors out there ensuring that those people aren’t selling to minors. The way I figure it, if you’re selling tobacco illegally, you don’t really care who you’re selling it to. You just want the money. That’s why you’re doing it. Unfortunately, too many of our kids are having access to these illegal products, and this is the time to step forward. Any time is the time to step forward for this government, but every time we’re not always having discussions on the tobacco act. That doesn’t happen too often, unless, of course, they devise a bill and forget to implement some of the ideas and have to come back with another one. I think when they come back with the other one they should be implementing ideas to decrease the illegal trade that’s occurring in our province.", "Under Todd Smith’s bill, the Tobacco Tax Act is amended to permit the minister to share the proceeds of forfeited property with police forces that assist in investigations that lead to the forfeiture. I think municipalities would be happy with that; I think they’re stretched on their own budgets. I believe that anything to help out their budgets with regard to their emergency services and the police is a benefit.", "The bill also says that the costs incurred by a police force or the crown to remove, store or dispose of a vehicle under section 24 of the act are a debt due to the police force or the crown and may be recovered in court. Again, the cost of dealing with illegal contraband trade can be dealt with by the police force.", "In his bill, enforcement powers are also expanded to include police officers, in addition to the existing persons authorized under the ministry, relating to unmarked tobacco products. Increases are made in the penalties that apply to offences relating to interjurisdictional importers, the manufacturing of tobacco products, the possession of unmarked cigarettes, and the purchase or receipt of marked or unmarked cigarettes for resale.", "Finally, a person’s driver’s licence may be suspended if he or she uses a motor vehicle in the commission of certain offences. Suspension periods are also increased. I think that’s a good deterrent. Nobody wants to lose their independence with driving. We see it time and again with our seniors who hit 80 years old and have to do that test. They get fearful because driving is their mode of transportation, especially in rural Ontario. We don’t have the buses; we don’t have the taxi services that are in large urban areas. In rural Ontario, we have the car. We have bicycles, but usually when you hit 80—there are fewer and fewer riding bicycles at 80, and when winter hits, you need your car.", "I’ve been trying to push. I haven’t been mean about it, but I’m gently pushing my local Ministry of Transportation in London. Right now, our seniors in Elgin county have to drive to London to do the written test and the eye test. I was able to locate a spot, free of charge to the ministry, in St. Thomas—which my seniors have been asking for around the whole area—where maybe once a month we could get the ministry to schedule some test dates; not the driving—that’s another ball of wax—but the actual written test and the eye test. I’m getting, “No,” but I find that if you keep asking, perhaps down the road we’ll see some changes and some benefits back into the St. Thomas area. A lot of government services have been moved out for one reason or another, but we in St. Thomas and Elgin county do need access to government services. We have the need. We have a high seniors’ population.", "Sorry I went off on that commercial break. Anyway, suspending driver licences is a good tactic.", "It’s quite clear that contraband tobacco is causing an uproar in our schools. Too many children are getting access to illegal cigarettes. I hope the government will support the member from Prince Edward–Hastings’s bill. There was a time when they could incorporate it into this bill. Maybe at committee we could offer to incorporate this bill into Bill 178.", "I mentioned earlier that Toby Barrett, Haldimand–Norfolk, has Bill 162 on the table as well, which is going to tackle the illegal trade. It’s important that all these bills that have been put forward are dealing with lung health and how chronic lung disease is debilitating. It’s something we could work on together to ensure that people, especially youth, have limited access to illegal products—have no access to illegal products. That would be the goal. That’s never going to happen; I get that. But for our government to ignore the situation isn’t going to make it better. It’s going to ensure that people have access to illegal product. It’s going to hook people on smoking—our younger kids—and it’s going to deny access to tax revenue that this government needs and it’s going to increase lung disease.", "They talk a great game at reducing smog. Elizabeth Witmer shut down the first coal plant. They followed up and shut down the rest, and smog alerts are gone. It’s great, but they’re doing nothing about contraband cigarettes, which are on the rise, which are causing more damage to the lungs of our youth and our adults, which are causing an increase in the health care system at the end of the day when people end up with lung cancer, which is on the rise, or other lung effects, like asthma. The use of medication is going to grow and the access to doctors is going to grow.", "We spend $52 billion on the health care system each year—it grows. They’ve rationed the health care system, and we’ve had—this government has stepped forward and is starting rationing health care in the system. They cut doctors by $800 million. People’s access to health care is decreased. They froze funding at hospitals for four years. There are fewer beds and long waits. They can’t fix it within a year. They throw in the 1% but they pull out $100 million from the lottery fund going to hospitals. We’ve seen a lot of services cut and we’ve seen a lot of health care professionals lose their jobs.", "You look at contraband cigarettes and you could do something about that to decrease the amount of people who, down the road, are going to need the health care system, which is 140,000 new people each year into the system. We have a growing demographic who are going to utilize the health care system. Why not do stuff or take steps outside of the health care system to cut down on future costs in the health care system by tackling illegal contraband cigarettes?", "I think that’s a great step the government could use. The money they could save—fewer people getting diagnosed with lung diseases, but also the increased revenue in the taxes could be filtered into the health care system and ensure that proper funding is occurring throughout Ontario instead of the rationing we see day in and day out, leading to emergency room crisis. I’m sure, Speaker, in your office, you have people calling up.", "I had a lady call up the office. Her daughter has dual diagnosis and was in crisis. They ended up putting her into a regular hospital bed, so she’s not getting the services she needs. There’s a bed waiting for her in London, but she’s got to wait two years to get to it—two years. Someday, we’ll start treating mental health like physical health and ensure quicker response times, that the beds are there when you need them. But at the same time, physical health is on the decline in the province. I mentioned earlier that in January, February and March, if you wanted knee or hip replacement surgery, you couldn’t access that in Woodstock, Strathroy, London or St. Thomas. They ran out of money. Unfortunately, the seniors who paid taxes their whole lives for a health care system they wanted access to when they needed it—they need to access it now and they can’t. They’re sitting at home and suffering. Sitting in one place too long is not healthy. They decline in health and they withdraw from social activities because it’s just too painful to leave their house.", "I think it’s prudent of this government, when you can capitalize on opportunities to save the health care system money by doing things outside of the health care system, such as tackling contraband cigarette sales and reducing the chances of lung disease—or, if you don’t want to go that far, because I know this government doesn’t want to deal with contraband cigarette sales, maybe incorporating other bills like the member from Cambridge’s, Etobicoke North, the member from Prince Edward–Hastings or Haldimand–Norfolk into a makeup bill, which this really is.", "This bill is purely here because Bill 45 was rushed, there was no consultation and they missed this. We mentioned that at committee, that when you rush a bill, you miss things. I’m glad they’re fixing their mistake; however, I always look at how we can fix a mistake and utilize what’s in front of us to push legislation through that’s sitting in the committee room or waiting for second reading at the Legislature, because there are good ideas on both sides of the House. There’s a lot on this side of the House that the government can utilize. I mentioned Sarnia–Lambton’s Bob Bailey’s tax credit bill for agriculture. They did utilize that bill.", "Anyway, those are my main comments on Bill 178. I think the medical marijuana issue is going to be probably key to discussion going forward. There’s a certain organization that thinks that they should be allowed to be wherever they want with it. I think that, with the consequences of the second-hand smoke from medical marijuana, we have to ensure that it’s removed a distance from the public. I guess this bill, when it’s in place, will ensure that new items that come down the line somewhere in the future of I guess research and development, that people who would like to partake in smoking will be covered under this bill. I hope there’s a way to work the regulations out that kind of is one-size-fits-all in these bills. I would hate if, 15 years down the road, if other things have gone to market, businesses have to put up five different signs for the different items that are on there, because then you get the sign traffic and you ignore it all. Your mind just blocks it out. It’s much like the billboards on the highways. I don’t see them anymore. I do see the speed limits. I do monitor the speed limits, in case anyone’s watching or listening." ],

It also notes that Bill 139 has been endorsed by the Canadian Cancer Society, the Heart and Stroke Foundation and the Ontario Campaign for Action on Tobacco, so I want to commend our member from Prince Edward–Hastings.", "The health board in our area also points out that the number of daily and occasional smokers in the North Bay Parry Sound District Health Unit area is 7% higher than the provincial average, which underscores my concern in my riding.

These things should be done before a bill comes to this House.", "Now we’re debating this bill, which is needed, addressing a need that the public has asked for. People don’t want vaping anywhere and everywhere. It talks about vaping in a car, prescribed products in your car and prescribed products in employment. There is a part in here, though, that’s an exemption for prescribed products in scientific research and testing facilities. That makes sense; we have to know what kind of effects these products are having on people’s health.", "It’s symptomatic of putting legislation through in this House, time-allocating things and rushing through without getting fulsome debate on legislation. I’m glad the government finally listened in this case and we’re talking about it today." ],

The member from Etobicoke Centre said this is common sense. Yes, it is common sense, and it was common sense to have been put in Bill 45. They rushed it. They made a mistake. They made a mistake with medical marijuana. They’re making up for it—I get it—but at the same time, why not incorporate one of the other bills that are sitting here that’s going to deal with lung health and/or smoking, get that bill off the table and start dealing with other problems in this province?", "The member from Prince Edward–Hastings’s bill to do with contraband cigarettes, especially those sold to our youth, is an excellent bill to put forward. On the other side of the House, the member from Cambridge: The Lung Health Act would be great to add in here. Unfortunately, they rushed to rush the bill. They came forward to fix it, and they’re rushing again and aren’t taking the time and opportunity to have a real common sense bill in the Legislature here to deal with more than just one fixer-up item.", "They embarrassed themselves; they made a mistake. They’re paying for it right now, because the opposition is going to hit them on this, as we should. We should point out that the incompetence in some of these ministries is unfortunate, and the people who pay for it are Ontarians. And because we’re not dealing with contraband cigarettes in this province, our health care costs are going to increase, our youth are put at risk and there’s quite a bit of tax revenue from the legal sale of cigarettes that we’re missing out on. We know this government needs that money, because why else would you sell Hydro One if you weren’t desperate for cash? There’s no other reason for that." ],

It’s a small bill, an important piece of the legislation that was missed, unfortunately, in Bill 45, so I’m happy to have a few minutes. I have to say that I’m pleased I don’t have the same hour that the member before me did, because it’s a pretty thin bill. But like I said, it’s important.", "Currently, the Smoke-Free Ontario Act applies to tobacco products only, so Bill 178 will extend the application of the act to include prescribed products and substances, so prescribed in cabinet by regulation. This is a legislative framework that will allow medical marijuana use to be governed by the same no-smoking law that currently applies to tobacco. That’s an important piece, Speaker.", "As we know, as we’re moving into a future where we know that medical marijuana is sometimes a better choice than narcotics, especially very highly addictive narcotics, we need to have things in place to ensure that we have a safe public, that we have responsibilities, that we have laws around how medical marijuana could be used. Personally, I would prefer to see people with medical marijuana than to be using very highly addictive drugs that we’ve seen many of our citizens in this province fall fate to. It’s through no fault of their own that they’ve become addicted to these narcotics that are prescribed to them by their doctor, but there is also no real plan of getting them off those drugs because they become highly addicted and then are turning to methadone programs.", "That is an unfortunate reality that we’re faced with here in the province of Ontario. We see many, many folks who would not typically fall into the drug addiction realm of their lives and never would be expected to be there, but because they’ve been prescribed very heavy, hard narcotics, they are now finding themselves faced with addictions and with family members, quite frankly, who don’t know how to deal with it. This, I think, will help along the framework of medical marijuana being used for pain control, and I’m fully in favour of that.", "I’m happy to see that we have legislation that will now create a better environment and put rules in place so people will know the limits, because nobody wants to be sitting in a restaurant these days with somebody smoking beside them, regardless of what it is, whether it’s for medical purposes or not. We know that not so many years ago, really, people were smoking in restaurants and bars on a regular basis. They were smoking here. I wonder where the ashtrays attached to our desks, because you can be sure that they were smoking cigarettes sitting in this very seat, in this very Legislature." ],

It has become something that people can count on now or try to lean on to try to quit smoking. Vapers are becoming the new norm. We need to make sure that we have rules in place, whether it’s for vaping for nicotine or vaping to not have the nicotine but giving you the sensation and the pleasure of smoking to help you quit smoking or whether it’s vaping medical marijuana—we need to make sure that we are responsible for society and that we put plans in place to make sure that it’s done responsibly.", "It’s really unfortunate that the government missed the boat on this in Bill 45, because I know there would have been great legislation that we could have been talking about today instead of dealing with this very small bill, but a very important piece.

People are struggling right across this province, but I have to say that in the north, it is different. In the north, we have a patchwork system where services, if provided, are provided in silos across ministries and governments, with huge gaping holes left in between.", "There are wait-lists so long for children who have experienced trauma that it effectively shuts the door to effective treatment and traps them into a lifetime of suffering.

Autism care is limited and all children with special needs in the far north are either left to the wayside or removed from their community.

Another nurse spoke about how it wears on her soul.", "Speaker, we live in a prosperous province and we are all Ontarians.

Simply put, our transformation is about putting the correctional part back in correctional services.", "We also know that our correctional services staff, including our correctional officers and probation and parole officers, are the backbone of our correctional system. I have had the honour and privilege as minister to tour correctional institutions in our province and have seen the incredible job that our corrections staff do on a daily basis to keep inmates, our institutions and our communities safe.", "Our government also recognizes that hiring additional correctional officers must be the first step in this transformation. That work is already under way. In fact, we have already hired 710 new correctional officers since 2013, and we are just getting started.", "Earlier this week, I was proud to visit the Ontario Correctional Services College in Hamilton and meet the newest group of 140 correctional officer recruits. Seeing these new recruits prepare for their future is always an inspiring sight. These men and women have chosen to dedicate their careers to keeping our communities safe. They will bring professionalism, commitment and passion to their work, and we need more just like them.", "While I was there, Speaker, I was pleased to announce our new correctional officer recruitment and training strategy. Under this plan, we will be hiring 2,000 new correctional officers over the next three years. Each and every one of these new correctional officers represents a strong correctional system, more effective rehabilitative programming and enhanced mental health supports. And they will be a reflection of Ontario itself, because we know that the best path to reach out to an offender in our custody—and to be seen as a role model—is for front-line employees to represent and understand Ontario’s diverse population.", "We will also address cultural shifts in the inmate population, including the unique needs of female and aboriginal communities.", "All new correctional officer recruits go through a thorough assessment process and must successfully complete a rigorous eight-week training program before being deployed to one of our correctional facilities. Those eight weeks include vital mental health training and inmate management techniques. The education of all correctional officers continues with ongoing job training throughout their professional careers. This is how we ensure that Ontario has the best of the best serving our communities by meeting the complex needs of inmates on the front line.", "I was also pleased to announce the next intake of 17 new probation and parole officers that will start on April 4, because we know the vital role our probation and parole officers play in helping turn people’s lives around and providing them with hope, opportunity and a chance to be a part of building an even safer place to call home.", "Hiring 2,000 new correctional officers, in addition to the 710 we have already hired since 2013, is central to the government’s transformation of Ontario’s correctional system—to upgrade correctional facilities, increase staff and inmate safety, improve rehabilitation and community reintegration programs, enhance mental health supports, and significantly reduce the potential for inmates to reoffend.", "Speaker, I am proud of these efforts, and I ask that members of this House recognize the tremendous job being done by our correctional, probation and parole officers, and welcome those who are training to follow in their footsteps." ],

We need additional staff now, not in three years. A staggering number of lockdowns have occurred due to chronic understaffing of correctional services. Not only does this abuse the basic human rights of inmates, many of whom have yet to be sentenced, but it also jeopardizes the health and safety of officers dealing with agitated inmate populations while being short-staffed.", "For too long, our correctional officers have been faced with the challenge of heading out the door in the morning without knowing if they will return at the end of the day.

But until trust can be restored between correctional staff and the ministry, the crisis in corrections will continue. It will be a long journey for the government to regain the lost trust of its correctional staff, but on behalf of the entire PC caucus, we will be there every step of the way to ensure that commitments are honoured and that the crisis in corrections is fully and properly addressed." ],

A responsible employer would make sure staffing levels are appropriate as officers and managers leave the job or retire. All jails need to re-evaluate their base staffing needs—managers and officers—and ensure that the levels meet the workload demand and specific needs of each jail or facility.", "Workload and caseload issues need attention. Probation and parole officers in Ontario have the highest caseloads in Canada.

This is a government that piles and piles on the stress and casework but does nothing to ensure the system works well.", "During Bill 163 submissions, it became clear to me that this ministry doesn’t seem to know what the job actually entails. Perhaps as part of the system transformation, the government can figure that out.", "Remember that almost everyone who goes into our provincial jails comes out and tries to reintegrate into our communities. We want that to be successful. We want them not to reoffend. We don’t want them to come out worse than they went in, but they are. Things are so bad that judges are reducing sentences because of the harsh and punishing conditions.", "Speaker, we read about deaths, violence and overdoses on a regular basis in our jails. Correctional officers and inmates are suffering the effects of a violent and unsafe environment. At Bill 163 hearings, we learned about the devastating effects of PTSD on our first responders, but don’t forget the inmates, who live under constant threat of violence and trauma and then have to successfully reintegrate into our neighbourhoods.", "This is a terrible situation. But the government can do something about it. For over a year, there has been a body scanner pilot project at Toronto South Detention Centre. Metal detectors don’t pick up drugs, lighter flints or ceramic knives. Our jails are full of weapons and drugs, Speaker. I’ve seen a body scanner scan that showed a lighter and a three-inch ceramic blade carefully smuggled inside someone’s person. Body scanners are necessary. They would keep weapons and drugs out of our facilities.", "The minister has my letter asking for timelines and formal commitment on body scanners and metal detectors in P&P offices; I’m looking forward to the reply. Officers need the appropriate tools to keep up with the threat. So, Minister, is safety going to be part of this transformation?", "Officers also need current and effective training: suicide awareness, CPR, first aid, mental health, breathing apparatus, community escort, and the list goes on. Training may not be transformative or shiny and new, but it is necessary. Cut a training ribbon if you need to, but get the expired training up to date across the province.", "Our jails are not silos. They are part of our society and social systems. When this government eviscerates our health care system and shuts down psychiatric beds in our communities, like another 25 beds in North Bay, those who struggle the most with mental health are the most vulnerable and they often find themselves on our streets and, more often than not, in our justice and correctional systems. Jails are not appropriate places for our mentally ill community members. They’re unsafe and they deserve appropriate care in our communities so that they don’t end up warehoused or segregated in our jails.", "We do need to have a very real conversation about segregation. This government can’t point at the inappropriate or problematic use of isolation without pointing at itself. When they have closed the beds and cut supports, they have to take responsibility for the consequences. Isolation exacerbates mental health issues, but many mentally ill inmates would be in very real physical danger if they were in the general population. So what’s the solution? The answer isn’t in our jails. What will this government do to fix the problem that they have worked so quietly to create? Cutting psychiatric services doesn’t get rid of the problem; it just locks it away.", "A careful look at our justice system and the process has to happen. As the minister talked about, inmates across our jails are on remand in massive numbers. A re-evaluation and close look at our bail system clearly has to happen, but those pieces fit with the others that I’ve discussed.", "Actions have consequences, but so does inaction. As this government is realizing, this government can talk all day about transformation and rehabilitation, but it doesn’t matter if they don’t address the foundational issues. Nothing secure can be built if we don’t make sure that we have a solid foundation." ],

It took 137 years to get there. This government has doubled that debt in 10 years, and now it will rise to $308 billion after 13 years. That’s unconscionable, the debt—the burden—that they’ve put on families. They have a Supply Act asking us to approve their money. Are you kidding? Not a chance, when they have proved that they cannot manage the money that the taxpayers give them. It is absolutely unconscionable that they do that.", "Let’s talk about some of the things that they’re doing in this budget and where they’re getting this money that they want to spend. Of course, they’ve gone to the usual sources: the sin taxes, the alcohol and tobacco taxes. They’ve done that. It’s kind of an interesting thing how, during the last budget, they decided to sell Hydro One. One of the most heinous things that they did was put Hydro One up for sale, but again, under the guise that it will be used for transit. We now know—and it has been proven by all financial institutions, and in fact the media have finally started suggesting—the actual fact from the Financial Accountability Officer that the money is going to artificially balance their deficit for two years.", "The accountability officer has warned us that when that charade is over two years from now, and we no longer have that money coming in, the deficit will go right back up, because we have a structural deficit in this province. That’s why the people will not approve of this Supply Act: because they have a structural deficit. That means it’s built in; it’s baked in. Their spending is higher than the revenue that they’re receiving.", "They’re going to mask it for a couple of years with the sale of Hydro One—we’ve seen that—but that will end. The Financial Accountability Officer has told us that that will end in two years. You’re going to have two years of pats on the back, and then, shortly thereafter—boom—you’re right back, because you have not resolved the structural deficit that this government has created.", "They’re doing the same thing now with the cap-and-trade tax. They are taking that money and they are putting it right into the general revenue. They will be using it—ostensibly using it—for all programs that are already approved and already budgeted for. This is simply going to replace money that’s already been committed. We’ve seen that; we now know that. We saw it in the actual bill. Schedule 1 of the bill itemizes the items that the money can be used for, and there it is, plain as day: vehicles, subways, subway vehicles as well—a list of everything that’s already in the budget. That’s why they have not increased the annual expenditure on infrastructure. They’re merely using that money to put it in infrastructure and the money that was already there will be coming out. That’s how they’re going to be balancing the budget, and that’s why we will never approve a supply bill from this particular government.", "If you look at some of the other things that they’re going to be doing, I talked about taking away the Children’s Activity Tax Credit. I mean, how low do you have to go? Let me add the next item: the Healthy Homes Renovation Tax Credit. I remember when they brought that in with great fanfare and how important it was and the photo ops. Boom, now it’s gone. They got their day in the sun out of it and now it’s gone. The child activity tax credit: Imagine that that’s where you have to go in the province of Ontario to dig away at those vital tax credits that were once in place.", "Of course, as we’ve said many, many times, if you look at page 191 and page 192 of the budget, you’ll see that they’re going to be increasing vehicle licensing—your vehicle licence, your driver’s licence itself—special event permits, hunting and fishing licences, camping in provincial parks. Again, they’re chipping away at the edges here. They’re literally looking through the couch for nickels and dimes to try to think, “How can we make up for our multibillion-dollar deficit and all the sins of the past?” They’re going to be making families, children and seniors pay for their waste, their mismanagement and their scandals. That’s exactly what this government is doing, and that’s just reprehensible.", "If you look very closely at the budget, you’re going to see what one of the results of this is. The Ministry of Finance themselves, in last year’s budget, projected that jobs will be created in Ontario: 93,000 jobs, they said, would be created in 2016. Because they’ve put all those punitive taxes on children, seniors, and families, because all of those tax credits are gone and all of those other fees are going up, this will take millions out of the economy. And because of that, their own Ministry of Finance now has readjusted their job forecast for this year, down from the 93,000 originally forecast to 78,000. Because costs are going to be going up, and people will not have the money to spend that they originally were going to have, businesses are going to suffer and they’re going to have layoffs and jobs will not be created. They’ve reduced their projection by 15,000 jobs. That is a number that’s in the budget. It’s not something we dispute. We agree that their punitive action is causing these job losses.", "In fact, they also took last year’s number, where they predicted a 1.3% increase in employment, and downgraded their own prediction to 1.1%. All of the added costs in this budget are going to reduce disposable income, they’re going to depress consumer spending and cost the people of Ontario jobs. That’s in their own document. That’s not something that we would argue. These are some of the reasons why we can never support this government’s supply bill.", "I think one of the most concerning items that we have is what they’ve done to the energy sector. We heard from the Auditor General just in December, where she told us that they could have put in the same amount of green energy that they have put in today if they hadn’t changed the contracts to this overly generous contract. We could have had the same amount of green energy for $9.2 billion less. Can you imagine what we could have done in the province of Ontario with this extra $9.2 billion? If I said “million” earlier, I apologize; it’s “billion.” This is the one that we hear most from people, their energy bills, where they just can’t seem to make it.", "I held a session in North Bay for seniors last week when I was home on constituency week, and Bonnie Beam was one of the seniors who came into my office. She told the media how she can only turn the heat on in her bathroom because the cost of hydro is, in her words, “astronomical.” That’s the only room she can afford to heat. She also told the media that her heat is turned off in the bedrooms. When the temperature drops below minus 30 degrees, she “might turn the heat on a little in the kitchen.”", "This is the Ontario that this government has created. It was not the Ontario they stepped into in 2003, when our debt-to-GDP was a respectable and admirable 27%. Today, it’s an embarrassing 40%. What that means in plain language is that we grew our expenses faster than the economy grew. Our debt grew because we spend more money than we take in. Our debt grew faster than the economy grew. Our debt-to-GDP skyrocketed to almost 40% today. That’s awful when you look at world standards and look what they inherited when they took office. Our debt-to-GDP was 27% and today it’s almost 40%. This is the mismanagement that I speak about.", "We talk about waste. You think of the smart meter program: $1 billion, they announced. Now it turns out, according to the Auditor General, it’s $2 billion and the things don’t work. They get no data coming in to help them make the decisions.", "They say, “Vic, what do you mean when you talk about waste, mismanagement and scandal?” I could look at just the energy sector alone and give you waste, mismanagement and scandal. Sadly, it’s now pervasive. It’s in every one of the ministries: SAMS, if you remember that scandal; the MaRS scandal; and, of course, the gas plant scandal, which some would call the mother of all scandals, but I’m not even sure that that is accurate.", "Speaker, I tell you, we bring these things out into this Legislature and talk about them, and we have to put up with the mocking and the huffing and the puffing and the eye-rolling, but I’ll tell you, I remember the day, standing here, when we asked the government, on the gas plant scandal—I’m talking about why the people don’t trust this government with their money. I remember, in the gas plant scandal, right—", "Interjections." ],

That just doesn’t seem right.” Our whole caucus got together and thought, “This can’t be practical.” So we all dug into this, and a lot of our staff dug into this. We began to put a series of numbers together.", "I remember getting the number; it was about $890 million, at the time that our party assembled that, in terms of the cost. I remember standing here in the Legislature and saying to the Premier, “We don’t believe the $40 million. In fact, our number today, with what we now know, is $890 million, but we think it’s going to go higher.” I remember saying, “It will cost more than $1 billion,” and I remember the laughter over there and the Inspector Clouseau lines and all the smug remarks that came from over there. I remember the Premier of the day saying, “Oh, now it’s $1 billion. Why not $2 billion? Why not $10 billion?”, and laughter. Of course, the Auditor General comes out and says that it’s $1.1 billion.", "This is exactly why we talk about waste, mismanagement and scandal. That’s all we seem to get from this government, and that is exactly why. We can stand here. We all have thick skins; we’re all elected. We can take the heckles and the barbs that come from the other side, but the people of Ontario have had enough. And the huffing—we can take that too. The people of Ontario are the ones who have had enough.", "Their huffing doesn’t cover over the fact that Bonnie Beam can only afford to heat her bathroom. She can’t turn the heat on in her bedrooms. That’s Bonnie—what she told the media last week. That’s the Ontario that we live in today: Families have to choose between whether to heat or eat. That’s unconscionable. And now, according to Debra Cooper Burger, families will have to make the decision of whether to eat or buy their medications. This is what it has come to in the province of Ontario. This is a terribly sad state of affairs, and that is why we will not support this government’s supply bill." ],

We’re talking about allowing the government to finish the damage from last year’s budget. Does anybody recall the title of last year’s budget? It was Building Ontario Up, and in parentheses it should have said “and selling it off piece by piece,” because last year is when they started the sale of Hydro One. I believe they’ve sold 15%. What makes that such a terrible mistake is that Hydro One actually brings revenue to the province. They’re selling off their own revenue tools. I’m a farmer, and that’s like selling the cows to pay for the feed, so you have no more cows left and you lose the farm. That’s pretty simple math. Why they’re doing that is to try to make it look like they’re going to balance the books. That’s the simple fact of the matter. They’re selling assets like Hydro One to make it look like they’re going to pay off the deficit.", "The electricity file in this province, for lack of a better word, is an incredible mess.", "I spend a lot of time in the House listening. I’m the whip, so I spend quite a bit of time in the House. Yesterday, I heard the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change, and I can’t remember what he was commenting on, but he was surprised because some of our comments—it seemed like we were living in a different province. Well, Speaker, I’m from northern Ontario, and a lot of times we feel like it’s a different province.", "I’ll give you some examples. I’m not sure that my daughter is going to appreciate me talking about her, but my daughter Steph works in northern Ontario. She and her partner have a condo in Etobicoke and they rent it out. In a casual conversation with her partner, R.J.—we were talking a couple of days ago about the hydro bill for the condo, and he was pleasantly surprised because they had leased it out and the hydro bill went down from $32 a month to $26. He was pleasantly surprised. We took a look at my hydro bill—granted, a condo is smaller than my house; I have a 1,200-square foot bungalow. I heat with wood, and my hydro bill is $250 a month. Why? It’s because of the delivery charge. Yet the Minister of Energy goes on and on about how we have the lowest hydro rates and blah blah blah. Well, do you know what? In northern Ontario, in rural Ontario, people are being driven out of their homes by energy costs. That isn’t the case, I’ve learned—because my daughter in Etobicoke certainly is not being driven out of her condo by energy costs. There’s a huge difference. Let’s say her condo is half the size of my house, so let’s double her bill: That’s 50 bucks, and that’s with heat. There’s something really, really wrong, Speaker. That’s why people are being driven out of rural Ontario. It doesn’t look like this government understands that, because we keep hearing things like “Well, no, we’ve got low energy costs, and we’ve got”—no, we don’t. When you take the overall bill—and don’t pick this and don’t pick that; take the bill, what people actually have to pay—it’s astronomical for people in rural Ontario. That’s the problem. That is the crux of the issue for energy costs. And that cascades over into businesses who want to create jobs in this province. It’s the same thing.", "But the example of my daughter’s condo and my house, when I heat with wood—and I make a good buck. I’m not complaining about my salary, but there are all kinds of people in my riding and throughout rural Ontario who live in an equivalent house to mine, who are happy to be able to make the payments on the house, and they cannot afford that.", "We look at what’s happening now with this budget. Take seniors’ prescription drug costs. They can say, “Well, there are so many hundred thousands who are going to benefit,” but the basic fact of the matter is that the majority are going to pay more, and a lot of those people can’t afford it because they’re right on the tipping point of how much that’s going to cost. This government can say we’re wrong, but that’s the fact of the matter from our perspective.", "It’s the same as what they’re telling us: “We’ve got the lowest hydro rates in all of”—and they named all the provinces this morning, and they named the states. Well, not for people in northern Ontario, I’m sorry. That, quite frankly, is not the truth.", "I’m trying to word this—" ],

I should make better notes like Vic here, but I’m kind of an off-the-cuff guy.", "We keep being told in the last budget, “We’re selling off Hydro One to build transit infrastructure.” Never has another government before built transit infrastructure. This is a whole new concept. Up until now, we’ve all been on dirt roads in Ontario, but that’s beside the point.", "But while we hear all this loud-and-proud about transit infrastructure—and we believe there should be more transit. I live here six months a year; I don’t begrudge people in the GTA that they need better transit. I don’t begrudge them a bit. But while we hear from the government, “You know what? We’re going to build transit infrastructure and that’s why we’re selling Hydro One,” you know what happens in my part of the world? You close transit infrastructure. You close bus stations. You cancel bus routes. You couldn’t cancel the train because you already did that.", "So again, what we feel in rural Ontario—specifically in northern Ontario—is much different from what we hear. That’s why people don’t believe, because they’ve been through this before. We’ve lived it. We hear one thing, but what we see and what we feel is totally the opposite.", "I’ll give you another example, Speaker. In the latest budget, we understand there’s going to be a tax as part of the carbon cap-and-trade—the word “scheme” comes to mind but I don’t want to call it a scheme. I want to call it something more dignified than a scheme, because we believe that there is an issue with carbon and that it has to be fixed. But the first part of that was a tax on gasoline. Great. You guys want to put a tax on gasoline. If we had options in rural Ontario other than taking the car—but we don’t. So, fine, the price of gas goes up to help with the carbon. Whether I agree or not, I can understand that part so far.", "But then there should be an offset for the people who are paying that extra. So the offset—what we hear right at the same time is an announcement of a $100-million program to help retrofit your home to use less energy, to create less carbon. Okay. The first thing that’s announced is that it’s going to be administered by Union Gas and Enbridge. You scratch your head and you say, “Okay, since a lot of people in rural Ontario aren’t connected to Union or Enbridge, how are they going to access this program?” To our way of thinking, basically, they’re not.", "When we brought this to the government, it was, “No, no, you guys don’t know what you’re talking about. This program is accessible to everyone.” Our reaction was, “How?” If you’re a customer of Enbridge or Union, you would likely get a little thing along with your statement: “Here’s this program and here’s how to apply.” So if you buy propane from, in my riding, Grant Propane, or if you burn wood or burn oil, how do you make that connection?", "The President of the Treasury Board says, “No, John, you’re wrong. It’s accessible to everybody.” I said, “Well, how? Are you going to put an ad in the local paper? How are you going to make this program accessible?” Her response was, “Well, you know, maybe we’ll have to work on that a bit.” “Okay. I’m willing to live with that.”", "I get a call from someone in my riding who is a customer of Union Gas and who contacted Union Gas and wanted to participate in the program. The response from Union Gas is, “Well, currently, we don’t really have people in your neck of the woods”—they didn’t use those words—“in your area who can actually make this come to fruition.” So even the Union Gas customer can’t access the program.", "So I go again to the President of the Treasury Board and make her aware of this, and she said, “That’s because we just announced this program and we don’t really have the details yet on how it’s going to work.” Well, you have the details on how much it’s going to cost for the extra gas; why can’t you have the details on the other side? People are already—whenever this is going to come in, August 1—people know how much more it’s going to cost them to get to work. In my part of the world, you can’t take a train. You can’t take a bus. Eight months of the year, you can’t take a bicycle. So we know we’re going to be paying more money to go anywhere.", "But, on the flip side, well, que sera, sera; it’s coming. The program is coming. That is what scares people. Specifically, and I’m speaking for rural Ontario right now, it frightens us, because we’ve seen other things that were coming down the pipe.", "For this carbon thing to work, there has to be a cost. There’s going to be a cost, but there has to be a benefit for people to buy in. If you’re just going to shake people down for more money, without them seeing any benefit, it’s not going to be successful. In the end, we can disagree totally on how to do things but I truly believe that all of us in this House want the province to be successful and want all the people in this province to actually feel like they’re part of the province. Right now, Speaker, in my part of the world, people don’t feel like they’re part of the province. When they hear that our energy costs are low, when we hear that we’re building all kinds of transit, and when we hear those things—" ],

Down here, she had the option of using public transportation. She laments about the price of gas because she has to drive to work. Again, we’re going to put the price of gas up or the price of home heating up to help with the carbon issue. One of the ways it can help, if you put the price of something up, is people will naturally try to find alternatives to use less. That’s one of the ways to do it. But if there are no alternatives and if the programs that are announced aren’t fully developed, or, quite frankly, aren’t developed enough to be believable—I got another quote from the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change yesterday. He said in one of his comments that every single building in Ontario is going to be retrofitted as part of this. Our question is, how and when? Because, again, we’re going to be paying the bill for the gas. We’re already paying the bill for the electricity. But we hear “every single building.” Well, a lot of my constituents won’t be able to afford to pay the bills. The house will be long gone before this kicks in.

There were a number of people who came to offer me advice. One of them was a constituent. She came up and she said, “No matter what you do when you get elected, never forget that you’re there to improve the quality of life of the people of Ontario. Never forget that, that that’s why you’re there. That should always be your focus.”", "I think of that today, because to me, this is what the Supply Act is about. The Supply Act is really about ensuring that we can continue to make those investments that will allow us to continue to improve the quality of life of the people of Ontario and the people in my community of Etobicoke Centre.", "For those watching at home who aren’t as familiar, the Supply Act is one of the key acts in the Ontario Legislature. If passed, it would give the Ontario government the legal spending authority to finance its programs and honour its commitments. Passage of the Supply Act would constitute final approval by this assembly of government and legislative office program spending for the fiscal year that is coming up at the end of March, in fact on March 31.", "It’s important to note that the Supply Act does not authorize any new expenditures. I think some of the members opposite were talking about forward-looking expenditures. The Supply Act actually isn’t about forward-looking expenditures; it’s about the expenditures for this current fiscal year that’s ending on March 31.", "All expenditures incurred under the Supply Act would be in accordance with the 2015-16 estimates. The estimates set out a comprehensive account of the government’s intended expenditures for the fiscal year and include details of the spending plans that were presented in our 2015 budget.", "To recap, last week the Legislature gave its concurrence to the estimates for fiscal 2015-16—that’s the year that’s ending on March 31—and in doing so, it approved the estimates of seven ministries and offices that were selected for review by the Standing Committee on Estimates. The estimates for ministries that were not called to the standing committee and all legislative offices received what’s called “deemed concurrence.”", "Today, as we near the end of this fiscal year, we are discussing the Supply Act. It provides the necessary legal spending authority for vital payments made to institutions and individuals—for example, institutions such as hospitals, schools, municipalities; people who are vulnerable who need our help. To stress, this is not about approving new spending; it’s about providing authority for the government to finance its programs and honour its commitments. It’s about approving spending on important priorities like schools, hospitals and income support, items that benefit the lives of people across Ontario, benefits that improve people’s quality of life.", "When I introduced the concurrence in estimates to this House, I spoke about how Ontario is well on its way to balancing the budget in a fair and responsible way by 2017-18. Today, what I’d like to do is to talk about some of the achievements of this past fiscal year to help provide context for this discussion as it ties in with the Supply Act.", "For context, Ontario has taken great strides since the 2009 global economic downturn, which had a devastating impact on people and governments worldwide. I want to reiterate that our government is committed to balancing the budget by 2017-18 in a fair and responsible way. Our plan to balance the budget is focused on managing growth and spending, delivering on the best possible value for every dollar and improving outcomes for people with every dollar that we spend.", "When I ran for office in Etobicoke Centre, one of the things that I committed to my constituents was that if I was elected, I would bring my experience as a businessperson, as someone who has taught at a business school at York University, who has been a management consultant, to help our government achieve that goal, to make sure that we manage growth and spending, that we get value for the dollar and that we improve outcomes for people. That’s exactly what our government is doing.", "The 2014-15 deficit was $10.3 billion, down $2.2 billion from the 2014 budget projection of $12.5 billion. This has marked the sixth year in a row that Ontario beat its deficit target. In the 2015 Ontario economic outlook and fiscal review, we projected lower deficits of $7.5 billion in 2015-16, $4.5 billion in 2016-17 and a return to balance in 2017-18. That is largely due to diligent management of growth and spending.", "Ontario consistently has the lowest per capita program spending among all Canadian provinces. We have done this while continuing to invest in priority programs and services like health care and education.", "The member for Nipissing spoke during his remarks about where he thought we were getting the savings; I think those were the words he used, more or less. Unfortunately, these are just not—what he said were simply not the facts. He doesn’t have his facts straight in terms of how we’re going about managing spending and balancing the budget.", "We are not going to balance the budget by making across-the-board cuts, and we’re not doing that. We’re going to do it by doing government differently, by finding new and smarter ways of doing things to improve outcomes and deliver the best value for Ontarians. We’re doing that through something called Program Review, Renewal and Transformation, or PRRT for short.", "I’m proud to work alongside our President of the Treasury Board, Minister Deb Matthews, and the rest of the team at the Treasury Board—and, frankly, our entire caucus, who works on this every day—in terms of making sure that we spend our money wisely and get value for dollars. But specifically, I’m pleased to work with Minister Matthews on PRRT, where we are looking at how every dollar across government is spent and we’re using evidence to improve better choices and to improve outcomes for people.", "At a high level, I’d like to describe what we’re doing. We are asking the following questions about each program and service: Is it relevant? Is it effective? Is it efficient? Is it sustainable? We’re moving forward with opportunities that improve efficiency, reduce overlap across government programs and ensure government works better for Ontarians. We’re being responsible.", "The member for Nipissing talked about how he believes we should work towards a balanced budget, how we should manage the taxpayer dollars. Frankly, Speaker, when the PCs were in power, they had record GDP growth. They still ran deficits; they still grew the debt. They cut services. They downloaded services to municipalities. They didn’t reduce the debt; they kept growing it—even though the member for Nipissing spoke extensively about how we’re growing the debt. Actually, I should say they did make one contribution to the debt, which was $3.1 billion, when they sold the 407, and we all know how that turned out. These are the folks who are now telling us how we should spend our money. I think their track record begs some questioning.", "We’re doing this in a responsible way, Speaker. Let me give you an example of how we’re doing it. We integrated six existing dental programs for children into one program called Healthy Smiles. What we did was change eligibility, making it easier for families of eligible children and youth to get access to timely dental care. As a result, 70,000 more kids from low-income families can get dental services, and 460,000 children are now eligible.", "We want to make sure that government programs are working at their best. That’s why we’ve established a new Centre of Excellence for Evidence-based Decision Making Support that will help build capacity to assess how programs are performing.", "We’ve appropriately managed our Ontario public service labour costs, working with our partners in the broader public service to reach agreements that are fair and reasonable to government employees and the taxpayer, and consistent with our fiscal plan.", "We’ve made it clear that there is no new funding for compensation increases, and that any modest wage increases in a contract must be offset by cost-saving measures elsewhere in collective agreements, to create a net-zero outcome.", "This is a responsible way to approach this, Speaker. This is in contrast, of course, to the Progressive Conservatives, who actually campaigned on a plan to address labour costs by cutting 100,000 jobs. I think our approach is responsible and, again, consistent with our fiscal plan, and preserves the services that Ontarians value.", "We have achieved a number of net-zero deals: AMAPCEO in August 2014; a three-year net-zero agreement with OPSEU’s unified bargaining unit in October 2015; a three-year collective agreement for OPSEU’s correctional bargaining unit in January 2016. There are many other examples as well.", "So again, just to recap, we’re balancing the budget by 2017-18. We’re doing it in a responsible way. We’re going line by line, program by program, to make sure that we’re delivering the best possible outcomes for people and, ultimately, the best value for taxpayer dollars.", "Now, while we’re managing spending, we’re also making investments in the programs and services that Ontarians rely on: health care, education, roads, bridges and expanding transit. We’re here with our Minister of Transportation, the member for Vaughan, and I have to say that he’s doing a tremendous amount of excellent work on this issue of building important infrastructure, not just in the greater Toronto area, but also in the north, in the east, in the west and across our entire province. We’re committed to invest more than $134 billion in public infrastructure over 10 years, spending on priorities such as roads, bridges and public transit, hospitals and schools. This is the largest investment in public infrastructure in Ontario’s history. These are investments that are going to support over 100,000 jobs per year, on average.", "Since the 2015 budget, we’ve announced support for more than 200 infrastructure projects in communities across the province, including recent investments in major transit systems, 40 hospitals and 170 schools. In my riding of Etobicoke Centre, we have a school, St. Clement Catholic School, which recently received a commitment of funding from the provincial government, something that I’m very proud of and something that I was proud to work towards, alongside the community. Etobicoke General Hospital, one of those hospitals, is going to benefit tremendously from that funding, and they’re breaking ground very shortly. That’s one of the investments that we’re making. This is just an example of some of the important investments we’re making to improve health care, to improve education, to improve transit and some of the other things.", "We continue to invest in the Ontario jobs strategy. We continue to invest in health care, in community care, in hospitals and in palliative care. We continue to invest in education—continually invest in education—because education represents the foundation for our young people’s future. All of these investments are about improving the lives of Ontarians today and tomorrow.", "We also know that our most vulnerable citizens need a hand, and we’re giving them a hand. I know that the President of Treasury Board is also the minister responsible for poverty reduction. Our renewed Poverty Reduction Strategy, called Realizing Our Potential, builds on the progress we’ve made in the past, sets new goals, calls on new partners and focuses on investing in what works.", "We’re making strategic investments across government: in health, in education and in housing programs. The renewed strategy focuses on four areas:", "—continuing to break the cycle of poverty for children and youth;", "—moving towards employment and income security;", "—a long-term goal of ending homelessness is Ontario; and", "—evaluating and supporting workable and sustainable programs.", "We launched the $50-million Local Poverty Reduction Fund, which supports innovative and sustainable community-driven initiatives that measurably improve the lives of those most affected by poverty. Through the first round of the fund, we’re supporting 41 projects in 20 communities.", "We indexed the Ontario Child Benefit to annual increases in the Ontario consumer price index, and we increased the minimum wage and indexed it to the consumer price index.", "We have a bold goal of ending homelessness in Ontario. When people have a home, they are healthier, happier, more ready for employment and better able to participate in the communities.", "We have increased funding for our Community Homelessness Prevention Initiative by $42 million annually, with a total investment of $587 million over two years. We continue to build new affordable housing and repair existing units so that Ontarians with housing needs can find a place to call home.", "Speaker, I started my remarks by talking about the constituent who reminded me that I’m here to improve the quality of life of the people of my community in Etobicoke Centre and the quality of life of the people across our province. That’s exactly what this government has been doing and making a best effort to do. I think that we are protecting and improving the services that matter. We are being fiscally responsible; we’re making every dollar count; we’re getting better value for taxpayers’ dollars. That’s the commitment that I made to my constituents of Etobicoke Centre; that’s, I believe, the commitment that we all made to our constituents; and that’s exactly what we’re doing here.", "I want to reiterate that the introduction of the Supply Act is part of the government’s economic plan. Without the spending authority that the Supply Act would provide, the government would be unable to meet its obligations to the people of this province, unable to make those important investments, unable to continue along a fiscal plan that is responsible, manages taxpayers’ dollars wisely and gets value for money, and unable to deliver on what my constituent asked, which is that we improve the lives of the people of Ontario in the way we committed to. I urge all members of the Legislature to support this important act." ],

First off, it is evident and it is beyond reproach that this government doesn’t care about people. That’s what I see. I see people coming in to my office who can’t get assistance for their children who are intellectually disabled; I see elderly parents coming in who can’t get assistance and help for their elderly children who are disadvantaged; I see people coming in who are on significant wait times for cataract and hip and knee surgeries. I could go on and on.", "It’s clear that this government is on auto pilot. The ministers have no interest in actually dealing with their responsibilities as long as they have a slogan to talk about or a sound bite. That’s what they’re interested in: a photo op and a slogan. That’s what this government is all about: photo ops and sound bites.", "Speaker, this Supply Act is about the money that is already spent for this year: final statutory authority for expenditures up until March 31. I want to speak about what I saw about expenditures. A week ago today, I spent three and a half hours walking through the Ottawa-Carleton Detention Centre. I had an interesting visit with the superintendent, Maureen Harvey; the assistant superintendent from St. Lawrence, Brian Patterson; and the president of the union local, Denis Collin. We toured the facility and had a wonderful, honest discussion about the state of our correctional facilities and the state of the Ottawa-Carleton Detention Centre.", "It’s also interesting that, today, the Minister of Community Safety made a ministerial statement about transforming corrections in Ontario. Well, I’ll tell you, it needs to be transformed. It needs significant transformation. The $2.5 billion that was spent in corrections this fiscal year, according to Bill 166—let me tell you a little bit of what I saw $2.5 billion bought us.", "I saw a busted-up exercise yard. The asphalt was busted up at the Ottawa-Carleton Detention Centre. The inmates are not allowed to get any exercise, because the busted-up asphalt can be used as a weapon. We couldn’t fix an exercise yard for $2.5 billion. They’d rather just leave the inmates in their cells. In the same yard, the protective film on the windows was tattered, torn, in total distress, not functional—$2.5 billion, and we couldn’t even fix some windows. Does this government care? I don’t think so. But there was much else that I saw there.", "The minister spoke today about hiring 2,000 new guards for our correctional facilities. Well, we probably need 2,000 new guards because they won’t spend a couple of dollars on technology to help the guards.", "I was astonished, as I was speaking to the superintendent, about the level of drugs and contraband that come into the detention centre. They tell me that most of these drugs and contraband—tobacco—even things such as ceramic knifes and various other unlawful products come in by people filling up Kinder eggs. You know those little Kinder eggs that you’re supposed to get a little toy in? People open them up, fill them with drugs and either swallow them or insert them in a body cavity. Or they fill up condoms—again, the same thing. And our guards have no way of finding out what is being brought in.", "I asked the guards, “Do you not do a cavity search?” I found out that we’re not permitted to do that. Our guards are not permitted to do that unless there is consent. Now, if somebody is bringing in illegal drugs and contraband, it’s unlikely that they’re going to provide consent. The only mechanism at the guard’s disposal is something they call a BOSS chair. They sit the inmate in the BOSS chair and do an X-ray. But the X-ray will only pick up metal; it won’t pick up Kinder eggs. It won’t pick up other things—it won’t pick up ceramic blades—and all these inmates know this. I was surprised. I didn’t know we had the BOSS chair, but we have no other search mechanism.", "The superintendent and the president of the union local said this could be solved. They need body scanners, the same body scanners that CBSA has at our airports. If we had one of those in each of our detention centres, the level of drugs, ceramic knives, tobacco—whatever else—would be greatly reduced, if not eliminated. But I didn’t see any expenditure, any investment in body scanners in this $2.5 billion—zero. We couldn’t fix the pavement, can’t fix the windows and can’t buy a few body scanners. So the problem persists and persists.", "Let me put this in perspective, Speaker. This is not just a wee bit of a problem like somebody smoking a joint in their detention centres. These are members of gangs, people bringing in drugs—and the violence that occurs. In my three-and-a-half-hour visit there, I saw one inmate who had been beaten severely, just prior to me getting to that area of the detention centre. He was beaten severely, and he was being taken into protective custody for his own protection. I think the individual was powerfully pleased that there was someplace he could be relocated to.", "That’s what drugs and weapons do in our correctional facilities because we need to ask for consent to search somebody, and because we won’t invest in a body scanner. We can go out and hire 2,000 more guards—and that’s probably a blessing—but let’s go out and buy a couple of body scanners, and let’s start putting a dent in the problem at our correctional facilities.", "This idea of Kinder eggs coming into our jails full of drugs and our guards not being able to do anything to prevent it—keep this in mind: It was explained to me that most of these drugs are being brought in by people who are coming in on intermittent sentences. People who have been sentenced to 90 days or less, who are serving their sentences from Friday to Sunday or Friday to Monday, learn the system—they know how the system works—and the gangs within our facilities are demanding that they bring in contraband or they will be beaten if they don’t. People are fearful for their lives in not complying with the ruthless behaviour by people in corrections.", "The superintendent and the president told me that they’ve seen people—because the contraband is so profitable and so lucrative in our correctional facilities—actually go out and intentionally break their conditions of release so that they will be brought back to jail for the weekend, so that they can sell their drugs and contraband at such exorbitant rates. Imagine, our system has actually built in an incentive for people to breach the conditions of their sentence so that they can make more money by going to jail for the weekend. There’s something wrong with this picture, Speaker.", "When I said that this government doesn’t care—they have allowed this to persist. They’ve allowed it to continue. They’ve done nothing. Body scanners are not new. This is not something that just got developed last week or last year. We’ve had them in our airports for quite a period of time. We’ve had a drug and violence problem in our correctional facilities for quite some time. Why have they chosen to do absolutely nothing? It’s out of sight out of mind, and they don’t care. They don’t care if there are drugs being brought in. I think that’s what we saw with our correctional facilities guards and the strike that they had. They recognized that all their pleading, all their requests for assistance from this government fell on deaf ears for years and years. They couldn’t get them to act in any way.", "That’s a couple of the things that I saw in three and a half hours. Maybe the member from Ottawa South would like to join me on a visit to the Ottawa-Carleton Detention Centre someday—or maybe the Minister of Transportation would—and go out and actually see what happens.", "There’s something else. I spoke with the Minister of Community Safety a little while ago about electronic monitoring for people who are violent offenders. We have no mechanism to track where violent offenders are or what they are doing. We don’t know if they’re breaching their conditions or not. We just don’t have the program.", "I was doing a little research. The city of Calgary, the city of Edmonton, the province of PEI and our CBSA authorities all have electronic monitoring. They have ankle bracelets that they can put on violent offenders. They know where that person is; they know if that person is breaching any conditions. Lo and behold, to my surprise, when I was speaking with the firm that provides protective electronic monitoring ankle bracelets to all these places—that we don’t have here in Ontario—the company actually monitors all those offenders from Sudbury, Ontario. That’s where their service is provided from.", "These ankle bracelets have a built-in cellphone. They have a built-in siren. They have a built-in vibration device. If the offender approaches a person or a place where they’re not allowed to be by court order, the vibration goes off and a phone call is made. If it persists, the siren is initiated and the police are called.", "Interjections." ],

But, just like the body scanners, they haven’t bothered. Nobody on the government benches could be bothered to get up off the couch and actually investigate anything. I’ll tell you when this government investigates something: when the media has a story about their failings on the front page.

But if we can’t give them the tools to be able to help themselves later in life, then we’re failing.", "We are doing that, Speaker. We know we have 16,000 kids on a wait-list for autism services, and 6,000 kids on a wait-list for mental health. If we should be taking care of anything in this province, we need to start taking care of our children and helping them to have healthy lives, and making sure that they can get through the school system, that they can learn to read and that they can get a job when they come out of that. If they don’t get these services that they need, some may not even be able to have a full conversation. It’s something that could have been fixed when they were a child.", "Talking about kids with special needs in schools, we see this government shutting down special-needs schools, the Trillium schools, in this province. They’re doing a consultation. They’re capping enrolment. They’re not allowing any more kids to be able to get into these specialized programs to help kids with severe learning disabilities.", "I spoke this morning, and I asked a question regarding a young boy who lives in my riding. He was struggling all through school. He finally had the ability to get into the Trillium school. His mother told me the process was a year-long process to be able to get into the school—the binders, and the criteria, and the paperwork that had to be sent in, just so this kid could learn how to read, right? He finally gets into the program. Things are going well. The kid is flourishing. He is flourishing, Speaker. He wrote a 400-word essay all on his own and on his own accord, not being suggested to, or not being pushed by family or the teachers. He heard about the model Parliament program and thought, “I want to do that.” If that child had not gone to those specialized schools, he would never have had the courage, the confidence or the ability to write that essay. We know that not many kids get to make it to the model Parliament. I’m so proud of Seamus and the accomplishments that he has made to be able to get and to be able to continue his education.", "That’s putting funds into our children. Yet this government is now blocking those schools, saying that no more kids are going to be able to receive these benefits of this specialized education. It’s going to put more kids at risk.", "The minister continues to say that all kids deserve equal access to education. Well, that’s absolutely true, but all kids also deserve equitable education also. If someone needs extra special attention when it comes to their reading, and a specialized environment, then that child should have that ability to do so.", "Here in the province of Ontario, we’re failing. It’s a big F when it comes to our kids with special needs in our education system.", "We don’t have nearly enough EAs to be able to assist.

They were cut back 2% a couple of years back. A couple were given 2%, but that 2% still didn’t bring them up to where they were able to balance their budgets, so they are still struggling. We have children’s aid societies who are fundraising across this province, doing galas and doing all kinds of things to be able to keep their doors open and to provide the services in our child welfare sector.", "On top of that, now, they’ve been given a CPIN program. They’re being brought slowly into the process, and they are being given $220,000 to be able to implement this program. Yet children’s aid societies are reporting $1.4-million to $4-million costs of implementing the program. So, once again, that’s a pretty big stretch. But this government is used to stretch goals, Speaker.", "It’s not me that’s stretching the limits. They are the numbers that I’m given on the cost of implementation.", "If we think that the cost of implementation isn’t really a problem of technology in this province, let’s talk about SAMS. We can talk about SAMS all day long because we know that municipalities are still bearing the brunt of the SAMS program, still not able to get all of their employees up to speed. Employees are finding themselves not able to deal with a program that this government refused to talk to people about. There was no consultation. They just rammed it through, bought a program off the shelf and said, “Here you go. This is what you’re going to use.” Nothing about that program suited the needs for our OW and ODSP situation, but this government decided that SAMS was going to be the program—and now CPIN is of the same nature.", "Yes, they’re doing things slower now because implementing it is a process, but it costs money; it costs money to do that. You can’t just expect them to be able to fall into that program without running into trouble. When you already don’t have any extra money, when you’re already fundraising to make up the limits and you’re already cutting front-line services to make up the difference again—you can’t possibly expect to put more load on them and for them to not feel that brunt.", "Our health care system: I’ve never seen the state of health care as I’m seeing it today. From residents who come to my office, from every single person that I talk to who has to go to the hospital, it’s a fear. Nobody even wants to step foot into the hospital these days when we have a shortage of nurses—what we used to have as RNs are now not RNs; who is qualified to do what—and a mix of practitioners that simply can’t keep up. I guess that would have to be the word.", "We see patients who are falling behind. They’re being left with bells ringing and soiled beds. They’re falling out of bed and slipping on their own stuff because nobody is coming to their attention. We have adults who can’t feed themselves. They’re sitting there with plates in front of them for over an hour, two hours. The nurses can’t possibly keep up with the cuts, and yet this is the reality.", "What’s happening? Where are the dollars going in our health care system? We know the huge amount of money in our health care system. How are we falling so far behind? How is our system getting worse instead of better? Where does that happen when they claim that they’ve increased the budget? Well, they increased the budget, I believe, by 1%, and it’s been frozen for four years in the hospitals. Even just to keep up with inflation it’s 1.8%, but they gave them 1%. Now, they’ll be able to say what a great job they did by increasing and not freezing the hospital budgets when, in fact, they are certainly frozen.", "There are talks in Hamilton of bringing us into the future and the possibility of closing a large hospital that has specialized services for not just Hamilton—I know I’m very blessed to live in a city that has multiple health care facilities, but people from all over come into those specialized facilities, and they’re already shutting down wards.", "I’m going to have to stop soon, but it’s a major crisis. They’ve closed down the mental health facility in your riding, Speaker, and are pushing patients up to my riding in the far west end, which is really far for people to have to travel when they have mental health issues.

I’m happy to rise and talk about the 2015 budget and the impact it had on my riding of Niagara Falls, Niagara-on-the-Lake and Fort Erie.", "When I took over last year—I see a lot of success in my riding. In some places, this budget certainly failed. Let’s start in Fort Erie, and I’m glad the minister is here.", "I’ve been working on a topic for years. I am absolutely not giving up. This government needs to support the Fort Erie racetrack. Last year’s budget did include funding for the Fort Erie racetrack, and I’m happy to say we’ve been able to save the track, but we need to go further. Fort Erie remains the only town in the province that has to kick in extra money. That’s money that’s coming from the residents through their taxes to support the track.", "In 2015, it was $500 million. I don’t think that’s right. Taking the slots out of Fort Erie was an absolute mistake. It should never have happened. We’ve managed to save the racetrack, but now we need to fix it and make it great again. With last year’s budget, horse people from across the province were clear that we need a long-term strategy. We can do two things right now. We can save the crown jewel of the town, increase race dates and return the slots. Last year’s budget failed the people of Fort Erie by not returning the slots that should never have been taken away from Fort Erie. Let’s reverse that policy of this Liberal government today and return the slots to Fort Erie.", "What does that give us? If you do that today, like we should have done in 2015, we can save 1,000 jobs and hire another couple of hundred people on the slots, just like they had before. That makes a lot of sense to me.", "We have seen some good development in Fort Erie. I’m talking about the Canadian Motor Speedway project. Over the last year, we’re finally seeing the roadblocks removed that have kept that project from going forward for eight years. The Canadian Motor Speedway has partnered with a number of universities, including Niagara College and Brock University in my area, to bring together some of the brightest minds in the province. They signed a partnership contract with Brock yesterday to work together on innovation and research projects, which are all good.", "This is a project that’s going to give back to Fort Erie and to the province of Ontario. It’s a project that can create jobs and revitalize the town. I’m happy to say that, over the last year, we’ve seen incredible progress, and I’m going to keep working with representatives at all levels of government to make sure this project gets done.", "Mr. Speaker, I want to touch on one aspect of government spending from last year that affects my entire riding and the entire region of Niagara. That’s the new Niagara Falls hospital. When I was running in the by-election that first brought me to this House—and I’m very proud to be here—over two years ago, the Premier came to Niagara Falls and unveiled a banner at the site of the new Niagara Falls hospital which said, “Funding grant approved.” If we go there today, the banner looks almost like it’s going to fall off. We know we’re in stage 1A, but some people are saying that this hospital is years away.", "People in Niagara can’t wait years. They have a right to decent medical care in a timely fashion. We need to see movement on this hospital and we need to see it soon. We have a chance here to increase our medical services in Niagara Falls and put local people back to work. It’s a win-win. Despite last year’s commitment to health care, we still don’t have a shovel in the ground here today. Let’s change that.", "There’s an important issue for seniors in my riding. Everywhere I go in Niagara—people on both sides of the House can say whether I’m right on this—seniors tell me they can’t afford their hydro bills, they can’t afford their food bills, they can’t afford their gas bills. It’s heartbreaking. You heard some of those stories this afternoon. On these issues, I believe we made it even worse in the 2015 budget.", "As these seniors get older, they need to have vital health care services. The longer we wait on projects like the new Niagara Falls hospital, the more we’ll put seniors at risk. They spent their entire lives—their entire lives—making our communities great. I’ve seen this first-hand in Niagara. They absolutely deserve our respect. Let’s make it easier for them to stay in their homes and live their senior years in dignity.", "There are many positives that came out of Niagara last year. I’m happy to say that in the last year we continued to see growth in Niagara-on-the-Lake. The wine region down there is an economic force, and the entire province should be proud of the work they’re doing. There are ways we can support the industry; namely, let’s get them more space on the shelves of the LCBO." ],

It creates jobs, and it puts money right back into the local economy. Here’s something that maybe the minister should listen to: When you buy a local VQA wine, over $11 goes back into the local economy; when you buy a foreign wine, just over $1.04 goes back into the local economy. That’s why we need to support them and give them more shelf space—not temporary shelf space, but permanent shelf space that goes longer than three years, sir. I’m proud of the wineries in my riding and what they have been able to do. They can count on my continued support. I hope this government will do the same.", "But it’s not just the wineries in Niagara-on-the-Lake. We have so many young, talented, smart people coming into the riding and taking advantage of the craft beer and craft cider markets. I will say without a doubt that we have the best craft beer scene in the province, maybe in the country. Go to Oast, Silversmith, Brimstone, Exchange, the Niagara Brewing Company or Niagara College, and you’ll see for yourself that we’re second to none.", "This is a market that is growing rapidly. This government missed a chance in the last budget to offer all the support it needs to fully flourish and create jobs. I hope they will take a serious look this year at what the craft brewing and the craft cider markets need and will give them the tools they need to succeed.", "Some of these successes have come with some major failures in last year’s budget. Last year’s budget saw a continuous cut to education here in the province. I’ve seen the effects of these cuts first-hand. I worked with the community in Niagara-on-the-Lake, and we did everything we could to save the heart of the old town, Parliament Oak. These sorts of cuts are the reason that Parliament Oak and schools like it around the province have been closed down.", "Let me say clearly—hopefully they can hear me over there—that this closure was an absolute mistake. It was the wrong thing to do, and it was a poor decision. It bothers me to think about all the other schools in this province that had to face what the town of Niagara-on-the-Lake faced. These education cuts only hurt our children and our grandkids. They’re the most important parts of our lives, and we should stop closing schools.", "Here, I had a meeting today about Ontario books and Canadian books that I didn’t even know about. In the budget this year, you’re looking at cutting 15% out of the Ontario Media Development Corporation, for example. We used to have a great book publishing industry here in Ontario. In my riding, we had a company called Coutts, that was actually Ingram, out of the States, which shipped textbooks across the continent but also to local universities. I knew the workplace well. They were members of my local union, Unifor CAW Local 199. They were incredible, hard-working men and women, and there was no support for them from the province or from the federal government.", "Coutts closed down that workplace in Niagara Falls and moved it, putting all these great people—100 of them—out of work. It’s a shame, and it should never have happened. I’ve seen it first-hand, and this needs to be stopped before it happens again. These cuts will only create more of that.", "I want to say on the books, really quickly: Does it not make sense to anybody—I’m not so sure how much time I have here—to be supporting our local book industry by having local books that are done right here in Ontario and right here in Canada in our schools? That makes absolute sense to me. Why are you cutting 15% out of that? It makes no sense.", "The last thing I’ll talk about in my last minute is that we’ve lost 317,000 manufacturing jobs since 2000. These are usually good-paying jobs with benefits. We have to protect them. We need to work harder; we need to protect these jobs and expand this. These are real jobs.", "In my riding, in my area, General Motors is there. They still employ 2,500 employees. They also have 6,000 retirees still in Niagara. They’re an economic force. We should support that industry. We don’t want to lose any more. We’re already being threatened with the potential closure of Oshawa, as we all know. Manufacturing should be a vital part of where we go.", "I’ve got 11 seconds left; I can’t go without talking about Hydro One. Listen, we don’t want to sell 1% of Hydro One. The Conservatives want to sell 49% of Hydro One; you want to sell 60% of Hydro One. Don’t sell one bit of Hydro One. It’s a mistake—the biggest mistake this province has ever made." ],

That’s a very important development in an industry that is growing by leaps and bounds.", "Collectively, we’ve also made some decisions. Craft beer and fruit wines will now be able to be sold in farmers’ markets right across the province of Ontario. And I want to be very fair this afternoon. About 10 years ago, Bob Runciman—now Senator Bob Runciman, of course—had a private member’s bill on this. I want to recognize his contribution on this particular debate.", "Starting in the spring of this year, in all of the farmers’ markets across Ontario, fruit wines and ciders will be available along with VQA wines. That’s an excellent distribution channel for a product that now has an international reputation. When I was in China, they wanted to buy more Ontario VQA wines.", "I just want to touch on horse racing for a moment. I have been to Fort Erie Race Track and it is the site, of course, of the second stop of the Canadian Triple Crown, when they host the Prince of Wales Stakes there. We’ve extended in our budget another two years for our horse race transition program, looking at ways that we can bring about a full integration of that plan to sustain many of these tracks right across the province of Ontario." ],

We get these really excellent goals and bill titles that make for great sound bites, but what we don’t get are the details. Time and time again, this government puts forward bills that lack the details that would ensure the goals of the bills are actually met.", "Take this bill, for example. The Waste-Free Ontario Act sounds like an excellent bill. Who wouldn’t want to live in a province where we don’t produce waste? Unfortunately, while this bill has a title that makes it sound excellent, and while it recognizes the need for individual producer responsibility in Ontario, it falls short when we get to the meat of it.", "First of all, there are no timelines in this bill for moving to a system of individual producer responsibility, which is important. If this bill becomes law, the day it passes absolutely nothing changes. Think about that: Absolutely nothing changes. Industry-funded organizations will still run our waste diversion programs, and there will be no real plan in place for them to move to a system of individual producer responsibility. That is a problem.", "The industry-funded organizations that currently control waste diversion programs in Ontario simply are not doing a good enough job at diverting waste. As my colleague from Toronto–Danforth told us, these monopolies lack incentives to find creative ways to reduce packaging and divert waste from landfills. What does that mean? It means that, according to the government’s own draft strategy, we’re going to require 16 more landfills in Ontario before 2050. It means that many of the members of this House—except, I guess, the many members from that side of the bench in Toronto—are going to have to go into their communities and tell their constituents to plug their noses. I’m no expert, but I think it’s pretty safe to say that telling members of your community that they’re going to have to put up with a landfill for the rest of their lives is not going to make you very popular. So aside from the really negative environmental consequences, I want the members opposite to also consider what the reaction of the people of this province will be.", "Mr. Speaker—I see we’ve got a new Speaker. You’re smiling. You’re friendly. It’s nice. Very good.", "I want to make this very clear: I and all of my colleagues in the Ontario NDP caucus support the goal of introducing individual producer responsibility to Ontario. This is an idea that has been bounced around for a long time, and it’s long past the time that we should have moved to this system. Only by introducing a system of individual producer responsibility to the province of Ontario can we ensure that more of our waste is being diverted from landfills. By introducing this system, we allow all waste producers in all sectors of our economy to develop their own methods for reducing waste. It creates competition to develop better and better waste diversion methods, and I’m sure the members of the other party on this side of the House will appreciate that.", "Mr. Speaker, it is critically important that we do more as a society to produce less waste and have less impact on our environment. We need to divert more waste from landfills so that it doesn’t just sit there and hurt our environment. New Democrats understand that if we’re going to ensure that the planet we inherited from our parents and our grandparents is the same one that we leave to our children and our grandchildren, then now is the time to act.", "Take my riding in Niagara Falls, for example. We have a series of communities that rely on good weather to grow our grapes and barley for our VQA wineries and our craft breweries. We are a series of communities that rely on tourists coming to visit, whether that means coming to Fort Erie for the racetrack—for the minister—Niagara Falls for the falls or Niagara-on-the-Lake for peach festivals. They all rely on their natural environment to some degree.", "In other words, we are a series of communities that will immediately and harshly feel the impact of climate change if it continues at this pace. We are also a series of communities that understands the need to take action on climate change.", "According to a 2012 report released by the Environmental Sustainability Research Centre at Brock University entitled Adapting to Climate Change: Challenges for Niagara, our region can expect to see a 20% decrease in summer rainfall by 2050, a three- to four-degree temperature increase, and growth in the conditions that give rise to thunderstorms with a likely increase in heavy rain, lightning strikes, high winds and hailstorms, which would have a serious impact on agriculture in Niagara.", "The report goes on to say that farmers in the Niagara region can also expect more negative impacts. They should expect a shorter growing season for Niagara’s signature ice wine; they should expect an increase in invasive weed species and agricultural pests; and they should expect an increase in crop damage from unpredictable freezing rain and freeze-thaw cycles. Not only does this eye test tell us that the Niagara region is going to feel the impact of climate change, but the scientists agree. Clearly, something needs to be done.", "This is a good story that I’m going to talk about because I think this is what should happen in the bill. This is what we should be doing in this bill.", "Mr. Speaker, I’m happy to say that some of the people in my riding are already taking action. Walker Industries, for example—I’d like everybody to listen to this—is a company with hundreds of hard-working employees in my riding that does work on aggregates, construction, environmental project management, waste management, renewable energy projects and more.", "The company has taken it upon themselves to introduce a sustainability framework to their business that guides their entire decision-making process. Well, think about this. The process helps ensure that they’re able to integrate the need for environmental sustainability into their priorities, their metrics and their reporting capabilities.", "And that’s not all they’ve done at Walker. The company is the industry leader in beneficial reuse of biosolids, with multiple award-winning facilities right here in Ontario. They’re also a company that operates landfills here in Ontario, and I’m happy to say that all of their landfills use some of the most advanced technology out there to help ensure that as little methane is released in the atmosphere as possible.", "Even more than that, on an annual basis Walker is able—listen to this, Mr. Speaker, because this really caught my attention—to divert more than 300,000 tonnes of organic waste out of their landfills, making them, if not the largest, one of such organizations in the province.", "Now, isn’t that good news? Don’t you think that’s something that we should be doing in this bill, going to Walker and saying, “How do you do it?” and making sure other companies do the same thing? I think that’s the way the bill should go.", "Clearly, there are already companies out there taking a strong stance in support of the environment, and this piece of legislation would hopefully encourage more of them to join all of us in a fight to protect and preserve our province.", "Mr. Speaker, the increase in greenhouse gas emissions that has occurred under the current system of industry-funded organizations managing waste diversion is appalling. No less a person than the minister himself told us that, “In Ontario, absolute greenhouse gas emissions from waste increased by 25% between 1990 and 2012.”" ],

It’s always a great-sounding name but never really the content. I prefer to call what the government does two things: I always seem to speak on many of the bills with the expression “ready, fire, aim,” because they come out with these things without consultation. So it’s ready, they fire, there it is, and then they realize, “Oops, we forgot to talk to everybody again,” and so they begin to aim.", "I found in this particular instance as well that while Bill 151 does include some parts of the PC plan in it—and those are obviously the parts that we like—there were major problems with the bill that are meeting opposition from the stakeholders. Why? Because they didn’t consult the stakeholders thoroughly and properly. The stakeholders’ concerns are primarily centred on the authority, their powers, the winding up of the recycling programs, policy statements, and enforcement, all without consultation with those very stakeholders.", "Other than ready, fire, aim, I also think about how this government comes out with these wonderful ideas.

  "text" : [ "I wanted to thank the member from Niagara Falls for weighing in on this debate.", "I wanted to pick up on one of the things that he talked about—actually, not that dissimilar from what the member from Nipissing talked about—and that is that the government, I think, sometimes gets stuck in their own frame of mind, thinking about how they’re going to spin something to make it seem like they’re doing something when maybe they’re not, really. If you look at this bill, you see that there are two things that are missing: One, very obviously, is the substance—it’s got a nice title—and the other piece, which is equally important, are the timelines.", "What I wanted to do in the brief time I’ve got is bring that back to how a piece of legislation like this affects people on the ground. I wanted to particularly talk about some of the municipalities that are struggling with very high costs of operating landfills and recycling programs. The one I wanted to focus on, in particular, is that of Red Lake. Red Lake is in a unique situation, where it’s essentially landlocked with mining claims. They have one landfill that’s at the end of its lifespan and they’re looking at ways to manage that landfill. They’re also looking at how to deal with the extraordinary costs of shipping their recycling materials at least 250 kilometres outside of the community and how they do those things.", "I also wanted to mention, very quickly, that I’m really proud of the work that Red Lake is doing, because what they did was they took a shed and they’ve turned it into a reusable shed to try to divert a lot of items that are still usable but that people maybe don’t have time to sell or whatever. They’re actually doing a bit of a freecycle thing, where they’re taking those things out of the landfill.", "Municipalities are leading the charge. They’re doing their part in bringing down their costs to be mindful of the environment. It’s really incumbent upon this government to put the rubber to the road. They have to follow up. There has to be substance, and there also have to be timelines." ],

Members from all parties will have an opportunity to hear from relevant stakeholders and, if they so choose, they can bring amendments to strengthen the bill." ],

  "text" : [ "Well, thank you. I didn’t finish my presentation, but there are a couple of points here that I think are very important, particularly this one: In 2013, the Ontario waste sector was responsible for nine megatonnes of greenhouse gas emissions—we understand that—5% of the provincial total. But here’s the part that really jumps out at you: 93% of those emissions came from waste sent to landfill. So you can imagine what we could do if we fix it.", "We as members of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario—and simply as people who live in this province—have a responsibility to take substantial action to reduce our waste production, to reduce the amount of waste in landfills and, in turn, to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases we’re putting into the atmosphere. We need to have proper waste diversion programs here in our great province of Ontario so that we can eliminate the need for new landfills cluttering up our natural beauty. Quite frankly, we need proper waste diversion programs here in the province of Ontario based on a system of individual producer responsibility, and we need to ensure that missing details of this bill are not allowed to fall by the wayside, or end up in a landfill.", "That was supposed to be funny. Nobody really—" ],

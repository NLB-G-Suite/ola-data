  "text" : [ "Speaker, I’m pleased to rise in the House and speak to second reading of Bill 8, Access to Consumer Credit Reports and Elevator Availability Act. The bill addresses two areas that, if passed, impact Ontarians on a daily basis.", "Speaker, I’ll be sharing my time with my ministry parliamentary assistant, Mr. Vic Dhillon from Brampton West. I’ll be speaking to this piece of proposed legislation that, if passed, would provide fairness and stability for Ontarians when it comes to consumer credit reports and elevator accessibility.", "Speaker, our government is committed to protecting Ontario consumers at home and in the marketplace. My remarks will focus on levelling the playing field to consumers accessing their credit reports, as well as this government’s commitment to developing a plan that addresses elevator availability and establishing a repair-time protocol.", "The proposed amendments to the Technical Standards and Safety Act, 2000, would establish a legislative and regulatory framework for elevator availability. We know that out-of-service elevators can be a source of frustration for residents, especially for the elderly, expectant mothers, those with young children and people with disabilities. That’s why we have developed an action plan which would address areas such as elevator safety, availability, preventive maintenance and education awareness for owners and residents. The action plan also looks at the labour supply of elevator mechanics and provides for better elevator access for first responders trying to reach patients in multi-storey buildings.", "As part of the action plan, we intend to develop an elevator repair timeline, to make Ontario the first jurisdiction worldwide to do so. In order to develop the standard, we need to collect more data and fully assess potential costs and impacts. We’ll continue to work with all parties, levels of government and stakeholders through wide-reaching consultations as we move forward on our action plan. This, again, will make Ontario the first jurisdiction in the world to undertake such action on behalf of its residents.", "Our government is focused on building a fair, safe and informed marketplace for Ontario consumers. If passed, this legislation would be added to an already impressive list of actions taken by this government to ensure that Ontario consumers are being protected.", "One year ago, with the passage of Bill 59, the Putting Consumers First Act, our government moved forward with this vital consumer protection bill in the areas of home inspections, door-to-door sales and payday lenders.", "More recently, with the passage of Bill 166, the Strengthening Protection for Ontario Consumers Act, our government set forth to protect consumers when they travel, when they purchase tickets to a concert or sporting event, and when they purchase a home or have a new home constructed. It should be recognized that Her Majesty’s loyal opposition did not feel that Ontarians deserved these latest protections and actually chose to vote against them.", "As the Minister of Government and Consumer Services, the minister responsible for administering the Consumer Protection Act, I take very seriously the need to continue to enhance the rights of consumers while ensuring that businesses in Ontario are provided the opportunity to excel.", "Minister Leal, our minister responsible for small business, also takes particular interest in ensuring that we strike this important balance. He and his office are dedicated to ensuring Ontario remains one of the best places in North America to set up and do business.", "I would like to direct your attention, Speaker, to the timelines of this legislation as we mark World Consumer Rights Day. Every year, the consumer movement marks March 15 as World Consumer Rights Day as a means of raising global awareness about consumers’ rights and their needs. Celebrating this day is a chance to determine and demand that the rights of all consumers are respected and protected. We need to protest on that day market abuses and social injustices which undermine these rights.", "World Consumer Rights Day was inspired by President John F. Kennedy, who sent a special message to the US Congress on March 15, 1962, in which he formally addressed the issue of consumer rights. He was the first world leader to do so.", "As minister, I want to ensure that consumers have the tools and resources available to them to make informed decisions about their purchases and to be aware of what courses of action they have available to them. This legislation, if passed, aligns perfectly with our previous record on consumer protections and the aspirational goals laid out by the late John F. Kennedy.", "When it first arose in the news and my ministry was looking at any possible negative impacts to Ontarians regarding consumer reporting agencies’ handling of personal data, we just found there wasn’t a level playing field. Ontarians were not being given adequate access to their information or the ability to ensure that their information was being protected.", "If passed by the Legislature, it would provide stronger consumer protection tools by giving consumers easier access to their own credit information. The bill is aimed at ensuring consumer reporting agencies give consumers greater electronic access, free of charge, twice a year, to their own credit history, including any credit history reports and scores that were shared with potential creditors over the past 12 months. The bill would also give consumers the option of putting in place a security freeze that would prevent agencies from disclosing their credit information to a third party. The changes would give consumers more access and control over their own information to help reduce the harm of identity theft.", "As we continue to move forward to a more digital environment, where many people living in Ontario would choose to review their credit report online, we need to ensure that consumer reporting agencies are providing them with access to their own credit history.", "If this bill passes, the ministry will consult with consumer reporting agencies, as well as businesses that use the services of these agencies, to inform the development of regulations needed to implement the legislative changes without incurring unintended consequences.", "The government’s proposed amendments would create three major changes. First, when requested by a consumer, credit reporting agencies would have to provide consumers with their credit history and credit score electronically at least twice a year. They would not be allowed to charge a fee for this.", "Second, agencies would have to provide, as part of a consumer report, any scores given to third parties within the past 12 months. This would help consumers to understand the information the agency has provided to the creditor.", "Third, agencies would also have to give consumers the option to put in place, suspend or cancel a security freeze that would prevent agencies from disclosing information.", "I should also note that my colleague sitting to my right this morning, the MPP for Beaches–East York, Arthur Potts, proposed many of these changes in his private member’s bill last fall, and I thank him for that.", "If passed, Ontario would have the strongest and most transparent rules in Canada over how consumer reporting agencies share your credit information. We understand that this bill would mean changes to the way consumer reporting agencies operate. These are not decisions we made lightly.", "We know that the information shared by these agencies trickles down to all sectors of the economy. That’s why we plan to consult with the public, including consumers, consumer reporting agencies, and businesses that use the services of the agencies, before forming the regulations that will allow us to bring the bill into force.", "In particular, we know that many of the registered reporting agencies are small businesses. We want to make sure consumers are protected without creating undue burden to businesses, especially small enterprises. This would be a key factor in specifying the agencies that would be required to comply with the new rules.", "These changes are being proposed to give consumers greater access to their credit information and the ability to limit when that information is shared with a third-party organization, like creditors.", "Currently, the Consumer Reporting Act gives consumers free access to their consumer report but does not specify a timeline for the agency to provide it or electronic access. It does not require scores to be provided to consumers. It does not provide consumers the right to put a security freeze on their information.", "The government believes that consumers need greater access to the information held by agencies, and more control over how that information is shared. These changes, if passed by the Legislature, would give consumers greater electronic access, free of charge, to their own consumer report and consumer score, to be provided upon request up to twice per calendar year, including any consumer scores that were shared with third parties, such as potential creditors, over the past 12 months. The option of putting in place a security freeze that would prevent agencies from disclosing their credit information, subject to some exemptions, would be set out in regulations.", "The changes, if passed, would also improve enforcement by giving the registrar greater authority to issue orders. If the bill is passed, regulations will be developed, in consultation with consumers, business and the credit reporting industry, before the changes could come into force.", "The proposed changes offer significant benefits to consumers. Consumers would have greater access to their credit information and, as a result, be better able to identify their credit standing and any fraudulent activity on their accounts.", "Consumers would also be able to place a security freeze on their information. This provides consumers with an additional tool if they believe their identity is compromised.", "The ministry has received input on changes to the act through informal discussions with the larger agencies. If approved, the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services would consult with consumers, businesses and the consumer reporting industry on the regulatory details. The ministry would likely begin consultations with the industry on proposed regulations in the fall of 2018 if the bill is passed this spring.", "Now to expand on the security freezes, these are placed at the request of the consumer. A security freeze prevents third parties, such as a potential creditor, from accessing a consumer’s credit information unless the freeze is suspended or cancelled by the consumer. Security freezes are currently a consumer option across the United States. We believe that those living in Ontario should have this option available to them as well.", "A freeze may help victims or potential victims of identity theft to protect their information. For example, it might be helpful for someone who lost a wallet where they kept sensitive information such as their social insurance number. This is why the ministry is proposing to require certain consumer reporting agencies to place the security freeze on an account at the request of a consumer.", "A security freeze can help diminish the harm caused by identity theft. For example, if you believe your identity has been stolen, a freeze could help prevent someone from opening accounts like credit cards or a line of credit in your name.", "The proposal includes regulation-making authority to determine fees for security freezes. The regulations could set out requirements to provide freezes for free following a breach.", "A freeze would go further than alerts, which are already part of the act. A security alert is an optional service that consumers can choose that requires agencies to warn potential creditors to verify an applicant’s identity. It can be a useful tool if you believe your identity has been compromised, but it does not necessarily prevent a potential creditor from getting information. With the security freeze, agencies would be prohibited from providing any credit information, subject to any exemptions that we would build into regulations.", "This is another area where we want to get detailed feedback from stakeholders to be sure that we avoid any unintended consequences. We know there might be concerns in the industry about the time this could add to granting credit, so we will be looking to the industry for their thoughts on how we can find that balance between consumer protection and ensuring efficiency.", "In the past, consumers have highlighted concerns they have with credit reporting agencies. Over the past three years, there were 2,090 complaints, incidents and inquiries made to the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services regarding the Consumer Reporting Act, 2009. Complaints about consumer reporting are among the top 10 most common complaints the ministry receives. The ministry did not receive complaints about the data breach covered in the news. According to the ministry’s consumer protection data system, the ministry received 597 inquiries, incidents and complaints regarding the agencies between January 1, 2017, and February 28, 2018.", "The most frequent issues about consumer reporting agencies are incorrect information, wrong individual, and a prohibited practice or missing requirement. This includes:", "—consumers indicating that a bank, lender or person did not obtain permission to access their credit report;", "—the credit grantor failed to notify a consumer that the consumer’s information may be divulged to a third party, including other credit grantors and consumer reporting agencies;", "—the user of a credit report failed to explain denial of benefits, such as the granting of credit;", "—the consumer reporting agency failed to notify creditors that a consumer’s report has been corrected after an error;", "—a person or business knowingly supplied false or misleading information to a consumer reporting agency.", "Given those examples, and many more, it was clear that something needed to be done to better protect consumers in Ontario.", "I want to talk a little bit about the effect on agencies and business. The proposed changes do not specify which agencies will have to provide free electronic access to reports and scores or which agencies will have to implement security freezes. This will be set out in regulation. The ministry would, if the bill is passed, consult publicly on regulations to meet these priorities. The government’s intent is to capture only the largest agencies, as they deal with the most consumer files and have the broadest reach.", "The government wants to ensure that the amendments will balance the need to protect consumers without imposing an undue burden on businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises. If this legislation is passed, the ministry plans to consult on proposed regulatory amendments and to better understand the impact on consumer reporting agencies and businesses.", "The come-into-effect date will depend in part on the outcome of the consultations with the stakeholders about the regulations. The ministry’s intent is to have the regulations in effect in 2020.", "As stated previously, I will be sharing my time with my parliamentary assistant, Mr. Dhillon. Mr. Dhillon will be elaborating more on different aspects of the bill before us. But I do want to touch just briefly on elevator availability before I turn it over to Mr. Dhillon.", "I want to say that one of the true testaments to our government’s dedication to democracy is the seriousness with which we consider private members’ bills. This bill is comprised of government legislation drafted in response to two private members’ bills. MPP Han Dong and MPP Arthur Potts brought forth bills regarding elevator availability and consumer reporting, respectively. They heard the concerns of their constituents and identified them as a larger problem that needed to be addressed. These two champions of consumer rights are joined by MPP Yvan Baker in continuously challenging this government to never wane in terms of consumer protection. This legislation, along with our recently enacted door-to-door protections, represents this government’s and my ministry’s answer to this challenge.", "In terms of elevator availability, I’m granted a really unique perspective. As both the Minister of Government and Consumer Services and the minister responsible for accessibility in Ontario, I’m keenly aware of the importance of this issue.", "Having access to an adequate number of working elevators is neither a convenience nor a luxury; it’s a necessity and, in some instances, a lifeline. If you have mobility challenges at your residential building and it’s without elevator service, where does that leave you? Too often we hear stories of those with disabilities and those with mobility challenges becoming prisoners in their own homes due to elevator breakdowns and slow repair times. Many are also caught outside of their residences when the elevators cease functioning and become burdened with unforeseen costs associated with locating and paying for alternative accommodations. For many with health issues, the lack of elevator availability can represent a significant health and safety risk.", "With the growing number of multi-level residential buildings being built in this province, this is a problem that needs to be addressed. Our government has growing concerns with seniors and people with disabilities or other mobility issues being unable to get in and out of their condos, apartments, long-term-care or retirement homes because of unreliable elevators. But it isn’t only those with disabilities who are impacted. This impacts expectant mothers and those with young children as well.", "Many of our high-rise residences have 40- and sometimes 50-plus floors. Even the most athletic among us would falter at the prospect of having to climb up and down those stairs. I encourage all Ontarians, of course, to engage in regular exercise, but 40 flights of stairs before going to work or coming home from work is not a reasonable thing to ask people to do. People should not have to worry about how to get to their homes from their lobby. This should be a quick and easy process.", "In March 2017, MPP Dong introduced a private member’s bill, Bill 109, Reliable Elevators Act. MPP Dong’s bill received second reading and was referred to the Standing Committee on Regulations and Private Bills. It’s for this reason that our government requested that the Technical Standards and Safety Authority—the TSSA—study the state of elevator availability in Ontario and come up with some solutions. The TSSA, in turn, commissioned an independent study, led by the Honourable John Douglas Cunningham, to develop a report identifying key challenges and proposing solutions.", "Mr. Cunningham’s report outlines 19 recommendations aimed at improving elevator availability. Madam Speaker, our government plans to take action on all 19 recommendations outlined in this report.", "In January of this year, I was pleased to stand beside MPP Han Dong and announce Ontario’s action plan on elevator availability. Many of the main points of MPP Dong’s bill are addressed in this current bill before the House and in the province’s elevator action plan. I want to thank MPP Dong for taking the initiative to introduce his private member’s bill which informed this proposed legislation.", "Speaker, I have been informed that unfortunately my parliamentary assistant is not here. I know the rain was challenging for the commute this morning for myself, so that may be what’s holding him up. I’ll proceed to read his remarks, if that’s appropriate.", "So, on behalf of MPP Vic Dhillon: Speaker, one of the key roles of government is to protect residents in areas where it’s difficult to protect themselves." ],

We want to ensure that we educate Ontario consumers on their rights and help them through situations where they may have been taken advantage of by a company or not given everything that they’re entitled to.", "One of the areas in which Ontario consumers find it difficult to protect themselves is, as we’ve discussed, credit reporting and how it impacts their credit rating. Typically, this is not something they think about on a regular basis. It’s not until they’re faced with circumstances where they need to go to a credit reporting agency that they come across situations where they would have benefited from the type of legislation that we are introducing here. Examples of this are when you’re trying to get a mortgage to purchase your first home, applying to rent an apartment, or being assessed for your dream job. At this point, your credit history may all of a sudden come into full focus.", "The integrity of your credit rating also becomes front and centre when something goes wrong; for example, an error on your credit report. Credit report mistakes can cost consumers higher interest rates and even prevent some of them from getting loans. Or, even worse, identity theft can destroy your credit rating and may even take a heavy financial toll. This can have a negative effect on an individual and their family, and can at times take a very long time to try to resolve. I remember when that happened to my husband. It took a long time to deal with an identity theft issue. Madam Speaker, many people in Ontario lead busy and at times stressful lives. They do not need issues related to credit reporting agencies to add to this.", "In 2009, the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre received identity fraud reports from 11,095 victims, totalling a loss of more than $10 million. It’s important for Ontarians to understand their credit rating and the information that consumer reporting agencies hold about them. This includes knowing how this sensitive personal information is shared and used. Madam Speaker, this is why our government introduced a bill that, if passed, would give Ontario the strongest and most transparent rules in Canada over how consumer reporting agencies share information. It would give consumers more access and control over their credit information, and it may help reduce the harm of identity theft. The people of Ontario deserve to be protected.", "Consumer reporting agencies are private sector organizations. They collect personal information on consumers, including debt, credit and bill payment history, and other information used to assess a consumer’s credit score.", "Agencies collect information about a consumer’s debt and payment history from organizations like phone services, banks and many other organizations. In Canada, Equifax and TransUnion are the largest and most well known. Consumers who have received a loan or credit from a financial institution in Ontario are likely to have a file with a consumer reporting agency.", "Many organizations, including banks, insurance companies and residential landlords access credit information about consumers held by consumer reporting agencies, to help them inform their decisions. This can include whether to grant an individual a mortgage or not, or to rent someone an apartment or not.", "The information contained in a consumer reporting agency’s credit files can have a huge impact on whether that consumer can get access to credit, or the interest rate they will be asked to pay on a loan. Under the Consumer Reporting Act, agencies must take steps to ensure that information contained within the consumer credit reports is accurate and the contents are kept secure and only released for specific reasons.", "As I mentioned, Equifax and TransUnion are the largest agencies in North America. They are also the two primary national consumer reporting agencies in Canada. But there are about 40 small consumer reporting agencies registered in Ontario which operate on a limited scope. Smaller agencies tend to specialize in providing information to landlords, employers or other niche areas.", "It’s possible that not all agencies will be subject to the proposed new provisions of this act. If the bill is passed, regulations would be developed to make consumer reporting agencies that collect a wide range of information in multiple sectors of the economy subject to the new rules.", "In this respect, we believe that regulations should be developed in consultation with consumer reporting agencies as well as businesses that use the services of agencies. We believe this is the best way to get the job done without creating unintended consequences. We want to make sure that the regulations are fair and reasonable for everyone.", "Since we know that many agencies are small businesses, their concerns will be top of mind. Our government is taking steps to make changes to strengthen consumer protection in this area.", "The amendments we have proposed in the Consumer Reporting Act through this bill were developed in order to improve consumers’ access to their own information, and to give them the ability to control when and how their personal information is disclosed by agencies.", "If this bill is passed, the proposed amendments to the Consumer Reporting Act would do four main things. First, it would give consumers the right to get their consumer report electronically for free at least twice per year.", "Second, consumers would also be given the right to get their consumer score for free at least twice per year.", "Third, consumers would be able to place a security freeze on their credit file. This could be used in circumstances, for example, where the consumer may be concerned about identity theft. A freeze means that a consumer reporting agency could not release information about the consumer except where permitted by the consumer or where otherwise authorized under the act.", "Fourth, the amendments would give the registrar enhanced enforcement powers and protections to help resolve disputes between consumers and consumer reporting agencies.", "Madam Speaker, I’d like to outline to you why we have proposed these amendments.", "With respect to consumer credit reports and credit scores, we know that some consumers may be unaware of the information contained in their credit report, or may be unaware of their credit score, until they seek credit or, unfortunately, something does go wrong.", "Under the current rules, all agencies are required to give consumers access to their own information. Agencies are currently required to give consumers a written copy of their credit report for free when they request it. However, these reports do not contain consumer credit scores and are typically provided by mail. In some circumstances, it’s far more difficult to get a free copy of the report using the mail route, and therefore, many consumers look to get their credit report online.", "Considering that the average consumer conducts many, many transactions online these days, it is reasonable for them to want to do the same when they’re trying to obtain their credit report. However, this is not currently done free of charge. In this respect, many agencies currently charge consumers to obtain a copy of their consumer score or to get their report in electronic form. The proposed amendments will give consumers the right to get their consumer score and an electronic copy of their credit report for free, at least twice per year.", "With these new proposed amendments, consumers would no longer have to pay a fee for convenience and—" ],

Thank you.", "If the Access to Consumer Credit Reports and Elevator Availability Act is passed, agencies would be required to provide electronic credit reports to consumers requesting it within two days and, again, at least twice a year.", "Currently, consumers can ask for unlimited free copies of their credit files. However, consumer reporting agencies are only required to provide information in hard copy, as I mentioned. There’s no maximum time requirement for them to do this; it can take several weeks for consumers to receive their credit reports. This is reasonable, as usually when someone is looking to access their credit report it’s with the intention to do a straightforward transaction; however, that’s not the case for other types of transactions. If, for example, a house is up for sale and someone wants to be approved for a mortgage, they do not necessarily have the time to wait a few weeks in order to get their credit report. This may result in them being unable to go through with, in this case, a purchase of a home. With how it is currently, however, they would be left with no choice but to pay and then go the online route.", "In addition, if this bill is passed, agencies would have to provide credit reports that include previously generated scores, upon request. Currently, as I mentioned before, the only requirement is to provide the reports, not the scores. Twice a year, a consumer can ask for a newly generated score.", "A credit rating or score is not part of a regular credit report. It’s a mathematical formula that translates the data in a credit report into a three-digit number that some lenders use to make credit decisions. Credit scores typically range from 300 to 900. The higher the number, the more likely you are to get the loan or mortgage that you are applying for.", "The changes we’re proposing, if passed, would mean that consumers would have timely access to the details in their credit report. Consumers would also be entitled to see any score that an agency has provided to any third party in the past 12 months as part of their credit report. This would result in increased transparency from the agency.", "Madam Speaker, I believe that putting information in the hands of consumers is, indeed, a powerful tool. If consumers have ready access to the information in their credit reports, they are much more likely to spot errors or unusual activities that might indicate they have been a victim of identity theft. It’s far easier to prevent these unfortunate situations than trying to remediate the situation after the fact.", "If consumers have ready access to the information in their credit reports, it could also be a way for them to correct inaccuracies or to understand their credit rating and how it might affect them down the road. It would be a way in which they could make themselves self-aware of their financial situation so that they could choose to learn more about how to improve their credit rating and what their credit score would mean for them. This would be especially helpful to those who are considering purchasing a property or renting a place in the future. The added awareness could translate into dollars and cents on loan payments or in other types of situations that I mentioned earlier.", "We do not believe the current situation is fair to consumers, who may be anxious to access their credit report and to understand their credit standing or ensure its accuracy. So we are committed to strengthening consumer protection in the credit reporting sector. This is part of what we do at the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services and Consumer Protection Ontario, and we want to continue doing that.", "We also believe that the proposed amendments to the act and giving consumers the right to a security freeze would be an important new consumer protection tool. The act currently provides that a consumer may require an agency to include in a consumer’s file an alert warning people to verify an applicant’s identity. Many people use this, particularly if they think their identity has been compromised. While it puts additional onus on a potential creditor, it still allows an agency to release credit information.", "A security freeze would give the ability to intervene and prevent agencies from releasing information about their credit history. An agency would have to give consumers the option of a security freeze and prevent information from being provided to a third party unless the consumer lifts the freeze, and some exceptions would apply.", "I understand my colleague from Beaches–East York is willing to speak to this bill and share the remainder of my time.

It was something that came about as a result of conversations I’d had with many people, both in this House, with staffers around here, and people in my community on the aspect of the bill relating to credit reporting scores, and particularly in relation to when we saw a breach of data from a credit reporting agency.", "The kinds of responses that we as Canadians were getting to respond to that breach—we realized that in the US, consumers were getting far more privileged rights in how to address that breach than we were receiving here in Canada. It just triggered an awareness that, in fact, we should be doing something about this. I did bring the bill forward and worked very closely with the minister’s office and her staff to get a better sense of what could be done. One of the focuses we had, of course, was on protecting people against fraud, credit fraud and identity theft.", "I remember the previous member from Toronto Centre, the honourable Glen Murray. He’d had a situation where his identity had been stolen. It was an interesting way they went about doing it in that his information was stolen and they got a credit in his name to go to the Brick. They bought a whole bunch of material. As you know, you have these “Don’t Pay a Cent” events—maybe that’s Leon’s—where you don’t pay for a year. For a year, somebody had stolen his identity, bought consumer goods, and they didn’t have to pay for a year.", "So it wasn’t until after the year was up and suddenly the retailer was expecting to get paid for these goods and services that they defaulted on those payments. The fraudulent operators defaulted on those payments. As a result, they came back after him to pay for these things. He said, “Well, I don’t have that television set. I don’t have that electronic equipment. That’s not me.”", "“Well, prove it’s not you”: All of a sudden, it seemed like the onus had been reversed on Mr. Murray to prove that it wasn’t him who had acquired these things. The retailer was saying, “Maybe you bought these things, sold them off, and now you’re just trying to escape paying for them.”", "Normally, when you find someone has breached your personal information as identity theft has occurred, you would have a chance to go back to that retailer and see the video evidence of whether, in fact, it was you who purchased those things. That’s often used in order to rectify a credit card fraudulent situation. But in the circumstances where you don’t pay for a year, where you’re not expected to pay for a year, all that security data has disappeared. It became impossible to use that kind of information to prove it.", "It became a very lengthy process in order to clear Mr. Murray of his personal debt. He spoke to me about this numerous times, on how we could address that. It may be another amendment we might contemplate. Maybe this is another private member’s bill at some point; I don’t know. But maybe it can be addressed in regulation that any agency, any retailer that has no payment for a lengthy period of time, like a year, should be required in law or in regulations to hold on to security tapes until the payment part gets triggered; maybe hold on to it six months after the payments are expected to start. That would alleviate a lot of the credit fraud.", "What we discovered as we were going through the opportunity here to protect people’s identity was that if we could simply just freeze their credit information—by freezing it, nobody can access it. I know that at the moment, I’ve got all the credit I want and need at this particular moment in my life. My mortgage is in place; I have a line of credit for extraordinary expenditures I may need; I’ve got a few credit cards. I don’t want any more credit. If I had the ability to go on and just freeze my score so that no other agency—no bank, no retailer, nobody—would have permission to use this, then that would go a long way to protecting people against identity theft or identity fraud.", "In a way, who is really benefiting from this? We’re actually, in many regards, protecting credit card companies and protecting retailers so they don’t get caught up in this whole debate about “is it your purchase, or is it not your purchase?” This goes beyond just protecting consumers; it’s actually protecting retailers and those high-interest-rate credit cards that may be excited and encouraged to give people credit that suddenly they have to charge, right, because the rate of default might be so high. That was what I thought was one of the most important pieces of this legislation that we had to get, and I’m so delighted that the whole freeze aspect has made it into this piece of government legislation, as it did before we prorogued the government earlier. This piece that allows people to freeze their credit scores is an extraordinarily important point.", "I remember that Mr. Murray’s chief of staff also had almost an identical situation. Maybe this is something that happens in downtown Toronto; I don’t know. It was devastating because it took so long to clear up their credit history that opportunities where they may have needed credit went missing. They weren’t able to, maybe, buy a property or rent a condo and this type of thing. So it’s extraordinarily important that we have this freeze in place.", "Now the other piece associated with getting free copies of your credit report: Part of this, I realize, was that I had a friend whose brother—we were trying to get him into a rental accommodation. The landlord insisted on having a credit report. Now, this particular person flies a bit under the radar. He doesn’t own a car with a loan. He doesn’t have credit cards. He has never really had to access credit as part of his way that he lives his life. Trying to facilitate this, I went online to see, and I was surprised. I was actually quite shocked to see that in order to get this information it would cost $36 to get the kind of report that the landlord needed in a speedy way. I went online and triggered the payment, because we were somewhat desperate. We needed it, and he needed to get this place in a hurry.", "As it turned out, they had no credit reporting score on this person, my friend’s brother. He doesn’t exist in the system—no driver’s licence, no car. He doesn’t exist, and so the report spat back nothing. So I had just spent $36 to get nothing. I thought, “That’s not fair.”", "What I found really intriguing about this, Speaker, is that they hold your information. They track your credit card expenditures, your mortgage payments and your car payments. They track all this material without you really knowing about it. You might sign a waiver with a bank because you want to get that loan, but they are tracking everything. This is your information. They don’t do this out of the goodness of their hearts, I can assure you, Speaker. They do this because they want to make money on it. They make money by providing the service to the people, the retailers, the banks and all these other agencies and financial institutions that want to do business with you, that want to give you that 28% Capital One credit card, which, by the way, I suggest you not take, because of your spending habits, particularly when you go down the US side and get to all those discount warehouses.", "They want you to have this credit, and they are holding your information. You should have the right to see your information and not have to pay for it. Under the current act, you do have the right to get that information, but you have to trigger it with a written request. It takes weeks until you finally get it, and maybe the need for why you wanted it, as the minister very eloquently identified—you want to buy a house. In this housing market, you’ve got to trigger these things in a hurry. Getting an apartment, you’ve got to trigger in a hurry, because you could lose out if you don’t have the information you need up front. Having the right to get it for free by writing and getting it in the mail? That’s just old school; right, Speaker? Canada Post is an honourable institution that has worked so well since the days of the Pony Express, but we have moved past that. Now we’re in an environment where we can do things online and we can do things electronically, and we should allow people to do that.", "In my private member’s bill, I suggested that people get five copies. Maybe I was being a little overly exuberant. And who was going to do this five times a year? I got that. In the current bill, we have put it back to two, and I am sure that has to do with the input that we received from the credit score agencies that maybe two is going to be sufficient.", "Speaker, that is how the bill came about that I wanted to move forward with. We also know that Mr. Dong, in his elevator act—and this is the second part of this bill. Again, I want to thank the ministry and I want to thank our side of this Legislature for the fact that they listen to us in the backbenches. They listen when we identify problems that we’re hearing in our community. We identify it, we bring it forward and we react to it. The member for Trinity–Spadina, he probably lives in the densest part of Canada with all the high-rises—particularly down in Liberty Village and all the other areas that he represents, Harbourfront high-rises, 40- or 50-storey buildings. This is probably one of the number one things he is hearing in his constituency, how difficult it is sometimes to get these elevators fixed in a hurry so that people don’t have to walk up 20, 30 or 40 flights of stairs in order to access their residence.", "So he brought that bill forward, and again, I am delighted that the minister’s office and the ministry were so responsive, that we do need to put some additional protections. I have these same issues in my riding. I represent an area called Crescent Town: five big, tall buildings owned by Pinedale. Three of them are rentals; two of them are condominiums. Something like 12,000 people live in, I think, five acres. Some 12,000 people: a very, very high density. It becomes a very serious problem for people to get to work, to get to school and to go shopping and come back when elevators aren’t running. Even if one of the three in a bank isn’t working, it means lineups. What happens—and we’ve experienced this on days where there’s mass movement in the building, for instance, to get to Eid prayer—is that everybody wants to leave at the same time so the elevators sometimes get overcrowded, and in getting overcrowded, the elevators stop working and it compounds the problem. It’s very important that we put in place the kinds of protections to ensure that elevators are going to be repaired in a timely manner.", "What else do we want to talk about here, my friend? The elevator act is important for all people who live in dense urban environments. I know that the Consumer Reporting Act is important to constituents that I have who need to access their credit reporting on a timely basis.", "What else am I going to talk about at this point?" ],

They will start to collect elevator data. You know, Speaker, that if you don’t measure it, you can’t fix it, so it’s very important that we collect the kind of data that’s necessary.", "We also have a problem in the industry and we’re trying to address that through apprenticeship rules, which is a second approach at the same problem in that we don’t have enough technical experts in elevators. It’s an area of labour shortage. I’m very proud that in our budget, we have added a whole bunch of new revenues to encourage people to get into job categories where there’s a demand in the marketplace and to open that up: skilled tradespeople who could be fixing elevators.", "We are going to ensure that elevator performance is published so that prospective residents can make better informed decisions before they rent or buy. You need to know if you’re in a building that consistently has elevators that are failing. It might be that they’re old, they need to be retrofitted. This is part of what we need to do to ensure that properties are kept up to a proper standard. If there is data collected and I want to—if someone says, “You’re going to pay a lot of money for this apartment on the 31st floor,” and you can ask and there will be a place to go and find out that, in fact, this building has a history of elevator issues, you might rethink that decision. You might rethink that decision on whether or not you are going to rent in that particular building.", "I had a wonderful nephew—this is a bit of a sad story, but it’s quite relevant to the whole credit score issue. My nephew Arthur Tevlin, who died quite young at, like, 22 of a heart attack—quite suddenly. He had just graduated from high school, he was at college and he was getting jobs and he was very active in the community. When he started to get that sense of independence, the first thing he did was he went out and got himself a credit card. It was a very high-interest credit card and he ran up a fair bit of debt. We were all concerned about it, but unfortunately, when he died—it was such a tragedy because he was such a young and incredibly vibrant person. We used to say that his heart was too big, Speaker. He died of a heart attack in his sleep; quite painlessly, we suspect.", "But he left a debt of about $18,000 in credit card bills because he had been encouraged to get this credit and do stuff with it. I recognize, again, that this is part of the industry where they want to give people, even when they may not be in a position, more credit than his job would have possibly allowed him to pay back in a reasonable time. Typically, credit card companies will just forgive debt in that kind of example, and that’s part of the reason we have high interest rates attached to those. They just forgive the debt. And they did. But as a family, we didn’t feel great about that, so we all got together at the Becel Ride for Heart. We all signed up and got sponsorships as a team in my nephew’s honour. We went out and we raised about the $18,000 that he owed so we could give it to the Heart and Stroke Foundation. It’s something we’ve done in his memory a number of times since.", "I guess we were saying earlier, about how we do need to collect the studies and the data associated with it.", "I want to go to another area." ],

You need this elevator service in multi-storey residences in Ontario because it will help address the inconvenience and the potential harm that residents experience. Improvements in the availability of elevators will help people make informed decisions.", "It will also help—and this is important, about the public safety. What happens when you have a fire on the 30th floor of a building and the paramedics, the fire service arrive or there’s an accident, and there’s no way to get up there? When you have a big fire, of course, you’re not supposed to go in the elevators but in order to respond quickly to get up there, you have to make sure—it’s important that elevators in the province are going to be in use. It’s almost part of the Fire Code. There should be a requirement that if one is down—you can never have all down at the same time, for instance, so education awareness for elevator owners.", "Also, for people with accessibility issues: We have the act, the Ontario disability act, and we’re two thirds of our way through trying to make sure that all public spaces in Ontario are accessible. Where they’re not, we take the necessary steps to make them accessible so that people have full and appropriate access. Elevators, of course, are an incredibly important piece of getting all buildings accessible in order to ensure that people with mobility challenges can get to where they live or can go visit a friend or get to their appointments back and forth. That’s an important component of why we need to do this and to improve elevators, and I know that’s something that the member from Trinity–Spadina was certainly focused on.", "I also understand that a lot of the work we have to do still is going to be in regulation, particularly in the credit reporting area. We need to sit down with the big players and make sure that we craft regulations that will be workable.", "I met with a group of people shortly after I introduced the private member’s bill, and they asked the question of me, “How are you going to monitor this? How are you going to know that a credit agency is actually getting back in a timely way?”", "They were offering up a solution where they would act as an intermediary between the consumers, the ministry and the reporting agencies so that they could, on real-time data, track whether people were fulfilling their obligations. When you, as a consumer, put in a request to get a copy of your report, for instance, it would trigger a timeline in a blockchain-secured environment so that once it’s fulfilled, you would know that you got the report in a timely way, as is required in the act and the regulations.", "I’m hoping that we can spend time with the large credit agency companies to ensure that they are working in a way that keeps this thing open and accountable and transparent for users across the province.", "One of the things I had also put into my bill initially—and it can be addressed in the regulations—is the requirement that credit agencies correct improper data in a timely manner. We had a timeline of two weeks, during the course of regulatory development. If you go online and see your credit, and it has a whole listing of things that aren’t yours, you need to correct that, and you need to be able to correct that quickly. I had put a two-week window in my private member’s bill, and we’ll see where that ends up.", "Speaker, you probably don’t know a lot of Arthur Pottses, but in the course of my life, I’ve got to know quite a few. My grandfather, in fact, was an Arthur Potts, a major general. My father’s twin brother was an Arthur Potts. He was a lieutenant colonel in the Canadian Armed Forces, and he had a son named Arthur Potts. So just within our own family, there were four Arthur Pottses.", "I recently met an interior designer who works for Holiday Inn—he helps decorate the Holiday Inns—and his name is Arthur Potts.

His name is Arthur Potts.” She looked at her a little askance and said, “Are you sure?” Because she knew the other Arthur Potts, who was the interior designer, and didn’t think that he would be dating her.

I was at the Cumberland movie theatres, and I was admiring this very beautiful painting. I said, “Wow. That’s really good.” So I walked up to see the name and what it was called, and the price tag. It was $24,000. It was a beautiful oil, with lots of dimensions in it. I’m standing there and I look at the name, and it’s Arthur Potts, the artist.

I think red tape is not necessarily regulation; I think it’s fair to say that we all support some forms of common-sense regulation.", "At the same time, I do want to just touch base that the concern that I have with this legislation is, as well, the lack of accountability of the TSSA.

Her family refers to their service dog, Jerry, as their “guardian angel.”", "However, service dogs can only serve their purpose if the dog has been properly well-trained so that the owner has control over the dog.

The dog was not provoked; rather, the six-year-old was just walking by. Was this dog a certified dog? What steps did the owner take to prevent this from happening? Airlines need to know that the dogs coming with people have been properly certified and trained so they can be allowed onto a plane. A similar case occurred in Ontario, where someone was asked if they could pet the dog and the owner said, “No, the dog will bite.” Well, if a dog is prone to biting, it just really shouldn’t be—it clearly wasn’t properly trained.", "We are having good work done in my community.

  "text" : [ "It is my pleasure to rise to speak to my private member’s bill, the Home Care and Community Services Amendment Act, 2018, or, as we refer to it in Windsor, Dan’s Law. It was named after a gentleman from Windsor who worked at the GM plant until it closed, and then he had to leave Ontario and leave his daughters behind. Dan and his wife moved to Alberta so that he could find work.", "Before I really get into Dan’s story, I just want to talk about how we ended up here. This is not the first time that we have debated this bill. In 2016, we went through this exact same process. It had all-party support, and it was sent to committee for consideration. It sat in that committee for 16 months.", "I think it’s important to point out, as a doctor who supports the bill pointed out to me, that the Chair of the committee that I sent it to, the justice committee, is a doctor. The medical community is not certain how a fellow doctor, someone who has sworn an oath to take care of people in this province, has not pushed to get this bill called to his own committee.", "It sat in committee for 16 months, and then the government prorogued. It’s important to note that the government also holds a majority on every committee, so they could have called the bill at committee any time they wanted. But they chose to prorogue, which means every piece of legislation put forward, whether by the government or any of the members of this House—they were all wiped clean, and we all had to start over again. This is why we are where we are today.", "Back to Dan Duma: Dan worked at GM, as I pointed out, until GM closed. He had to leave Windsor to go out west to work. He left his two adult daughters behind, and his wife moved with him. While Dan was living in Fort McMurray, he found out that he had liver cancer. After he received his diagnosis of liver cancer, the wildfires went through Fort McMurray. Dan was in hospital for treatment, and he wasn’t able to go home because his house was in the area where there were fires. They ended up having to evacuate all the patients out of the hospital in Fort McMurray and send them to Edmonton.", "Dan’s wife had to live in a hotel—not near the hospital, because there were many patients who had been transferred, so it was difficult for her to get a hotel near the hospital.", "While Dan was in hospital, he was told that he was not going to survive his illness, and that he basically had two options, because he couldn’t go back to his own home because of the fires. He could either go to the hotel and die in the hotel, or he could return to Windsor, his hometown, and be with his daughters and his wife.", "Dan and his wife, thinking what just about every Canadian thinks—I know I thought it, until I found out what happened to Dan. What most Canadians think is that we have a truly universal health care system, and that if you are Canadian and you live in one of our provinces or territories, it doesn’t matter where you are when you fall ill. You will get the medical treatment you need, and you won’t have to mortgage your house or mortgage your children’s futures in order to get that care. Unfortunately, that isn’t accurate.", "Dan came to Windsor, and they found out that if Dan went into hospital in Windsor and received care there, everything that he needed would be provided for him in his final days. All the medical professionals, all the medication, any of the equipment, anything that Dan needed medically in his final days would be provided to him, and his family wouldn’t have to shoulder the financial burden. If suddenly Dan’s health turned or he had some other symptoms, he would have been able to go to the doctor’s office and find out what was going on. That would have been covered as well.", "But as everybody in this room knows, and as the government says time and time again, most people do not want to die in hospital. That is not where they want to be. And the government has acknowledged that the cost of somebody being in hospital is much, much more expensive than if they’re able to go home or, if need be, if they go into hospice.", "Yet we have this red tape that financially prohibits people from coming back to Ontario, or if they are from another province and they have loved ones who have relocated here, it prevents them from coming to Ontario to be with those family members in their final days, because they do not qualify for home care. It’s not deemed medically necessary under the interprovincial billing model that we have now, so they would have to pay for everything.", "Dan’s family would have had to pay for everything if he was to die at home with his family. He also didn’t qualify for care in hospice. That also would have been a cost to his family, if he even qualified to get into the hospice. He would have been responsible for his medication. He would have been responsible for all of the equipment. He would have been responsible for the bills for all of the medical professionals who would have been taking care of him.", "It’s truly unfortunate that after hearing Dan’s story—and with all-party support—16 months later, we’re back here starting this again.", "In that time, I have had other doctors come forward and share their stories about their patients, but first I’m going to start with Dr. Nadia Alam.", "Dr. Nadia Alam is the president-elect of the Ontario Medical Association. She joined me for a press conference today, and I’m just going to share some of her comments.", "She said, “Our humanity is defined not just by the way we treat the living, the sick, the needy, but also by the way we care for the dying. Dan’s Law is about end-of-life care and how government rules can make all the difference in the world in providing good end-of-life care or bad end-of-life care.”", "Then she went on to say, “Any of us here today could be Dan Duma.", "“This is where the story becomes surreal. Nobody—not Dan, not his wife, Ana, not his daughters, Laura and Andreea, not even his palliative care doctor, Dr. Darren Cargill—nobody could have guessed that Dan Duma would be denied palliative home care. Nobody guessed that he would be denied something as simple as PSWs or nursing support to help with his care, his bathing, his clothing, his mobility, caregiver relief for his family.", "“The reason why he was denied? Bureaucratic red tape. The rule is, to qualify for OHIP coverage of all basic services, a person has to have lived in Ontario for three months straight. In-hospital care is covered, but palliative home care, not so much. Here’s the thing: Dan did not have three months more to live. He had terminal cancer and lived just about a month before passing away. Dan was denied his final wish: to die at home.", "“Think about it: There is no compassionate exemption to this bureaucratic rule for terminal patients who have only weeks to live.", "“Our humanity is defined by how we treat the dying. No doubt the government failed Dan. But there are other men and women stuck in the same nightmare all over Ontario. We can do something for them. We should do something for them. Dr. Lisa Fischer cares for one such patient in Ottawa.”", "I’m going to share the story she sent me about her patient. Dr. Fischer said, “My patient moved to Ontario from Alberta to be supported by his family after receiving devastating health news. I feel, as his palliative care physician, that I am delivering care below the current standard as, without access to OHIP and community care, I can’t best manage his symptoms while at home. Additionally, he is not eligible for supports in the home such as a personal support worker, home nursing, physio and occupational therapy. These are all key factors to ensure maximum comfort and symptom management outside of hospitalization. Lastly, without OHIP coverage, he is not eligible to access hospice services should and when the time comes.", "“This gentleman is at high risk of ending up admitted to the acute care hospital, which is exactly what [he] and his family are trying to avoid.", "“The three-month wait period to access OHIP services is a huge barrier that is affecting very vulnerable Canadians at an extremely difficult point in their lives. Sadly for some, they don’t have three months to wait.”", "I think that’s a pretty strong statement. We are not talking about somebody who is going to come here with a chronic illness and could survive for years; we are talking about people who are coming here with very serious health issues, people who are returning to Ontario or coming to Ontario for the first time because they have family here and they know that when the end of their life comes, they want to be at home or in a hospice, surrounded by their loved ones. I don’t think anybody in this room would want to deny somebody that. At some point, this could be any one of us in this room. We could have a family member from another province who wants to come back and be with us in their final days. Currently that is not possible unless they have the financial means to do that.", "I think it’s important to note, in the little bit of time I have left, some of the organizations, some of the professionals that have signed on and supported this bill. These are medical professionals, people who work either directly with patients or indirectly in the hospital system or home care system. I have Dr. Shawn Whatley, who is the current president of the Ontario Medical Association, and, as I said, I was joined by Dr. Nadia Alam, who is the president-elect of the OMA; Dr. Darren Cargill, who is the medical director of the Hospice of Windsor and Essex County, the doctor who came to me about Dan and has really been such an incredible support in not only drafting the legislation but bringing awareness to the issue and bringing in some of these other professionals to realize that there is legislation here that could help their patients; Marnee Wilson, the president of the Nurse Practitioners’ Association of Ontario; Sharon Baxter, executive director of the Canadian Hospice Palliative Care Association; Vicki McKenna, president, Ontario Nurses’ Association; Dr. David Henderson, president, Canadian Society of Palliative Care Physicians; Dr. Laurent Marcoux, MD, MSc, president, Canadian Medical Association; Fred Hahn, president of CUPE Ontario; and Shirlee Sharkey, president and CEO of St. Elizabeth Health Care.", "When we started this bill down this path in November 2016, I had four, maybe five organizations that had signed on. In the 16 months that this sat waiting for the government to do something with it, that list—and this was just a short list that I read—has doubled or tripled in size. They need to pass this legislation before we rise for the election." ],

I would also like to acknowledge Dr. Darren Cargill for his advocacy on this issue and other issues related to palliative care.", "As the member from Windsor West would know, I met with her and Dr. Cargill on this issue several months ago. We talk about it with some regularity. I know they both know, and I want to assure them again, that I’m committed to resolving this issue.", "As the parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Health, I’ve had the mandate to develop a comprehensive strategy for palliative and end-of-life care in our province. It’s a mandate that I asked for and one that I’ve had for the past four years.", "My commitment to access to quality end-of-life palliative care stems from my family’s own experience. In October 2013, my father was diagnosed with an inoperable oral cancer. He was told by his oncologist he would receive three palliative radiations so that he could spend his final few months being able to eat and have less pain. He also told him somebody—this was on a Wednesday—would call him Friday to schedule those treatments right away. Friday came and nobody called. Next Friday came and, despite repeated calls, nobody called. That got resolved.", "Then he finished his palliative radiations, so my sister called his care coordinator to access more support in the home. It was three weeks before Christmas. The response from the care coordinator was, “I’m retiring, and you will have a new case coordinator in January.” When you have only months to live, two or three weeks is a very long time; I know that.", "This morning I read the story as well of Professor Paul Adams and his wife, Suzanne—they lived in Ottawa—and their journey. Suzanne had metastatic breast cancer. It’s a story that everybody should read, from July of last year.", "I was reminded of how they moved through our hospitals and our health care providers and did not get a palliative care assessment until her final days, when she arrived in the emergency room. There should have been a safe path for them earlier on their journey. I believe that, in the face of suffering, we all have an obligation to get people on a safe path. That is what we have been focused on, providing access by creating pathways to care.", "As part of our plan, we are providing 200 new hospice beds across the province. We’ve increased operating funding to hospices and visiting home hospice. We’ve supported the development of advanced care planning initiatives, volunteer training and caregiver support.", "We’ve invested in perinatal hospice at Roger Neilson House and Emily’s House. If nobody knows what perinatal hospice is, it’s when you get a life-limiting diagnosis in utero and the doctor says to you, “Your baby is at great risk and you have a choice to make.” Often what happens is, you have a choice to make and then there is no support. This is something that’s in this year’s budget that I’m very proud of.", "We have increased training opportunities to support health care workers in long-term care to better deliver palliative care. We’ve implemented a new capital program providing $200,000 per bed to offset the cost of hospice construction.", "We have also created the Ontario Palliative Care Network to advance the provision of quality palliative care in the province. At the core of their strategy is access. Better access is the most important thing we can do. Although the number of people who come to this province to join their family before they die is very small, it is an issue of access and it is important.", "Home care should be part of the Canada Health Act. Home care is such a large part of provincial health care services that it should be guaranteed nationally in law. We should have portability and reciprocity.", "Unfortunately, we can’t wait for that to happen, and that brings us back to the experience of Dan’s family. There were efforts by Dr. Cargill and others to help the family care for their father. Those efforts gave support to the family, and the reality is that much more could have and should have been done for them. We must do better.", "Again, I believe that in the face of suffering and human need, we all have an obligation to get people onto a safe path. We need to address that gap that exists and deal with what’s in front of us in real time, right now.", "As a member, I have been faced with similar situations. It is possible to find solutions in the community to support families. The member from Windsor West read a letter, and I want to assure her I’m working with that family and that physician to find a solution. It’s not always easy and usually requires the participation of a number of community leaders. I have found that working with community-based partners like hospices, community health centres, community services, visiting home hospice, regional pain and symptom management teams and palliative care regional teams, you can put together a solution. They have the flexibility that is needed. I find there is always goodwill in the community to get this done.", "One of the key things I’ve discovered about hospice palliative care across this province is that communities have taken their capacities, used them in different ways and achieved the same outcome. So the hallmark of palliative care is collaboration. Having said this, in these situations it is always a big effort that requires a number of people to engage to get that safe path established.", "It would be easier if the pathways were the same for everyone, and until we find a permanent solution, I want to let any member of this Legislature know that if you are confronted with a situation like Dan’s family, I am at your disposal to help you and your community and that family find a solution.", "As the member from Windsor West would know, I fully support the intent of Dan’s Law. I do believe it may be the best approach to take a regulatory approach, and I think we can fully achieve the intent of what you would like to do and what we all need to do together.", "I want the member from Windsor West, Dan’s family and everyone to know that we’ve been working to develop a permanent solution so that families like Dan’s in the future will have a safe path to support them at their most vulnerable time. To that end, I know that the Minister of Health intends on bringing forward this issue to cabinet next week.", "There’s still work to be done to get this over the finish line. I want you to know I’m fully committed to getting this done. I want to thank the member from Windsor West again for providing another opportunity to debate this bill, and I look forward to working with her and all members of this Legislature to ensure that families, at a time when they are most vulnerable and in their greatest need, have all the support they need." ],

In that time, the other province is responsible for covering medically necessary visits. Access to physician and hospital services is covered, but the gap lies when patients need home care. In my view, Bill 5, as proposed, effectively bridges this gap in home care and community services, like palliative care, by eliminating this wait time.", "When we last debated this particular bill, which was November 17, 2016, I had the opportunity to speak on that bill and supported it, because the bill at that time put patients first, counter to the government’s choice to focus home care funding in bureaucracy rather than in front-line home care services.", "According to the Auditor General of Ontario’s September 23, 2015, report titled Community Care Access Centres—Financial Operations and Service Delivery, the Auditor General found that 39% of the funds allocated for home care by the government are funnelled into bureaucracy rather than front-line care, resulting in less care, like palliative care, being provided to the Ontarians, like Dan, who need it most.", "Lao-tzu, the Chinese philosopher, once said that life and death are one thread—the same line viewed from different sides. I’ve long been guided by the belief that how we care for each other at the end of life is as important as the beginning of our lives. Palliative care focuses on living, not dying.", "Individuals are empowered to choose how they navigate their final journeys, and their families receive the necessary support in preparing for their loved one’s last stages of life. Eliminating the three-month waiting period will allow many to choose the route of their final journey.", "What happens at the end of someone’s life often results in a very powerful memory, either a positive memory or a negative memory, of how that person lived and also how the health care system served that person.", "What is clear is that there’s no medical justification to require a three-month waiting period.", "Sadly, many Canadians who are returning to Ontario, like Dan or others, to spend time with their families cannot afford to wait three months for home care and community services.", "Removing the three-month waiting period is in line with what Ontarians expect of our universal health care system. This will necessitate a greater focus on home care, and health care more broadly, as evidence has shown that, when properly supported, home care services often result in higher patient and caregiver satisfaction, particularly with end-of-life care.", "The proposed bill under consideration would ensure that Ontario’s health care system provides care for all by truly putting patients first and removing an unnecessary barrier to accessing home care and community services.", "In conclusion, Ontarians want and deserve a health care system that helps them live independently at home, where we know they want to be. That’s why I’ll be supporting this proposed bill today." ],

In our final hours on this earth, may we all find the peace and comfort and care from dedicated professionals, without the stress and tension that Dan Duma’s family had to go through. A home isn’t just a place where you live or have lived; it’s also a place where you find comfort, where you can feel safe, and where you can be cherished. Is that too much to ask from a government?

Basically, today we’re talking about home care and community services—to amend the act so that we can provide end-of-life care, palliative care, home care, whatever is needed, without a waiting period. Right now, if you move from province to province in Canada, you are subjected to a three-month waiting list to get OHIP and to get home care. Emergency services are covered. I think it’s problematic—and I’m a little surprised that nobody has addressed it today. The fact is, we’re all Canadians and we have a national medicare system, as we used to call it. People are quite shocked, when they go to another province, that they’re covered for emergency care, but sometimes when they want to get other care for whatever reason—they’ve gone to help a daughter, maybe, who has had a child and they’ve relocated to another province for months—they have this three-month waiting list in order to receive any kind of health care and support and home care.", "I think that discussion has to take place between all of the provinces. Yes, Ontario should be at the forefront, and we all support this, and we all support ending the fact that people have to wait three months to get home care and palliative care, which is what we’re focusing on today, but we should be having that discussion with the other provinces, because otherwise we could create an imbalance whereby people are coming to Ontario and receiving care that may not be accessible or permissible in another province, which makes it unfair.", "I think we all remember a few years ago—we were all quite shocked. A woman had to be transported by air ambulance, I believe in Alberta. I think she was on some type of vacation. She had to be transported and she got a bill for $10,000 for an air ambulance. She was an Ontario resident, a Canadian citizen, and she got stuck with this incredible bill, because apparently you are not covered for air ambulance services for an emergency. This was an emergency medical situation in another province, and people learned to their surprise that they’re expected to get some kind of health travel insurance in order to go to other provinces to get this type of service covered.", "Maybe it’s our fault as legislators that we’re not getting the word out to our communities. Maybe it’s understood by Canadians that they expect to be covered in other provinces for emergency services, home care services and palliative care services. Maybe we need to have that discussion with our federal counterpart and ensure.", "One of my constituents, Emma Kaplan, actually told me recently that she hoped we were supporting this bill, because she had a situation where her grandmother was a palliative patient and would have benefited from this type of legislation. The grandmother came to Ontario to be with her family, and had to receive end-of-life care in a hospital because it wouldn’t be provided at home. Unfortunately, we see this all too often, Madam Speaker: People find out the hard way how the rules are and how the rules are applied.", "I think the term that was used previously was “compassionate exemptions,” and I think that we have huge bureaucracies, but it’s up to us to ensure there are methods to appeal, to receive compassionate exemptions in a quick and timely manner, so the rules can be applied maybe more fairly and maybe with a little bit of wiggle room that’s needed.", "I really hope to see this bill get moving along, and I think we heard a little bit from the government side that they’re having a cabinet meeting soon to maybe just enact this legislation and not wait for it to go to committee and third reading.", "Thank you, Madam Speaker, and I’m looking forward to celebrating with my colleagues." ],

This means that they can access a physician in hospital care, but not qualify for home or community care. This is obviously the health care gap that exists, and it has existed and we’ve known about it for quite some time.", "But what makes this more personal, obviously, and emotional, is that there’s a human connection. I think that when private members’ bills and legislation are driven by those human stories, they are all the more powerful. That has been my personal experience, and I think that most members in this House would agree.", "The fact that this motion is before us again is another opportunity for the government to acknowledge that this is a gap. We just heard the parliamentary assistant say that with this new health minister—because the last time this came forward, it was a different health minister, and that conversation was ongoing. But we’ve just heard, for the first time, I believe, that this issue will be brought to cabinet next week.", "We have three more weeks of this Legislature in advance of the election. It’s getting down to the wire. If there were any issues that this government could take action on, I think it would be this one, because in Ontario, this government, quite honestly, Madam Speaker, is sort of desperate for a good-news story. So let’s get it done, right?", "The other issue, of course, is that as the former finance critic I always look at the money. The health care system and the state of our hospitals is obviously in a crisis. We have brought these stories to this government day in and day out now for almost the entire term.", "The fact of the matter is that to be able to offer the opportunity for somebody to die in a hospital, at almost 10 times the cost, versus a compassionate home care situation where integrity is maintained and where people can spend time with their family and their loved ones—those broader principles and goals that have been part of a national conversation on dying with dignity can be honoured. So the member from Windsor West has brought forward this motion. We’re incredibly proud of the motion and of the work she has done on behalf of these families. We all have families in our ridings who fall under this category as well. I’m really hopeful that whatever happens at that cabinet meeting, it results in Dan’s Law passing and being incorporated going forward.", "This is an opportunity to do something good.

In other words, this bill would allow palliative care patients who move to Ontario, or return after residing in another Canadian province, to have some dignity and peace in their last days by giving them access to home care.

Despite the fact there’s no medical or financial justification for the waiting period, they are still required to wait three months for coverage, even if they have just one month to live. This is exactly what happened to Dan Duma, whose egregious case has prompted this amendment.", "Duma, a former Windsor autoworker, died fighting for the right to receive home care in his final days. He was refused home care services because he had spent some time outside his home province of Ontario. Dan left Windsor in 2013 for Alberta to find work after GM’s Windsor transmission plant closed. Tragically, while there he was diagnosed with liver cancer and was told he had only a month to live. Like most of us would want, Duma himself wanted to get back home to Windsor, to be in a familiar environment and spend his last days with his family and friends and see everybody he wanted to one last time.", "But upon return to Ontario there was no comfort to be found. Duma was told by our health bureaucracy he did not qualify for any home care supports until he was in Ontario for at least three months—this despite the fact he had just one month to live.", "Madam Speaker, it is a shame this bill hasn’t been passed into law even though it was introduced here two years ago. The Liberal government unfortunately made the political decision to prorogue the Legislature, which means Dan’s Law, in the words of his palliative care doctor, Dr. Darren Cargill, “has remained in purgatory ever since.” That quote is in reference to the Liberal government’s move to first let this critical bill languish in committee for 16 months before wiping it off the books after prorogation.", "We don’t believe any person facing a terminal illness should be subject to waiting for end-of-life care. Canadians deserve timely access to health care. That’s what we call universal health care. That’s what we expect. That’s what we deserve. This is an egregious policy. It’s health care rationing. It’s causing unnecessary suffering and it’s uncaring.", "It does not even make sense from a financial standpoint. Think of it: An acute care bed costs an average of $1,000 a day compared to $250 to $350 a day for care in a hospice centre. This bill is an opportunity to make better use of acute care beds at a time when hospitals are over capacity and to provide the comfort the person is requiring. Giving families support to care for a loved one at home costs the province between $150 and $250 a day.", "The change is supported by patients, their families and the medical community, including the Ontario Medical Association and Ontario Nurses’ Association.", "I urge the Liberal government to stop their hollow election promises and pass this amendment. If they truly want better care for the people of Ontario, this is one way that they can stand up and show it. After all, does this government not support care for people? Do they not support timely access to care for people who are suffering? Do they not support end-of-life care, Madam Speaker? In Duma’s case, the government put bureaucracy above caring and left a dying man without care at his most critical time. If this government sincerely cared about people, they would stop hiding behind election slogans such as “A Time for Care” and they would swiftly pass this law, because Dan Duma did not deserve to die without care, nor did his family deserve the anguish and trauma of watching their loved one suffer.", "Bill 5 would ensure that access to care for the terminally ill is equitable, no matter the nature of their grievous illness and no matter where they live.", "Madam Speaker, I hope that everyone in this House will pass it today and ensure that no one else has to suffer without the care they deserve." ],

I believe that this is a critically important piece of legislation that identifies a glaring hole in our health care system and does the necessary work to fix the hole.", "Dan Duma, the Windsor resident whom the bill is named after, found himself in a really tough situation. After the General Motors plant closed in Windsor, Dan and his wife left Ontario for Alberta so Dan could go work in Fort McMurray. What was tough about this story that nobody has really talked about is that Dan worked in Local 1973 at the CAW transmission plant. Here’s a guy who was a hard worker—worked in a plant most of his life—and he had to make a decision, because there was no more plant in Windsor. He made the decision to make sure he could provide for his family, and moved out to Alberta. The sad part was, he left his two daughters behind. It’s not an easy thing to do later in your life.", "As we’ve heard from other speakers, they run the risk of slipping into this terrible gap if they have to return home. Once Dan was diagnosed with liver cancer, he and his wife returned to Windsor to be with his daughters, only to learn that palliative care needs would not be met by the province for a full three months. You have to ask yourself why.", "Here’s the part that I find interesting about this: Dan lived in Ontario. He paid taxes in Ontario from the General Motors plant. Through no fault of his own, the plant closed. A hard-working guy from Ontario moved out west. You would think, because he paid into our system all these years, that when he came back and needed that system to assist him, it would be picked up. What we found out was, it wasn’t.", "I haven’t talked to his daughters, but I’m sure that the last thing they were expecting when their father went to follow the work was that he’d be coming home to die and that when the decision was made that he wanted to die at home, the system would fail him.", "We spend a great deal of time in this Legislature speaking about issues in the province’s universal public health care system. What I’ve noticed time and time again is that this universal system doesn’t always seem to be truly universal. It surely wasn’t universal in the case of Dan. There are gaps when someone can’t afford their prescription medication. We can’t continue to boast about a world-class health system if we continually run into these gaps for the people in our communities.", "The worst part is that Dan is not the only person who experienced this gap in care in the province of Ontario. The member from Windsor West just said in her press conference this morning that she has been contacted by two doctors this week with patients going through the exact same thing.", "I will say to the Liberal Party—because I’m not going to be able to get through my entire speech—that you’ve had a chance to do this for 16 months. You have the full support of all three parties. We are asking you: Pass Dan’s Law before we rise on May 9." ],

To learn that it doesn’t, particularly where there are extraordinary circumstances in end-of-life care, is really extraordinarily troubling. I’m delighted to reinforce what I’ve heard from the parliamentary assistant: that our government is taking a very serious look at this.", "We’ve also heard people raise the issue of end-of-life care and hospice care. I want you to know that I take hospice opportunities, and I’m trying and working very hard with my community so that we can build an east-end hospice.", "When I was in university, in my third year, I wrote a significant paper on hospice care and end-of-life treatments, and interviewed workers in hospices and at Salvation Army Grace Hospital at Bloor and Church to get a better sense of the emotional demands, particularly on those hard-working people who work in those environments.", "We’re working with Rauni, who heads up Emily’s House in Toronto–Danforth.

Just this week, Speaker, I had a constituent concerned because her parent came from another country. She’s a new Canadian, and she’s here; she is a Canadian, lives in Ontario, has OHIP. Her mother came without the proper travel insurance. I wonder if we need to do something at the federal level—that people need to demonstrate that they have insurance. Her mother came into my community, got very ill, ended up in the intensive care unit at Michael Garron Hospital and, unfortunately, didn’t survive. As a result, as the family was collecting her remains, they were presented with a bill for in excess of $50,000, which they can’t pay.", "We need to ensure that people are covered off, whether it’s for provincial travel or international travel.

I would not have made it before the election, to be able to debate this bill again, and she gave me her time slot so that I could do this.", "I also want to mention that the importance of this bill is highlighted, not just because the OMA has come out and written a letter and signed off on a letter, or the president-elect came to a press conference. They have an election platform that they put out. They have a document that they put out, prior to the upcoming June election, with their list of priorities of what they want to see from the government, and Dan’s Law is within the first two pages of the OMA’s platform of what they expect from the government. I think that speaks volumes to their commitment as medical professionals, recognizing that they are the ones who have to tell these people that they cannot provide the care that they need and deserve, when they can’t give them the home care or they can’t put them into hospice.", "Dr. Cargill went above and beyond. He doesn’t mind me sharing this: He snuck Dan into hospice, and he treated him at no cost. All Dan’s family had to pay was for the medication.", "That should never happen.

It stems, Speaker, from some interactions I have had with the youth leadership in my riding, who participated with youth leadership across the province in various opportunities. This is the genesis, and I’m happy to have a chance to speak to it here today.", "Of course, Speaker, this comes in a long line of bills that I’ve had the pleasure of introducing in the House since I was first elected in 2014. I have had a little bit of success trying to find those important niche areas, a lot associated with consumer protection issues. You’ll be familiar, of course, with the tipping bill, Speaker, that required that owners of organizations where tips were being utilized couldn’t skim them, steal money from their employees. Of course, I will acknowledge that it was a bill that introduced by my previous colleague at Beaches–East York a number of times. It was a commitment I made to the community that if I were lucky enough to get elected, I would bring that bill back. He had four opportunities to bring it forward and to not have it pass; I brought it forward in my first year and we did get it passed. I’m delighted that we were able to do that.", "We also had a bill that I brought forward relating to daycare wait-list fees, non-accountable wait-list fees. That also came as a result of listening to consumers in my riding and hearing the concerns they were having about daycares charging a wait-list fee that was not accountable, that was non-refundable. We rectified that. I brought the bill in and worked with the ministry. We brought in the regulatory changes needed.", "Of course, the very exciting one that I did in 2016 was the Air Miles bill. As you know, with Air Miles, as they were planning to expire on December 31, 2016, we brought this bill and we actually convinced them, based on one province—one subnational jurisdiction in North America—not to do that, and they didn’t. As a result, consumers saved tens of millions of dollars in Air Miles points. I was delighted to be able to move that forward.", "Then, this morning, Speaker, you had the pleasure of listening to me in a somewhat impromptu debate we had around having consumer protection agencies and the new openness that we’re bringing to people getting their credit scores.", "This is not a consumer protection bill as such, but it very much is a participation. It very much a bill which seeks to address, I think, a developing need in our community. When I first brought the bill in in the last session, I acknowledge that I didn’t anticipate it to be even getting to second reading because I didn’t have a ballot spot. I anticipated to just open a discussion about whether 16-year-olds should have the right to vote.", "I’m delighted with the support that I have received across the province towards having this bill go forward. There has been some pushback on the other side, and I want to have a chance in my opening remarks to discuss some of those issues that were raised. But I do want to give a particular shout-out to some of the youth in my community—Charlotte Zronik, who was the president of my youth Liberal association, a Malvern student who is now in university; Noor Samiei, who currently is the president of my youth organization; Chris Knipe and Roya Shidfar—all who have done great work and are participating in politics at a young age and getting engaged in the community.", "They came to me in January and they said, “We’re so involved in politics. We know the issues and so many of these issues affect us. They affect us in a personal way about our futures.” Whether it’s the cost of going to university, whether it’s the cost associated with climate change, the increasing cost of housing and education, these bills fundamentally affect them; and they asked me why it was that they didn’t have a chance to participate.", "I thought that was a good question. So as I said earlier, it was my intention to just bring the bill forward so we could have a debate. We’re coming into an election. I don’t expect this to get past the government House leaders at this stage and be adopted as a private member’s bill in this session, and I’m actually okay with that. But I think it’s important that we take the issue back into our communities and listen to what people have to say about it.", "What I found particularly interesting, particularly amongst the naysayers, is that there is this attitude that youth aren’t mature enough. I would like to address that question of maturity head-on. There isn’t a maturity test for voting. Without being too hard on some of the people who have been extraordinarily hostile in the kinds of pushback they have had on this bill, as I see on a whole bunch of issues, where people are not being civil, where people are being nasty and angry and lashing out—if we had a maturity test, Mr. Speaker, there are a lot of people who have the vote now who probably shouldn’t be voting, if that were the basis of it." ],

I wonder: In some cases, are these the parents of teenagers? We all know that when kids hit that critical area where the hormones are starting to just go a little snaky, parents have a really difficult time with it, whether it’s from keeping their rooms clean, doing the dishes, doing their chores, just coming home when they’re just acting out. We know teenagers. I’m wondering if maybe all of this is negative reflective action from parents towards their teenagers. They don’t think that they’re responsible enough to vote.", "I kind of get that. But what I have experienced amongst the youth in my community is that those who want to be engaged in a positive way are doing so, and they are acting responsible. I don’t expect every child who hits 16 or every young adult who hits 16 or 17 to go off and participate, but I think it would be important as part of their growing up and part of the educational curriculum if you could have them brought into a program so they would better understand the issues and better understand the possibilities. And while they’re still at home, their parents can assist them in getting on the voters list, going to the polling station and sorting out the mechanics of it, because once a young adult has left the house and they’re into university or college in another city, it becomes a lot more complicated. It’s not something they’re used to. I think it would help establish a habit of voting and of voting whenever they could.", "I know that this has worked in my lifetime. My father, Speaker, as you know, was very active in politics when he first ran in 1963 for the Liberal Party of Ontario. He ran again in 1967. In my first campaigning, I was six years old, knocking in signs for my dad. My father used to take us to the polling station. I have six brothers and sisters, so you can imagine the little train we had. He’d take us because he wanted to reinforce that this is an incredible responsibility we have to cast a vote. People all over the world wish they could do the same. He would reinforce that with me.", "I brought that same attitude to my children. My daughter Robin, my older daughter: I used to bring her into the booth with me. My younger daughter, Dara: I used to bring her right into the voting booth.

We are certainly in strong support of this bill.” I appreciate that. I know that UNICEF works with children all over the world. As Scott has indicated to me, the presumption of listening and of a child’s having opinions that count is embodied in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. It’s embodied. It’s article 12, and I’d like to read into the record article 12 of the convention, Speaker. Article 12 says that children “have the right to give your opinion, and for adults to listen and take it seriously.”", "That doesn’t mean, in a sense, to give them the vote, but it means that their opinions count. I look at those young adults in Florida who have fundamentally changed the tone of the gun debate in the United States of America. Retailers are changing what they’re doing because these kids, who don’t have the right to vote, have done the protests and have brought attention to the issue, #NeverAgain.

If at 16 you do have the right to vote, would you have the right to stand for election at 16?

We have youth volunteering with us, and we’re seeing them on a fairly daily basis these days when we’re getting ready for an election. As the PC critic for children, youth and families, I’m interacting with youth in sometimes very difficult situations, and oftentimes they have to grow up way too young.", "I want to just talk a little bit about the motives. The member opposite had a media availability to present the bill, and he was joined not by youth advocates from all parties, but just from the Liberal Party. That makes sense; he’s a Liberal member. I’m just curious what the youth associations from the other two parties have to say about this. I’ve heard pros and cons from youth in my riding. Obviously, I would be interested to know if there was some kind of political motivation. We all know that when we look at the demographics of polling, the younger demographics tend to vote differently than the older demographics. We saw that in Scotland when they had a referendum in 2014. They allowed 16-year-olds to vote in the referendum.", "Maybe that is something that needs to be considered here. Maybe we want to pre-register our youth to vote when they turn 16. In order to vote on certain referendums, maybe we could have a few things on a type of electronic ballot, an online survey—pre-registered to vote, and then you can vote in some type of referendum. Maybe that could be a first step and we could see the results. We could see how many youth are really that engaged and interested and how they vote. Maybe there could even be comment sections. That is something I would like to see us work on fairly soon. That would be quite interesting for all of us, and I think we could get all three parties to support an initiative like that.", "I know that Quebec Premier Pauline Marois was suggesting lowering the voting age in Quebec. Again, she’s not with the Conservative Party—not that there is one exactly there, but there are more conservative-leaning politicians in Quebec, and she’s more liberal.", "I think that this is really about youth engagement. I would honestly support any effort that we can come up with to encourage our youth to be more engaged. I think that, as parents—many of us are parents, and we remember what our teenagers were like. We would have loved for our teenagers to be involved in community organizations and to be volunteering. We all saw that the schools really did help in finding things for the kids to do for their community service hours. We weren’t able to be partisan with those in-school volunteering things, but the kids do get community service hours. I know that I’m not the only one who signs for youth in my community—the high school students—to come out and volunteer. I know I’m not the only one in this Legislature who goes door-knocking with high school students and finds that, a lot of times, they know the issues and they know how to speak to people very well and collect the information in a very organized fashion, oftentimes better than the adults who go door-knocking with us. Certainly, we know—the member opposite mentioned a maturity test—that there are many youth who would score a lot better on that maturity test than adults.", "In our party, we have the member for Niagara West–Glanbrook, who is the youngest ever elected to the Legislature, at 19. He’s going to be speaking after me, and I think we’re all going to be very interested in hearing what he has to say about this initiative.", "We heard the member from Beaches–East York mention that we don’t have taxation without representation. I think that’s part of the crux of why people are against this. Should you be voting while you’re still in high school? We assume that people who are 18—they may be in post-secondary education, but they may also be working and paying their taxes. But 16-year-olds who are working at a full-time job and paying taxes are few and far between. Yes, they’re working part-time, and they’re filing their income tax if they are—and I would encourage that maybe that should be part of this, that we should encourage more of our youth to be filing income taxes and starting to think about putting whatever savings they have in tax-free savings accounts or RRSPs. By doing so, as the member opposite said, we’re getting them in the habit of voting.", "I think that there’s a lot of wiggle room here. I think that we’re going to be hearing, obviously, from all three parties here, but we’re going to be hearing, hopefully, from community members once they get wind, in the press or media, about this bill. We’re going to be hearing from them as well.", "I hope that we can steer the conversation towards how to get people to pre-register to vote—our youth—and how to get our youth engaged and aware. Maybe it’s something that will help revive some of our media as well and give them some support, if the youth are a little bit more engaged in following what’s going on in the media and in politics, instead of just getting their news from social media.", "Thank you very much, Madam Speaker.

Quite frankly, in 30 years of knocking on doors, I’ve discovered that there are a lot of 26-year-olds and a lot of 36-year-olds, 46-year-olds, 56-year-olds, 66-year-olds, 76-year-olds and even 86-year-olds who don’t pay much attention to politics, so I see that as a red herring. That’s not a qualification for voting right now: that you have to pay attention.", "But what I would like to talk about is some of the young people I’ve met who are 16 and 17 years old and who do pay attention to politics.", "Speaker, you know what a wonderful job our young trustees do, our student trustees, in representing their fellow students on the school boards across the province. Those students came to us when I was president of the Ontario Public School Boards’ Association and said, “We’d like to have a provincial trustees’ association, just like the adult trustees,” and they actually took the initiative to set up a provincial student trustees’ association.", "Then, if you’re Minister of Education, you have a body called the Minister’s Student Advisory Council, MSAC. Wonderful young people—tremendous diversity—all over the province apply to be on MSAC and come together to give the Minister of Education advice. Those are people who are highly involved.", "If I think about my own riding in Guelph, three out of the seven high schools hold all-candidate debates, and I never, ever miss those. The truth of the matter is, the quality of the questions you get from the 16- and 17-year-olds—because they’re focused on grade 11 and 12 students, who are 16 and 17 years old—the quality of the questions, I can tell you, Madam Speaker, are just as good as at any debate which is populated by and aimed at adults. So, given the opportunity, those 16- and 17-year-olds can really focus.", "At another high school in Guelph, I’ve got a civics teacher who, annually, when she’s got her grade 10 civics class—one of the assignments is that they have to find a current issue, they have to research the issue and they have to write a letter to a local politician advocating for whatever they’ve learned about that issue. We get amazingly interesting letters from this particular grade 10 civics class each year, which we take great delight in responding to. Again, it’s a group of average, everyday young people who are actually interested in politics and can articulate what they’re doing.", "What’s the point here? Well, to me, the point is that we have all sorts of information that tells us that people who vote once are more likely to vote again in the future. The best predictor of future voting is past voting. What an opportunity we have to start young people voting while they’re still in high school, when we can organize some education about the process.", "We actually have a model to do that. There’s something called Student Vote Canada, which is active in many schools across Canada and which organizes the infrastructure to teach students about elections, about researching candidates, and about researching platforms. They do a mock vote. They have a secret ballot. Incidentally, the vote from Student Vote Canada is more accurate than the polls, don’t you know. When they unseal the ballot boxes and reveal how the students voted, they’re always more accurate than the polls on the outcome. I think that with a bit of a massage, we could use that as an opportunity to get our young people engaged in voting while they’re still in high school.", "Thank you—a wonderful bill." ],

I think it’s fair to say that he is indeed young at heart, and perhaps in person as well—I was careful with my phraseology there.", "What we’re talking about today is reducing the voting age to 16 years of age. I was elected, as members in this House will know, at 19 years of age—actually, very shortly after my 19th birthday, so almost 18. Perhaps you might think I was one to avidly advocate for the reduction of the voting age. I want to just say that I think we have to be a little bit careful. We have to do our due diligence. As someone who worked in federal politics on the electoral reform committee and looked at some of the different methods of voting when it comes to mixed-member proportional representation or other methods of voting, we always have to make sure we’re not rushing into these sorts of decisions hastily, that we’re doing our very best to examine all the options.", "That being said, I think there is definitely a pro to this idea. We’ve heard already in this House about some of the lack of engagement among younger voters, and we’ve heard about some of the concerns that have been expressed about how we can send our young people off as soldiers and can expect young people who are 16 to get married with their parents’ permission, and yet we’re not willing to let them contribute in democracy to the extent that they can cast their ballots.", "I understand where this comes from, but a lot of this, again, is sort of anecdotal at best and perhaps just hypothesis at worst. We need to make sure that we’re actually looking at some of the metrics behind this and looking at some of the results in other jurisdictions.", "As well, what I want to do just briefly is to ask people in this Legislature to do a little bit of research into public choice theory. Public choice theory is, you could argue, one of the bases for our democracy. When we think about public choice theory, I like to use the analogy of the cow example, where if you have a cow and you have 1,000 people who decide to guess the weight of this cow, if you take the aggregate of that 1,000 people and divide it, you actually have the opportunity—" ],

I know this is a little old, but in the 2011 federal election, there was only a 38.8% turnout among people ages 18 to 24. So what should we be doing to increase voter interaction at that level? Having more people engaged—it doesn’t automatically follow that if you reduce the voting age, those people are going to get the opportunity to come out and vote.", "I think we’ll also have to look at the fact that just as we’re willing to let our young people join the military with their parents’ permission at 16 and get married at 16, we’ll also have to look at the reverse: You’re not able to buy a pack of cigarettes at age 16; you’re not able to buy a case of beer. Again, this is, I think, a good decision. We don’t want young people engaging in those types of risky behaviours.", "But when you look at the aggregate weight of casting that ballot, have those at that age thought through all the implications of their ballot in a way that we can understand?

We need to be looking at the opportunity costs of casting their ballot and whether or not we can be doing more to reduce that opportunity cost, whether that’s through online voting or other measures.", "I think there’s a broader discussion that needs to be had about the role of youth within the political process.

Voter turnout has been quite poor and on the decline. Even an enraged electorate is sometimes not that engaged in the electoral process. We’ve seen that.", "I was listening to the member from Beaches–East York as he was talking about one of the reasons why he connected the child care wait-list issue from consumers in his riding—I prefer to call them citizens; they’re not really consumers. He heard from those people, and then he petitioned his own government to get rid of the child care wait-list fee. Well, there should never have been a child care wait-list fee in the province of Ontario, but it is an important example in some respects as to how the voices of the citizens that we’re elected to serve can actually inform policy. When they do speak up, there’s a responsibility that we, as members, have to actually bring forward their concerns, sometimes even when we don’t agree entirely with them. But if it’s in the best interests of the people of the province, then we actually have a responsibility. So there is a two-way street.", "The question, though, for the member from Beaches–East York, is—he was vague on the fact that—would he actually vote to have 16-year-olds have the vote? He said that there’s a lot of back-and-forth and there are lot of pros and cons out there, so I’m not really quite sure where he stands on that.", "I do believe very strongly that 16-year-olds have a lot to contribute to democratic institutions, be they school boards or city councils or provincial Legislatures or federal Legislatures. I think that, genuinely, 16-year-olds are hungry to be involved. When they see the systems that are working against them, be it really high tuition or transit that doesn’t work for them, or the cycling issue that I’ve brought to this Legislature around vulnerable road users and strengthening the rights of those people, like pedestrians and cyclists, to have better recourse and more meaningful consequences for serious injuries or deaths—when an issue connects them to the institutions that really dictate their lives. When I go to speak at high schools, I tell them, “Everything is political; it really is, from the water that you drink to the air you that breathe to the roads that you walk on.” So I encourage their participation, because their participation can be incredibly meaningful.", "Like the member from Guelph, I was president of the Ontario Public School Boards’ Association. I have a deep respect for the student trustees in the province of Ontario. In many instances, their questions at the boardroom table resonated with the lived experience of the students we were serving and so had great weight. Those questions were informed because they were living out and experiencing the educational policy that we were determining at that board table. That’s an important part of a democratic process.", "It’s really interesting to hear the member from Niagara West–Glanbrook talk about his involvement with electoral reform, because electoral reform is one of those indicators and one of those measures that we could actually have taken in the province of Ontario back in 2007 to improve the democratic institutions such as this by having a mixed-member proportional election process where people don’t always have to choose a Liberal or Conservative or New Democrat—perhaps a Green candidate. That was really a missed opportunity.", "He seems to be also in agreement with the Prime Minister, who promised electoral reform: that the last election was the last first-past-the-post. But then once he got back into power, he decided, “No, we have to slow things down. We don’t want to rush into this.” This is the problem with power: Once you have it, the human instinct—and, actually, patterns will demonstrate that—is to hold on to that power. That power imbalance is very much part of this debate, with youth and engagement and voting.", "I have to say that our civics curriculum could be a better curriculum. If I had greater confidence in the civics curriculum in the province of Ontario, I have to tell you, I would feel very confident that the voting practices and the voting engagement of 16-year-olds would be done in a very responsible manner. That’s saying something, because my husband is a very, very good civics teacher in Waterloo-Oxford, and he challenges his colleagues across the entire board to make sure that that curriculum is current and it’s up to date. If you have the same civics curriculum and you’re delivering it every single year and it’s the same and never changes, then you are doing a great disservice, I think, to the students who are in that classroom. I think the civics curriculum in the province of Ontario could be better. It can be stronger. That’s an important part, I think, of this debate.", "In summary, it is time for this decision to be made. The politics at play here, though, are obviously—we have three more weeks of the Legislature. Private members’ bills rarely go anyplace, much to our chagrin on this side of the House. I think that an important distinction to be made will be that giving the vote to those who are under 18 will only be useful if it is part of a larger non-partisan effort to address democratic engagement at all ages. That’s something, quite honestly, that we should all be invested in." ],

I was kind of stunned when I heard the member from Niagara West–Glanbrook say that maybe, when people are between the ages 16 and 18, they’re not able to weigh the importance of their vote. Well, I tell you, I think I know lots of people between 16 and 18 who have a lot more competence, a lot more knowledge and a lot more vision than many people 18 and over. I don’t think at age 18 you automatically gain that competence. So I would say: Let’s encourage more people to get engaged.", "The biggest reason I support this is because it means that students would be able to cast their first vote when they are in high school. It means those civics classes take on a real sense of importance because people will make decisions while they are in that school year. So I completely support it.", "I think also we have to remember that younger people have more at stake in the decisions that we make than we do.

I look forward to wholehearted support.

Over the past three years of running this program, I’ve had the express privilege to witness first-hand just how politically engaged our young people truly are. These are young girls in grades 7 and 8, from ages 12 to 14 years old. They care about and are attuned to their community issues and certainly have opinions on them that they want to express. Not only are they attuned to the issues in their community issues and certainly have opinions on them that they want to express—not only are they attuned to the issues in their community, Madam Speaker, but in communities around the world.", "One of the exercises we did as a Girls’ Government group was to debate an issue. The topic for our debate was whether the voting age in Ontario should in fact be lowered to 16 years old from 18 years old.", "At the time, the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida had just happened, and the students there had just challenged senators and congressional representatives and engaged them in a substantive debate on gun control.", "What was going on south of the border, and the #NeverAgain movement, became a core element of these young girls’ debate in my constituency office. Let me tell you how impressed I was to hear 12- and 13-year-old girls speak about gun control, the importance of the issues and the importance of what was going on south of the border.", "This is all for the simple reason that the issues in our communities affect young people directly. A number of the government’s most recent policies are impacting youth as primary stakeholders. If people aged 16 can drive, work, pay taxes, join the military and make their own choices about medical treatment, they should also be allowed to vote. Young people have a stake in the game, and it’s time for us to respect that.", "We demand more from our youth than ever before, expect more from them in their studies, and give them more responsibilities to fulfill.

It certainly moulded me into the partisan that I am today, and the activist. I’m very proud of having had that experience. I think it’s an important part of civics, and civic engagement, for youth to be involved.", "In fact, when I give some thought to this bill, I reflect on our own party structure. Of course, we all have youth wings of our parties, and those youth, whatever the parameters are of their involvement—if there is a threshold of 16, or at least 15, or down to 14—we involve them. It’s important. They contribute enormously. I was honoured to be a New Democratic youth as a youth, whatever that age was. It seems like forever.", "But we also, as partisan youth, got to vote on partisan policy. In a sense, we were shaping the party’s policies. I know that sometimes, there was some heated debate where the youth wing of the parties overturned motions that were on the floor, just by engaging and organizing and mobilizing. That’s an important lesson to learn.", "Let’s bring it right now to the reality of this bill, to give the franchise to those youth who are interested in being engaged, are already engaged, or don’t know how to be engaged. I think this is a great first step forward.", "Also, as now an elected official—and previous to being an elected official, in my three failed attempts to win an elected seat federally, prior to winning provincially—I embarked on a campaign to engage with local youth in my riding of Essex.", "I will never forget, and am eternally grateful to, my good friend Tania Petro, who is a teacher at Pavillon des Jeunes school in Belle River. Tania was the first teacher—she was teaching grade 5 at the time—to invite me to her class as a candidate—a failed candidate at that—to come and talk about my experience in trying, through the election, and to teach the kids about what I knew about civic engagement and politics.", "Since that time, I’ve done, I would say, dozens of different schools and classes—the grade 5 and grade 10 classes—and I have never heard such insightful commentary and ideas than from those youth. Why is that? Perhaps, Speaker, it’s because they’re not tainted by partisanship. They are altruistic. They are focused on the big picture. They are focused on achievables. They don’t get into the dirty business of having to please one sector or another, the nastiness that we all know exists in politics. They are focused on solutions.", "I think that that could breed so much more optimism and a better system overall that this is certainly a worthy endeavour and a worthy policy for us to look at. I commend the member for bringing it forward, because I’m certain that in the schools that he has toured through in his tenure as a member, he has heard that time and time again.", "What I always did was that I would split the class up, representative of the mixture of the House here. We would have a mock debate and would decide which policy we wanted to debate. Inevitably, it would be lowering the age of voting. It was always a great debate with lots of wonderful ideas. Of course, there are some youth who might be apprehensive about that for whatever reason, but the majority of the time the vote always came out on the side of allowing those 16 or older—or whatever the parameters were that that class may have put in—to be part of the process, to be engaged and, ultimately, to cast their ballot for the future of this province.", "I think it’s something that is worthwhile for this Legislature to look at.

He is old way beyond his years, and I commend him for how articulate he can be.", "The member from Kitchener–Waterloo reluctantly acknowledged the importance of these bills and how I brought them forward. But that’s okay. It’s clear. I want you to know that I’m absolutely clear. Like the member from London North Centre, I totally, completely and absolutely support the right of 16-year-olds to have the vote. That’s why I’m doing this. We need to hear what other people’s points of view are, and that’s really important. I hope we get a lot of that as part of the debate.", "The member from Davenport: I want to commend her for the excellent work she continues to do with young people in her riding—" ],

This bill simplifies the process of suing fossil fuel companies for the cost of damage from their operations and their products. The bill makes it more likely that governments, businesses and individuals will be able to secure compensation for costs to prevent such damage.", "Typically, in this House, when we debate climate change, we talk about the need to reduce emissions to avoid damage in future. That really is the critical starting point. I think that we are entirely right to talk about mitigation, about reducing our emissions. We know that if we don’t slow down and stop climate change, then we’ll see ever-escalating damage from extreme storms, floods, wildfires and rising seas.", "We’re seeing damage now, which we have to pay for. We’re going to have to invest a lot to protect ourselves, our homes and our cities. The stakes are very high. We’re not talking about the far future.", "Let me just note some of the costs that people in Ontario are already encountering. We can start with Windsor. In 2016, the Windsor Star reported that on Thursday, September 29, record rainfall hit Windsor-Essex county and resulted in a declared state of emergency in both Windsor and Tecumseh. It’s estimated that the insured loss reached as much as $108 million, with no telling how much damage was not covered by insurance. That was September 2016.", "Then, in 2017, August 28 to 29, rains brought major flooding to Windsor, Tecumseh and other parts of Essex county. The Windsor airport broke a rainfall record. Over 1,000 basements were reported flooded, and water levels were waist-high in some areas. The Insurance Bureau of Canada reported that a significant flooding event in Windsor resulted in more than $124 million in insured damage.", "In just two years, Windsor got hit with over $200 million in flood damage, in both years from record rainfall.", "It’s not just insurance companies that will be called on to help people in trouble. Canadian Underwriter put out an article about our good colleague from Windsor–Tecumseh, Percy Hatfield. They headlined it, “Windsor Residents ‘Disappointed’ with Ontario Government Response After August Flooding: NDP.”", "September 22: “During question period at Queen’s Park,” Minister “Mauro was asked Thursday by Percy Hatfield, the New Democratic Party municipal affairs critic, when the government will ‘update the coverage guidelines’” for disaster recovery assistance, “‘especially for those who can no longer qualify for private insurance.’”", "A lot of people are not going to be able to qualify for private insurance against flooding in the future.", "The head of underwriting for Swiss Re in Canada was quoted in that same article saying, “Flood insurance continues to remain either not available or unaffordable for Canadian property owners in areas with high flood exposure.” Swiss Re found that “9% of Canadian homes are located in a 100-year flood zone and can be considered at risk for severe flooding.”", "Not only are insured claims rising, but there will be a lot of people who can’t get coverage at all. Governments will either have to step in to help people, or eventually people are going to have to move out of those areas because they’re no longer habitable. That will be incredibly expensive as well. We are not going to abandon those people. We’re not going to say, “Tough luck. Too bad.” No. We’re going to say, “The climate has changed. You are our neighbours. You are our fellow citizens. We’re going to assist you.” It is going to be pricey.", "I’m just going to leave Windsor with this: 2016, 2017, February 2018—again, flooding in Windsor from record-breaking rainfall over the long weekend. What’s common in all three years is that the rainfalls were record, and they simply overwhelmed the storm sewer system that was set up for another climate—one that’s gone, no longer here. We’re in a different world. That’s Windsor.", "Toronto: CTV reported on July 8, 2013: “A severe storm in Toronto flooded parts of the city, knocked out power to thousands, and shut down roads and sections of the city’s subway system Monday, as nearly 100 millimetres of water fell across the area in a matter of hours.”", "At the storm’s height, Toronto Hydro reported 300,000 people without power. People had to be rescued from a GO train trapped by flood waters in the Don Valley. According to Environment Canada, total rainfall surpassed 90 millimetres in some areas, beating records set in 2008.", "Speaker, there was a follow-up to that. The Toronto Star reported that the preliminary cost of that storm was $850 million, according to the Insurance Bureau of Canada. That was one of the most expensive natural disasters in the province’s history.", "And we’ve seen other damage: In 2005, a windstorm and rainstorm in the GTA cost $671 million; four days of heavy rain in July 2009 cost $228 million; and then there’s the $1.5 billion for the ice storm in Quebec in 1998.", "So the stakes are really high. We were lucky. None of these reports talk about loss of life, but they do talk about large volumes of money that are going to be needed to protect people and to pay for damages from extreme events.", "The National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy earlier this decade calculated that the national cost of climate change for Canada—this is for damage—could escalate from roughly $5 billion per year in 2020 to between $21 billion and $43 billion per year by the 2050s. In a worst-case scenario, the potential is there for costs to be at least $91 billion per year. We are talking about phenomenal burdens on our economy, and a very strong argument for mitigating the increase in greenhouse gas emissions, for dealing with climate change. But should we fail in any way, the costs will be extraordinary. Governments are going to have to act. Citizens are going to call on them to take action to deal with damages and to protect them.", "I haven’t seen a calculation for Ontario of what it will cost for us to adapt—to make sure our sewer systems are functional, to make sure that roads are properly protected, that gas pipeline infrastructure is dealt with—but the city of New York has done a calculation in their lawsuit that they are taking against five major fossil fuel companies. They say that they’ve already committed to spend $20 billion to protect that city from the impacts of climate change, with further billions to come as the seas rise higher, as temperatures rise and as rainfall increases.", "So we are talking costs in the billions. Even if we avoid the worst projections for costs, we’re talking tens and hundreds of billions of dollars per decade to deal with damage. We need legislation that will ensure that those companies, the fossil fuel companies—extraordinarily wealthy—are paying their fair share of those costs. It cannot all be left on the shoulders of average Ontario families. It can’t be.", "We do have a precedent. We’ve taken action in the past. Here in Ontario we passed tobacco liability legislation, as we’ve seen in many provinces in Canada. In September 2005, the Supreme Court found that BC’s Tobacco Damages and Health Care Costs Recovery Act was constitutional. That decision sets the basis for this kind of legislation, that in fact you can legislate for recovery of costs. We need some similar legislation here in Ontario.", "Some people may say, “There’s a big difference between tobacco and fossil fuels.” But the University of Alberta faculty of law publishes a blog, and last year they published an article “Do Comparisons Between Tobacco and Climate Change Liability Withstand Scrutiny?” They looked at the United States, they looked at Canada, and they concluded that, in fact, one of the most important things that happened in the United States with regard to the tobacco industry was the passing of legislation that allowed the use of statistical and epidemiological evidence to go after the liability of the tobacco companies. We need that. Prior to those pieces of legislation, it was very difficult to win against tobacco companies. But after it was passed in the United States, the industry went from never losing a case to settling for US$240 billion. We’re talking very big dollars. In a province that is already stretched to meet its social needs, its medicare system, its education system, its infrastructure costs, we can’t afford to take all this on. The fossil fuel companies have to pay their fair share.", "The Alberta law faculty blog went on say that there were real similarities between tobacco legislation and what they saw in the future as related climate legislation. They noted that one of the big similarities included well-documented campaigns of denial in the face of mounting scientific evidence in both contexts. The reality is, the fossil fuel companies are following the same playbook as the tobacco companies followed, and we need to act in a way that’s proven to be effective.", "New York City is engaged in a lawsuit with major fossil fuel companies, who they say—and they go into great detail in their lawsuit; I think it’s great reading. They said, “For decades defendants have known that their fossil fuel products pose risks of ‘severe’ and even ‘catastrophic’ impacts on the global climate through the work and warnings of their own scientists and/or through their trade association, the” American Petroleum Institute.", "“Yet each defendant decided to continue its conduct and commit itself to massive fossil fuel production. This deliberate decision placed company profits ahead of human safety, well-being, and property, and foisted onto the public the costs of abating and adapting to climate change.”", "They go into great detail about what the fossil fuel companies knew as far back as the 1950s. They knew that there was a risk of a catastrophic impact on economies and significant loss of life. They had the knowledge. They acted contrary to the interests of our society. They should be paying their fair share of dealing with the damages and the cost of preventing damage.", "We are able to put forward a piece of legislation like this because the science has changed. It’s much easier now to determine what the responsibility is of individual companies—that’s been studied—and to determine whether an extreme weather event is climate related.", "Speaker, the potential is there to protect Ontario, to set a precedent for the rest of North America, to build on the legislation that we already have in place to protect us from tobacco impacts. We need to pass this legislation." ],

I can say that we are looking forward to reviewing further his private member’s bill. We’re going to consider it as an opportunity to build on the work we’re doing to fight climate change.", "With that in mind, I just wanted to take a couple of minutes on that topic. I can say that Ontario has undertaken significant action in the fight against climate change. Our foundational block is our cap-and-trade legislation and program that puts a cap on the amount of pollution industry is allowed to spew into the air each year. It lowers the cap each year, and proceeds from our cap-and-trade auction—proceeds which, in this year, in the first year of the cap-and-trade program, amounted to some $2.4 billion, every penny of which must, by law, be invested in projects and programs that further reduce greenhouse gas pollution and carbon pollution.", "We are following this path of cap-and-trade. It has been shown, where it has been implemented with our partners in California and our partners in Quebec, to offer the most efficient way and the most effective way to reduce greenhouse gas pollution emissions at the lowest cost to Ontario residents and Ontario businesses.", "I’ll say it again, Speaker: Each and every year, the cap on the amount of greenhouse gas pollution that businesses are allowed to spew into the air is reduced, so that we can march towards our target.", "I can say that in 2014, Ontario exceeded its carbon reduction targets, in part because of the closure of the coal-burning plants that created electricity at great cost to the environment. We are on track to hit our 2020 targets, so we’ll continue to march in that direction.", "I can tell you, Speaker, that in the short time I’ve been in this portfolio, when I have had the opportunity to travel outside of Ontario, I am impressed by the stature by which other governments—national and subnational governments—hold Ontario. There isn’t an event that I have been to where folks from US states, from countries like Australia, New Zealand, Germany and the UK, haven’t sat down with us and said, “How did you put cap-and-trade together that is making such a difference? What advice would you have for us?”", "In fact, just a few weeks ago, the former Vice-President of the United States, Al Gore, was in Toronto talking to public school students from across Ontario, and Ryerson students. In his remarks, Al Gore said that he travels the world as a climate change advocate, and often, Al Gore is asked who other countries can turn to, and who has a model that they can look at. Al Gore says that when it comes to responsible leadership and action on climate change, “I always point to Ontario.” Speaker, I can reaffirm that in my travels, that’s exactly what I see: Ontario is seen as a leader.", "We have a cap on greenhouse gas pollution. It goes down every year. The model of cap-and-trade provides us with proceeds which we are investing in programs to further reduce greenhouse gas pollution.", "We have budgeted $1.9 billion per year over the next four years. Some of the things that we’ve invested in this year are: to improve social housing, $200 million; to improve colleges and universities, some $500 million; and $100 million to put into hospitals. All of this allows those facilities to take the money they would have spent on upgrading their facilities, the money they would have had to spend on energy—things like fossil fuels and burning natural gas—they take those savings and put them into the things they are supposed to do, which are taking care of their patients, taking care of their schools and providing a better environment for people who live in their social housing units." ],

Frankly, the slogan for the GreenON Rebates program is “Save Money, Fight Climate Change,” and that’s what Ontarians are asking us to do: to help them, to provide them with ways of fighting climate change.", "I’ll sum up and I’ll thank the MPP for Toronto–Danforth for this bill.

  "text" : [ "I am glad to weigh in on Bill 21, Liability for Climate-Related Harms Act. It’s always interesting to be a part of the broader debate and listen to the remarks from those around the room. It’s nice to also be recognized by the member who just spoke for our principles. It’s also refreshing to imagine that there are folks in this room who recognize principles still. I wonder if there are some who can’t, but here we stand.", "I’m glad to stand, of course, in support of this bill put forward by the member from Toronto–Danforth. Again, this is the Liability for Climate-Related Harms Act. There were some questions just raised by the Conservative member, and I’ll be glad to flesh out a little bit more understanding for them.", "This is a bill that provides a framework for citizens and for businesses and governments in Ontario to sue big oil and gas corporations for climate-related damages for their products. This is about the world’s largest fossil fuel corporations that need to start to take responsibility for the damage that they are doing, to be accountable and to pay their fair share when it comes to that damage.", "As we heard from the member earlier, we’re seeing remarkable damage and economic challenge in the wake of storms and catastrophes happening in our own communities. He talked about Windsor—I will as well—but we’re seeing across our communities that the costs are going up and we’re needing to call on those who are helping to create the problem to help be part of the solution, which is what we have here. This bill follows in the footsteps of the tobacco liability legislation that is in place in Ontario to allow governments to sue for health care costs.", "into the atmosphere to be globally detectable—so to the member who was asking about just how much methane, “globally detectable” is what we’re talking about in terms of the products. So if you are emitting enough methane to be globally detectable, then you may want to sort yourself out there. They should be paying the price for the climate-change damage that is currently being shouldered by our communities.", "I’m sorry that I missed his press conference recently. There were some heavy hitters who were there weighing in on this issue. Dr. James Hansen is a renowned climatologist and former head of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies. He said that in the US, there is already litigation under way by New York City, San Francisco and Oakland. He said, “Unchecked climate change is a threat to humanity. People need a variety of tools and strategies to protect our society. Holding fossil fuel companies liable for the damage from their products is a big step.” That’s a piece of it.", "Greenpeace’s senior energy strategist Keith Stewart was also at the press conference and said that elected representatives—ourselves and those who are seeking offices should demonstrate support for this bill because, as he said, “Just like the tobacco companies, oil and coal companies hid what they knew about the science in order to delay policy action that would shrink the market for their product.”", "When we think about fossil fuel producers who are responsible for emissions at a globally detectable level, they should be held strictly liable for the climate-related harms they cause in Ontario. This bill, as I said, sets out that framework.", "The member already talked about those who supported the bill, but I want to talk about what we see in our community, or what I have seen on my own journey.", "Back in 1998—I wonder if everybody here remembers 1998—I was in university, in second or third year, or whatever it was, living in Kingston. I remember the ice storm of 1998. At that age, I thought I was a grown-up and was independent, but when the lights went out and the power went off for days and we were without heat—we were resourceful, but it was quite a time. Kingston is a beautiful city. It’s a place that I have such a special place in my heart for because that is, again, where I decided to start being a grown-up. All of the trees were so damaged, and they came down. The ice was unbelievable. We had a little bit of fun the first day; we weren’t in crisis mode yet. But after a couple of days without water and without power and without heat, it was very challenging, and that was for young, resilient youth, all coming together. The struggle at that time was a lot—but it was the cleanup afterwards. It really was quite heartbreaking to drive around the following spring and see all of the trees that had lost all of their big branches. There was so much damage across that one community, and so to imagine that and extrapolate that across the province and across the areas affected—the Quebec ice storm of 1998 is the most expensive storm on record. The damages came to $1.5 billion. That’s just one storm that we can point to; since then, we can all imagine many.", "I did some advocacy about a storm in December 2013. My community of Oshawa sustained a fair bit of damage, and we had to encourage the government to move along with the funds that they promised them. It’s an expensive proposition to serve and support our communities, especially with these damaging storms.", "The member from Toronto–Danforth and the members from Windsor and Essex and, well, this whole back area here, with the storms in Windsor, doing all of that advocacy, because the unbelievable cost of the damage and the storm after storm after storm—it was awful, and it continues to be awful because insurance isn’t covering the damages for many of those families and many of those homes.", "And we’re just seeing more. In fact, when we look back at this recent storm season, 2017—how many of us learned the difference between category 3 and 4 and 5 hurricanes? During the last Atlantic hurricane season, we were all watching Irma and Harvey with bated breath to see—hopefully, not the devastation.", "Our storm seasons seem to be worsening. Again, if there is a way to ameliorate and to help our communities to pay for the fallout, let’s do that. We have an opportunity here to have this kind of conversation.", "I’m going to go in a different direction.", "When we talk about accountability and responsibility for our climate and for our environment, I was a bit interested—I’ll challenge some of what the minister said. This government always holds up California as such a shining example. I lived in California during the energy crisis. I did high school there. It was interesting because, after that, when we all found out about Enron having defrauded California out of billions of dollars—in the 1990s, when we were watching all the rolling brownouts, I was living through that—Enron was one of the chief proponents of the state deregulation which led to this crisis.", "Let’s look to ourselves for how to best solve this. We have an opportunity here to have a conversation on how to be responsible. Let’s have that conversation.", "And just a side note, Speaker: I’m sure your constituency office also got these two boxes. Everyone would have gotten those two boxes, 27 pounds each, of those paper books, Fighting Climate Change: Better Communities. I would argue it’s campaign literature, but anyway, it’s the government’s climate change plan. Well, 54 pounds of paper is not how we tackle climate change, and I wonder what that cost to send, but there we have it.", "Let’s actually use a worthwhile example here. When you look at the government of Canada website and their enforcement notifications for violators, we don’t have to look very far. I’m just going to read the headlines. I’m running out of time. I’m just going to read the notifications, and this is all public. If you are curious about the kind of—well, I’ll just read this to you:", "—the most recent one, on March 27: “Environmental Charges Laid Against Husky Energy Inc. and Husky Oil Operations Ltd. in Relation to the Pipeline Release of Blended Heavy Crude Oil into the North Saskatchewan River”;", "—March 14: “Agricultural Products-and-Services Provider Fined $150K for Environmental Violations”;", "—“British Columbia Manufacturer of Plant-Based Foods Fined for Fisheries Act Violation”;", "—“Company Found Guilty of Fisheries Act Violation in Lac-Mégantic Derailment Case”;", "—“Fishing Vessel Owner Sentenced in British Columbia for Violation of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999”;", "—“Petroleum Company Sentenced for Offences under the Migratory Birds Convention Act, 1994”; and", "—“Mining Company in British Columbia Fined for Fisheries Act Violations.”", "I have, like, three pages from just the past two years, and when you read it, it’s remarkable just how many companies are choosing to say, “It’s the cost of doing business, these environmental fines.” They’re going to make harmful choices for our communities. Many of these are intentional when you read through them; some are accidental.", "But this is just small and mid-sized. Imagine, on a global scale, these massive emitters. When we have government situations where our hands are tied and our policy can’t protect us environmentally—look at Canada’s track record under NAFTA chapter 11. We’re the most sued nation, and we have the worst record. I think we’ve lost nine cases. The States haven’t lost any. Anyway, we are paying out to these companies who are challenging our government and saying, “We don’t like your environmental regulations. You are hampering our potential for profit,” and that drives our governments to—it has that effect of policy chill: “Maybe we don’t put those environmental regulations into place, because we could end up sued.”", "If it makes our government think twice, and if it makes governments think twice about how they do business, imagine the potential for a bill like this. The province of Ontario says, “If you are going to have a measurably devastating impact on our environment, then we’re going to hold you responsible and we’re going to make you think twice.” We have the opportunity to do that here today, and I hope that everyone in this Legislature will take the opportunity to support this bill." ],

  "text" : [ "Speaker, I get a chance once again to speak in the House today, and I’m absolutely honoured for this opportunity, so thank you. It’s an opportunity to speak to Bill 21, An Act respecting civil liability for climate-related harms.", "I commend the member for Toronto–Danforth for bringing forward a bill. The principal act here in the act is polluter pay. I think we all accept the notion that the polluter should pay for the harms associated with the pollution they put out. I think that’s important, that we recognize that we all accept that principle.", "My concern with this bill, however, Speaker, is its absolute lack of enforceability, of being able to get anywhere close to any kind of conviction to even determine the measure of damages associated with it. This bill, in my view, would create a complete morass of legal and scientific evidence which would drag on absolutely forever. This is red tape to the extreme—not in the sense that you are asking people to do certain things and follow certain regulations, but it absolutely puts the fear of God into anybody who is using a fossil fuel source that in some way you’re going to try to attribute something that has happened somewhere else to their activities.", "I look at even just the definition of “climate change” in the bill. It means “a long-term change in the Earth’s climate caused by the alteration of concentrations of greenhouse gas in the global atmosphere.” At what level? How much is there that wouldn’t have otherwise been there? How much is attributable to a cyclical warming? How much is attributable to an increase in the population of crickets and other methane insects in the world? How much to animals and such?", "The definition itself is mired in scientific controversy, and when you look at the list of liabilities without limitations, it is astounding. When you try to figure out how you’re going to assess the costs associated with economic loss or physical loss of property and infrastructure that is specifically attributed to the carbon associated with that one particular actor, it’s almost unconscionable to even have people contemplate how they would go about doing this.", "Harm related to ocean acidification: You know, the cod stocks dropping—some might argue that acidification of the ocean as a result of acid rains has resulted in the micro-organisms that feed the protozoans that feed the fish and this is all contributing to it. How do you assess the impact associated with one actor? You can’t do it, Speaker.", "What I see in this bill is a well-intentioned straw man, a political straw man that the member puts forward. It is, “Look at me; I’m out there, being active to fight climate change,” but it does absolutely nothing to do it.", "What we need to do is we need to listen to what the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change had to say about the programs that are in place, because what you need is not this kind of a heavy sledgehammer approach; you need to have incentives, incentives to build new technologies that will reduce our carbon footprint, incentives so people can be in electric vehicles and incentives so that people can build hydrogen-powered cars.", "I am so proud of the fact that two and a half years ago, as an environmental champion, as I believe I am, as a steward for the environment, I went to the Ministry of Transportation and insisted that when they build these new ferries out in Kingston to go to Wolfe Island and to go to Amherst Island, that they not be diesel-spewing but that they actually be electric. We came back and we did that. I’m so proud of the fact that as an environmental champion in this government, I insisted the Ministry of Energy would include a power-to-fuel option that would use surplus electricity in our system, of which frankly we have a fair bit, to make a non-carbon fuel like hydrogen or super-hot air they could drive into boilers. This is the kind of innovative work that is coming as a result of the investments that we can make from the proceeds of cap-and-trade.", "A bill like this just puts a complete chill on anybody who is engaging in hot air and does nothing to address climate change because it’s unenforceable and it ties people up in courts to no useful end. I’m not supporting it." ],

  "text" : [ "It’s my pleasure to stand today and contribute to this debate, specifically on Bill 21, Liability for Climate-Related Harms Act, on behalf of my constituents of Huron–Bruce. While the member from Toronto–Danforth and I know that we each care about the environment, I think the reality is that in some cases, we just go about it differently. Unfortunately, today is an example where we’re going to have to agree to disagree, okay?", "I’m going to be frank, though. The legislation before us is an unworkable law that leaves too much to interpretation and regulation, and when it comes to regulation, it does make people very nervous with red tape and handcuffing. The Liberal government has already done enough to drive business out of Ontario; we don’t need to keep perpetuating reasons to leave this province.", "Speaker, I would suggest to you that everyone in this province needs reliable and affordable energy, and we need to call a spade a spade here. This bill would make the providers of energy liable in the future for an ambiguous and completely arbitrary amount of climate-related harm associated with the production of fossil fuels.", "We all know what this bill is, Speaker. It is political positioning to show that the NDP care about the environment. But I must be very clear here: We all care about the environment. In fact, I must remind everyone here today that it was actually Bill Davis who created the Ministry of the Environment, and it was actually the combination of efforts from Elizabeth Witmer and Jim Wilson that saw Ontario’s first coal plant close.", "The Liberals have brought forth cap-and-trade, which uses the environment as a ploy to take more money from the hard-working people of Ontario. And you know what I’m talking about: It’s another tax. We can all acknowledge that there is room to reduce our carbon emissions, but creating a future liability for fulfilling consumer demand will just increase prices right here and now. When there is an expected liability on the books, the rational behaviour would be to raise prices to address future liability. We’ve seen it happen over the last 15 years with this government. Unfortunately, this private member’s bill is following the same path in that regard.", "I do have a question: Does the member who proposed this bill heat his house with natural gas? Does he use a barbecue? Does he buy food from stores? Does he know how the food got to the stores? Typically, the larger trucks that do the deliveries use a combustion engine. What I’m trying to point out here is that increasing energy costs would increase our bills, of course, but the reality is that it increases the cost of everything. And do you know what? We already have people in the province of Ontario choosing to heat or eat, and scratching to get by.", "Through the current government’s disastrous Green Energy Act, we’ve seen countless Ontarians pushed into energy poverty. We have seen people who have had to choose, as I said, to make difficult decisions. Unfortunately, bills like we’re debating today, ultimately, disproportionately hurt vulnerable Ontarians the most. This bill before us today would directly make life in Ontario more unaffordable, and shows that there is only truly one party that is committed to making life easier for people in Ontario. It is only the Ontario PC Party that is rallying for a better Ontario.", "A report from the Clean Economy Alliance acknowledged last week that Ontario’s cap-and-trade program hasn’t had a tremendous impact on reducing emissions. This so-called bill is a perfect example of the problematic climate policies that we have seen come into this House and negatively impact people over the last 15 years. Too often, the policies are about laying blame, pointing fingers, photo ops, platitudes and more taxes.", "I know that the member from Toronto–Danforth is passionate about climate change, but I think we have to consider what this bill actually does for climate change. Will it help mitigate emissions? No. Will this expand the size of government? Yes. Will this expand the role of government in the economy? Yes. Will it make doing business in Ontario tougher? Yes. Will it make life more unaffordable in Ontario? Yes.", "I’m all about protecting Ontarians. I think all of us in this Legislature value the safety of Ontarians and the preservation of our natural environment. But I also think we need to acknowledge what is already happening and in place to sequester carbon. We need to enable Ontarians to reduce emissions through new innovations and technologies, and acknowledge what is already happening; for example, with our Ontario farmers. Do we need to increase the cost of living and doing business in Ontario to reduce emissions? No." ],

And I want to thank Dr. James Hansen for lending his credibility to this bill when he attended our media conference.", "Speaker, it’s unfortunate that the member for Niagara West–Glanbrook hadn’t read my bill. I think his remarks would have been better informed if he had read it. I just want to say that if he’d read it, he’d have noticed that we aren’t talking about small emitters. We’re not talking about farms; we’re talking about major fossil fuel companies. That’s very clear in the bill.", "In fact, there has been a lot of scientific research done to show that something like 50% to 60% of the emissions in the atmosphere that are making this planet hotter come from about 90 firms, private and state-owned. So we’re not talking about small operations—just as with tobacco liability legislation, we talked about the big tobacco companies, not about corner stores.", "With regard to the member for Huron–Bruce, I think the reality is, we’re going to be paying a lot more for insurance and people are going to be driven from their homes by flooding, and their party is not prepared to either prevent that or give assistance to those who are hurt. Usually they talk about personal responsibility. I think responsibility of fossil fuel companies is a principle that’s consistent with conservativism, but apparently not.", "The member for Beaches–East York: I don’t quite understand his logic. Frankly, I’m sure that he supported tobacco liability legislation when it was before this Legislature, and in the United States tobacco liability legislation led to payment of hundreds of billions of dollars to states to deal with their costs. It’s a very comparable situation.", "This is a good bill. It deserves to pass." ],

You’ve gone through three hours of Canadian Shield, and you will crest this hill and you will see nothing in front of you but farmland—acres and acres. There are actually 400,000 acres—200,000 acres in Quebec and 200,000 acres in Ontario—and it’s completely developed. There are big farm equipment dealers. There are elevators. It’s a total change of scenery compared to what you have seen for the last three hours. To us, we’re very proud of it, but it is one of the wonders of Ontario when you crest that hill. The Earlton Farm Show is where these people gather.", "It’s kind of a running joke, I have to say, whenever we hear someone from the Ministry of Agriculture or people like me speaking about how the government is going to develop agriculture in northern Ontario, because it’s already there. There is a lot of potential, and I’m going to get to that. But the nucleus of agriculture is already there. The understanding of the people, how to do it, is already there. They don’t need to be taught how to farm in northern Ontario.", "There are things that the government can do. I give credit where credit is due. We worked for years, when I was the president of the federation of agriculture locally, with various governments to try and get the Northern Ontario Heritage Fund to recognize agriculture. They did. To this government’s credit, they continue to do so. The heritage fund has done wonders for the agriculture sector in northern Ontario.", "That’s where I’m getting to the budget.

It’s totally bilingual. There’s a very high percentage of Francophone people in Timiskaming–Cochrane, in northern Ontario, but Verner, West Nipissing, is the only municipality I have that is totally and completely bilingual.

We’re all working very hard to make sure those services are maintained. I’d like to commend the firefighters, the town and the public service employees who are doing everything they can to make sure that those services are maintained. It’s very important.", "Those are just a few things that are different in my part of the province, our part of the province. The GTA isn’t all about farms or mines; there are totally other industries, totally other demographics. But we all rely on the government to provide services, to administer services, to collect taxes. Nobody likes to pay taxes. I think that’s pretty obvious.", "This is my second opportunity to speak, as finance critic, on a budget. The one thing that has become very clear to me is that although we are very good at trading barbs and we all have different views on how the province should run and where money should go or shouldn’t go, for a lot of the basic structures, we speak in a language that many people don’t understand or don’t translate into their everyday lives. They hear about debt and they hear about deficit and statements like “structural deficit” and “bond rating agencies.” It’s not that they can’t understand, but it’s in a language that is not presented so they actually can relate it to their own lives. If people don’t understand something, they won’t relate to it, they won’t relate to what we’re saying, and that’s bad. It’s not only bad for democracy, but it’s bad for citizens to not really understand how things work.", "Before I actually comment on the budget itself, I’m going to try to relate on a more individual scale how the province runs.", "We hear a lot about debt and deficit and how much the government brings in. If you bring that to a household level, the government taxation is your income. When the government gets people to pay taxes, gets companies to pay taxes, revenues, tolls, that is their income. With that income, like your household income, that’s how you pay expenses. Your food, your groceries, your—you relate that to services the government provides.", "Now, we hear about debt and deficit, and some people will tell you that all debt is bad and that if you run a debt, you’re not doing something right. Well, then, you’re basically telling everyone in the province who has a mortgage on their house that they are a failure. That’s not the case. There are certain things that you are not going to pay for with savings. You have to borrow money and pay that money off slowly so you can afford to buy things you can’t buy from your daily income. That’s your debt, and that’s the same that the province has. If the province wants to build infrastructure—whichever government is in place—and if the cost of that infrastructure is more than their yearly income, or more than many years of income, you’ll have to spread that out over a longer period. That is the province’s debt.", "The tricky part of that is to make sure that what you’re spending, what you’re willing to borrow money for, is actually going to provide a long-term benefit for the people of the province, just like if your family is going to get a mortgage, that it’s going to be something that is going to provide benefit to your family for many years and hopefully have some residual value. A house will have residual value, but also, in the province’s case, that infrastructure is going to drive the economy. You could have long-term infrastructure and borrow money over a longer period, perhaps building a hospital or building a road. That could be financed over 25 years or whatever. It’s like buying a house.", "Where you get into trouble, and where the province can get in trouble, is if you buy something—if you need to go to work, you need a car. You might have to borrow money for a car. But if you have to borrow the money for the car over 20 years and the car is only going to last seven or five, then you’re paying debts, you’re making payments on something that no longer exists. That is where you run into big trouble. Later on, I’ll speak on the examples of where the province has done that. So there’s a difference between productive debt and bad debt, and if you have too much bad debt, then you’ve got a problem.", "A lot of people don’t understand—or don’t take the time to understand, or we don’t explain carefully enough—the difference between debt and deficit. A deficit is if your yearly income, and something happens—we just talked about cars. If your car breaks down or you have an unexpected expense, one year you could run a deficit because your expenses are more than your income. That’s a deficit. That can happen. That can happen in your personal income, but that can also happen to a province. That’s not necessarily a bad thing.", "Where deficits get to be a bad thing—and where bankers will talk about structural deficits—is if you know that no matter what you do, your income is not going to match your expenses. That’s a structural deficit. With that, you have to make some changes. You either have to raise your income or change your expenses.", "Again, you have to look at that very closely, because in the province’s case, there are certain things—if you’re actually increasing your services or you’re driving something that’s going to help the economy, a deficit could be a good thing. It’s the same as if you’re making mortgage payments on your house and your house needs a new roof, and you don’t put the new roof on and your house slowly rots because you’re not putting on a new roof, you know what? Taking a loan over four or five years to put a new roof on your house is actually a lot smarter than having your house fall in because you don’t want to borrow the money for a new roof. It’s the same with the province.", "When you hear people talk about a province owing too much money and the credit agencies and the bond raters will raise the interest, that’s the same as if you have a bad credit rating. If you make bad decisions, the interest that you pay will go up. That’s the same for a government. If they make bad decisions and they borrow money on things that aren’t going to—again, I’ll go back to my example of a car. If you’re going to buy a car over 20 years—and there are a lot of people now who buy cars on eight years of payments. I’m going to get to that later, too. That’s a sign that people are having a tougher time making it because that is a sign that they’re stretched to the limit. Again, that is a sign that you’re getting into the territory where your interest payments are going to be much higher. It’s the same with the province. But it’s not necessarily—debt isn’t necessarily bad. It’s how you structure the debt and it’s what you spend the money on. That’s what’s important.", "Hopefully I’ve been somewhat successful in bringing that to a personal level—not sure if I have—but I find that a lot of times when I listen to these debates, they are way over my head, not because the concepts are over people’s heads but the language we use isn’t the same as the language that you use on the street. Everybody knows what a mortgage is and what a mortgage payment is. That is your debt. Everyone knows what a credit card is. You could use a credit card to cover your deficit or your short-term debt but there’s certain things you don’t want to finance on a credit card because the interest is way too high. Hopefully I’ve brought that.", "Now I’m going to go back to the more political part regarding the budget and the budget motion and the budget bill. This government has been in power for 15 years. A lot of the things that are happening in the province, and I’ll use a couple of examples, but two that we use quite a bit—one is hospital wait times and the other is the energy system in the province. A lot of the issues that are happening in the province now haven’t happened by accident. I’m not saying that everything is the government’s fault, but governments have made decisions, and government makes decisions and is responsible for those decisions. One of those decisions is how they fund health care.", "Health care is the biggest cost in our province. You will often hear—the Premier will tell us, and the Minister of Health, that their spending has gone up on health care overall every year. That’s not the case for hospitals. It often happens that the actual spending on hospitals has been below the rate of inflation. Costs go up every year; that’s the rate of inflation. If the budget of the hospital doesn’t equal the rate of inflation, that’s effectively a cut. It might be an increase in funding, but it’s a cut in the purchasing power of the hospital. As a result, the administration of the hospital is going to have to make changes to accommodate the erosion of their spending power, of their buying power. Over the long-term, that results in cuts in services. The example of that is people waiting, being treated in hallways, in washrooms. That’s an example.", "We can talk all we want about finances and where the money comes from, but the fact of the matter is, when someone is treated in the hallway or they’re put in a washroom or a shower room, obviously there’s something wrong with their experience in the hospital, and that comes from a long-term funding erosion of buying power.", "The government has acknowledged that. They acknowledged that in this budget. So this budget has—I believe they’re promising another $800 million that they’re going to put into hospitals to fix that problem. The problem with that is that this government has been in power for 15 years. It has watched this problem happen, and now, at the eleventh hour, it’s saying, “You know what? Just vote for us one more time and we’ll fix this problem that we’ve been watching and helping to create. We’ll fix it. Just vote for us one more time.”", "I think that people are growing—I think people have made their decision. They haven’t made a decision on who’s going to replace them yet, but I think they have made the decision that the government is going to be replaced. I am sure." ],

The government has lots of assets; it should review the assets, take an inventory of what’s going on. That seemed reasonable.

When you give up the controlling power of a company, when it becomes private, it does what a private company should do: look out for the profitability of its shareholders.

That’s not the case, because we have regulations and we have all this stuff. They have to provide service.” My example? If that’s the case and if private companies are so good at providing service, then let’s talk about Internet in rural Ontario. That’s private. The Internet broadband in rural Ontario and small-town Ontario and many parts of the GTA certainly isn’t what it is in the very built-up parts of the GTA. That’s because it is provided by private companies that are doing their job. They focus on where their profit centres are. That’s why people have the confidence to invest, why they buy stocks in private companies, why they base their pensions on private companies. We’re not opposed to that, but private companies are not good at providing essential services, because it’s contrary to what their real goal is. They’re good at providing goods and services where it makes a profit, but certain places where it doesn’t necessarily make a profit but you need it to provide an essential service—that should be provided by publicly controlled companies. That’s why we have committed to regaining control of Hydro One.", "In the last few days, it’s come to people’s attention that the CEO of Hydro One’s pay packet has increased considerably.

Again, I’ll return to the soon-to-be Minister of the Environment, the critic for environment: Why? I think many of the people of Ontario are wondering that too. Why did she really sell Hydro One? It just goes against the whole brand. I’m sure one of the ministers is going to say, “Well, it’s to pay for infrastructure.” But again, you are vastly underestimating the thought power of the people of Ontario, because Hydro One brings in dividends to the province, higher than what it would have been to borrow the money—to build infrastructure—equivalent to what Hydro One was sold for. That’s not just the NDP saying that. That’s the Financial Accountability Officer of Ontario saying that as well.", "The question is, why did they bother? Why? I think that’s one of the questions, one of the biggest issues, that has shaken the resolve of the people of Ontario, shaken the faith of the people of Ontario regarding the government’s true intentions, because they saw, in the last election, that what the government talked about wasn’t what the government did—especially in the last election, when the McGuinty regime was very scandal-ridden. Some of these scandals are still percolating through. The new leader of the Liberal Party said, “No, it’s going to be totally different under me. I’m a breath of fresh air”—open and transparent.

If I had gone to my bank manager with a cash flow—which business people need to do every year, because we also have to borrow money and buy big-ticket items. If I had gone to them one year and said, “You know what? The next three years, I’m going to do everything; I’m not going to need to borrow any extra money,” and then I’d come to them the next year and I said, “Well, no, I’m going to have to borrow a lot of extra money,” that wouldn’t shock him or her if I said, “I’m going to do an expansion.” What would shock him or her is if I went to the bank manager and said, “Well, you know what? I didn’t bother telling you last year that this was falling in and this was falling in, and I had to fix this and I had to fix this.”", "That’s what this government is doing to the people of Ontario. They vastly underestimated what was actually going wrong. They vastly underestimated what it was really going to cost to fix our hospital system, or they actually ignored what it was going to cost. They have been ignoring—I think perhaps that’s too strong a word, Speaker. Individually, as members, I do believe that all members are here to represent their constituents. They fight hard for their constituents. I believe all members do that. But the party, the Liberal government, has ignored many of the concerns of the people of Ontario. And now, at this late date, they’ve realized that people are angry. People who are working three jobs and getting further behind every day are angry. People who were told that things are getting better, but things aren’t getting better for them and they’re being left behind, are angry. And now, after 15 years, for the Premier to stand up and say, “We know things are getting tougher. That’s why we are promising to fix it all if you’d just vote for us one more time,” is making them even angrier.", "They’re done. The question that the people of Ontario are asking themselves is, “Who’s next?” That’s a very legitimate question. Who’s next?

When we’re given a challenge of people continually coming into our office with a lack of dental coverage, we’ve put forward a plan to solve that challenge. That is one option, or we have another option.", "When given a challenge, for a line, they decide they’re going to try to fire someone at a company that they don’t even control, and they want to put up a big neon sign. They don’t even have a platform, Speaker. I think people in Ontario are going to see that, and I think they’re going to vote for change, a change for the better, and that will be Andrea Horwath." ],

There are investments here in infrastructure, schools, hospitals, roads and transit.

I didn’t get a useful comment. I also asked if in fact he would tell Hydro One not to buy any other coal plants in the United States. He wouldn’t answer that question. The closest he came was saying, “You know, those utilities are vertically integrated,” which means they have everything from digging up the coal to running the coal plant to running the wires to doing the billing.

If we think they’re profitable, we’ll do that”—totally contrary to all the rhetoric we get from this government about its relationship to coal and to the environment.", "The other thing I want to say about the purchase of Avista, the Washington state and Oregon state entity, is that it does have ownership of the Colstrip coal plant. There are big questions there about unfunded liability and undetermined liability, because that plant has tonnes of coal waste that have been seeping into groundwater. No one has ever quantified that liability, so we don’t know how much of a bill we’re going to be stuck with when, ultimately, someone has to deal with the water contamination issues in that part of the world.", "The government’s privatization plan was reckless and damaging in the first place, but to go and buy companies where there is an unquantified liability and to perpetuate climate change by supporting coal-fired generation is extraordinary to me.", "Yes, this bill has a lot of options for discussion." ],

Ontario’s economy is getting stronger. With the unemployment rate at its lowest in almost two decades—I believe that in March it was at 5.5%—we continue to create jobs here in the province of Ontario, with over 10,000 net new jobs in the month of March.", "Yet, between the rising cost of living and stable, long-term jobs becoming harder to find, many people are struggling to take care of themselves and their families. As the changing economy widens the gaps within our society, the government has a plan to build a fairer, better Ontario by supporting everyone in the province with the care and opportunity they need to get ahead.", "This budget lays out our plan for care and opportunity. Even with the relatively strong economy and with unemployment at its lowest point, as I mentioned, many are still struggling to get ahead. We cannot ignore the fact that many families are struggling to get ahead in this rapidly changing economy. The costs for caring for themselves and their loved ones continue to grow, and that’s causing people stress and anxiety.", "What I’m hearing from people and what we are hearing from people is that they expect their government to step up and help with that burden. Now is not the time to pull back or to make deep cuts to the services people in our province rely on. We need more care. We are making a deliberate choice to invest in programs that make it easier for the people of this province to care for their loved ones. Our plan also takes steps to boost economic growth and job creation, and focuses on initiatives that make life more affordable.", "One of the things I hear from young families moving into my riding of Davenport—and every year, more and more young families move into Davenport—is that they have difficulty in finding quality, affordable child care. So I’m proud to be part of a government that is listening to the people of Ontario and is doing just that: providing more options for families by making preschool child care free for children aged two and a half years old until they’re eligible for kindergarten. This, Madam Speaker, is saving a family with one child, on average, $17,000 per year, and this builds on the savings families get from full-day kindergarten. It seems just like the other day that my sons were in preschool and I was looking for child care, so I know and I can appreciate the investments that this government is making.", "We know the contributions that women make to our economy. I refer to women because it is often the mothers who stay home to take care of their child. We have fathers, as well, who stay home, but many times it is the mother. Their contributions that they make to the economy are so crucial, so we want the mothers to get back to work, to be able to continue on with their careers, to expand their careers and also to continue contributing to the economy and shortening the gender wage gap that currently exists.", "I recently had the opportunity to meet the ambassador here in Canada from Norway, and we had an opportunity to speak about OHIP+ and what our government is doing providing free prescription medications for all children and youth under the age of 25. We hadn’t yet expanded it to seniors at the time. We got talking about health care and what they are doing in Norway, and I asked her specifically about child care and the costs that they had regarding child care. They have a formula that they use and they have a program in place, and that works for Norway, but one of the things that really struck me in my discussion with the ambassador from Norway is that she said to me, “Cristina, nothing impacted the economy greater than the return of women back to work after long absences and after being away during a maternity leave.” And this was coming from a country that relies a lot on, and whose economy is really boosted by, natural resources, so women’s impact on economy was greater than that.", "I mentioned OHIP+ and the fact that we had introduced that earlier this year in January. We are now expanding OHIP+ to seniors. Let me tell you, Madam Speaker, when I speak to the seniors in my community of Davenport, they are excited for the investments that we are making in OHIP+.", "So I support this bill.

What this fund will do is it will guarantee payments of certain benefits from the pension plan should an employer go insolvent or into bankruptcy. That’s a troublesome thing that seniors have to think about in their retirement years, when they’ve planned on this pension and our economy develops in such a way that perhaps that pension is at risk. Can you imagine the anxiety that that creates in their minds?", "This initiative, this guarantee fund, is the only one of its kind in Canada. That is progressive legislation. That is leading-edge legislation for the benefit of our seniors and retirees. The fund will provide critical assistance to pensioners and plan members when their plans are wound up with insufficient funds to cover the proposed benefits. Think of the anxiety that that has gotten rid of in seniors’ minds when they are entering their retirement years. This is an example of good government for the benefit of the people, in this case particularly for the benefit of seniors and retirees.", "The increase will raise the guarantee payment from $1,000 a month to $1,500 a month. That is a significant amount, an extra $500 a month for retirement income. And we are introducing legislation that is going to make that retroactive to May 2017. There’s a whole other cohort of seniors that this will bring some peace of mind to, some measure of confidence that they can enjoy their retirement years.", "I want to particularly comment on the effect this would have on the former Sears Canada employees, who will benefit from receiving this additional support. The Sears situation is one that is playing out in the media, and it has created tremendous levels of anxiety. We have an obligation as a government, if one of the responsibilities of government is to help people, to do things with them that they can’t necessarily do all on their own. This is a contribution to that need.", "The bill is also going to provide additional supports for workers and retirees by proposing to amend some of the aspects of the Pension Benefits Act. What it’s going to do is it’s going to require disclosure of events that may negatively impact corporate pensions, and that disclosure has to be made early to the Superintendent of Financial Services. That gives the superintendent a chance to take some preventive action." ],

In many cases, either the families invest this money or spend this money on their children in daycare, or the mother stays at home for two or three years. Of course, after two or three years, when she wants to go back to work, it becomes very difficult to find a job after being away from her profession.", "Indeed, some years ago, we introduced full-day kindergarten—JK, SK. Now, based on this budget, education will be provided by the government for every kid, every child from the age of two and a half up to the end of high school. In university, of course, we have introduced free tuition for the middle class and people coming from low-income and middle-income families.", "Our philosophy on this side of the House is investing in the people of Ontario because we believe our greatest asset is our people. It’s the people who build this province. We need to educate those people. We need to invest in those people so they can produce for this country and for this province. That’s what we have been doing.", "As a result of our right policies in the past 15 years in this province, our kids never, ever lost a single hour in school, while we all know that under the Conservatives, when they were in office eight years, close to 13 million hours of schooling were lost. As a result, the graduation rate was 64% in our high schools, meaning that only 64% of our students graduated from high school; now 86% of them are graduating from high school. This is one element of this budget: investing in the people of Ontario.", "We’re also investing in businesses. We are reducing the small business tax, not by 1%, not by 2%—by 22%. This is going to assist small businesses. We know small businesses are the backbone of the economy of this country, of this province.", "We are also increasing the tax credit for research and innovation. We are increasing the tax credit for R&D in this province so that our companies can become more productive, can become more innovative and, as a result, we can attract more investment from foreign sources to this province so that our economy can grow. Our economy is already doing very well. Our economy is growing by 2.7%. We are leading not only every Canadian province, but we are also leading all of the G7 countries. Our unemployment rate now is around 5.6%, the lowest in the past 25 years.", "When it comes to investing in the people of Ontario, again, in terms of seniors, we are making prescribed medication free for every senior, every person aged 65 and above in this province. Can you imagine its impact on our population? They will be covered by not only 100 or 200 medications; they will be covered by 4,400 different types of medication which are all on the OHIP formulary.", "We are also investing in mental health—historic investments in mental health in the history of this province, by $2.5 billion. This will increase the total investment in mental health to $17 billion.", "Our investment in every sector of our society is phenomenal. This budget, once it’s implemented, is going to take the province of Ontario to another plateau for years to come.", "Madam Speaker, this budget is for the people of Ontario. It reflects the values of this Premier, it reflects the values of this government and the Liberal Party of Ontario, and I’m so proud to support this budget." ],

Unfortunately, the 2018 budget, taken together with the Premier’s recent announcement related to mental health, only included a paltry sum for community college and university students, many of whom are in desperate need of help now, not over four years. Speaker, when you break down the announcement, the amount of funds provided over each year and divided across each of the 44 community colleges and universities in Ontario, the funding won’t have an impact that students, faculty and administrators have been asking for for several years.", "There’s another glaring omission in the budget. The member from Davenport and the ministers raised seniors. Well, a striking omission is a lack of measures to combat and prevent acts of elder abuse. Clearly, we have a growing demographic of seniors in this province. We all acknowledge, within this Legislature, within all parties, that elder abuse is a terrible crime perpetrated against our society’s most vulnerable citizens, yet as you read through the narrative of Bill 31, again a “Plan for Care,” well, there certainly isn’t the level of care that you would have expected for a growing demographic of seniors.", "It’s not only within the aspect of elder abuse—" ],

This government has been in power for 15 years, and there have been issues that have been festering for many of these years. Hospital overcrowding and hospital underfunding has been an issue that didn’t pop up because of the last flu season. The wait-list for long-term care, again, is not something that just popped up. That is something that has been there for a long time, for many years.", "It’s nice that the government has now decided to show their commitment with their latest budget, a few weeks before the election. It’s nice that now they have decided to care. As individual members, I’m sure they do care, but the direction of their government hasn’t demonstrated that over the last 15 years, and certainly not over the last four. People had a lot of faith in the current Premier, and quite frankly, on many issues, she didn’t deliver what people believed. This government, which claimed to be open and progressive—she didn’t deliver, and—" ],

I was listening to the member from the PC caucus, and he was talking about how there isn’t enough being done about mental health, so I wanted to just speak to that.", "First of all, prior to this budget, we made a significant investment in mental health services on post-secondary campuses. I have to tell you that I’ve had the chance to visit a number of post-secondary campuses and speak to some of the young student leaders at those campuses, and they’ve certainly told me that that has made a major difference. Is there more to be done? Sure, absolutely, but boy, it has made a big difference in their minds, so I think that that’s something I want to correct the member on.", "But I also want to note that in this budget a number of investments are being made to further strengthen mental health for young people. We’re providing every high school in Ontario with access to mental health support within the next two years, to enable early intervention. This is not just about helping high school students; the comment from the member opposite was about post-secondary, but by helping high school students, by intervening early, we can address those mental health challenges early, so that they don’t arise in post-secondary. What we’re really doing is helping post-secondary students, as well, through this measure.", "We’re going to be helping up to 350,000 more people across the province with anxiety and depression by increasing access to publicly funded psychotherapy, including children and youth; adding 2,475 more housing units over four years to those who require care; and creating at least 15 additional youth wellness hubs to improve access to services. This is for young people age 12 to 25—again, covering students, so helping to address mental health challenges in those early years, before young people get into post-secondary. But this also allows us to serve those young people who are at that age and who are in post-secondary, and those who aren’t as well.", "So I think a lot is being done on mental health. A lot is being done in other areas, as other members have spoken to. I think this is something to be proud of." ],

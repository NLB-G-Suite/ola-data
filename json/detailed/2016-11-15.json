  "text" : [ "Speaker, we’ve been debating this piece of legislation now for some time, so I just want to go over it once more. I pose the question to the viewing audience: What are the proposed mining amendments all about? Well, it’s a part of Ontario’s ongoing efforts to modernize the Mining Act. Mining is a crucial commercial and economic activity of this province. It is important that all aspects of the mining business in Ontario, if you will, be as modern as we can possibly make them.", "If passed, the bill would make some technical amendments that the Mining Act needs to implement on mining claim registration, which is the newest way to register mining claims. That, of course, entails a new mining lands administration system. We are going from the old style of staking mining claims to a new online approach to make this jurisdiction here in Ontario at the leading edge of how the mining business is conducted.", "There are a number of other aspects of mining that have already been modernized, so these will complement those that are already in place. Other aspects have included new rules and tools to help provide clarity and certainty to industry to help build positive relationships with surface rights owners and ensure ongoing engagement by industry with affected indigenous communities.", "I want to just speak for a second about the relationship of indigenous communities to the mining industry. As the Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation, I can tell you that First Nations’ relationship to the land and to all that the land encompasses—that is, the rich minerals in the land—is of huge importance to First Nations. It’s important that First Nations’ opinions be taken into account and respected, and that there be an open dialogue about how these amendments are going to interact with First Nations’ cultural attitudes towards the land.", "Let me give a couple of comments about why the amendments to the Aggregate Resources Act and Mining Act will be put together into one bill. As a part of the government’s continued efforts to modernize the Aggregate Resources Act and Mining Act, these amendments with both the aggregate piece and the mining piece have been combined into one single act. So much of aggregate is a by-product of the mining industry that it makes sense to treat them as a common entity, if you will.", "The proposed Mining Act amendments were introduced in December 2015. That was a part of the ongoing process of modernizing Ontario’s Mining Act, as I’ve said. That process, interestingly, began in 2009 with the passage of Bill 173. While this is the first time that the proposed Aggregate Resources Act amendments have been introduced, the proposed changes represent the first step in a very phased approach to modernize and strengthen the aggregate resources policy framework.", "The current bill will enable the Legislature to consider proposed changes to two of Ontario’s natural resource statutes at the same time. There’s an economy there, there’s an efficiency there, there are policy links there that make it proper to include these amendments and changes to roll this legislation affecting both aggregates and mining into one piece of legislation.", "Another question comes up, and I’ve been asked: “Why does the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry have the lead on this bill?” The Ministry of Northern Development and Mines is working in close collaboration with the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry to put forth important legislation in Ontario’s provincial Parliament. I am particularly looking forward to working with my colleague Minister McGarry, who is the Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry, as this legislation is presented to the House.", "I’ve also been asked if this combined bill will change the process of the Mining Act amendments to be passed. I can assure you, Speaker, and members of the House, that the combined bill will work its way through the usual legislative process for government-proposed bills.", "I want to say some additional comments, then, about modernizing the Mining Act and what’s involved in these proposed amendments. Ontario is proposing some necessary technical updates to the Mining Act to implement around-the-clock mining claim registration and an entirely new administration system for managing mining lands. If the amendments are passed by this Legislature, licensed prospectors would select cells on a grid overlying a map of the province, and that would be done through an online client claim registration portal instead of the old style of walking through the bush or across the land, staking claims with a small sledgehammer and claim sticks. That’s the sort of idea we have of staking claims from the movies. Perhaps some of us have actually been in the north and observed that being done. So it’s a very, very modern approach.", "Again, I want to stress that if Ontario is going to continue to be, as it has been for generations, a leader in the mining business, it is important that Ontario have the latest technology, the most modern tools to do mining. That will attract investment. That will make people want to come to Ontario to avail themselves of the most efficient way, the very best possible way and the fairest way of staking claims. That’s why Ontario is moving to an online claim registration system.", "What other jurisdictions—and that’s an interesting question to ask ourselves: What other jurisdictions have online staking experience and what has been their experience? I can tell you, Speaker, that while Ontario is continuing to modernize the Mining Act to ensure it remains one of the top jurisdictions in how exploration and development are carried out, there are other jurisdictions that have implemented these processes themselves. We’re keeping pace with these jurisdictions. Online registration of mining claims is already in place in British Columbia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Saskatchewan and Quebec. Manitoba and Nunavut are in the process of implementation of this new approach to the staking of mining claims.", "So you see, Speaker, and members of this Legislature, it is important that Ontario maintain its leading place in the technique and the practice of staking mining claims. We do not want to fall behind, given the rich, rich possibilities that await us in the mining industry here in Ontario.", "I have been asked, that being the case, why we have not moved sooner with these implementations. I’ve also been asked how much it is going to cost. Well, Ontario is a huge province, as you know, Speaker, a huge province, much larger than any of the other provinces that I have referenced, with the possible exception of Quebec. So a significant amount of work is required to complete the initiative that we’ve taken. Ontario has decided to do it in a phased-implementation manner so that we get all of these technical online pieces in place in an orderly fashion, so there is a phased transition to the new system. Phase 1 of the modernizing of the act was implemented in 2011, phase 2 in 2012 and 2013, and we have committed to phase 3 in the 2014 budget. So, Speaker, at the end of the exercise, Ontario will continue to be the leader in mining and exploration." ],

I was part of the Standing Committee on General Government, which, for over 18 months, went around the province to discuss the update that could be made to the ARA act. There were several members who are still here and a lot of members who aren’t here in the Legislature anymore, enabled by our great researcher Jerry Richmond. We would say Jerry rocks. Jerry is retired now also, but he kept us all together, because it did go over a lot of months, to keep track of all the issues. I think we’re happy to finally see legislation. We’ve been begging for it since the report was tabled over two years ago. Different ministers have been in the portfolio. But there really needs to be an update.", "Geography determines where aggregates are. I live in Haliburton–Kawartha Lakes–Brock. There are aggregates all over my riding. In fact, there are the top aggregate producers, municipal producers of Ontario. Kawartha Lakes, the largest municipality in my riding, is in that category of the top 10 producers in the province of Ontario.", "We tried to make recommendations that strike a balance between the aggregate functions and living with the neighbours, the municipalities, the environment. We see that many recommendations we made are not in this bill, so I’m hoping that when the bill comes to committee we can make some.", "One is haul routes, H-A-U-L, haul routes. For example, I can have an aggregate facility in Trent Lakes in my riding, but the roads they haul the aggregates on, to where they’re providing the aggregates, are actually through another municipality. Therefore, the money does not go to the municipality where there’s the most wear and tear on their roads. So we want to see the increased levy, but we want it to go to the municipality, especially in this case, that has the most wear and tear due to the aggregates." ],

There is some updating, and there are some definitions that are going to be changed, something that I described in my one-hour lead that I believe I had just a couple of weeks ago.

And I remember welcoming the member who just spoke, from Haliburton–Kawartha Lakes–Brock, to Manitoulin Island when she did come on behalf of the committee. I was happy to see those new faces from her area and other areas of the province coming to my riding.", "Some of the things that are not contained in this bill are that there are no clear solutions to those seeking greater restrictions on the large quarry operations in sensitive areas like the Niagara Escarpment. That’s not in this bill.", "It does not require a needs assessment to help balance interests when land use decisions are being made about quarry applications. That is not in this bill.", "The bill is silent on maximizing the use of recycling aggregate, something that I talked on extensively during my one-hour lead last week.", "The bill offers no clear solutions for those seeking remedies for excessive noise, truck traffic or other impacts of aggregates operations.

That is not within this bill, as well.", "So the government can stand and say that this is a great bill, but a lot is left to, “Well, let’s hope they do the right thing;” and if we look at the track record of this Liberal government, they’ve been failing with an F for a very long time." ],

But at the same time, I want to say that it has always been important to me, because when I was growing up, actually, my father had a company in Italy, not here, and that’s what he did. He had quarries. So I’m familiar with the industry because I recall when I was a child visiting some of these quarries and how significant they were for the benefit of the economy at the time. They were used to make roads and to make bridges and we know how important infrastructure is for any society. So we have that aspect that brings it back home in many ways.", "Today, we have the ability to recycle aggregates and to reuse a non-renewable resource, if you will, in a much better way.

If indigenous communities are notified that a claim has been staked, how will that notification occur?

Should the proposed bill be enacted—this piece of legislation—the new mining lands administration system would enhance that existing notification process by providing for automatic, real-time notification to indigenous communities following a claim registration. This will give First Nation or indigenous communities in the area of a mining claim that has been staked instantaneous notice. They’ll get the same in-time notice that everyone else gets the moment that that claim is filed through the computer.", "I should add this important point also: First Nation reserves are not open for mining claim staking under provincial legislation. Reserve lands are federally administered and within the federal legislative jurisdiction process.", "I want to say something about how governments will ensure that large areas cannot be easily tied up by a few companies.

I believe anybody who represents a rural area will have significant experience and interaction with their constituents over aggregate extraction in our ridings. I have had significant interactions as well.", "I want to first start off—this act provides an undue and significant broadening of the powers of the minister, which is not what people are looking for. I’ll draw attention to a couple of places. Section 37: “Upon issuing an aggregate permit, the minister may attach such conditions to the permit as he or she considers necessary.” At any time, the minister may also “add a condition to an aggregate permit, rescind or vary a condition of an aggregate permit or amend an aggregate permit in any other way.”", "Speaker, we need and we expect that we live under the rule of law, not under the rule of ministerial edict. This bill provides all-encompassing authority to the minister, often without any right of appeal. I find it quite odd, knowing what the select committee recommended to this House on improvements to the Aggregate Resources Act, why the government would now come out with such broad, arbitrary powers vested into the minister.", "Once somebody has a permit, has met all the criteria, has met all the functions and thresholds to extract, to then give the minister the authority to just arbitrarily change the conditions of the permit is absolutely, fundamentally wrong. That’s just one element of this bill that I would like people to look at.", "I think this bill also misses the mark on a distribution formula for funding between municipalities with aggregates and those municipalities that use aggregates. I think it’s important for us to recognize—and I believe why aggregates can be so contentious—I think they’re symbolic of that urban/rural divide that many people speak about. Aggregates, by and large, are located in rural Ontario, but they’re utilized disproportionately in urban Ontario. We see all these requirements placed on the extraction of aggregates, often either by the ministry or by different urban groups. But they’re the beneficiaries of it, and the rural municipalities do not get much of a share in the wealth created from aggregates. This bill is silent on that aspect.", "Something else that I want to just draw people’s attention to—and I found the number astonishing. A number of years ago—it was during the select committee—I found out that over 90% of our aggregates in Ontario are already off limits. They cannot be extracted either due to site conditions or, more often, regulatory restrictions. Over 90% of our aggregates cannot ever be taken out of the ground in this province. That’s an astonishing number.", "Of course, the other element behind our aggregates that we need to understand is that we’re having fewer and fewer people engaged in the extraction of aggregates. Competition has been reduced. Small pit and quarry operators have not been able to keep pace with the regulatory environment and the cost of doing business in this province. We’ve lost many family owned and operated pits and quarries in my riding and throughout the province, and that has led to an increased cost and a reduction of competition.", "I’d like to turn it over to my colleague." ],

As we first came in this morning, we were scared that they were going to limit debate, so I wanted to get a few more things on the record for my municipalities and on the work we did for that committee.", "In 2011, after the election—the ARA review was basically an election issue in some of the ridings, so thus we started. It was a really great committee as we travelled the province. We made 38 recommendations. One that I mentioned earlier, that I just highlighted, is the fact that I have aggregate producers and then I have haul routes. If there’s a pit or a quarry in one municipality, it can be right on the edge of that municipality, but the wear and tear on the roads—because I have fewer provincial highways, they’re actually over municipal roads.", "The remuneration is very low. I have to go back in my memory quickly; I think it’s 11 and a half cents, and maybe six cents go to the municipality. The municipalities in my area are actually losing money because the pittance they get from the fees does not compensate for the roads they have to build. You can imagine these big trucks on culverts and bridges. The wear and tear is excessive.", "The ministry, in this bill, is recommending an increase, and I’m more than happy that that is finally coming, five years later. It’s the distribution, and the fact that we don’t really know how much it’s going to increase and how it’s going to be distributed. When we were in committee, we heard a lot about a fund that it goes into, like a separate trust, a dedicated fund into which the dollars go. I must say that the aggregate association worked well with a lot of municipalities. They were ahead of the mark and made recommendations even before our committee started. They were with us at committee, the Ontario Stone, Sand and Gravel Association and many municipalities. They had already looked ahead to see what they could do.", "What we see here are not specifics—I always worry when it’s all left up to regulation; I know some things have to be—of how this increase per tonne is actually going to be distributed. I want to say that in Trent Lakes, where half of the quarries are actually on crown land, that is actually not addressed. If you have extraction from crown land, you actually don’t get any money from the per-tonne extraction, yet they use the municipal roads. That was definitely recommended, in our view—and the minister is nodding her head, so I appreciate that—but it’s not really clarified here.", "Northern Ontario could be a different issue; I understand that. That’s what we heard when we travelled. That’s why it’s good to travel on committee to other parts of the province. But in southern Ontario, when we have a small municipality like Trent Lakes and they don’t have any remuneration and 50% of their pits and quarries are on crown land, it’s very impactful. Their roads are in desperate need of repair, yet their budget, because of low population in the township, is not there. I’m hoping the minister looks at that.", "From Trent Lakes, most of the haul route on several quarries goes through the municipality of the city of Kawartha Lakes and actually through several villages. Again, they’re not getting any money, and yet they have the most wear and tear from certain pits and quarries on their roads. When TAPMO, which is the Top Aggregate Producing Municipalities of Ontario, saw this as an issue, they said we should have dedicated funds on the use of roads for aggregates and then divide them up fairly.", "I know that the member from Caledon mentioned recycling. Certainly, we’d like to see recycling a little stronger in the bill. We don’t need to extract as much from pits and quarries if we use more recycled materials. We see some municipalities—and even the government did actually, I think, 30% use of recycled aggregate, yet a lot of municipalities, when they put to tender, they say “no recycled,” which is something that should be looked at, and I think it’s in all our best interests.", "I have very limited time, but one more is about mapping. The town of Caledon did mapping so that people coming in could actually see where deposits were that may be future-developed, and I think that should be across the province of Ontario.", "Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for that leniency." ],

I think it’s important to acknowledge that the communities where the aggregates or the materials or natural resources are—the municipalities should receive some remuneration. I think that’s an important point in fairness, so I want to acknowledge that comment being raised by both members who just spoke.", "When we’re talking about the aggregate issue, an area that’s been very unclear and an area where there has been significant problems is with respect to gravel truck drivers. These are the drivers who go into the pits and have their trucks loaded up. There’s a massive lack of clarity with respect to this issue. The drivers have had numerous complaints. They’ve done strikes, and it’s really because of a lack of leadership with respect to the ministry. What’s happening is that you have drivers who are coming to a pit. They’re driving in a gravel truck, and their beds are being filled up by the loaders. What happens is that these are tonnes and tonnes of material that are being put into a truck. The driver cannot control where the material is being loaded. What happens is, when they’re pulled over, the ministry then charges not because they’re carrying over the capacity—they’re carrying well within the capacity of their truck—but then there’s axle-weight capacity. So if the material, if the aggregate is a little bit too much on one axle, then they’re charged with an offence, and these offences are quite expensive. It’s not a criminal offence, it’s a highway traffic offence, but even for a provincial offence, the fines are so high that it actually costs them more to pay the fine than what they earn in a day.", "This is an issue where the government needs to provide some more clarity. A driver can’t control where loaders put the materials. They can look at the overall weight, but they can’t control the aggregates being on a particular axle or not. That’s an area where the government needs to provide some more leadership." ],

We were on the committee that travelled the province with the member from Haliburton, and I think it was a very productive exercise, because we went all the way up to Manitoulin and saw how they ship aggregates to Cleveland and everything. I think we learned that this is a very complex issue dealing with many competing interests. That’s why you can’t have one-off comments about this bill.", "We do know that this bill is certainly long overdue, but it is not a silver bullet because there are very difficult issues. For instance—I think the member from Haliburton mentioned this—the most perplexing thing I found was that all the local municipalities were complaining about the aggregate industry and the damage to the roads, yet we found out that the local municipalities do not use recycled aggregates. They refuse to. Their engineers say, “Recycled aggregates are not up to our standard,” yet the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario uses recycled aggregates; 30% of the aggregates used by the MTO are recycled.", "We asked many municipal leaders—I remember Mr. Seiling and others came—“Why don’t you use recycled aggregates? You would reduce the impact on your municipalities, you would reduce costs, yet your engineers don’t allow the use of recycled aggregates.” It was just mind-boggling to see this. It is one of the perplexing aspects of this bill.", "Anyway, it is something that needs oversight, it is a good bill that blends together a lot of interests, and it’s overdue." ],

Again, as has been pointed out, 38 recommendations came forward for consideration, and we’ve been waiting five years for action on those recommendations.", "I’m really glad the member from Eglinton–Lawrence mentioned the recycling aspect. That is so, so important. This is 2016. We should be thinking about how those infamous “Rs” can be applied to the aggregate sector. We, too, support the notion of doing better in that regard and improving and recognizing greater opportunities to do just that: recycle our aggregates as we move forward with our road development and rehabilitation.", "Another thing I’d like to touch on is the fact that mapping is very, very important. I commend my colleague from Dufferin–Caledon on the work that she did along with the member from Haliburton–Kawartha Lakes–Brock. The town of Caledon is leading by example. They’ve gone out on their own initiative and mapped out the future development of aggregate resources.", "I think this is imperative as we go forward as a province, so that when they’re looking at relocating or opportunities for development in our local municipalities, people are able to recognize very quickly the future development of aggregates, because it will make a difference.", "Just to close my two minutes in terms of comments, I want to say that members in this House spent a lot of time on the report that came out of the Standing Committee on General Government. I know this minister will take those recommendations to heart and do the best she can." ],

It’s actually a very educational bill for many of us because, as members have said, geographically, it really dictates where this bill will be particularly important.", "This is an almost entirely enabling legislation, with very few details. The blueprint report that was done, A Blueprint for Change, has many, many recommendations that weren’t adapted into this bill, and the changes that are happening from the blueprint are left to regulation.", "This all kind of came about because of the example that Melancthon went through, where a developer, or a corporation, purchased farmland in quantities, in acreages—500 acres—in quite a substantial amount. The community was left thinking that they were going to use it for farmland. It turned out that Melancthon didn’t have the intention of using it for farmland and food production but, indeed, for aggregate purposes. In a lot of ways, that was the case that drove this legislation.", "Leaving a lot of these things to regulation isn’t really something that people can put a lot of faith in. We need to have legislation that actually will work for the companies and for the communities that they’re going to use their resources from. We talked about that with regard to the environmental piece. That’s very important to communities. We don’t want to have those things dumped back into our environment. We want to make sure that we recycle those aggregates appropriately. I think helping the communities will make a big difference when it comes to the environment." ],

Some of the recommendations—I’m hoping he’s going to come into committee when we have maybe a potential to put some amendments forward.", "I had left off about mapping. Municipalities could map where deposits are. We all can see where the quarries are now. But we also wanted to have a process that was simplified—digitalized. We said to digitalize it, so people could go online. They can go on now and see where sites are. Digitalize the whole permitting, to see if there’s a pit and quarry operated that hasn’t acted in good faith.", "I’m a little concerned with some of the bill, where it says every licensee shall pay an annual fee in the prescribed amount within the prescribed timeline. But it says “shall,” and in the current legislation—it was “shall” and now it’s “may.” We have to have a responsibility that the people who are taking out the licence for these pits and quarries have a responsibility to pay licence fees, but also that the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry can go in and make sure things are working properly and there are reports that are tabled annually.", "Enforcement needs to occur. The Ontario Stone, Sand and Gravel Association would like the resources for enforcement, right? Not themselves, but for enforcement to occur, so that this keeps this liveability that we have to have with the neighbours to pits and quarries, with municipalities and with the environment all above board.

Though we’re not a big mining town, my community is brimming with passionate advocates for a number of important issues such as safety, the environment and transparency, all of which are areas of concern within this bill.", "I will remind the Speaker that in Oshawa, we also have an international deep-water shipping port that connects to cross-country rail and the 400 series. We know a lot about industry and heavy road use and also finding that balance when it comes to protecting our sensitive environmental areas and our wetlands. So we do have thoughts on this bill. Let’s get to it.", "Today, we’re debating Bill 39, the Aggregate Resources and Mining Modernization Act. Coming in at 73 pages, it isn’t a light bill, but magically the government found a way to skim over a number of important details, still. As we know, this bill has two schedules which seek so amend the Aggregate Resources Act and the Mining Act—and, of course, we must applaud the government for another wonderful Liberal title by sticking the word “modernization” in there.", "I should also note that the government first proposed changes to the Aggregate Resources Act around five years ago; we’re just seeing this legislation now. That means that not only is it missing some important details, but it’s also coming five years late.", "These are some of the broad concerns we have about this bill, but as the bill amends two separate pieces of legislation, I would like to address each schedule separately as well.", "Starting with schedule 1, which pertains to the Aggregate Resources Act, once again, the government is asking the Legislature to trust it with vague enabling legislation that leaves almost all the crucial details to regulation. Again, this is after a long delay. The government has very little to show for over five long years of reviewing the Aggregate Resources Act, and we’re still waiting for details. Personally, I would assume that you could fill in some of those details after a five-year period, especially with so many weighing in on the bill, making recommendations which, by the way, we don’t see reflected in this piece of legislation. But anyway, perhaps I assumed too much.", "Back to what is missing: There aren’t any guidelines, purposes, statements of value or provincial interests in this policy framework. The bill enables certain powers, but doesn’t explain how these powers may or must be used. In short, the government can do pretty much anything it wants. The government could impose huge new regulatory burdens on the industry and make aggregate operations impossible, or it could allow every acre of wetland and prime farmland to become a gravel pit, operated without needing a licence or permit.", "That’s not good enough for stakeholders, environmentalists or the people of Ontario. They want and deserve proper details, just like they deserve with every piece of legislation that the government introduces and every decision they make that affects the general public.", "Speaker, a side note: The largest user of aggregates is the government, so you would think that they would be the leaders, that we would be leading, taking the lead, when it comes to recycling. But unfortunately, we’re not.", "This bill does not prevent the destruction of wetlands by aggregate extraction. It does not protect the Niagara Escarpment. As I said, in Oshawa, we have Second Marsh and we have McLaughlin Bay. They’re pretty close to our international deep-water shipping port and the industry that comes and goes through there. Locally, we appreciate the need for balance in preserving nearby wetlands and encouraging industry in supporting our roads. We do have thoughts on this, as do all people across Ontario.", "There are no interpretive guidelines or tools for approval authorities to help them balance the need for aggregate operations with other public interests.", "There is still no clear obligation to screen out pit or quarry applications that conflict with the government’s own protections for natural heritage or source water, as the Environmental Commissioner recommended a decade ago. If the government is sincere about modernizing the ARA to provide better environmental safeguards, then it should demonstrate this in the legislation.", "In short, there’s a lot that is missing. There’s a lot that hasn’t been addressed and a number of questions up in the air. I will be the first to admit that I am not an expert in this field and, as my colleague mentioned, this bill has been an opportunity for many of us to learn more about this field and this topic; but I am pretty sure that the Environmental Commissioner is indeed an expert in this field, as are the industry stakeholders that recognize what’s missing from this bill.", "During consultations—people have been asking for things. Why aren’t those recommendations seen in this piece of legislation? That’s another question. Apparently, the government knows best.", "What this bill does do is provide the minister and the Lieutenant Governor in Council the authority to do a number of different things. Some of them are important changes, such as allowing the minister to protect some of Ontario’s natural heritage; other changes are redundant or require further clarification, which we hope to hear soon. We look forward to hammering out some of those issues and details, filling in the blanks during committee.", "On to schedule 2 of the bill, which makes amendments to the Mining Act: Same as with schedule 1, the government has left the details in the amendments to the Mining Act almost entirely to further regulations after its passage.", "Again, the people of Ontario deserve more than this. The government has had plenty of time to iron out the details of this legislation in advance of its introduction, but they’ve chosen the Liberal approach of passing the legislation and then introducing the details in the dark. That’s a shame and a missed opportunity.", "These amendments have long been promised by the government. We should note that they were originally contained in Bill 155, the Mining Amendment Act. As we know, that bill died on the order paper, Speaker, when the government prorogued the Legislature, you might recall, for that one day in the fall—another example of when the government has put their interests ahead of the interests of Ontarians, but I digress.", "Back to the bill: The majority of the amendments are meant to streamline the antiquated claims process in the province, consistent with the government’s mineral development strategy. New Democrats have long championed the development of the mining resource industry in the province as a jobs and infrastructure creator, particularly in the northeast and northwest of the province.", "As my colleague from Algoma–Manitoulin had spoken at length about northern issues—this is a government that pretends to care about infrastructure, but it’s been dragging its feet on facilitating multi-billion-dollar infrastructure and job creation, which is affectionately being called the ring of smoke now. Here we have another example of where we could be seeing more.", "That’s why we support the government finally making amendments to the Mining Act, but that doesn’t excuse the manner that they’ve introduced them in or, again, what’s missing.", "This bill leaves the majority of details to regulation. The changes have moved at an almost glacial pace, and there is a continued lack of engagement on being party to necessary agreements between First Nations and industry.", "We have concerns about the lack of details. We wish to express our disappointment in the amount of time it has taken the government to finally address some of these problems. Ultimately, we are indeed supporting the legislation, but the government should be providing greater clarity to the bill. It should strengthen environmental considerations, especially protection of prime farmland and drinking water, but these are things that we’re going to push for at the committee stage.", "Again, it’s disappointing that they have taken so long to address some of these problems, then delayed them even further through prorogation. Just like in introducing this bill, the government has historically shown a lack of urgency towards facilitating multi-billion-dollar infrastructure and jobs generators in the north.", "Speaker, sometimes it feels like this is a broken record. We’re just dancing to the same broken record. How often can we say that the government has left the details out of the bill, the government has delayed the introduction of important amendments, the government has refused to properly consult with experts and stakeholders, and here we are again? We keep saying it, but they keep doing it. So I guess we’re back to where we started.", "Once again, the government is asking us to trust them with vague, enabling legislation that leaves almost all the crucial details to regulation. Once again, they have little to show for over five years of reviewing. Like I said, it’s a 73-page bill—it’s not a light bill—but it is still missing pieces.", "I’ve outlined the broad concerns we’ve been speaking about on this bill in the Legislature. I’d like to take a moment to thank my colleague the member for Timmins–James Bay, who has long served as the NDP critic for natural resources and forestry, and my colleague the member from Algoma–Manitoulin, who serves as the NDP critic for northern development and mines. They’ve done incredible work on these files. They’ve pushed for positive and necessary changes that have often fallen on deaf ears with this government. I know that being an opposition critic can be a thankless job some days, but I’d like to thank them for their work in this field. I want to thank them for their experience, their passion and their expertise. I hope the government has at least listened to a few things that you’ve suggested, now and on so many occasions in the past.", "We are supporting this bill. There are changes we will fight for. There is time to make this bill stronger, and we are happy to continue to make those suggestions, whether the government is listening or not." ],

I’m really delighted to know that the recommendations from the standing committee are reflected in this bill in response to what the standing committee put forward, for instance: the standardizing provisions for site plan amendments, which is recommendation 8; creating a framework for equalizing fees and royalties, which is recommendation 6; and enhancing provisions that will support improved reporting on rehabilitation and recycled aggregate production, which is recommendation 10; and so on and so forth. Certainly, that work that was done on A Blueprint for Change has also helped to inform this process. Other committee recommendations will be moving forward when we move to phase 2.", "In saying that, I’ve listened intently to many members on all sides of the House and have taken note of all those comments, and certainly I want to see this bill move forward as quickly as possible to committee so that we continue the work and the discussion with more public consultation and see what the committee can make of the bill and finally shape this moving forward.", "I did want to make my final comments after thanking all the members who have already spoken to this bill to talk about equalizing fees. This has been a subject of great interest with the municipalities, industry and the public. Certainly, equalizing fees between crown land and private land helps to address the ongoing burden that the municipalities face with infrastructure. So that particular discussion will move forward fairly quickly. The consultation has now finished. We’re now poring over that work, and that will be moving forward to see how that addresses it in the future.", "So again, Mr. Speaker, thank you to all who have spoken to the bill." ],

This is where we struggle for the balance.", "In his comments about recycling, to follow up with the member for Eglinton–Lawrence, the Ministry of Transportation has done trials of up to 30% use of recycled aggregate. Actually, one of the recommendations from our review was that they share their technical expertise and best practices regarding aggregate recycling. I think that we should push that further with other municipalities, certainly, to show them that it can be done. It has the right standards and I think those are very much what we need. In fact, there were nine recommendations, I believe it was, under recycled aggregate materials, so nine recommendations we actually made to that effect.", "There are also recommendations that were made in regard to the federation of agriculture, so basically aggregate operations and agricultural land. So there are great recommendations there about where the Ministry of Natural Resources, the Ministry of Agriculture and Food, the industry, the Ontario Aggregate Resources Corp. and other parties do the evaluation of current and potential innovative rehabilitation practices by which excavated areas may be returned to agriculture production. So we’re trying again to strike that balance.", "I just want to mention quickly the cumulative impact of aggregate operations on water resources.

On schedule 1 she talked about the ultimate problem being that it’s enabling legislation and the government is basically saying, “Trust us. We’ll do what’s right and we know what’s wrong.” She also touched on missing components that are not within the legislation that were absolutely within the blueprint, and unfortunately we didn’t see those in the bill.

Yes, we talked about the First Nations that are there and, yes, that process is highlighted under the aggregates act, where they’re actually identified this time. But what is that framework?

We think they should do more; we’ve got recommendations for them to do more. But at least MTO is using recycling when they build their roads.

It’s a series of industries, really. It’s not just one industry; it’s a series of industries. It deals with the municipalities. It deals with First Nations, that we have to consult with them, which we’ve done for years on this. The mining industry, the environmental concerns, the Ministry of the Environment, natural resources, wetlands—all of these have to be taken into account. The construction industry—wow. The agricultural community, the Ministry of Agriculture—all of these ministries, industries and communities had to be consulted. That’s why it’s taken the time it has.

  "text" : [ "I’m happy to speak and, like the member from Haliburton, I think we have so much to say about this bill. It was a fascinating experience to see the industries that are related to aggregate resources. Again, some of the ironic things I’ve found in this whole issue over the years—I know, even in my own riding, I had these signs on front lawns of big stone houses saying, “Stop the mega quarry.” And I said to people, “Well, where do you think all the rocks and stone to build your big stone mansion come from, and your swimming pool and your paved driveway?” I said, “Maybe you should build your house of wood, if you really want to do the environmental thing.”", "So there is a disconnect between people who use the aggregates and where the aggregates come from. They don’t know the challenges that people in small rural communities have with the aggregate hauling, with the extraction, the impact on the environment, the water table, the wetlands. There’s a need to try and educate people in cities about the relationship between building all these mammoth homes made out of extracts from quarries, and building highways. People are driving up and down the new 407 there and they’re talking about how we need this 407, yet they don’t realize that it comes from aggregates. Without the aggregate pits and the excavation, you’re not going to have the highways; you’re not going to have the new schools, the hospitals. So that’s the reality that sometimes makes things difficult.", "I remember it was a very interesting deputation we had from the former Environmental Commissioner. He said that he had the answer to all this conflict. He said what we should do is basically extract aggregate only from northern Ontario and ship it by train into the urban areas in the south. That was his simple solution. I said, “Yeah, in a dream world you might be able to do that. Who’s going to pay for the building of all these railroads all across the province and hauling aggregates off trains onto trucks in the cities?” There’s no simple solution, as proposed by the former Environmental Commissioner.", "But we’ve heard from some very knowledgeable, intelligent people. We visited aggregate sites. We walked them up in Manitoulin. We walked them up in Ottawa and all throughout the Guelph and Kitchener area. We saw first-hand the incredible industry and the challenges they have. One of the challenges they have is that to get approvals for an aggregate pit, it takes up to 10 years, and that adds to the cost. I think one of the recommendations we made is to try and streamline this approval process, which shouldn’t take 10 years.", "On the other hand, the 10 years and the delays occur because there are many objections. Every aggregate pit has countless numbers of objections from local communities, agricultural groups and environmental groups, so it is a very painful, slow and costly process to get one of these approvals. That’s the challenge, I think, the ministry had in trying to come up with this legislation: to try and be fair with everyone. That’s why it’s been a very deliberate process of examination, of consultation, of changes that have to be made, because it’s also a changing industry, with the new technologies that are occurring in the whole area of using recycled materials and the whole area of mitigating impacts on water tables.", "But there is, as I’ve said, a need to bring this legislation up to date, and it is a very comprehensive bill. Is it going to solve all the conflicts? By no means, no. There are just too many very difficult, challenging issues.", "I can recall talking to the members who represent areas where there’s aggregate extraction. The challenges they have from what happens on the roads, what happens with the dust, what happens with the impact, perhaps, on water tables, the whole issue about getting the aggregate—because the aggregates have to be close to markets to make it affordable. So if you’re hauling trucks full of aggregates from northern Ontario down to the GTA, it’s not going to work financially, because there’s a cost in terms of trucking, etc.", "These are some of the things that came up. Again, as I said, we had people with scientific backgrounds, geologists; we had agricultural community representatives come forward and talk about the need to take into account the impact on agricultural land, like we had in Melancthon. But, as you know, in Melancthon, what happened is that the Ministry of the Environment did an unprecedented thing and asked for a full environmental assessment of the Melancthon application, and that basically killed it. The American company who tried to get in there disappeared, thankfully.", "We just have to remember, though—I think it’s essentially an awareness issue—that we are all connected. Therefore, if we demand more aggregates to build our homes, to build our roads, to build our office buildings—and we have a lot of construction, thank God, in Ontario. But remember, the construction material—raw materials—comes from generally agricultural rural areas. There’s an impact there, so there’s a price to pay.", "Again, I think many members have mentioned that they would like to propose amendments and make the bill stronger. I think this is very important, because I think we have a number of members who have got good backgrounds in this legislation, and we know that there are some issues that may be missed in this bill. I know that a number of us have taken an interest in this and there’s a need to really ensure that the experts—again, the stakeholders, their cultural community, the industry—are brought forward to the Legislature in the committee so that we can make amendments to make this bill the best we can. Again, it’s not going to be easy, but we need to hear from those people so that we can finally get a bill that’s going to be workable to the benefit of the economy of Ontario and the environment of Ontario. It’s something that is really needed, because it is a backbone.", "I think there has been over nine and a half hours of debate, and I think we should go listen at committee, where we can make this bill stronger. As a result, Mr. Speaker, I move that this question be now put." ],

La francophonie ontarienne est plus forte que jamais, avec plus de 600 000 citoyennes et citoyens, jeunes et moins jeunes, venus d’ici et d’ailleurs, qui la dynamisent au quotidien et dessinent son avenir pour les générations futures.", "Si la communauté franco-ontarienne réussit à persister, c’est d’abord et avant tout parce qu’elle s’est donné les moyens de nourrir sa langue et sa culture. À force de courage et de conviction, elle a surmonté les écueils qui ont jalonné son parcours et s’est affirmée au rythme de ses paroles et de ses actions.", "Le rayonnement de la francophonie ontarienne passe par une foule d’institutions comme ses écoles, ses collèges et ses universités, ses médias, ainsi que ses organismes culturels et communautaires qui alimentent son appartenance à un patrimoine culturel riche qui dépasse nos frontières.", "Ce rayonnement passe par un cadre de gouvernance et des lois qui garantissent à une minorité linguistique comme la communauté franco-ontarienne l’accès à des services gouvernementaux en français dans toute une gamme de domaines.", "Telle est la raison d’être de la Loi sur les services en français.

Ainsi, plus de 50 000 Ontariennes et Ontariens s’ajoutent à la francophonie au sens de la Loi sur les services en français.", "La population francophone, à l’image de la province, affiche de multiples visages et accents venus de partout dans le monde.

I wish to recognize the long history and contributions of First Nations, Métis and Inuit in Ontario and also give special acknowledgment to the Mississaugas of the New Credit.", "Two years ago, I spoke in this House about the treaty relationship and our commitment with indigenous partners to establish a treaty awareness day. Together with indigenous partners, we decided to expand on that commitment by introducing legislation to designate the first full week of November as Treaties Recognition Week, making Ontario the first province in Canada to dedicate a week to raising awareness of treaties, treaty rights and treaty relationships.", "In May of this year, the Treaties Recognition Week Act, 2016, was passed with the support of all parties of this House, and I want to thank all parties for their support. This legislation was passed the same day that Premier Wynne apologized to residential school survivors and announced our government’s statement of commitment and reconciliation with indigenous peoples. We were honoured to be joined by indigenous leaders and residential school survivors on that historic and hopeful day.", "Before I touch on these initiatives, I would like to take a moment to reflect on the importance of Treaties Recognition Week for all Ontarians. This province was founded on treaties. They shape its past, present and future. They are the reason we know Ontario as it exists today. Treaties represent solemn agreements to live together on this land through the formal exchange of promises that created rights and responsibilities for Canada, Ontario and First Nations. They formalize a relationship between the crown and First Nations based on principles of trust and mutual respect, and were meant to be lasting, meaningful agreements.", "Sadly, governments have not always lived up to the promises in treaties. We are working to change this. Ontario’s treaty strategy is guiding the way we work with indigenous partners to revitalize treaty relationships. Treaties Recognition Week supports these efforts by helping to build public awareness and promote education about these important issues.", "Everyone should have the opportunity to learn more about the importance of treaties, because as Ontarians, treaties are at the heart of our shared history. Understanding this shared history is the necessary first step on our journey toward healing and reconciliation with indigenous peoples. Treaties Recognition Week is about creating a lasting dialogue in Ontario to help everyone understand where we came from and how we can move forward together in a spirit of reconciliation.", "Last month, we partnered with Anishinabek Nation to mark the beginning of Treaties Recognition Week at the David Bouchard school in Oshawa. This event also marked the launch of a high school treaty learning kit, Understanding Our Nation to Nation Relationship. It was produced to help educators teach students in grades 9 to 12 about treaty relationships.", "On the same day, Premier Wynne visited Northern Secondary School in Toronto for the first Living Library presentation of the week with Michael Etherington of the Native Canadian Centre and elder Dr. Duke Redbird.", "Throughout the week, we continued to work with indigenous partners and the Ministry of Education. Together, we identified and brought more than 25 presenters into nearly 60 classrooms, gymnasiums and auditoriums. We worked with 14 local school boards across the province to support educators in teaching students about the importance of treaties and how they are relevant today. I want to especially thank the partners we worked with and everyone who offered their time and energy to travel to schools to bring this message to students.", "Education was the central theme of this first Treaties Recognition Week. The Ministry of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation worked very closely with Minister Hunter and the Ministry of Education to reach students and educators in school boards across this province.", "In addition to the Living Library series, we wanted to give educators the resources they needed to make treaty learning a part of classroom learning throughout the school year. The Ministry of Education is supporting that goal by working to embed learning about First Nations, Métis and Inuit cultures and histories in the Ontario curriculum.", "To help students build on the knowledge they have gained from the Living Library presentations, the Ministry of Education has created a special curriculum link to resources available to educators on EduGAINS and ÉduSource Web pages. These supports are designed to highlight treaties, treaty relationships and treaty rights in classes like grade 7 history or grade 10 civics and citizenship.", "These new supports build on existing treaty learning initiatives such as the First Nations and Treaties map of Ontario and the accompanying teaching resources which were sent to every school in the province in 2014. These efforts from the Ministry of Education support our government’s response to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Calls to Action. The Calls to Action included working with indigenous partners to enhance Ontario’s curriculum with mandatory learning about residential schools, treaties and the legacy of colonialism.", "Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, let me say that Treaties Recognition Week was created because treaty rights and treaty relationships are a part of the story we all share in this province. We need opportunities to learn more about that shared history and shared responsibility going forward so together we understand the wrongs of the past and build a future based on strong relationships of respect and trust. I am proud to say that this first Treaties Recognition Week has helped all to take a step in that direction. We look forward to building on this initiative next year and for the years to come, as we walk with indigenous partners on the path to healing and reconciliation. Thank you. Meegwetch." ],

It’s going to take decisive action to send a signal to the world that Ontario is open for business and to kick-start the investment and innovation that we so desperately need here in our province.", "It’s been said many times before, but I’d like to reiterate today that Ontario currently has over 380,000 regulations on the books. The CFIB conservatively estimates that the cost of regulation in Ontario has grown from $12.7 billion in 2005 to almost $15 billion in 2014. The Liberal government has clearly taken us down the wrong track for over a decade when it comes to red tape and the overregulation of Ontario businesses.", "As I said in my opening about a month ago, when we started debating this bill, we will be supporting it because we desperately need some action on red tape, but clearly this bill is missing a lot. Even with an hour to speak in total to Bill 27, it’s difficult to cover much ground because this is such a large omnibus bill which covers such a broad assortment of issues.", "I’d like to pay credit to our leader, Patrick Brown, and our caucus, who have identified the key economic challenges faced by businesses and the business community in the province. Our leader has laid out his four pillars for economic development, and he identifies red tape as being the first pillar of economic development of a PC government. He talks about energy costs, infrastructure and the skills mismatch, which we all hear about from the businesses in this province.", "When I left off talking about the Burden Reduction Act, I was giving some real-life examples of red tape from around the province. That is where I’ll be picking up today. Again, it seems like the government was mostly concerned about reducing the burden on the government, rather than families and businesses, when they crafted this bill, so I think it’s important to bring these examples to light.", "There’s a lot of work to do in reducing the burden of regulations on our businesses, and this bill, despite its promising title, barely scratches the surface. I would like to highlight the case of one business owner from northeastern Ontario who was told that to renew her TSSA registration, she must get confirmation from the Ministry of Government Services that her corporation is in good standing. If she lived in Toronto, she could just pop by the office and obtain that confirmation for $22, but because she lives in northeastern Ontario, she has to hire a company to get the confirmation for her, and it will cost over $50.", "I understand that we live in a large province, so there will naturally be some barriers that arise because of geography, but there is no reason something like this couldn’t be done online. There’s a feeling in many places in this province that politicians and bureaucrats are living in a Toronto bubble, and this is a pretty classic case. A downtown location may seem convenient when you’re sitting at Queen’s Park or in Whitney Block, but it can represent a logistical nightmare for anyone doing business outside the GTA.", "It’s common sense today, and we all know it, that we have the ability with current technology to overcome what were previously unavoidable inconveniences for these businesses. There are a few things in this bill which update the way in which paperwork and documentation are processed, allowing for more to be done online, but it doesn’t go far enough.", "This government needs to be sending out a very strong signal to the bureaucracy, to crown corporations and to government contractors that it’s time to streamline. It’s time to modernize and use all the tools available to make doing business in every corner of the province as simple and as efficient as possible. These types of solutions represent a trifling cost to implement, and it’s really the lowest-hanging fruit in terms of what government can do to support Ontario’s businesses.", "“Streamline” is really the watchword here because we have seen unfortunate examples of this government’s attempts to modernize, resulting in new headaches for businesses. One such example was brought to my attention by the CFIB. It relates to small manufacturers and importers in Ontario who have to report on product packaging and printed paper. Some companies are exempt, but they have no way of knowing if they are exempt or not until they fill out a long, poorly designed online form. Instead of stating the exemptions up front, the form simply stops working and instructs users to call the agency for clarification.", "There has to be an easier way to do this, Mr. Speaker. What a waste of time for both companies and agency employees. These types of processes are in serious need of some common sense.", "Speaking of a lack of common sense, we might turn our attention to this government’s policies relating to alcohol. I doubt very much that even the members across the aisle, let alone the public, can understand the tangled web of who can sell alcohol, how much they can sell and when they can sell it.", "CTV News highlighted just one of the convoluted and redundant policy knots attributed to this complicated system. The Old Third winery in Prince Edward county was having issues with the LCBO licensing process—a not uncommon problem for wineries, I understand. The LCBO charges the vineyard for selling wine by the glass on vineyard property, so it’s as if the winery had sold the bottle to the LCBO for distribution and then bought the bottle back for sale, despite the wine never having left their property. Additionally, the LCBO monopoly prevents a small winery from selling internationally. It has to go through the LCBO. So we have a homegrown business facing hurdle after hurdle because the provincial government wants to micromanage their sector.", "Half the frustration with red tape is not about compliance, but trying to understand what the government actually wants. Regulations are made much more onerous when individuals and companies aren’t able to easily decipher what applies to them and how much they can comply.", "When a government accumulates regulations the way this government has, it drains resources from the private sector. These resources are therefore unavailable for research and development or capital investment, which would fuel economic growth, productivity and job creation.", "Speaker, I’ve heard a broad range of complaints like this when it comes to the Ontario Electronic Stewardship program. Headaches continue to arise from this program because information is both hard to find and difficult to understand.", "The time and other resources that go into these efforts to adhere to regulations translate into lost productivity that is ultimately detrimental to Ontario’s economy. We don’t want employers and employees tied up, taking them away from their operations and pulling their hair out in frustration as they struggle to understand confusing or contradictory regulations.", "Speaker, I’ve also heard a lot of concern around the environmental compliance approval system, which is long overdue for modernization. What Bill 27 does right here is allow for more business activities to move to the Environmental Activity and Sector Registry, the online self-registration system available for certain low-risk activities. I also applaud the government moving to allow inspectors from the environment ministry to gather more information by phone or email rather than requiring face-to-face meetings. The parliamentary assistant mentioned this as a great time saver for government personnel, but I’ve certainly heard from private sector stakeholders that having to take time away from their operations to deal with various government proxies is an ongoing aggravation.", "With the high cost of doing business in Ontario, many businesses are running as lean as they possibly can, with a minimum of staff, so pulling a manager or business owner away from their regular work is a major imposition. But unfortunately, as pleased as I am to see some work being done to simplify these processes, this is still an area where this government seems to be working at serious cross-purposes.", "The approvals process needs to be addressed more comprehensively than what we’ve seen in this bill. Companies are facing delays that average around two years, which is a real deterrent to new investment and results in delayed implementation of more environmentally beneficial technologies in GHG reduction initiatives.", "Speaker, I spoke with a representative from one company in particular who wanted to reduce their energy consumption and reduce emissions by investing in a new piece of machinery. Unfortunately, because the approvals process for bringing in new machinery is so convoluted and the Ministry of the Environment was never able to offer definitive specifications, this turned into a procurement process that lasted two and a half years, so machinery that reduced emissions and cut power consumption sat unused in the shop waiting for the government to sign off. That doesn’t sound to me like a government that is prioritizing the environment. It doesn’t sound to me like a government that supports innovation. If I were a business owner, that doesn’t sound to me like a government I would want to deal with.", "Another case of nightmare bureaucracy came from a company that was also doing its best to be environmentally friendly. This manufacturer had their facility inspected by someone from the ministry and was told that there was good news and bad news. The good news was that there were no problems and he was impressed with the facility. The bad news was that the company would have to hire a consultant to the tune of $60,000 to confirm that. “You just have to pay the money and wait,” they were told; wait and wait and wait, because it takes the government up to three years to review the consultant’s report.", "Speaker, during those three years, companies are expected to freeze their operations so that the report remains accurate, so no new machinery or processes are to be introduced, which is plainly absurd and certainly not what a government that prioritizes innovation should be requiring. When the company raised this as an issue, they were told they should go ahead and make changes but to hire a lawyer to deal with the complications this may cause, which goes to show just how out of touch this government has become.", "These are precious resources for companies already pushed to the brink by high energy costs. Why should these companies pay the price for this government’s redundancies and backlogs? That last example, Speaker, in particular really highlights a problem that goes hand in hand with red tape here in Ontario. The high-level bureaucratic intervention here is being exacerbated by the financial constraints that high debt and ongoing deficits are imposing. With inadequate resources to enforce and administer these hundreds of thousands of rules and regulations, people and businesses are left waiting far longer than is reasonable for paperwork and approvals. The government has overspent and overregulated, and the result is that they can’t afford to maintain their own protocols effectively, which leads to a drag on the private sector, slowing productivity growth and reducing overall real economic growth in our province.", "The Fraser Institute recently highlighted a study conducted in the United States which tracked government regulations over 35 years across a broad array of sectors. This study found that regulations distorted investment choices that lead to innovation and “created a drag on the US economy amounting to an average reduction in the annual growth rate of the US gross domestic product of 0.8%.”", "The Fraser Institute holds this study up as a warning for us. I’ll quote Professor Steven Globerman here: “The US productivity experience should be a cautionary tale for legislators everywhere, including Canada. Regulations are difficult to remove once implemented, as they create groups in society with vested interests in preserving regulations that shield those groups from direct or indirect competition. The available evidence suggests that there is a potentially large economic payoff to eliminating regulations that have net social costs, as well as to forbearing from implementing new regulations with unfavourable benefit-cost rations.”", "Now that the incoming government in the United States has signalled that they plan to pursue an aggressive economic agenda, there has to be a wake-up call to the province of Ontario and to this government in particular. We are in direct competition with the United States. Our companies here already have states like New York, Kentucky, Ohio and Indiana banging down their doors, offering them all sorts of incentives to move south.", "We need strong leadership from this government today. We need a real plan to create a business climate in Ontario that can compete with the United States. We can’t afford to continue to tinker with a system that needs a complete overhaul.", "In the last week, I have heard from businesses that are seriously concerned about this. I’ve spoken with business owners who want to stay in our province because it’s their home and because they care about their employees, but they know that at some point it’s not going to be viable for them to operate in Ontario. I know that my Liberal colleagues are hearing the same concerns, and yet, to date, there has been no signal from this government that things are going to improve.", "I spoke last month about how the proposals in this Burden Reduction Act are, unfortunately, absolutely dwarfed by what we’ve seen come forward in the Changing Workplaces Review interim report.", "I think it’s also pertinent to mention the tremendous burden this government plans to impose on the private sector with its cap-and-trade cash grab. Even before the scheme is implemented, it’s costing our business, as managers and business owners dedicate days and weeks trying to decipher what cap-and-trade will mean for their company. The stakes are very high for them because they’re already coping with the most expensive energy costs in all of North America.", "One long-time Scarborough-based family business, Automatic Coating, which employs 75 people, spoke with the media recently and shared that they expect cap-and-trade to cost their business around $127,000 annually. Jocelyn Williams Bamford, a vice-president at Automatic Coating, said, “For the past two months, I spent more time on cap-and-trade and energy policy than I have on growing my business.... It’s a recipe for disaster.”", "Automatic Coating is not alone. High energy costs coupled with the spectre of cap-and-trade have led to a no-growth-in-Ontario mandate for many businesses. It’s led to many companies formulating an exit strategy from Ontario.", "Manufacturers in this province are saying that many Liberal policies seem to be designed to run them out of town. They need something much more substantial than what the government is offering them at this point.", "I have talked a lot about red tape in general, as did the minister and his parliamentary assistant when they spoke on Bill 27. But there are few schedules of this bill I’d like to get into more detail on today as well, because this bill isn’t simply about red tape reduction.", "Concerns have been raised already in the Legislature by the members for Parkdale–High Park and Toronto–Danforth about schedule 16 of this bill, and I would like to draw the government’s attention to it once again. Schedule 16 includes the provision of a mechanism which enables Ontario Place Corp. to acquire and dispose of “land, buildings and structures, or any interest in land, buildings and structures, by purchase, lease or otherwise.”", "The government has thus far refused to justify this inclusion of a provision that would allow for the sale of Ontario Place assets. Yes, the Premier has previously committed to keeping Ontario Place public, but she also promised the same about Hydro One. So as Hydro One is being auctioned off, it begs the question of why anyone should believe the Liberal government when it says it will keep Ontario Place public, especially when the government is bringing forward new legislation buried in this omnibus Burden Reduction Act which would allow them to sell it off. The precedent of broken promises around privatization has been set by the government sell-off of Hydro One. Here we see the government changing the laws to allow them to privatize Ontario Place.", "I would like to hear some justification for this from the Liberals, besides the same tired talking points about how excited they are to revitalize Ontario Place. The people of Ontario deserve straight answers about whether the government intends to continue disposing of public assets to pay for its years of waste and mismanagement. If they legitimately don’t intend to do that, I’m not sure why they have included the ability to more easily dispose of Ontario Place assets in this bill.", "I would also like to speak for a moment to schedule 2 of the bill, which retains the industrial exception in the Professional Engineers Act. The industrial exception allows unlicensed people to practice engineering if the work is done on their employer’s machinery or equipment.", "I take issue with this provision for two reasons, the first of which is that the government has not been open with the engineers before bringing this forward. The associations who represent engineers in this province, who are the experts in this field, quite reasonably expected they would be invited to the table to discuss this move by the government. But this latest step came out of left field for them. This government announced the repeal of the industrial exception in January of 2013, only to backtrack a few months later. Since then, it was radio silence from the Liberal government, leaving industry and engineers to guess at what erratic move might be next—which is an unfortunate hallmark of the government, creating uncertainty and volatility for Ontario’s businesses.", "My second issue with this is that this provision of the bill is retaining the industrial exception, not introducing it, so it’s misleading for the government to claim that this is a move that means money will be saved. It’s like announcing you won’t introduce a new tax on kitchen tables, and claiming you’ve saved people money. The amount the government is claiming they’re saving through this measure is significant. They’re putting it at between $118 million to $196 million in cost-avoidance. So when the minister stands up and claims this Burden Reduction Act is going to save millions of dollars, it’s mostly based on this malarkey about the industrial exception. This is smoke-and-mirrors economics and ultimately, a PR exercise.", "The government needs to get serious about creating better economic conditions in our province, instead of focusing on trying to make themselves look good. As we continue down this path of being preoccupied with tinkering and taking a piecemeal approach to policy in this province, our economy is falling further behind. We are disadvantaged because of disjointed policies, which is what happens when the government has no cohesive plan to pursue prosperity and sustainability. This bill, which chips away haphazardly at the province’s massive red tape burden, is just another example of this.", "As I approach the end of my time here, I want to say that I look forward to the debate continuing on this bill. As an omnibus bill that affects over 11 ministries, there is a lot to delve into. I look forward to hearing the other members as we just begin the journey of debating this bill.", "But I want to reiterate for the Liberal government in particular, and to the people working within the ministries and to the bureaucrats who quite frankly are many times driving jobs out of the province, that we have over 380,000 regulations on the books today. The reality is, for our neighbours to the south, it appears they elected a business-friendly government. This has to be a wake-up call. We have 380,000 rules and regulations on the books. We have the most expensive energy costs in all of North America. We have a debt now that’s set to hit $318 billion. Businesses know that at some point they’re going to be the ones that are going to pay for the years and years of mismanagement by this government.", "For the life of me, I don’t understand why they’re not taking action to make Ontario the best place to do business in. We need to hang over Ontario an “Open for Business” sign, Mr. Speaker. According to the 2014 numbers, red tape is costing our economy about $15 billion per year. That’s not the signal that we want to send to the world.", "As I said, this bill sounds good. It has a catchy title, but frankly, Mr. Speaker, even though our caucus will be supporting it, it’s just window dressing. We need to take action and to go much, much further.", "In closing, I again want to just highlight the four pillars of economic development that our party is focusing on and that our leader, Patrick Brown, is focusing on. He’s touring the province talking to chambers of commerce, BIAs and other business organizations, and really focusing on four pillars.", "(1) Red tape: I’ve already covered that—380,000 regulations costing the economy about $15 billion every year.", "(2) The highest energy costs in all of North America: We need to stop the sell-off of Hydro One. We need to stop signing contracts for energy that we don’t need.", "(3) We need to build that infrastructure. The best example of infrastructure not being built in the province that would stimulate huge benefits for the people of the province is the Ring of Fire. We’ve heard this government make three announcements about building infrastructure, building that road to the Ring of Fire, and it’s not happening. Three times—they love photo ops, but the reality is that the Ring of Fire is not being developed as we speak.", "(4) Lastly—and I’m really happy our leader is focused on this because it’s something that we all hear from the private sector and from the business community in Ontario—there is a skills mismatch in the province. There are employers across Ontario today who can’t find people to fill jobs. Our leader, Patrick Brown, has highlighted many times that in Ontario today we’re graduating kids and students for jobs that don’t exist today and tomorrow.", "We’re going to continue to advocate to create better economic conditions in the province. This government has to wake up to the fact that every single day we have businesses calling us, telling us that they’re barely hanging on. In fact, a lot of businesses can’t even hold on until the next election—", "Interjections." ],

It never closed its doors, and it continues to see a number of businesses sprouting up here in Ontario, coming to Ontario because of the conditions that we have created. But we know that there is more to do. I’m very glad, when I sit across on this side of the House, to hear the member from Lambton–Kent–Middlesex say that both he and his leader are in agreement with what we are doing here in terms of trying to reduce and cut red tape that businesses often have to encounter when trying to do business here in Ontario.", "Reducing regulatory burden is part of the government’s economic plan known as the Business Growth Initiative: to build Ontario up and deliver on its number one priority, to grow the economy and create jobs.

So he comes from the ground. He understands what’s happening out there in small-town and big-town Ontario. Business is business is business and, really, the reality that we hear not only in his riding but in my great riding of Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound is certainly about the burden of red tape: the 370,000 regulations that we have out there, and when they keep adding to them, it’s burying particularly those really small businesses, where they are everything in the business. They’re the procurer, they’re the developer, they’re the salesperson, they’re the bookkeeper, and yet this government continues to ask for more and more paperwork which takes more time away from the front line, from the customer.", "He referenced the energy costs, the highest in North America. I hear this every single day of the week—whether it’s from business people, large or small, whether it’s from single-parent families, whether it’s from seniors on fixed incomes, every day the concern is there. The hospital: Grey Bruce Health Services shared with me that their hydro costs have gone up 40%. And with fixed budgets, that means they are actually either going to lay off staff or they’re going to cut services at the front line, and we already know how many nurses have lost jobs. So it’s very challenging.", "What we hear out here all the time is that there’s more consultants being hired. Just this morning questions were asked about David Herle and the Gandalf poll.

When the number of the 370,000 regulations that exist is touted, let’s recognize that they’re there for a reason. Let’s recognize that a whole host of stakeholders have at one point or another had their say on these, and also that they’ve been brought in by successive governments.

He can’t warehouse his wine, if you can imagine that. If he gets a request for a skid of his wine up in North Bay, he can’t store any off-site in Toronto to be able to lessen his transportation costs.

It opens the door to something that the Premier said she was never going to do. It is found in schedule 16, under “Ministry of Tourism, Culture and Sport.” It’s controversial, Speaker. It opens up Ontario Place’s corporation lands to “development”—privatization––“acquisition, construction, operation, maintenance, and management powers.” Under the schedule, Ontario Place Corp. will be given “the power to acquire and dispose of land or any interest in land, subject to the Lieutenant Governor in Council’s approval.”", "In February 2012, the Ontario government shut down Ontario Place.

Anybody remember Boblo Island? My goodness, it was the heyday of southwestern Ontario, where our economic engine was booming. Boblo Island sits in the middle of the Detroit River, between Windsor—well, effectively between Amherstburg and Detroit. For years and years, that was an amusement park. It was unbelievable.

It was remarkable, a really important part of our history in Essex county.", "For whatever reason—obviously, economic conditions and so on and so forth—Boblo Island shut down.

These are folks who go about their business every day in our communities unknown. They’re not heralded as the grand speakers. They’re not feted like we are as politicians. When we do something good, we make sure everybody knows. We put out press releases; we take pictures; we cut ribbons. We want all the credit, unfortunately. That’s the name of the game when it comes to politics. But for professional engineers, they go about their day-to-day business ensuring that we are living in a society that is safe, efficient, effective and competitive. It’s through their knowledge and their expertise that they bring into every aspect of our society—we are better off because of their expertise.", "If you look at a list of professions in Ontario or anywhere in the world for that matter, politicians, in terms of how well they are revered, might be at the bottom, I would imagine. Lawyers, politicians—engineers are way up there. The Liberal government may want to commission another poll to find out whether people like them. I don’t know how much they’ll spend on it, but I can save them the money. People don’t like politicians. If you haven’t gotten it yet, they don’t like you. They’re not revered, especially this government because of the tenure that you’ve had and the disaster that you’ve created. I’ll save the government some money on that one.", "Engineers do us a good service; they do us a good public service, and we definitely need to support them and give them the tools to be able to do their job. But buried in the context of this omnibus bill here is a schedule that will continue the industrial exception when it comes to professional engineers in Ontario, and they are dismayed. What that means is that professional engineers will not be required to do their job on machinery that a company owns or an industry owns, and unlicensed people will be able to carry out what typically and should be engineering work on machinery and equipment in manufacturing.", "Now at one point in time, in 2013, this government understood that they should fall in line with all the other provinces in Ontario and remove that industrial exception. Why? Because it’s good public policy, quite frankly. This is not a partisan thing; this is a matter of good public policy. I think time will tell and history will tell that the government and now the Conservative Party are on the wrong side of this issue because first and foremost, aside and above our partisan roles in here, we have to ensure that we are enabling good public policy and not blocking it.", "So Professional Engineers Ontario, upon understanding that the government was going to backtrack on their promise to remove the industrial exception, issued this media release. I’ll read it into the record in its entirety:", "“June 9, 2016—Professional Engineers Ontario (PEO), the body that licenses and regulates professional engineering in Ontario to protect the public interest, is extremely disappointed with the government’s decision, first announced last fall and confirmed with the introduction yesterday of the Burden Reduction Act, 2016, to halt proclamation of the repeal of section 12(3)(a) of the Professional Engineers Act, often referred to as the industrial exception. The industrial exception allows unlicensed people to carry out engineering work on machinery or equipment in manufacturing.", "“‘It’s interesting that the government also had third reading yesterday of An Act to proclaim a Workers Day of Mourning. We simply cannot understand why, under such circumstances, the government would not honour its commitment to the repeal, which would improve worker safety, improve profitability of Ontario manufacturers, bring Ontario in line with other provinces, and ensure work requiring specialized design and problem-solving knowledge is done by professionals with obligations to the public interest—in the guise of reducing red tape,’ PEO president George Comrie ... said.", "“‘The government has described red tape as regulatory requirements that are ‘unclear, outdated or costly’ and do not protect public interests or safety. The repeal of the industrial exception simply does not fit this definition.’” And I wholeheartedly agree.", "“In fact, the repeal:", "“—would eliminate confusion about engineering activities that have always required a professional engineer and would standardize Ontario with the rest of the provinces;", "“—is not outdated or redundant, as the currently required Pre-start Health and Safety Reviews under the Occupational Health and Safety Act occur after the design process is completed and serious potential equipment design issues may no longer be evident; and", "“—is not a costly requirement, as there are potential cost savings to businesses from reducing worker injuries and competitive advantage through innovative design solutions to production problems. PEO estimates that the impact to industry of proclaiming the repeal would be only $1 million to $1.9 million, whereas the value of one life saved is immeasurable”—undoubtedly.", "“‘The repeal would have been implemented without any expense to taxpayers and little cost to employers, since PEO had committed to offsetting almost half of the licensing fee of anyone required to be newly licensed as a result of the repeal,’ Comrie said.” They were already going to work with you. They were already putting into place provisions to work with you and to make it cost-effective. “‘PEO had also put in place a regulation to enable employers to transition over a one-year period.’”", "Speaker, I would imagine that that transition period could have been extended as well. Maybe if the industry needed more than one year—these folks are practical. They are good-public-policy-oriented. They are easy to work with, but they need a willing partner on the other side.", "Many of you spoke with them. You’ve attended events. You know that this is important. You know that this is good public policy, so to watch your government slide this in here under the guise of reducing red tape and burden is wrong, Speaker.", "The letter goes on to say, “‘The Ontario government’s troubling decision to reverse its previous commitment to repeal section 12(3)(a) of the PEA leaves a gap in PEO’s ability to regulate acts of engineering and continues to put workers at risk,’ said PEO Registrar Gerard McDonald, P.Eng. ‘Engineers are committed to public safety and are professionally accountable by law for all acts of professional engineering. Not requiring engineers to carry out work in this narrow area is not a red tape reduction. It is a significant missed opportunity to protect the public.’” I can’t argue with that.", "“PEO is committed to working with governments and industry to achieve a stable and prosperous economic future for Ontario, which it continues to believe would be enhanced through the repeal of section 12(3)(a) of the Professional Engineers Act.”", "Speaker, a little bit about Professional Engineers Ontario: “Under the authority of the Professional Engineers Act, PEO governs ... 85,000 licence and certificate holders and regulates professional engineering in Ontario. PEO’s mission is to regulate and advance the practice of engineering to protect the public interest. Its vision is to be the trusted leader in professional self-regulation. Professional engineering safeguards life, health, property, economic interests, the public welfare and the environment. Professional engineers can be identified by the P.Eng. after their names. Holders of limited licences can be identified by LEL or LET after their names.”", "There you have it. I couldn’t say it any clearer than Professional Engineers Ontario did. This is a matter of public policy, of public safety. If you’re saying it’s a matter of burden reduction, we don’t understand how it could be that a workplace injury, a lost-time injury or a workplace fatality which will result by the lack of oversight that professional engineers provide gives any advantage to industrial manufacturers in the province. You shut down the entire facility after somebody gets hurt and you review the processes. Sometimes it’ll cost you—well, what’s the price that you can put on someone’s life, as was stated here in the media release?", "That, just again, goes to show you how this government, at one point in time, can see the light, can make those commitments to professional engineers, can say all the right things and make all the right moves but yet buckle at the first hint of any potential effect on their support levels. They’re playing politics here, Speaker. This isn’t about good public policy; this is about politics.", "On that basis alone, I would say that New Democrats would—" ],

It’s nowhere to be found. There’s nothing in here that alludes to any remedy or any reduction in cost for ratepayers in our province. Speaker, again, the focus of the bill was to support businesses and to support our competitiveness by reducing red tape. They had a Red Tape Commission. They asked people to go on the website and submit their ideas about how to reduce regulations in the province, and I would assume they received thousands of submissions. There aren’t thousands in here, and the ones that are in here are, frankly, inconsequential. I’ll tell you why: because the amendments in these schedules really bring us in line with international trade agreements. These are things that modernize and harmonize regulations that already exist and that we have to become compliant with. This isn’t anything novel that the government has come up with on their own; they’re things that have been identified through trade agreements that require them to take action on. So they bundle it up, they package it up and say, “Look at how great we are doing when it comes to burden reduction.”", "That doesn’t help people in our riding, Speaker.

We walked in there a couple of days ago—our leader, Andrea Horwath, and my colleagues from Windsor–Tecumseh and Windsor West—and we met with some dairy farmers at Gabe’s Arner Stop. Some of the locals are in there. It’s a little restaurant. It’s your quintessential greasy spoon. It’s pure Canadiana. It’s where you want to go to learn about your community and to chat with your fellow community members. If you ever, as a politician, want to know how you’re doing, or if you want to save money on commissioning a poll, go to your local Arner Stop. Find the greasy spoon in your community, sit down and have a good cup of coffee—because that’s where you’re going to find the best cup of coffee." ],

They can know what’s going on in their operations through their phones, these days. This is high-tech agriculture. They have changed the motors so that they’re low-voltage and low-draw motors—to a huge expense. They’ve changed the lighting. They’ve changed the fans. They’ve put new roofs on. They have everything that they can do. Many of them, also, are part of green energy and renewable energy projects as well, so they’ve got geothermal on their farms. And they’re having a hard time making ends meet.", "Now, here’s the thing, and particularly dairy farmers, because they’re regulated—in other industries, that cost would be passed on to the consumer. Dairy farmers don’t have that ability, Speaker, to pass on that cost, so these guys—these men and women and families—are carrying that burden of the skyrocketing costs of hydro on farms. Here’s the hazard and here’s the cautionary tale: Once you lose your ability to produce your own food as a nation, you are absolutely vulnerable; the sovereignty of your nation is vulnerable. So what we’re doing is, we’re creating the economic conditions, or disincentive, to even get into farming, let alone sustain a farm, and once we start to see those dominoes fall—because again, these guys are at the margin in their operations—you’re going to lose the ability to produce your own food. You’re going to have to rely on imports coming from other areas that have already cut their regulations, that have slashed and burned or never had any regulations to begin with, and you’re going to get products that may be substandard. I don’t want to point out any specific areas or jurisdictions—I’ll just say, maybe China. Do you want to get your food from China when you lose your ability to get it from Ontario? No, I don’t think so.", "When speaking with Bernard Nelson and Mark Stannard and Gabe Saad, they want to know what this government is going to do for them. They want to see, if you’re going to put an omnibus budget in there, that there’s something in there for them. We don’t see it. In fact, what we see is a continuation of the plan to privatize our largest public asset, which is Hydro One. What’s the rationale for that? We’ve been told that they need to find funds, that the government requires funds to pay for infrastructure. This will be the first government in the history of Ontario that has to burn the furniture to heat the house and sell off Hydro One.", "Now, when that 60% share is turned over fully to private industry, Speaker, do you think that their incentive will be to provide the lowest rate for consumers? Do you think that their incentive will be to ensure that consumers are using less power? I don’t think so. That’s not a business model that will keep them in business very long. What we think and what we know from experience is that privatized power is more expensive. You will see an unregulated power regime as was brought in, in the late 1990s and the early part of the millennium, by Mike Harris. Rates skyrocketed and the uncertainty of an unregulated system sent the economy into chaos. That’s why it was backpedalled so quickly, because we saw the effects quite immediately. This is the road that we’re going down, and if you don’t want to believe me, Speaker, if you don’t want to take it from me, take it from the Association of Major Power Consumers in Ontario. These are the big dogs, Speaker. These are the ones that eat up the majority of the power or consume the majority of the power in the province. They’ve got some great facts and figures. I would encourage any member who has a chance to sit down with them.", "They represent some of the largest corporations in our province. I’m going to just try to find the list—here we are. Some of their members are Air Liquide, Air Products Canada, Dofasco, Atlas Tube, Nova Chemicals, Sudbury Integrated Nickel Operations, General Motors, Goodyear, Hamilton Specialty Bar and Invista. They’re got lots of major power consumers, Speaker, that are telling this government quite clearly that they can’t afford to stay here. They will not be able to afford to keep up their operations in the province.", "Do they see any remedy in this omnibus bill? Do they see any burden reduction in this bill? No, not where it counts, most definitely. Will this bill keep them in business? It’s highly unlikely that any of the efforts out of this massive omnibus bill will keep them in business.", "And in the future for these companies, they say the forward curve is daunting. There’s a 69% increase over five years being sought by OPG, and 11% to 14% increases in hydro rates being sought by Hydro One. The Toronto Hydro distribution rate increase has been 43% over the last five years, and of course they have questions around cap-and-trade and its impacts.", "So what do they say? Their outlook is that in terms of operations, post 2020 is a significant question mark. We’ve got three years to figure this out, essentially, three years to bring our energy system in line with other jurisdictions that are more competitive, like Quebec and Manitoba.", "Now, we could argue ad nauseam about why Manitoba is more cost effective or why Quebec is. Quebec certainly has more run-of-the-river hydro capacity and generation, but the common denominator there is that they’re both public utilities, publicly owned, publicly run for the benefit of the public in good public interest. You’re not letting the privateers, the vulture capitalists, come in and eat up an enormously valuable public asset. They use it as a strategic asset to incentivize economic development.", "Why can’t we do that here? How many energy ministers have we had, and no one can figure it out? It’s an indication of failure. Our current energy minister might be preoccupied with pending charges that are about to come as a result of the Sudbury by-election. However, we would hope that this focus would be on lessening the burden for businesses in the province that are sounding the alarm and saying, “We need help here.”", "Speaker, in the last 12 minutes that I have here—I know everyone’s been just totally engaged in my speech here and I hope that they’re absorbing all the wonderful information. I want to get back to the two bugaboos that we have—Hansard will have fun with that word—the two no-go zones, the two areas that really prohibit the Ontario New Democratic caucus from supporting this bill.", "One is that they’re going to sell off Ontario Place, the public lands that have been a fixture of—", "Interjection." ],

For some time, there was a real penchant for off-shoring to China for manufactured goods. I’m sure there still is. A large amount of manufactured goods are made in China. But when it specifically came to the automotive sector—the tool, die and mould sector—a lot of the tools and moulds were being made in China. What they found, after some time, was that the quality of those products coming through was so substandard that they couldn’t use them. Not only could they not use it because of the quality of it, but it started to jeopardize the overall product, whether it be a car or anything else—aerospace. But there has been a recognition of that, and we’ve seen a massive amount of on-shoring because of that simple fact: that the quality in Ontario in manufacturing is the best. We are world leaders, and by ensuring that we have the proper oversight and bringing in professional engineers in Ontario and their expertise, we can propel our industry to heights that I think would set us alone in manufacturing and still maintain cost-effectiveness, because we know how to do that.", "The workers in those plants and the management know that they have to work together, but it takes leadership at the provincial level, through various levels of government, to understand that they can achieve that and they can work within the boundaries of good public policy. That’s gone. That won’t happen, and I cringe at the thought of any worker being harmed because of the result of this. I don’t want to be the guy who stands up and says, “We told you so.

That’s gone, and I don’t think this government has any intention of ever revisiting it. I think that because of a measure of embarrassment, they’re reluctant to pull that out into a stand-alone bill. They’ve buried it into the content of this bill so that it doesn’t receive individual oversight or criticism by us.", "We would say, pull those out—pull that clause out and pull the Ontario Place provision out of this bill—and we’ll support your burden reduction bill. The things that you have in here are not contentious. We look forward to other areas where we can see the government recognize and address burdens for small businesses like wineries, like the Arner Stop in Harrow, like all of the businesses that are begging this government to do something on the hydro file.

We’re getting close, Mr. Speaker. We’re seen now as a global best practice when it comes to reducing regulatory burden. Our Red Tape Challenge opens up the opportunity for every single Ontarian to participate in our efforts to reduce regulatory burden. We started in the auto parts sector. We’ve gone into the food processing sector. We’ve got four other sectors we’re tackling in the next couple of years.

I listened intently to the member from Essex in terms of his concerns and his support for a majority of the bill.", "I’m going to highlight a couple of themes about this particular bill. I think the member from Essex also would be supportive.", "One piece of the bill talks about harmonization, aligning child performers’ protections with industry practices. The member’s colleague from Hamilton East–Stoney Creek supported the bill. I remember that, very intently, we had a huge debate on the child actors piece. This is a very important piece of the legislation. That particular harmonization, a theme of Bill 27, will address this issue, making sure that we have harmonization, making sure to reflect industry practices, but at the same time, protecting child performers with safety.", "The other theme is with respect to streamlining the processes when it comes to the issue of police escorting—the safety of the delivery of inmates. The proposed bill, if passed, will streamline that process, meaning streamlining the delivery of “superload” permits by eliminating the requirement for police escorts but ensuring safety by allowing for qualified non-police escorts.", "Coming from my ministry, the Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services, it is absolutely very important, because we know we’re constantly hearing from various municipalities about the costs of policing, whether it’s in rural areas—I come from the city of Toronto. Policing is an expensive cost, but we cannot compromise that safety with the costs.", "I encourage everybody—I’m looking forward to more conversation about this particular bill." ],

  "text" : [ "Thanks to the member from Leeds–Grenville, the Minister of Economic Development and Growth, the member for Oshawa, and the member for Scarborough–Agincourt.", "Essentially, there are amendments that are fulfilling an already-existing obligation under international law and agreements that Canadian commercial trade is subject to. That’s what they’re doing. The majority of the bill is that, or a transference of power to a proxy from the LG in Council. Housekeeping is what we’re talking about, with the exception of the industrial exception and Ontario Place. If they are so inclined, people need to look into those provisions of the bill. Again, they’re not contentious—to reduce any burden or regulation that doesn’t affect public safety, that doesn’t affect the environment, that doesn’t affect the economics of other businesses. Those aren’t contentious for New Democrats. We think we should always be reviewing those and addressing them as often as we can. That makes sense to me.", "But to set the stage for another massive exercise in privatization through a bill that should be about burden reduction and reviewing regulation is sneaky. It’s not what people expect. People expect the government to actually be clear about their purpose and their intentions, not to try to sneak something in. To take that position with the engineers of the province, who provide a real public good and a public service, is again, I think, underhanded, and something that I hope people in this province recognize when it comes to the priorities of this government.", "Thank you, Speaker." ],

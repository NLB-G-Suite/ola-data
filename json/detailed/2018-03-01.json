  "text" : [ "I rise today on behalf of the amazing people in my riding of Huron–Bruce, the PC Party of Ontario, and all Ontarians who, from one corner of the province to another, expect democracy to be carried out in this House.", "I have to ask: Why is the government of the day, under the leadership of Kathleen Wynne, afraid of debate, afraid of consultation, afraid of deputations? This is totally unfair. They are running around this province under the cloak of pretending to be fair. Well, let me tell the people watching this debate this morning: Everything this government is doing is unfair. Again, they are shutting down debate, they are shutting down consultation, and they even want to skip committee, for goodness’ sake. They are cutting down opportunities for people to come in and have deputations, to share exactly how Bill 194, under their watch, is completely unfair. Actually, this government is shameful, and I’m going to tell you why, Speaker, in the next few minutes.", "So, again, I am pleased to rise today on behalf of the riding of Huron–Bruce, the PC Party of Ontario, and as a member of Her Majesty’s loyal opposition. But I’m not pleased, though, to have to speak to a motion from this Liberal government that is intended to completely shut down debate on a bill that is far from complete. Something that I could stand before you today and say is that I will not be supporting it in its current form. And I have complete support from the PC caucus in this regard.", "Speaker, we have seen this government play some terrible tricks in its time in office, but with this last one they may have saved their best trick for last. From time to time, we see time allocation motions, which the government uses to speed up the process, in their eyes. But from the perspective of Her Majesty’s loyal opposition, we see what they’re doing: the use of time allocation as a tool to shut down debate and ultimately shut down democracy. Is this the Ontario we have to be stuck with? I think not, Speaker.", "Furthermore, this government of the day—this old, out-of-touch, out-of-ideas, tired government—has taken it a step further. Instead of limiting the amount of debate that this bill will have in the House and at committee, the government, in its infinite wisdom, has decided that the legislative process doesn’t matter. But we’re used to that. Ontarians are tired of it, and this government is going to learn its lesson on June 7.", "With regard to Bill 194, I will quote the Premier from her minister’s statement just this past week. She said, “I am encouraging all members of this House to put games aside, come together and support the people of Ontario by passing the Fairness in Procurement Act.” Well, you know, time flies. Only a week has gone by, and yet again the Premier’s words ring hollow. It’s like: “Don’t listen to what I’m saying. Don’t watch what I’m doing. Come on; everything we’re doing is fair.” Speaker, that is so not true.", "In light of the Premier’s statement from last week, her government’s actions this morning can only be described by words that unfortunately you would probably remove me from the House for using. But because this is the most egregious time allocation motion that I have seen in my time at Queen’s Park—this motion frankly cuts out whole portions of the legislative process—I’m going to talk about it. People in Ontario need to know how “done” this government is. For instance, this motion cuts out the whole committee stage of the democratic process in the passing of legislation. Why would a government choose—and again, I repeat, the government is choosing not to hear from stakeholders. Speaker, that’s not the type of Ontario you or I can be proud of. That’s not the type of government that you and I were elected to uphold here in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario.", "So I have to ask: What is the Liberal government under the leadership of Kathleen Wynne afraid to hear at committee? What is it that a stakeholder might say that has this government so scared? To quote the member from Eglinton–Lawrence, “We know now why they like these closure motions. Because they don’t want the public to know what they’re doing.” Yes, that’s true. He spoke these words, though, in 2002, and they ring true today as we debate this time allocation motion.", "Today we can expect a tired, out-of-touch government to make a lot of excuses. Speaker, I expect them to reiterate the Premier’s accusation that our reasoned amendment last week was a stall tactic, but honestly, we had not been briefed and we had not been given time to ask our questions. There is a very good reason why that reasoned amendment came to the House. I have to tell the people watching today that this tired, old government will try to spin what’s happening right now into some sort of justification of their complete disregard for a legislative process. But nothing could be further from the truth.", "Allow me to lay the facts out on the table, because I feel this story is worth repeating. This bill went to cabinet in early April. That’s almost 11 months ago. The government did not reach out to my office once to discuss their bill. They did not indicate that they wanted to work with the opposition at all. Not once in the 11 months since they took this bill to cabinet last spring in 2017 did they come forward to want to work with opposition.", "Next, the government indicated, on February 6, that they would be tabling the bill two weeks later. I immediately told my office to reach out for a briefing or for an embargoed draft copy of the bill that, in some cases, happens. We did not receive either in a timely manner. We received our draft copy of the bill on February 20, moments before the bill was tabled. Our briefing was received the morning of the scheduled leadoffs.", "Again, this is a government that is acting absolutely unfairly. They had no regard for process. Ultimately, that can be translated into the fact that they have no regard for Ontarians. Again, the Premier, in the government press release on February 6, said—and she clearly stated—that she wanted to work with all parties to pass this legislation. I said during my leadoff that the very fact that they would not allow us to do our due diligence on this bill indicates their unwillingness to include us in the discussion at all. Guess what? The government has now decided to limit debate and just eliminate all committee hearings on this bill.", "Again, I ask this tired, old government: What are they afraid of? When exactly was the government intending to work with us, Ontarian stakeholders and ultimately put the thoughts and the priority on Ontarians, like they should? As I said on Monday, through their actions, we have seen no willingness on the government’s part to co-operate with anyone. We, unfortunately, have seen their true colours. They don’t want to work with opposition, the third party or stakeholders. They don’t care about the dismal fiscal realities they have driven this province into. This “my way or the highway” approach is exactly what gets government into trouble.", "Now, originally, I thought that this bill was something that we essentially just see from embattled politicians seeking an outside enemy. But now that they have shut down debate and all consultation entirely, their behaviour is more akin to what we see from autocrats. This government pays lip service to co-operation and consultation, but when it becomes inconvenient, again, they choose to ignore it.", "I would like to remind this Premier, her entire cabinet and all of her elected colleagues that her government is off the rails. I would like to remind this Premier and her government that they are not all-knowing. In fact, if they were willing to listen, I’m sure that they would realize that there are things that they could fix within this bill, but they don’t want to work with opposition. Again, it’s their way or the highway. Unfortunately, who gets hurt by this unfair practice? Ontarians: our future generations, our taxpayers. The fact that we have heard very valid questions about this bill is reason enough to continue debate, actually come forward and be brave enough to bring Bill 194 into committee. There are so many valid questions that have yet to be answered.", "Going back to our reasoned amendment, we asked: Why? Why is this legislation needed? What prevents the government in their authority, their self-assumed and self-absorbed authority to procure goods and services, from directing government entities and broader public sector entities to select bidders that reflect preferences on trade? We’re still awaiting a satisfactory answer on that. If this motion goes through, we will not have a chance to hear that answer because the government will not allow this bill to proceed to committee.", "Again, I would like to remind all of them of the fact that the Auditor General’s report from 2017 revealed that Infrastructure Ontario was not even tracking how many vendors bid on capital projects and which vendors were actually winning the bids. Can you believe it? In fact, Infrastructure Ontario “allowed its external project managers to select vendors from its vendor-of-record list” but “manually add them to the list of bidders,” and 321 projects worth $49 million were selected this way. Its managers can hand-pick vendors, so why can’t the government just tell these very same managers to exclude New York-based vendors when they do their hand-picking next time? Again, Speaker, they can hand-pick vendors, so why can’t the government tell these managers to exclude New-York-based vendors when they continue to do their hand-picking next time?", "It’s actually very shameful, the manner in which this government is acting. We still do not know why this requires legislation.", "Beyond the fact that we already know that this government is allowed to hand-pick bidders, let’s take a look at what is happening today.", "Ongoing NAFTA negotiations could soon render this whole debate moot. Chapter 10 of NAFTA directly references subnational procurement. Why this government felt it even had to table Bill 194 leaves a lot of people questioning their tactics. Although the subnational provisions in NAFTA were never finalized or agreed to, the potential remains, especially as many chapters in the agreement are currently on the table. Even more recently than NAFTA, the Obama administration and the Harper government also reached an agreement on subnational procurement, on a smaller scale. This is why we are party to the World Trade Organization Agreement on Government Procurement.", "I ask, Speaker: Why debate this whole issue when those negotiations are ongoing? Have we not seen the rhetoric coming from the United States? Quite simply, we are being provocative and risking further retaliation for the sake of this Premier’s and this government’s desire to score political points.", "This debate could have waited until after the NAFTA talks, but the problem was that the timeline wouldn’t be convenient because it would take the government past the upcoming election on June 7. Again, international objectives are being overridden by Ontario electioneering by Premier Kathleen Wynne and the Liberal Party.", "I ask: Why would we ever risk escalation when much of the bigger conversation is happening under our federal counterparts?", "Not only is this legislation not what we need; it is legislation that is, in fact, opening Ontario up to unnecessary risks. We know what happened when this government of the day tried to encourage manufacturing of industrial wind turbine parts in Ontario. Where did we end up on that side of the legal case? On the wrong side.", "I might also add that a compounding risk that could happen right now is the haphazard way the government chose to write this bill. For example, what is, for goodness’ sake, “proportional response” from the government? Do they even know? How is this defined? Is “proportional” defined as not exceeding the damage of an offending jurisdiction in terms of what it does to Ontario? Perhaps it means that the measure with which we retaliate must do at least enough damage to the offending jurisdiction.", "They haven’t defined their own definitions; they don’t have a clue what they want to do within this legislation. Instead, they want to put up this blatant electioneering and decide how to clean up their mess behind closed doors, via regulations. That’s not the type of Ontario that taxpayers and our future generations deserve.", "Going back to the “proportional” aspect, this lack of a definition means that we could be opening up the province to massive escalations with American jurisdictions like those we’ve seen as a result of the Green Energy Act, escalations that will cost our economy jobs. For instance, that one company in Tillsonburg: There was a lot of hoopla when they were creating jobs in Tillsonburg building parts and pieces for industrial wind turbines, but when that closed down, so did 300-plus jobs in the Tillsonburg area.", "Let’s carry on here with regard to Bill 194. The President of the Treasury Board, responding to the member from Parry Sound–Muskoka, told us the following:", "“While members opposite have referenced issues like escalation—the member from Parry Sound–Muskoka, who talked about how we need to apply caution.” Guess what was said, Speaker. “We agree.” But she went on to say, “This is not about escalation, for that very reason. This is about a proportional response, Speaker. It’s important that we keep these things in mind.”", "I have to ask, Speaker: Really? When that member was speaking, did they know the true definition of a proportional response? I’m doubting it.", "To carry on: Has the President of the Treasury Board even read her own bill? It’s only a couple of pages.", "Do you know what’s sad? It wasn’t even properly translated into French. It’s a shame. This government is out of touch. Their knee-jerk reactions to try to garner favour with the Ontario voter, when they’re doing so dismally in the polls, are causing them to rush legislation, and as a result, they’re getting it wrong on so many different levels. As I said, they couldn’t even get the French translation right for Bill 194.", "Going back to the President of the Treasury Board: If the minister agreed with regard to a proportional response, then there should have been a reference to proportionality in the bill. We should see a threshold.", "How can we know that this bill would not lead to escalation when there are no checks and balances in the bill? Speaker, there are none.", "This government has flailed around for 15 years. Time and again they have absolutely thrown Ontario taxpayers, and all of us, quite frankly, under the bus. And here we go again.", "Speaker, I was planning on bringing forward an amendment to alleviate this concern in committee, but unfortunately I will be unable to do this very action because of this government’s cynical behaviour that is hitting home here right now, this morning. It’s too bad, because if the President of the Treasury Board agreed with the concerns of the member from Parry Sound–Muskoka, perhaps her colleagues could have entertained such an amendment. Unfortunately, if they get this motion through, they are taking away that opportunity in committee.", "Again, for those of you watching today, this tired, out-of-touch government, under the leadership of Kathleen Wynne, is trying to shut down Bill 194 with regard to debate, deputations in committee, and consultation with stakeholders.", "This government’s time has come and gone. June 7 can’t come soon enough for Ontarians across this province.", "Again, Speaker, the problem is that the government did not, at the end of the day, table a viable piece of legislation. Like we’ve been saying all along, this is just a last-ditch attempt to get votes. If they truly cared about Ontario jobs, we would have seen this government take action long ago. They would have seen proper legislation come through their tables and through their doors, and we would have actually seen a government caring about Ontarians. But all they care about is themselves.", "As a result, Ontario has bled manufacturing to other jurisdictions. As I mentioned in my leadoff just last week, a manufacturer from my amazing riding of Huron–Bruce—specifically, in the Walkerton area—forwarded an email to me whereby the state of Vermont was telling them that when they want to grow, when they want to expand, the best place to do that is not Ontario; it’s Vermont. That’s what our manufacturers are facing day in and day out.", "Continuing on with regard to Bill 194 and with the lack of proportionality in this bill, Speaker, there’s something that I would like to remind everyone of: Trading with other jurisdictions actually saves our government money. Every time the government responds in kind to an American jurisdiction, it represents a contract that Ontario is overpaying for.", "And coming from the government that brought us eHealth, Ornge and the gas plant scandal—Ontarians would prefer it if, once and for all, the government did not overpay on a contract. Ontarians have been paying more and getting less in this province for far too long over the last 15 years, Speaker. Every single measure that this government brings into force makes us pay more for less time and time again.", "This bill mandates no third-party oversight to report on the additional costs of protectionist procurement regulations enacted under this law. That’s a worry. Do we still have to continue to pay more and more under this tired, old government? Financial transparency could have allowed Ontarians and stakeholders to weigh the benefits and costs of the action that the government would be taking under the authority of this bill. Without a reporting requirement like this, Ontarians could be in for a financial surprise. With this government, we know what these surprises could entail.", "Moving on, there’s a deplorable irony to Bill 194. The very purpose of a committee is to consult. Had Bill 194 actually made it to committee, we would have seen deputations from stakeholders and we would have seen their submissions. They all want to speak on this bill. We have the mechanisms for the public to have their say, but this government is taking it away from them. How fair is that? This government is anything but fair.", "Then, we’ve lost our opportunity to bring forward amendments in committee. This is a very important lesson for the Liberals. The amendments that we would have brought forward would have allowed us a chance to improve their bill, which has been hastily rushed and tabled and, as we saw today, pushed through our Legislature just so that they can electioneer on, yet again, another bad idea. But, Speaker, I have to tell you, if this bill does not go to committee, it will not be amended. As we know, they didn’t even get the French translation right. This is a story you can’t make up.", "Honestly, like I said on Monday, the lack of consultation has been an absolute trademark of the Wynne Liberal government, and the lack of transparency is very concerning.", "Again, if we look at this bill, consultation is only an option. They actually wrote into Bill 194 that consultation is an option. Ontarians: Be very nervous about this, because they’re taking every voice that we have in this province away. They’re shutting down consultation and they’re shutting down committee.", "I want to go back to the bill and tell you exactly what it reads: “Before a regulation is made under this act, the minister may consult, in the manner that the minister considers appropriate, with any persons ... the minister considers appropriate given the content of the proposed regulation.” What the heck is that? It’s a blatant punch in the gut to Ontarians.", "This government is tired. It’s out of touch. Nothing proves it more than the fact that they’re shutting down consultation and Ontarians’ voices through consultation. No Ontarian should stand for that. I hope they send them a message loud and clear on June 7.", "Considering that the government is not even willing to consult with stakeholders at committee or to consult even with the opposition members of this Legislature, this action is completely indicative of how this government thinks. Their thought process is that they don’t need to consult on a bill that doesn’t require them to consult before they make regulations. They believe the public should trust them. Again, trusting them: What did that get us? It got us Ornge; it got us eHealth; it got us the dismal Green Energy Act; it got us the gas plants. We just don’t trust them anymore. That’s why we think that it’s a travesty that they’re shutting down debate and they’re shutting down consultation. Essentially, they’re shutting Ontarians out of their government.", "They believe that the public should just trust them, and we’re not going to do it. After 15 years, we’ve had enough. The public does not trust this government on hydro. The public does not trust this government on jobs. The public does not trust this government on education. The public does not trust this government on health care. And the public does not trust this government on ethics." ],

It reads: “The Lieutenant Governor in Council may make regulations designating an American jurisdiction as an offending American jurisdiction if, in the minister’s opinion, the government of the American jurisdiction has enacted legislation or ... measures that may inhibit or prevent Ontario suppliers from participating or succeeding in procurement processes....” The definition that reads “may inhibit or prevent Ontario suppliers from participating” is very vague.", "Instead of heckling and just doing what a tired, old government does, I encourage the members to actually read this bill because, in fact, I’ve read a comprehensive list of those measures in the House during my leadoff. I talked and shared over 50 examples from over 50 states in the United States of America that talked to procurement. I invite them to go back and check the lead-off, because I doubt that many have.

They did not take time to define proportionality. This is a huge concern, and another reason why old, tired, knee-jerk Liberal legislation needs to have scrutiny. We should have the right to debate it in the House. We should have the right to take it to committee, and for goodness’ sake, Ontarian stakeholders and Ontarians who are concerned about trade should have every right to exercise their voices via deputations in committee.", "What they are actually proposing in Bill 194 could put our trading relationships at risk, our trading relationships with Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, North Dakota, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming. How can we possibly give the government the unilateral authority to penalize all of these jurisdictions without any defined checks and balances?", "Did you hear that across the House? In this legislation—because I doubt if you’ve read it—Bill 194 does not define any checks and balances, so you should be going back to your caucus and saying, “What the heck are we doing shutting down debate on Bill 194, and for goodness’ sake, why are we not having an opportunity to correct our own mistakes in committee?” like we’ve seen you do so many times before with regard to other bills. It is just stunning, Speaker, what’s happening in this province under the Liberal watch.", "Bill 194 gives the government the authority to respond in kind to measures big or small—measures as big as steel contracts and as small as flag holders; as big as meat products and as small as baseball fields. The way this legislation has been written is absolutely absurd. This government knows this unsettling fact. They know it, and that is why they are afraid to continue debate. That is why they are afraid to take it to committee. That is why this government is afraid to hear from stakeholders. They don’t want to hear the flaws of the bill and they don’t want anyone to see that they are tired, they are out of touch, they are out of ideas, and they can’t even write proper legislation. They don’t want any of those facts out there in the open.", "What’s even more troubling is that the government’s response to this fact has been complete dismissal, as we’re seeing here today. The member from Guelph told this House that the Minister of Agriculture does not find Alaska’s measures against Ontario in the agri-food sector as requiring a response. She views it as a merit to this bill that the government can pick and choose. But, Speaker, I’m telling you, that is a major flaw in the bill. Why would the government not write thresholds into the bill so that we would know what actually warrants a response?", "There has been a trend in this short debate over Bill 194 with this government, and it goes something like this. To illustrate my point, Speaker, I’d like to speak to an exchange between member from Kitchener–Conestoga—the really effective, respected member from Kitchener–Conestoga. The exchange was between him, the member from Welland and the member from Trinity–Spadina.", "The PC and NDP members brought very legitimate concerns regarding escalation from American jurisdictions and how that could do further harm to Ontario businesses.", "The member from Trinity–Spadina responded: “It doesn’t mean that we will do it, if this legislation passes; I’m just saying that this is giving us the legal tool to do so, if necessary.”", "To me, that makes sense. This bill enables the government, unfortunately, though, to sit on the fence and do nothing until they decide it’s time to arbitrarily pick a battle. And why do tired, old governments pick a battle? They do it so there’s a distraction; they do it so they can find a villain that the white knight can go up and fight against.", "But guess what, Speaker? Ontario is seeing through this act. They want a government that is acting in good judgment. They want a government acting on behalf of Ontarians, as opposed to one trying to find a way to posture as we lead into the election on June 7.", "This is cynical public policy at its worst; that’s what Bill 194 is. Right before an election, we see this government suddenly claim that it cares about Ontario businesses and workers. We don’t agree with that; we have not seen proof of that for years.", "Another trend we saw in the debate is when we saw the PC members stand, time and time again, to show that this government stood idly by while 300,000 manufacturing jobs left the province or were just shut down.", "When the member from Lambton–Kent–Middlesex joined the debate, he shared the fact that an automotive supplier in Strathroy had to shut down its plant. The fact is, 300 people from his community lost their jobs. That has a ripple effect across southwestern Ontario. This government is blind to the fact that, when it comes to the automotive industry, parts of a car pass through the border eight times before the finished product actually takes to the road. They completely don’t get that, and they are jeopardizing so much.", "Another trend that we saw is that our members spoke of rising hydro rates. If this government truly cared about manufacturing and truly cared about procurement of products, they, for goodness’ sake, would take a look at what they themselves have done. Take a look in the mirror. I encourage the Premier and the rest of her tired Liberal government to look in the mirror and actually accept the fact that it’s because of their bad policy decisions that we have lost so many jobs in Ontario. In fact, this procurement piece of legislation is anything but fair. The title, quite frankly, is a joke. If they really cared about jobs in Ontario, they would be addressing the cheaper hydro rates that are luring businesses across the border into New York.", "The member from Leeds–Grenville made an excellent point, and I’m going to quote him directly. He said, “Given what this government has done to hydro rates, you can imagine what their sales pitch is. One business gave me this comparison, so listen up over there: In Massena, New York, the all-in price for electricity is 2.5 cents per kilowatt hour.” Guess what it is in Ontario? “In Ontario, the cost is 17 cents plus HST. That’s the imbalance, Speaker, that’s costing us jobs, and this bill is not going to answer it. You know what’s going to answer it? The fix to this problem is going to come on June 7.”", "Perhaps Ontario businesses do not need this legislation; perhaps they need a government that actually, once and for all, listens to their concerns before pushing ahead with their own priorities.", "In my leadoff, I referenced energy prices and their effect on our economy. Does this bill help that at all? Not at all. In fact, we have seen the Auditor General’s value-for-money audits of this government grow thicker and thicker every year.", "Have the Liberals included in the bill a provision that mentions the public interest at all? No. Sadly, the answer is no, Speaker. This glaring omission means that whatever action this government decides to take, we will not know the cost of these measures on government entities or broader public sector entities. This means that Bill 194 could make health care more expensive. It could make post-secondary education more expensive. It could make children’s aid more expensive. And of course, it could make electricity more expensive in this province as well.", "This bill puts everything on the table. It allows the government to respond in a way that only they see fit, and in a way that is self-serving to them and them alone.", "Ironically, with this time allocation motion, they have shown again that when given an inch, they’re going to take a mile. They’re that desperate.", "I would like to read a quote from the member from St. Catharines: “Time and again, the government puts the boots to the opposition in this Legislature, as it has this afternoon with this time allocation motion—more ominous, more sinister every time.”", "I wonder if he’s recognizing that in his own government right now. I too have never seen a time allocation motion as ominous as the one before us this morning, one that goes as far as to bypass the whole committee process.", "In conclusion, Speaker, I think we should all recognize here today that the motion before us is very troubling, and it cannot be supported. Time allocation motions can serve a purpose at times. However, tabling a bill, answering none of our questions, ending debate, removing our ability to bring forward amendments at committee, turning a deaf ear to stakeholders and all of Ontarians, and then actually cutting third reading debate to a mere 30 minutes is a sign that this government is done. They’re done, and they need to check out on June 7.", "Every single member of this House should be concerned, if not disgusted. This bill is two to five pages long. It wasn’t even properly translated into French. How long could clause-by-clause have realistically taken?", "I will specifically say that the member from Nickel Belt astutely noticed—and I mentioned it earlier—that the French title of this bill is incorrect, and it needed to be changed. But is she going to have a chance to bring that good amendment forward? No. This government just doesn’t want to listen to anyone because they are embarrassed by this dismal legislation that they’re bringing through.", "I can recall, during Bill 172 in the last Parliament, that the government brought forward amendment after amendment after amendment because there were so many issues with the bill. They used the committee process to actually fix their mistakes. I was embarrassed for that side of the House.", "The French title is one, and my colleagues and I have identified so many others. But none of these potential amendments will ever see the light of day if this government has their way yet again—all because this government refuses to allow the legislative process to proceed. This government refuses to listen to Ontarians.", "Speaker, this week, we have seen member after member from both the Progressive Conservatives and the New Democratic Party stand up and argue against the tone and timing of this bill. It cannot be supported." ],

I know the member from St. Catharines and a few others were here when the standing orders were such that a government actually had to call a bill and have it debated. Yes, at times it took a while to get a bill through. But what would normally happen was, there was sort of an agreement between the parties about which bills they wanted to have more time on and which bills they got along on and agreed on. So some bills would go faster. You might have a couple of hours’ debate at second reading. We would refer it off to committee, and it would do what it had to do and would come back.", "Since we’ve had time allocation brought in—and I’m going to say this in the debate, because somebody’s going to say, “Oh, yeah, the NDP.” Listen, every government had their hand in changing the standing orders. In my view, it has been a mistake. I think this motion is the pinnacle of how bad a time allocation motion can be.", "We have a bill that New Democrats support. We support the general intent of what the government is trying to do here. We think there needs to be some changes. The government has a bill that we generally agree with, and I’ll get into that in a second as to why, but there’s some difficulty with the bill.", "There are probably changes that have to be made at committee on reflection and reading of the bill, and normally that’s done; it’s automatic. We refer all our bills to committee. In this case, the reason I say this is probably one of the worst time allocations I’ve seen since I’ve been here: The bill says we get a very short time at debate this afternoon, like as with this morning, as we’re doing now. By the looks of it, there are going to be 40 minutes from the official opposition and 40 minutes from the NDP. The government is not taking their time. There will be a vote and then, the next time the government decides to call the bill, there will be a total of 30 minutes. But the real kicker is that there is no time in committee. We’re going straight from second reading directly to third. I think that’s a mistake, and it’s a problem for this institution.", "Committees are where we go back and not only fix bills as far as noticing there may be some drafting errors or some policy parts that we need to fix in the bill, but it gives a chance for the public to come before us and say, “Hey, here’s what I like about this bill. Here’s what I don’t like about the bill. Here are the ideas I have about how you can make it better.” The government has decided not to do that in this case. They’ve decided to have a time allocation motion that excludes the public, that completely cuts out the committee process and refers the bill directly to third reading once the vote happens in this House. I think that is dangerous when it comes to how we draft legislation.", "I heard some of the government members on the other side a while ago say, “Oh, yes, but we have to do that because the Conservatives rang some bells yesterday.” Those are the standing orders. The standing orders of the Legislature allow the opposition some tools—not very many, I will argue—to try to keep the government to account. At times, they will ring bells. It was the first time I had seen bells rung in this place in probably a couple of years, but I think that only means that the Conservative Party had reasons why they wanted to do that. Now, I may agree or disagree with them ringing bells. In fact, we voted against the ringing of the bells when it came to the vote, but it’s their right. It’s the ability of any opposition party to be able to hold the government to account by the rules that are set out in the standing orders.", "Here’s the difficulty. When I listen to government members across the way say, “Oh, we had to do it because you guys are ringing bells,” it just shows the arrogance of the government and, I think, the lack of understanding on the part of some members—I would not say all, but some members—as to how this place should work. If you think you’re really helping Ontario by short-shrifting the committee process and moving a bill from second to third reading, I’ve got a rude awakening for you: You’re not. At the end of the day, committees serve a useful purpose in the drafting of legislation.", "When a Parliament or a Legislature decides that it’s in its best interest—in this case, the government, because they are the majority—to do those kinds of things and keep public out, it is a form of tyranny. I know that’s a strong word to be used in this Legislature. I know there may be some on the other side who are maybe a little bit upset that I would use such a term, but it is a form of tyranny in the sense that the government is utilizing its majority to not just cut out the opposition but, more importantly, cut out the public. The way this Legislature is designed, and the beauty of the legislative process, is that the public always gets its opportunity to have its say.", "These days, under the Liberal government and, before that, under the Tories, we didn’t get as much time in committee on bills that I would like. I remember, as the member from St. Catharines does, that we used to have bills that would go into committee in the spring and they’d be back in the fall because the committee work needed to be done in order to make the bill better. It’s just the process. We used to take a lot longer to draft bills and pass them through the process. It used to take a lot longer in the past, and for a good reason. It allowed the public to come and talk to us and tell us what’s good, what’s bad and how to change it. There was a real exchange between the opposition and the government. I was on the government side at one point of that process, and I was on the opposition side for the other part, and the point is, there was a real exchange. The government said, “Well, you know what? They’ve got a good point here. How do we change this? This is embarrassing for us.” We used all of the political considerations, but at the end of the day, there was a free exchange of, “Okay; how are we going to make this happen?”", "I’ve used the example—and I’m not going to go into it in any detail—but I use the sustainable forestry development act that we did or the skidoo trails legislation that the Conservatives did. When those bills went into committee, we made those bills much, much better as a result of involving the public. The opposition members, in the case of both those bills, really were a part of making those bills better. They still stand today and have not been amended. They have stood the test of time because they had the proper time to be able to do the work that had to be done, get the public involved so that we can hear all sides, and to draft regulation—not draft regulation; that’s a whole other issue—but to draft amendments to the bill that made it a lot stronger.", "I just say to the government across the way: You think that you’re being very clever and wise. You think that this will just fix one of your little political problems because you want to be able to wave something going into the next election. Heck, if you’re going to run over the public to get there and if you’re prepared to use your majority in order to squeeze out the public and the participation of this place, I don’t think that’s a good thing. I quite think that that’s actually pretty bad in all things.", "As far as the bill itself—I know I’ve got caucus members who want to speak, so I’m not going to do much longer, because I know there are a few people that want to speak, right?" ],

We have the most unstable trade situation right now, given the current administration and given the mood in the United States as to what has happened over the last number of years in their economy. Legislators and the administration have been doing things in order to protect their side of the border when it comes to economic activity, and some of it very unfairly.", "The one that jumps out is the Bombardier deal. Boeing, which is heavily subsidized by the American military—because you’ll know that in the United States, when you build an airplane, a 777 or whatever it might be, as a passenger jet, the money that allows Boeing to operate doesn’t strictly come from commercial sales. A large part of it comes from government sales, which is, in their case, the military, when it comes to building for their four armed forces, if you include the Marines. It’s sizable amounts of money.", "My point is, Boeing and other aircraft manufacturers—and there’s only really Boeing these days in the States as the big one—get subsidized quite heavily by the Americans when it comes to operating their company. If I have a branch of my company and it makes a lot of money as a result of government contracts, I can afford to build the commercial airplane for maybe a little bit less. So to make the argument that they’re not subsidizing, I think, is a bit ridiculous.", "In the case of Bombardier, Bombardier was slapped with—what was it? a 300% tariff? I think it was 300%. There was a 300% tariff put on the sale of Bombardier equipment from Canada into the United States. We did what we had to do. We went off to the various tribunals and mechanisms by which we defend ourselves in these trade situations, and guess what? There was no case by the United States to slap on a 300% tariff, and they had to take it out.", "The point is: We need to have a trade system and we need to have mechanisms in our trade system that allow those types of situations to not run away on us so that the government of a state or the government of a country, such as the United States, can’t all of a sudden decide on a whim, because they’re being lobbied by some organization, to slap a tariff, and goes on and slaps it. You need to have mechanisms to deal with it. The government, in this particular case, is saying by way of this legislation, “If there are going to be unfair practices in the United States and they unfairly treat Ontario manufacturers and service providers, then we will mirror what they’re doing on this side of the border.”", "We’re not going to lead. We’re not going to do it ourselves and say, “Well, we’re doing this and we don’t care what you’re doing.” We are saying, as I understand in this legislation, that should a state decide to do something that affects trade between our province and their state, we would mirror simply what they are doing. It’s not what you would like to do. I don’t think anybody in this House likes the idea that we have to get to this point. But I can understand why the government is doing it. They want to be able to run around going into the next election and say, “Look at what we’ve done,” and they don’t want anybody saying anything negative on this legislation, because anybody that says anything negative could take away from the shiny bauble that they will have running into the next election with this particular piece of legislation. They made a political decision in order to not have this bill going to committee, so that people are not able to come before the committee and to say what they think is wrong with the bill or what has to be changed with the bill. That’s a really disturbing part.", "The other point I just want to raise, because it gives me an opportunity to get into it, is the softwood lumber dispute. Canada and the United States entered into, first, the free trade agreement and NAFTA some years ago. Mr. Speaker, you were probably on the picket lines with me marching against those trade agreements when they were being negotiated, because we felt at that time that the deal and the way that it was negotiated was problematic for Canada. There would be job losses. And, in fact, it turned out to be that way. Unfortunately, we lost a lot of manufacturing in Ontario as a result of free trade and other pressures that made costs go up on our side of the border and moved the production into the United States, or into Mexico once we got into NAFTA. That was facilitated by the NAFTA agreements. But the one good thing about NAFTA, and this was something that the federal government had negotiated into the provisions of chapter 19, is that we have a dispute resolution mechanism. That dispute resolution mechanism simply says this: If there’s a trade dispute, either Canada, the United States or Mexico has the right to be able to raise the trade dispute at this panel.", "The interesting thing about the panel—the panel is made up of experts chosen by each of the three countries. I can’t remember how many. I think there are 10 or 20 each that we put up and nominate. But they are trade experts. They are people that understand the intricacy of the trade issues between Canada, Mexico and the United States when it comes to the various sectors of our economy: forestry, manufacturing, resources, oil and gas, etc. So we have these experts on the panel that are not necessarily political appointees. In fact, they’re not political appointees. When they look at the trade dispute and they are asked to make a decision, they are doing it based on law and based on what the actual facts are. We have been quite fortunate that that particular chapter 19 provision has served us well in the forest industry, in that, every time the United States has slapped a duty, as they have this time, and put a tariff on wood going from Canada to the United States, each and every time, we’ve won. The only one we had a problem with was the last one. We were winning it and the federal government decided to negotiate away a billion dollars’ worth of the money that was held by the United States and gave it back to them. I think that was wrong. We should never have allowed that to happen. But that was the choice of the federal government.", "The point is, Mr. Trump is making noises—and I don’t know if he’s going to go there, but he is certainly making noises in that direction. His administration, along with other lawmakers in the United States, are talking about weakening the provisions of chapter 19 so that the panel would be made up of political appointees. So I’m Mr. Trump and I get to appoint who is on that panel. And do you think that those appointees are going to be in any way influenced by the person that appointed them? Well, absolutely. You are there as Mr. Trump’s person on the panel and you will have instructions as to what the decision should be once the panel hears the case.", "Canada, and rightfully so, is pushing back on that and saying we should not allow the panel and the provisions of chapter 19 to be weakened, because as bad as NAFTA has been for our economy—and I have a lot of colleagues here who have lost plenty of jobs as a result of NAFTA and free trade, in Sudbury, St. Catharines, Timmins and different places. As bad as it has been, the one thing that has helped us has been chapter 19 when it comes to at least trying to maintain the stuff that’s left. There is already a lot of manufacturing that is gone, but at least we’re able to protect some of the stuff that we have here against unfair trade practices by the United States.", "With that, Mr. Speaker—I know that other members of my caucus want to speak—I just want to say one more time to the government: This is the grandfather of all time allocation motions that you have brought forward. The fact that you bring back a time allocation motion on a bill that limits debate at second reading, I can live with. You’ve been doing that for a while. I don’t like it, but I get it. But the fact that you’ve excluded the public by saying that this bill will not go to committee and it will go straight to third reading for a 30-minute debate to me says that this government is tired, it is done, and the quicker we get rid of it, the better we’re going to be." ],

I think it’s a big mistake. They shouldn’t be cutting off debate.", "I’d like to thank you for allowing me to speak today. I think most of the members in this House know what the situation behind this bill is. Obviously, in the United States, we’re facing an issue where the President and certain states have forged themselves an America First policy. We’re looking at our largest trading partner talking about cutting off ties with us because they believe somehow that will create jobs. Mr. Speaker, nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, the evidence points in the opposite direction.", "I’m an auto worker. I spent my entire life representing auto workers, and I believe our auto sector is a perfect example of why this American policy is flawed. When you’re making a car, the parts in that car will cross the border on average six to seven times before that car is completed—back and forth. If you look at the auto sector, you can see this clearly. If you look at an assembly plant, they’re based around major routes that allow parts to move quickly up and down the highway.", "That’s why we’re so strong in supporting the GO train and public transit in the NDP. When the highway is clogged, it slows the transit of parts like these. When those parts get slowed down, manufacturing slows down, and when that slows down, people start getting laid off and losing their jobs. Keeping our highways congestion-free is not only good for the environment; it’s necessary to maintain good-paying jobs. I know that the Speaker worked in the steel industry and he knows exactly what I’m talking about.", "But what happens when the border closes? We’ve seen just a small, small part of this happening. Delays at the border cost our province and our nation millions of dollars. We’ve all seen it. You pull up to the border on a busy weekend, and there are 10 booths but only two are open. It’s not the workers’ fault. They’re trying to keep up the best they can, but it’s a staffing issue.", "I know this is a federal issue, Mr. Speaker, but it’s a good example of what can happen here when manufactured goods have trouble crossing our borders. The federal government can and should resolve this issue, particularly around staffing.", "We have people all over Niagara—and I know the Liberals are listening to this, I think; maybe not. We have people all over Niagara looking for jobs, who would love to work at the border, but unfortunately that’s not how it works. So we end up with borders being understaffed and workers being overworked while we have people willing to work within that town.", "But it causes other problems too, and automotive parts, in my eyes, is the best example. Steel and plastic are all good examples. Mr. Speaker, it’s the best example because it’s the most important export that we have in Ontario. These are industries that provide good-paying jobs with benefits and pensions. When your parts slow down, we start producing less, and it starts to be a risk to have an automotive plant here in Canada.", "I want to be clear because I listened to the—it tells you how exciting my life is; I actually watched the debate last night around 10 o’clock on TV on CPAC just to get an idea of what parties were saying about this Bill 194. It is rich, with the Conservatives—I want them to listen to it—when they stand up and talk about protecting good manufacturing jobs in the province of Ontario. Do you know what they said about the auto sector? I was there. Nobody can deny this. I was at the bargaining table. I remember the stress that I was under because it looked like the auto sector was in big trouble and we could lose the entire auto sector. We needed the support of all the parties right here in this House—Liberals, NDP, Conservatives—and you know what the Conservatives said about the auto sector? You want to hear it? They said, “Let the auto sector die. We don’t pick winners and losers.”", "Mr. Speaker, you are from steel. If that auto sector had died, it would have affected the steel plants. It would have affected plastics, small manufacturers, advanced manufacturers. But they said, “Let it die.”", "I was at the bargaining table at that time, and the stress that we were under was incredible. We were going 72 hours around the clock trying to get a solution. What we didn’t need was a party saying, “Let it die.”", "What they didn’t know when they said that was that immediately, if the auto sector had died, the people who I represented, who I took great pride in representing—it was one of the highlights of my life, being a president of my local union. Immediately, if they were getting a $1,000 pension—and this is just an example, because they get more than that in pensions—their pension would have gone to $300; 30%, they would have got on their pensions.", "But what was even worse—and we were faced with this at that table—was that the pensioners, and their spouses—our seniors—would have lost their benefits immediately. If the auto sector had died, the very next day they would have been cut off their medication, their heart pills, their diabetes pills; anything they were getting was cut off immediately. So it’s a little rich when the PCs stand up like they did yesterday talking about manufacturing.", "We should talk, by the way, about how we got into the mess around losing 300,000 manufacturing jobs. Yes, they could have done a better job on the Liberal side, make no mistake about it. You could have. You could have done a lot more. But the reason we lost 300,000 manufacturing jobs was twofold. One was a NAFTA agreement that wasn’t—there’s nothing wrong with trade. We’re a trading nation; we should continue to trade. But it wasn’t fair trade. It wasn’t reciprocal.", "What happened in the auto sector, and why we lost 300,000 jobs—I worked out of a plant in St. Catharines. Before NAFTA came in, you know how many people worked in that plant, Mr. Speaker? Your steel mills were the same way; I know they were. We had 10,000 people working in Niagara, in St. Catharines. Those 10,000 jobs supported a parts sector outside of that, based around the plants. Hayes-Dana was there. There was all kinds of manufacturing. Steel plants were there. All that stuff was there.", "When NAFTA came in, because it wasn’t reciprocal, those jobs were gone. You go down Ontario Street in St. Catharines today—and I know the member from St. Catharines is here—all there is is a chimney left. That’s all that’s left there, where there used to be 4,000 jobs.", "That’s one of the reasons we lost. And who brought in NAFTA? Anybody know?" ],

I’m saying “steel” because I know a little bit about his situation as well.", "What happened is, we decided, under Harper, to have a high Canadian dollar, a petro dollar. That’s all it was. It went on for years. Our dollar went from being where it is today, which is around 79 cents, I think, when I looked yesterday; maybe 78 cents. We should have a Canadian dollar around 80 cents. That’s about where our dollar should be: 80 to 82 cents. But because they decided to have a petro dollar, what happened was, our dollar went up. It was driven by the west, we know that, at the expense of our province of Ontario and good-paying manufacturing jobs in a number of sectors. Our dollar went up to a buck 10, a dollar 10, as manufacturers and businesses said, “I can’t compete. I can’t do this.”", "You’ve seen what’s happened. Manufacturing has come back. I always said, when I was president of the local and I was on radio station after radio station, “Do not give up on advanced manufacturing. When our dollar goes down, we might get some of those jobs back.” And that has happened. But we’re never getting the plants that we lost, because of NAFTA and because of the high Canadian dollar.", "So if we’re going to stand up and talk about trade, we’ve got to take a look at the big picture. And the big picture is—there are a number of reasons, but there was a blatant attack on the manufacturing sector in the province of Ontario by the PC Party through NAFTA and through a high Canadian dollar. That’s how I see it.", "When I talk about letting the auto sector die, like I said, I was watching TV last night and there was steam coming out of my ears when I was listening to this. So I thought I’d raise that this morning, and I’m going to continue to raise it until they at least acknowledge the fact that that’s what they said. They’ve never, ever acknowledged that, and I was at the table, and I’ll be honest with you: It just about killed me. Nobody can deny what happened there. I’ll be honest with you, it would never have gotten done without some of the parties coming together, but it was really the Obama administration that put its foot down at that round of bargaining and said, “We’ve got to get it done. We can’t allow the auto sector to die in the United States and Canada.” We had to get it done, and a resolve was finally come to.", "But when you’re at a bargaining table and you have a party that says, “Let those jobs go. We don’t care about pensioners. We don’t care about seniors. We don’t care about their spouses,” that’s a mistake. They should at least acknowledge that it was a mistake.", "So we’re talking about—I’m sorry; I got off a little bit on that. Obviously I have passion around it. We’re talking about tens of thousands of jobs involved with each of these plants. But here’s the thing: It’s not just about us. The thing about trade is that it has to go both ways. If you close the border on certain products, it’s going to hurt Canada. Make no mistake about it. But it is also going to hurt New York; it’s going to hurt Ohio; it’s going to hurt Michigan and states all along the border. Simply put, it’s a terrible idea that’s going to hurt workers on both sides of the border.", "I’m going to support the bill. But I want to say again: You should not be cutting off the debate. You should be allowing the stakeholders to come and make presentations. You should be allowing the public to come and make presentations on a bill as important as this. To cut off debate is a mistake. You shouldn’t be doing it. I’m going to tell you straight out, Liberals, you should not be doing it on this particular issue. You should be ashamed of yourselves on this one.", "I have one major problem with the bill, one question I’d like to ask the Liberal government.

You’re going to sit there and pretend you care about auto workers with one hand while with the other hand you’re signing trade deals that will put the automotive sector at risk again.", "Let me be clear: I’m not against trade. But trade has to focus on being fair, reciprocal, benefiting both parties. That’s what it’s supposed to be about. For decades, we had fair trade with the United States along our border. When one side was producing more of the assembled vehicles, the other side would produce more parts. That’s how it’s supposed to work, where both benefit.", "Yet you have a government that doesn’t care about that. You have a government that, alongside their federal counterparts, supports a trade deal that is going to cost workers. Don’t take it from me; take it from a Liberal press release. After talking about supporting the deal, the press release said:", "“The Premier reiterated her support for new opportunities for free trade, but made clear that the benefits of enhanced trade should not come at the expense of Ontario’s auto workers, farmers and food producers. Premier Wynne called on the federal government to fulfill their commitment to provide transitional assistance to help Ontario’s automotive and agri-food sectors adjust to the new realities created by the CP-TPP before ratifying the deal. The province is requesting at least $1.26 billion over 10 years in assistance for the auto sector and at least $1.4 billion over 10 years for the agri-food sector in Ontario.”", "So here’s the question, Mr. Speaker: If the Premier believes this is good for Ontario, then why are you asking for money to give to workers to cover their losses? That statement makes it clear. She expects the auto sector and she expects agri-food to lose jobs. We don’t want to lose jobs in the province of Ontario. We want to create jobs. We want opportunities for our kids and our grandkids. She expects them to take a hit when the government signs this deal. I’m saying to the Liberal government: Say no to an agreement that’s going to attack workers in the province of Ontario.", "What the government of Ontario is trying to do is soften the blow of a trade deal. But what happens when the money runs out in 10 years? What happens to those workers in the plant who started only a few years ago, our young people, our grandkids? Do their lives and their pensions not matter? Or is this just a problem for another government—push it down the road?", "Mr. Speaker, I know I’ve only got a couple of seconds left. What we see in this bill is an attempt by this government to look like they’re standing up for workers. Well, if they really cared, why not truly stand up for workers? Why not stand up to the federal government and fight for a fair trade deal, one that actually benefits our workers, like the old auto deals we used to have with the United States?", "Here’s the problem: Ontario is going it alone. We can’t compete head-on against—" ],

The right to cast a ballot without fear or intimidation is something generations of brave Canadian soldiers put their lives on the line to defend. We must never take it for granted, nor can we become complacent by assuming our system is perfect.", "Many members of this Legislature join me in expressing grave concerns about the state of our voters list following the 2014 provincial election. Casting a ballot for a candidate of your choice is a fundamental act in any democracy, but it’s only part of the process. If people aren’t registered and don’t have the information about where or when they vote, they’ll never get to mark a ballot. They are disenfranchised, Speaker. That’s what was happening in too many cases in my riding and across the province. So I’m so very pleased that Elections Ontario has recognized this problem and has launched this initiative to ensure that every Ontarian who is eligible to vote is registered. Ontario PCs are proud to stand with all the parties today to proclaim the month of March as Provincial Voter Registration Month." ],

I think it has been said how important it is that people can find themselves on election lists when they go to the ballot box to exercise their right to vote.", "Unfortunately, it’s becoming more and more of a problem. Although this is a step in the right direction—nobody’s going to say this is a bad idea; in fact it’s quite a good idea—I hearken back to a day when you had people who went out and actually did enumeration, so that when you got to the door, the enumerator would show up, and they would find out who’s living in that house, that apartment, and how many voters were eligible to vote. It would be on the list, the corrections would be made, and you would have a list that reflected who’s in the community and who’s able to vote.", "How many times have we all seen in our own individual ridings, in our elections, on all sides of the House, somebody show up at poll 23, but they’re registered somewhere else? They’ve got to be able to get in their car, if they have one, and get from point A to point B in order to be able to vote again, or they’ve got to go through a pretty elaborate process at the poll. In fact, I remember that happening in your by-election when I was helping my brother, hoping that he would be here instead of you. But congratulations nonetheless.", "It is an issue that we need to deal with. What’s happening is, our electronic lists for voting are not as accurate as they need to be. Our leader raised that yesterday in the debate that took place at Ryerson, and she was right. We really need to have a system so that every voter who is able to vote, who is a citizen of the right age, is able to find themselves on the list, listed at the proper poll, so that they can execute their democratic franchise.", "Is this a good initiative, what Elections Ontario is doing? Yes, but it shouldn’t be the only one. We should go back to door-to-door enumeration so everybody gets on the list and we have less confusion on election day." ],

In the opinion of her coach, Maureen Miller, it was clear that “from the minute she walked in the door she had a talent; she picked it up really quickly and put the work in.” Teagan is the youngest student ever from the Miller School of Irish Dance to qualify for the world championships.", "For those who are unfamiliar with Irish dance, it is a discipline that requires considerable athletic strength and technical skill. Dancers must have excellent posture, stand tall on their toes, be flexible and have strong core muscles. You must also be able to calm your nerves when you go to a world championship.", "As my mother’s maiden name was Shanahan, I wish Teagan all the luck, and I hope she brings home the world championship to Barrie." ],

She joined the Queen’s Park team in about 2006 as a senior communications adviser working for the Honourable Monte Kwinter.

I appreciated immensely her talent in helping our association excel.", "Annette envisioned a fairer Ontario, and I’m proud to say that as a government we are committed to staying on the same path, for which she would be very, very proud.", "Speaker, I extend my deepest condolences to her family and friends and to all of her colleagues who had the pleasure of working with her in her decade-long career here at Queen’s Park.

In fact, I feel that this antagonistic approach is only going to make matters worse. If we anger our friends to the south, we risk compromising trade relations so much further. Major economic drivers will fold throughout our province, city by city. In a community like mine of Sault Ste. Marie, with the industry being steel, Algoma Steel will fold.", "The answer is simple. If we look within each of our individual communities and we think about what our major businesses are that supply and drive economies south of the border, we can demonstrate to the leaders there with one phone call—if each one of us makes just one phone call to a leader south of the border that relies on our economies to keep their economies afloat, we can show the US that they need us as much as we need them.

I am reminded of what my former colleague the member from Niagara West–Glanbrook said in his farewell speech to the Legislature: We are a privileged 107 in this place. We have the special opportunity to walk into this chamber, take our place at our desks and talk about the issues that are most important to the people in our communities. We have the real ability to create positive change for the people of Ontario. So I am optimistic that the members will seize that opportunity and support this motion that we are discussing here today.", "What I’m asking for in this motion is that the members of this House support my call for the government to immediately strike an advisory council that will make recommendations to the Ministry of Health about how best to support children and families dealing with PANDAS/PANS.", "You may recall that just about 15 months ago, this Legislature wisely voted to pass Bill 43 into law, creating PANDAS/PANS Awareness Day in Ontario. Every October 9 now is officially recognized in Ontario as PANDAS/PANS Awareness Day.", "I was very proud that the members of this Legislature chose to join the growing movement across North America to recognize the need to educate and raise awareness of pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococcal infection, otherwise referred to in this bill as PANDAS, and pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome, otherwise referred to as PANS. I’ll refer to that in the rest of the bill. I was really taking a chance to get it out that many times.", "The work to help children and families who are confronted with these diseases does not stop with one day of awareness a year. For those families, the impact of PANDAS/PANS is felt every day of the year. I want to take this opportunity to recognize some of those families who are here with us today in the west members’ gallery. I would like to introduce them once again. I introduced them this morning. Kerry Henrikson is here, the mother of Jonah Henrikson; Erin Kwarciak; Janet Trider; Ellen Nichol; Erica Mills; Doreen Crombie—there they are—and Don Crombie. These are some of the leaders in this struggle across Ontario, and I want to salute them at this time and thank them for being here.", "These are just a few of the people across Ontario who make up the PANDAS/PANS Ontario network. I know that there are many more who are probably watching today who would have liked to have been in attendance. They have all faced the challenge of dealing with the symptoms of PANDAS/PANS either personally or in caring for a loved one.", "Please join me in welcoming them to Queen’s Park today.", "PANDAS—I’m not going to go through that long name; I’ll stumble over it—describes a subset of children or adolescents who have either an abrupt onset of obsessive-compulsive disorder or tic disorder symptoms or an acute worsening of symptoms following a streptococcus infection. PANS, which stands for pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome, describes the sudden acute onset of any neuropsychiatric condition—for example, OCD, anxiety, depression, irritability or other regression—that cannot be explained by any other neurological or medical disorder.", "This is a lot to take in, so let me simplify it just a bit. Children and adolescents are all infected at some time or other with the strep virus, which we all know is very common. I’m sure every member of this House who has children or grandchildren has at some time had to deal with the threat of the strep virus. After the strep infection has run its course, parents are noticing that their children are acting differently. They are showing behaviours and traits that they didn’t have before the strep infection was present: things like obsessive-compulsive behaviour, generalized anxiety, joint pain, restrictive eating, tics, separation anxiety, hyperactivity, sleep difficulties and regression in both language and behaviour. This is obviously very troubling for any parent or grandparent. So parents and grandparents are going to their doctors and pediatricians and asking for help. But because the awareness and understanding of PANDAS/PANS has not permeated the mainstream thinking of the medical community, which our own Minister of Health acknowledged today and the former minister acknowledged to me over a year ago when we passed a bill for the day of recognition, the symptoms that these children are displaying are often being confused with other conditions, Madam Speaker. As a result, these children are potentially being misdiagnosed and they end up taking medication to deal with their symptoms, but the root of the problem is never being addressed.", "A perfect example of a lack of understanding in how to properly address PANDAS/PANS can be found in the response that I received from the former Minister of Health to a question I tabled on April 16, 2015, in this House. At that time, I asked the minister to detail what the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care was doing to support patients and children dealing with a PANDAS/PANS diagnosis. The minister responded, “PANDAS/PANS are not fully understood.” The minister continued, “Ontario’s health care system provides support through treatment of symptoms such as OCD and tic disorders.”", "That is very important, Madam Speaker. Because of a lack of understanding, our medical community ends up prescribing treatments for the symptoms but not the root cause of the disease. For many parents, this is an incredibly frustrating and scary situation to deal with. I think we all agree that parents know their children best. But what do you do when a medical professional suggests that your child, who has changed almost overnight, should begin being medicated by psychiatric drugs like Zoloft, Prozac and Cymbalta? To be clear, these are drugs that are used to deal with things like depression and anxiety. I’ll yield to my colleague from Elgin–Middlesex–London; I know he’ll go into maybe greater detail on what those drugs can do, being a pharmacist.", "Madam Speaker, every community in our province is facing the challenge of how we deal with youth mental health issues. I can’t help but wonder if it’s possible that young people with these treatable medical issues like PANDAS/PANS are being misdiagnosed—not on purpose, but because of a lack of experience and education on symptoms like depression and anxiety—as having mental health issues.", "Of course, no parent wants to see their child medicated needlessly. There’s a very powerful documentary by the filmmaker Tim Sorel called My Kid Is Not Crazy. The film follows the story of six children and their families as they fight to have their children properly diagnosed.", "It is an experience that I think each and every one of the guests here today from the PANDAS/PANS Ontario network has experienced first-hand. That is why it is so important that this government of Ontario join this fight to raise awareness of PANDAS/PANS as a possible diagnosis in these situations.", "The advisory council I am seeking your support for would ideally include a multitude of perspectives, but, first and foremost, it would include parent representatives. The parents and the children who have lived these experiences must be part of the process to educate, inform and advance our understanding of PANDAS/PANS.", "These stories are very powerful. I would strongly encourage each member of this Legislature to set up meetings with representatives of PANDAS/PANS Ontario in your communities. Believe me, ladies and gentlemen, they exist in every community in Ontario. So I would urge you to reach out. I have contacts here that will make sure they make their members aware of your connections and addresses.", "I know that a number of members have already held meetings. I want to thank those members for that. I know the member from Beaches–East York is going to speak later today; he has met with someone in his riding.", "In addition to parent and child representation on the advisory council, my hope is that the government can turn to the example that is currently being provided in the state of Illinois, which struck its own advisory council in 2015. That panel has a wide and diverse selection of experts in medicine, research, wellness and child development to inform its recommendations. I know any parent is going to say they want to know that everything is being considered when it comes to the health of their child.", "Once diagnosed, treatment of PANDAS/PANS may be as simple as antibiotics or an anti-inflammatory medication. The impact on the child can be seen almost overnight. This is important information and potentially life-changing for those affected.", "Before my time is up, I want to mention that the major driver behind the bill to create the PANDAS/PANS Awareness Day on October 9 and to form this advisory council is an organization that was started in my riding of Sarnia–Lambton by Kerry Henrikson, who I introduced earlier today. Kerry is one of the parents, with her fellow members, who saw these dramatic changes in their children and knew something wasn’t right. So she started asking questions, making phone calls and organizing people around the province. Now, with the help of the families that are here today and many more that can’t be here, they are doing a lot of great work in getting the word out about PANDAS/PANS. I hope that members from each party will take a few moments to say hello to Kerry and the other visitors from PANDAS/PANS Ontario to learn more about their personal stories.", "As I wrap up, I’m going to circle back to the thought I started my remarks with. As members of this Legislature, we have a great privilege to sit here and to be able to impact people’s lives in positive ways. I can think of no better way for members of this Legislature to execute that privilege to effect positive change, especially those members sitting on the government benches, than voting to support this motion this afternoon, but then, once that is done, directly appealing to their colleagues, the Premier and the Minister of Health, to act without delay in striking that advisory council on PANDAS/PANS.", "Thank you, Madam Speaker. I look forward to the remainder of the debate. Thank you very much to my colleagues for listening to me." ],

He’s asking for acknowledgment that this is happening and that people can bring their experiences to educate us. This will be a form of research, obviously.", "The people here today, the families here today, are looking for answers. They are looking for answers to a diagnosis that they are experiencing, whether it’s themselves or their children. That’s what parents do. If something happens, an illness, to a child, they expect to go to their health care system. They go to their doctor. They go to the emergency room, when it’s not overcrowded, and they get help. They get some medication, or maybe it’s surgery, but there’s generally some diagnosis. There’s generally something that can help the ailment that they’ve come to find treatment for.", "But in this case, with PANDAS/PANS, it’s not so readily available. There’s not much around diagnosis. We know that we’ve heard from parents, and from looking at the information I’ve sought out, that it often starts with the streptococcus, and then somehow, there are other side effects or ailments or health concerns that arise.", "Parents are concerned, and they want help with this. They want to know what kind of treatment—if you can identify some of these health risks when it comes to PANDAS/PANS, what are some of the preventive things that can happen so that it doesn’t escalate into these other symptoms that have been highlighted before?", "If there are ways to do that, I think the advisory council is a good first step. We need to have, especially—I agree with the member from Sarnia–Lambton—experienced people to represent the advisory council and guide them, because this is such an unknown right now. We need to learn from people who are experiencing these health concerns. That’s the right thing to do. We need to involve them, and we need to ask them what it is that they are seeking.", "When we have that advisory council, of course you’re going to have to have some terms of reference and a mandate, and maybe that is also guided by what they have experienced. Surrounding those terms of reference, when we’re consulting, when we’re hearing and collaborating with people, families, parents, grandparents, patients and people who are experiencing these health concerns, PANDAS and PANS, finding out what that is so that the advisory council can be effective—making it up within these walls and not consulting with the people who are actually living it, living what’s going on, I think, doesn’t help research and the advisory council to develop what their mandate would be. We need to know what their experiences are.", "I thank the member for his passion, and for the fact that he is good at what he’s doing here today. He’s good at listening to his constituents. We had the first step, which was the bill for recognition on October 9 of PANDAS/PANS Awareness Day. Oftentimes that’s where things start. It’s a progression: We don’t have knowledge of an issue, we start researching it and then we start educating people, as well. Education sometimes comes first, before research, as in this case, so education is a good thing. So that was the first step. We had that recognition of awareness.", "Then the member talked further, and probably at the pressure of the people who are experiencing this health concern, so good on them for continuing to lobby the member from Sarnia–Lambton, and him coming up with some kind of solution or mechanism to address their concerns.", "Today, again, one of the great things that we have the pleasure and the privilege of doing is debating issues that we’re not aware of, listening to our members who bring concerns forward in their riding and opening up the vast tools that we have as legislators in our own ridings to deal with problems as they come forward. That is the next step that he has progressed to.", "And then, who knows? After the advisory council, should it come to light—I mean, we certainly support this initiative. We’ll see what happens after it gets sent to a committee, or where it goes from that stage. If it passes through this chamber and ends up actually being legislation where this advisory council is created, then from that stage forward, that information—like they said, it’s a report. They’ll want it to be reported back to the Legislature. We’ll have to examine those results. Then, from there, that’s where the health minister can maybe have some training and education in medical schools, because this is all brand new.", "I just want to congratulate the member again and welcome everyone here who has come here to support the member in this initiative. I look forward to continuing the debate and hearing other perspectives and experiences that people have in speaking to the bill." ],

It’s a pleasure to see you in the chair this afternoon for private members’ business here.", "This is, I think, one of those great days in our week where we get to do some very important work, where the whole House can come together on issues that are of particular importance to one member who has had his ear to the ground to hear what his constituents are saying and what others in the community are saying, and taken action on it. I’m delighted to be able to stand and to take an opportunity to support the member from Sarnia–Lambton on this initiative.", "I came to understand PANDAS as a rare disease among children about two and a half weeks ago, when a constituent of mine came to see me. She happens to be the daughter-in-law of a very close personal friend. I had heard that they had some issues with their child back a year ago, and I didn’t know what it was; I didn’t have any idea what it’s about. But she reached out to me, now that their child had stabilized, to say that she wanted to tell me about her experience with her son Knox.", "Erica Mills was here earlier. I wonder if some of the families had a chance to meet her when she was here earlier during question period. But Erica came to see me and said, “You’re not going to believe what happened.” One of her two children, a very healthy, very active son, suddenly started to display very odd symptoms: his head tics, anxiousness, and he started to verbalize things they’d never heard out of his mouth before. It was very distressing as a parent, as you know it would be, and I’m sure your families have gone through exactly this distressing, unpredictable, un-understandable behavioural changes in your child that happen really quite suddenly.", "So they went to hospital, they went to emergency, as any good parent would. There was no diagnosis of PANDAS at the time. They weren’t quite sure what was going on. They gave him some relaxants and sent him home again. But the situation and the complications got worse and worse. They were watching their loving child change dramatically, and they were just horrified: “What do we do?”", "Now, Erica happens to be a professional researcher, so she went online; she went to journals; she went to the University of Toronto medical libraries. She started doing research to try to better understand. Her mother happens to be a physician, as well. She eventually came across a PANDAS diagnosis, and she said to her mother, “Look, this seems to be exactly what my Knox is going through.”", "It’s not a complicated treatment. Drugs are readily available once you get the diagnosis. So she brought that to her mother and her mother agreed. They went back to the family physician and had the family physician do some investigation. It’s a simple blood or saliva test, I believe, in order to determine that in fact there are antibodies running around that are supposed to be attacking a strep virus and which are now actually attacking the brain of the child. Knox wasn’t exhibiting symptoms of strep throat, fever or any of those things, but just a simple blood or saliva test could indicate that he had these antibodies in his system that had to be addressed.", "They put him on a treatment protocol. I think it was three to four months of antibiotics. Now they live with that fear that it may come back, so they’re watching him very, very closely. At some point, I understand, the immune system may become more robust and it won’t be an ongoing danger to an early teen or into adulthood, but for now they maintain that vigil to ensure, if he starts to exhibit signs, which are now more recognizable, they will go and get him back on a treatment system.", "So she came to me, and I immediately said, “We need awareness.” I’ve only been here since 2014, but I’ve seen the incredible work we’ve done on awareness for a whole series of issues by holding a special day of recognition, for instance. So in my mind, what about a PANDAS/PANS Day? I looked online, and in the US, October 9 is widely recognized as a day of recognition of this disease. So I thought, well, we should do a private member’s bill.", "It didn’t take me long in my research to determine that another member of this House, the member from Sarnia–Lambton, had already done a private member’s bill to recognize October 9 as PANDAS day, and it had received the approval of the House and it went forward. I congratulate him on that very, very important bill. But it doesn’t mean that the work was done, because what we really need to do is get more information to pediatric doctors. This woman’s own mother is a doctor, and she wasn’t aware of the symptoms that would have led her to a diagnosis. So we need to do more.", "I thought, as part of my work, I would go and spend some time with the Minister of Health, which I did. I said, “What we need here is some kind of professional circular to go to every single pediatric doctor in the province of Ontario: ‘Are you aware of these symptoms and that the cause could be....’ and that this is the simple test to confirm and these are the treatment options?” It seemed like a simple thing to me. You would do this in any professional organization. You’d send out an advisory to all of the people who are dealing with diagnosis, particularly pediatric diagnosis, to say, “Be aware.”", "It’s not unlike—and the member from Sarnia–Lambton will also be very familiar with this—the issues around Lyme disease, because with climate change and the temperatures warming in Ontario, we’re starting to see more deer ticks carrying Lyme disease up into Ontario, and it’s not an illness that’s well understood by doctors in the province. So we’re seeing people with Lyme disease not getting the treatment as early as they need, and it results in catastrophic difficulties for them later in life if they don’t get early treatment.", "The same, I think, could be said about PANDAS/PANS. The earlier you treat it, the better the chance for full recovery, and a lack of treatment can lead to serious consequences for the children and their families in not being able to indulge in a full and productive life.", "So I had this conversation with the minister: “Can’t we be doing something along the lines of those kinds of professional directions to all doctors?” And he said, “Well, that would be difficult. For the Ministry of Health to tell doctors how to do their job is kind of overstepping authority. We need some other mechanism.”", "I had reached out to the member from Sarnia–Lambton to say, “What else has been happening?” And it just happened, that day, he said, “I’m going to table my private member’s motion,” which he has in front of us today. From my perspective, the timing was very fortuitous. I welcomed the opportunity that I could support him. I know that all members of the House will support that the ministry does determine, through—I think you’re asking for an advisory council that can put good, professional minds on the case to figure out how best to disseminate the information to those who need it most.", "The minister told me—very supportive—he was aware of the disease, but wasn’t aware of whether we were doing anything special within the ministry. And now we have a ministry change, of course. I haven’t had the chance to speak to the new Minister of Health and Long-Term Care, but I’m absolutely certain that her staff will be absolutely on topic, trying to do the work.", "Particularly because this is not like a rare disease wherein the treatment is costing hundreds of thousands of dollars and putting taxpayers—money spent well to keep people healthy is obviously very important. But we face that issue often, where people come and say, “We want you to fund this drug, even if we’re not sure it’s going to be effective, and it’s going to cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.” But that’s not the situation here. The situation here is that if you get the information right and if you get the diagnosis right, you can treat it.", "I’m delighted that part of our treatment options now, under OHIP+, is that every child under the age of 25 is now entitled to free medicine, so the drugs associated with treating PANDA/PANS would be free under the OHIP+ program. I think that’s an important step, but it doesn’t deal with the more important diagnosis piece, which is what I hope this advisory council can focus on—to bring those talents, those best minds, together.", "It may be that an advisory council that’s constructed out of the ministry could, in fact, put a kind of information circuit together, and maybe start publishing into medical journals that doctors read, and maybe make it part of continuing education for physicians in the province of Ontario, that will alert them to the symptoms.", "Erica Mills told me—and I’ve seen it in some of the other government material that has come to me—that they classify this as a rare issue. But she has seen evidence in the US that suggests that almost one in 200 kids could be affected. I look around at the kids I know in the community who are suffering from dyslexia or autism or OCD issues, and you have to stop and ask yourself, “Wait a second; did something happen earlier in their life that changed their behaviour and that never was caught and it had an effect?” I think the incidence is not nearly as well understood as it should be. We should be putting the research dollars into ensuring we know more about it and what we’re doing to identify it.", "Speaker, I don’t know if any of my other members want an opportunity to say a few words on this. I will absolutely work with the member from Sarnia–Lambton to ensure that we get the work done so that we can support the families from his own community, in my community and across the province of Ontario to ensure that they get the diagnosis and the treatment that they so richly deserve.", "Thank you to the member for bringing the motion.

It was more than a year ago when the member from Kitchener–Conestoga, Mike Harris, brought forth a similar type of bill, which called on a special advisory committee on rare diseases as a whole. It was important that that bill came forward to put a spotlight on the fact that Ontario is not dealing with the issue of rare diseases very well. It hard to blame anyone, however. It has been occurring for so long; we do have to throw it out in the spotlight.", "Medical technology this day has become so advanced and our diagnostic protocols have been so specific that more and more types of diseases and conditions are being diagnosed. The treatments that result from those diagnoses and responses have become so specific that we are creating more and more rare diseases because we are becoming a brighter and more technically advanced society. I mention that when speaking of any GI—gastrointestinal—type of problem, we’ve become so specific. It used to be that maybe we would just treat Crohn’s disease or colitis, but now we can break it down even further. And the medication and treatments coming out, and the understanding coming out, for these diseases are so advanced that, many times, a misdiagnosis occurs.", "It’s not a misdiagnosis because our health care professionals are failing us—I think that Ontario has the brightest and highest-trained health care professionals not only in North America but in the world; it’s because our advances are so quick in coming forward. That’s the role the government needs to play: How do we create an integrated system so that with these advancements in society—that the government is well informed about what’s happening in the medical system—they can find a way to ensure that that information and ideas are spread through the health care professionals and our hospital system so that we can diagnose these conditions quicker and ensure that treatment begins soon?", "It’s unimaginable, as a parent—and most of us who are parents are blessed to be parents here—the fact that if your son or daughter were to take ill and you would go to your doctor, and they weren’t getting better—something was missed. And I know in the system, it’s really hard to see specialists to start with. The fact that we have the potential to continuously misdiagnose these issues is only heartbreaking to the family. You can talk about the cost associated with it, but I’m just going to talk about the anxiety and the worry that parents must feel.", "It’s motions like the ones from the member from Sarnia–Lambton that make this really important to bring forward so that the Minister of Health is kept well informed, because with the bureaucrats in the Ministry of Health and the minister themselves, there are so many issues to worry about that they can’t possibly keep on track of all the issues going on.", "I know that the ministry created a rare disease advisory committee at just the same time that Michael Harris was pushing the issue, but that committee is not enough for this issue. Perhaps this motion wouldn’t have had to come forward if the government had had a proper consultation process in listening to health care professionals as they reach out for help.", "My other point I just want to bring forward here—because hopefully this will pass—is the implementation of this committee. The member opposite mentioned Lyme disease. I think it has been about two years now since we passed a similar motion to create a strategic plan for Lyme disease in this province, and we’ve had little to no movement. The bills from the member from Haldimand–Norfolk and a member from the third party pushed this forward.", "Step 1 is get this motion passed. Step 2: We need your help going forward, once we pass this motion, to push the government into action. There is more than enough time to get this started before the election, so don’t let that be an excuse. Know if this motion passes, and we’re fortunate enough to form the government, that we will continue to ensure that it’s enacted. But we need to get this pushed as quickly as possible.", "I will make this small comment on OHIP+. It’s great to expand coverage for OHIP+, since we’re talking about a pediatric condition. OHIP+ fails because the formulary does not cover enough dosage forms for children. I’m getting calls from psychiatrists and I’m getting calls from family doctors saying that the dosage their child is on, especially for anti-depressant medications—the Ontario Drug Benefit Formulary does not cover children’s doses.", "I’m hoping they’re making those changes to that formulary to ensure that those children are going to get the treatment they need. We can do better with OHIP+. It was rushed, implemented—our side of the House, we’re going to fix that. I hope the government is making note of the necessary changes in case they want to expand it—that they need to do better homework in creating these programs.", "Thanks again to the member for Sarnia–Lambton.

  "text" : [ "Thank you to my caucus colleague from Sarnia, Bob Bailey, for taking this important step in continuing our party’s efforts to ensure that Ontarians with rare conditions have the support they need.", "Special acknowledgment goes to Kerry Henrikson and her son, Jonah Henrikson, and all of the people in the gallery who have come here today to support this. It’s a very important cause and one that I’m proud to support.", "Following up on the work done some years ago when we declared October 9 as PANDAS/PANS Awareness Day in Ontario, we’re now taking this advocacy work to the next level, which is to establish an advisory council on PANDAS/PANS—on research, diagnosis and treatment relating to the disorder and syndrome.", "As you heard earlier, PANS stands for pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome, and PANDAS stands for pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococcal infections. It is not one we often hear about, but because of that first step this Legislature took some time ago, we were able to raise awareness and, as a result, we now know that we need to do more to help improve our understanding of the two disorders which have slightly different diagnosing criteria.", "So far, we have learned that PANDAS is believed to develop from a case of strep throat and results in a multitude of behavioural issues similar to obsessive-compulsive disorder or autism and, in the words of the parents with kids suffering from PANDAS, a lot of mental anguish that, and I quote, “just explodes overnight.”", "Parents describe the symptoms as anger and raging, followed by life-changing symptoms such as severe restrictive eating, intense anxiety, tics, personality changes, a decline in math and handwriting abilities and sensory sensitivities.", "This autoimmune illness affects one in every 200 children. It’s a similar statistic to childhood cancer, yet there’s no single test, no single lab test available to confirm the diagnosis.", "This is why raising awareness levels is critical, as PANDAS/PANS is often misdiagnosed and undertreated due to the lack of awareness both by the public and even the medical community. The truth is, the disorders aren’t widely recognized in most medical circles and treatment is difficult to come by and isn’t covered by health insurance, albeit the province provides support through treatment of symptoms of tic disorders. This is why we need to set up an advisory council and coordinate a plan to help children suffering from this autoimmune illness.", "The members opposite will know that our party has always supported individuals and families who are affected by rare diseases. It was just two years ago that another caucus colleague and MPP for Kitchener–Conestoga, Michael Harris, stood here on behalf of rare disease sufferers who were seeking access to treatments. He championed a motion for an all-party select committee into rare disease treatment after the government refused to help these families, many of them who had been forced to scrape up the needed funds themselves or suffer in silence. In some cases, these treatments can run between $3,000 a month or $25,000 a year.", "Similarly, another colleague from our party, the MPP from Nepean–Carleton, Lisa MacLeod, did the same.", "Our PC caucus will continue to support and take next steps towards access to support and treatments for Ontarians suffering from rare diseases.", "At home in Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound, my constituents support the same. I’ve received emails and phone calls from concerned citizens in my riding who are not happy with this government’s treatment of patients, the government’s lack of support for people who are struggling to access treatment in Ontario and whom the government is forcing to max out resources to pay for life-saving treatment.", "This is why it’s important for us to change that by supporting this motion and putting parents and families dealing with symptoms of PANDAS/PANS on notice that we are listening, we do care and we are taking action to help.", "I’m proud to stand here today with my colleagues from Sarnia, Kitchener–Conestoga and Nepean–Carleton who continue our fight and call for better support and access to health care and treatment for Ontarians—all Ontarians.", "I truly support my colleague Mr. Bailey from Sarnia. I think this is number six of his PMBs. He always brings those issues that are truly impacting people across the province.", "He was just sharing that it’s kind of unfortunate sometimes that it’s on Thursday afternoons when the House isn’t here. People go home to their ridings, and that’s just the reality of the situation. Please know that the people who aren’t here in the House today—it’s not a reflection that they’re not caring and concerned, because there’s tons of support across, I hope, all three parties. At the end of the day, this motion will get passed and we will be able to take critical action as quickly as possible." ],

It’s most important that you made the journey here today from across Ontario and Sarnia–Lambton to be here, to advocate on behalf of your children, your family and friends.", "I did make a couple of other notes here. I understood from Kerry that there are only two doctors across Ontario, one from Chatham and one from somewhere else in Ontario, who may be presently treating this disease. I could be corrected on that. It’s not a widely treated disease because there’s just no one with enough expertise in it or who takes the time to be made aware of this. We need to work with this.", "I appreciate the support of all three parties in the House to do this.

I think that if everybody in the province could have the privilege to be here on Thursdays to hear the many issues that are brought up from ridings across the province—you learn so much on Thursdays. I’m not so sure of the rest of the week, but Thursdays, definitely, for private members’ business, because that’s when the members from every party in the House bring issues that are important to them and to their constituents here to this House, which is such a privilege to serve in." ],

Thank you from the bottom of my heart for the work that you do, for your courage, for your determination to make life better for all of those children and youth, now and in the future, who struggle with mental health.", "It is an honour to rise today to speak to my private member’s motion to eliminate wait-lists for children and youth seeking community-based mental health services. I wish this motion wasn’t necessary, but it is because, despite the words I hear from the government that they know that more needs to be done, I am not sure they appreciate the urgency of the situation that we are facing. That is the message that I hear from those who work and live in the field: that we have a crisis on our hands.", "In 2012, the government announced Moving on Mental Health, a plan that promised to transform the system. It promised a system “that is easy to navigate, that enables fast answers and clear pathways to care. Most important of all—the system must deliver early and appropriate help for each child and youth who needs it.” The service providers were hopeful that this had signalled a significant change, and they worked hard to make sure that they could do the best that they could. I can assure you, Speaker, they have a history of working miracles with very limited budgets, because they have had to—because the fact is that they have received only two increases to their base funding in the past 25 years: 3% in 2003 and 5% in 2006. Once you take into account inflation and an increase in demand, service providers are operating at about half the capacity of what they were before.", "They had been hopeful for change, but they soon recognized that instead, they were falling further and further behind. In Moving on Mental Health, the government gave themselves three years to transform the system so that “parents will know where to go for help and know how to get service quickly. Funding will reflect each community’s current and future needs. All Ontarians will know how well the system is working.”", "Speaker, that was in 2012. We are now in 2018, three years after the deadline the government had set for themselves, and we are no further ahead. In fact, service providers are saying that their capacity to meet the needs of those they serve continues to erode.", "The numbers speak for themselves: 12,000 kids in Ontario are waiting for mental health treatment, some for as long as 18 months; it estimated there are 6,500 that are waiting more than a year. This has a devastating impact on lives, an impact that can carry on into adulthood and stay with them for the rest of their life. In fact, 70% of mental health problems have their onset during childhood or adolescence. In other words, early treatment is crucial to avoiding bigger problems down the road. Tragically, some take their own life; others come much too close.", "This morning, I was joined at a news conference by Alicia Raimundo, who shared her experience with the children’s mental health system. Alicia spoke of her life as a 13-year-old: She was in a place of darkness. She couldn’t imagine living another day. At 14, she tried to take her own life. Luckily, she woke up in hospital, but then she had to wait seven years to get the mental health treatment that she needed. Her survival is a true testament to her strength in the face of adversity. To speak out now, on behalf of children and youth all across Ontario, demonstrates remarkable courage, and we so appreciate it.", "Sadly, there are far too many who do not make it through. Suicide is the second leading cause of death among young people in Canada, where we have the third-highest rate of youth suicide in the industrialized world. Our First Nations youth are in crisis, having a suicide rate five to six times higher than that of non-aboriginal youth.", "Loretta Hill-Finamore, who is the director of youth services with the Good Shepherd in Hamilton and who is here with us today, told me of a young artist and musician who first showed up at their door before the age of 16. This youth was in and out of hospital, in and out of youth mental health facilities and a homeless shelter. They fell into the world of substance abuse, and the system was never able to meet their needs. At one point, they were ordered by the psychiatrist and the court to go to Syl Apps Youth Centre, the most restrictive youth facility. It’s a tragic story that ended in suicide for that youth.", "As Loretta said, if we had a system that was accessible to indigenous families living in poverty, this young artist might still be with us today. As stark evidence of our need for increased awareness of gender identity and expression, LGBTQ2+ youth have a risk of suicide and substance abuse 14 times higher than that of their peers.", "Beyond those particular tragic outcomes, the lack of services causes untold damage that severely impacts lives. A survey conducted by Ipsos in October of last year found 46% of 18- to 34-year-olds had missed school due to issues related to anxiety and 40% had sought mental health help; of those, 42% are still waiting or did not get the help that they need. The result, of course, is that kids with mental health issues have substantially lower achievement at school. Their career opportunities become severely limited and could lead to a life of poverty as they get older.", "Outcomes like this mean that the effects of what we are doing now are not impacting just today’s kids, but potentially their families for generations to come. Parents have to take time away from work to care for their children. It affects their income, or perhaps takes them out of the workforce completely. As we might imagine, this adds significant stress to situations that are already extremely challenging. Lacking proper treatment, the problems inevitably get worse.", "Some end up in group homes where the staff just don’t have the resources to deal with them. Don’t get me wrong: The staff at those homes do a very difficult job that they often feel is thankless, and they do it for very little pay. Often, the staff have no training at all, let alone any to deal with complex mental health issues. This is a problem that was highlighted in the report submitted two years ago by the government-appointed Residential Services Review Panel.", "Sometimes these placements have terrible consequences. In February of last year, a tragic fire in a foster home near Lindsay took the life of 14-year-old resident Kassy Finbow and staff member Andrea Reid. Mary Ballantyne of the Ontario Association of Children’s Aid Societies wrote a column in the Toronto Star about this tragedy, and in the column she said, “The residential services working group convened by children’s aid societies is looking at initial data from agencies that suggest in some areas upwards of 40% of their youth in the care of group homes should actually be in the care of a children’s mental health service.”", "The fact is that in the absence of adequate community-based mental health services, many of those who need help end up in the wrong place—hospitals, for example. In the past 10 years, there has been an increase of 63% in emergency department visits, and a 67% increase in hospitalizations for children and youth seeking treatment for mental health disorders in Ontario. Not only are children and youth being denied the services and the treatment that they need; we are also needlessly encumbering other parts of our health care system, at an estimated cost of $190 million a year.", "Children and youth who can’t access community-based mental health services have no other option but to go to the hospital when they are in desperate need of help—hospitals that, as we know, are already strained to their limits by an overcrowding that none of us have ever seen. It makes no sense and it’s bad policy.", "Speaker, the stigma of mental health has always been a problem. It has been a barrier to us talking about it and dealing with it. However, I think that we have made significant headway in recent years. The young survivors who came here today and spoke so eloquently in sharing their own experiences are evidence of that. More and more, it is being treated as a health issue, but we still have a long, long way to go.", "Just last week, the former Minister of Health said in this House, “I think all of us understand that mental health and physical health are two sides of the same coin. We need to demonstrate that same vigour, intent and determination on mental health as we do in providing health services for those with physical ailments.”", "I have to say to the government that you’d better believe that you need to demonstrate it, because it certainly isn’t being seen by those who are dealing with mental health each and every day, and it certainly isn’t evident when we compare spending on mental and physical health. Data from just a couple of years ago tells us that Ontario spent $1,361 per capita on health care versus $16.45 for mental health.", "The government will tell us what they have done, but the fact is that they have fallen unacceptably behind on their Moving on Mental Health plan. We are still waiting for a new funding formula. In 2012, they said it would be done in three years. They said that by 2015, “the system must deliver early and appropriate help for each child and youth who needs it.” The actions they have taken, such as their commitment to wellness hubs, do not include an increase to treatment services. It’s a good service delivery mechanism, but it does nothing to reduce wait-lists, and they are limited to only nine communities in the entire province.", "Meanwhile, children and youth in the thousands wait and wait and wait. They struggle, they suffer and some die. We are at a critical stage when it comes to our children’s mental health. I ask all members to support this motion today." ],

As I say, it’s not just about money, but money is important. We have committed to an additional $1.9 billion over the next decade in better mental health services.", "Speaker, I can tell you that in my community—and I think this is not unusual—the challenge with mental health services for young people is that there has been a very uncoordinated labyrinth of services to try to navigate. I know there has been really good work done in my community and in other communities bringing together organizations that provide mental health services.", "We’ve established lead agencies. In the 33 service areas across the province, 31 of them have identified a lead agency that is responsible for mental health services in that area. These are agencies that are really beginning the work of integrating care for people. There’s nothing worse for a parent who is worried about one of their kids than to go an agency, wait for an assessment, get the assessment and then be told they are in the wrong place, that there’s a better agency somewhere else. Then they have to start it all over again. Meanwhile, the clock is ticking on this child. The child is not thriving. The families are suffering; the kids are suffering. We need to better coordinate.", "The other area where there is really good progress being made is through our school system. Very often it’s the teacher who first identifies a mental health challenge. In fact, often it’s the teacher before the parents. Parents can maybe not realize that their child is experiencing mental health challenges, but the teachers do. We need to bring that mental health service into the school system as well.", "This is not a partisan issue. All of us agree that we want the very best services for our children and youth. But I think we need to bring not just agencies within the mental health sector working together but we need to bring schools and we need to bring our hospitals and other health care providers. Collectively, I know we can continue to improve services and better outcomes for people.", "Some real example of change is taking place. We’ve now got 24/7 walk-in counselling services so children and youth can get the help they need when they need it the most.", "When I was Minister of Advanced Education and Skills Development, the number one issue that I heard when I went to colleges and to universities—whether from the faculty or the administration, and certainly from the students—the number one issue that was identified to me was mental health services.", "The advice that I got time and time again was that we need to provide a system that offers the right care at the right time in the right place from the right provider, so that students who can work with peer groups like Jack.org—Jack.org provides terrific peer support. For some students, that’s the right care. Others need more intensive care. We need to continue to develop a system that delivers the right care at the right time in the right place from the right provider.", "I am encouraged by the progress that has been made. I would be the last person to say that we’re at the end of this journey. There is so much more to do. We will continue to do the work.", "Again, I applaud the member from Hamilton Mountain and so many others in this Legislature who have stood up and said that there is no health without mental health.

You could say it’s because of Bell Let’s Talk, which has increased awareness and reduced the stigma, which is great. People are seeking the help they need. But that wouldn’t be the cause of all the emergency department visits. The increase is because community services have been starved for support from this government, and there’s nowhere to turn but to the emergency departments in our hospitals.", "The next stat: Hospitalizations for mental health disorders in children and youth rose 67%. It’s lucky enough if they have a bed. Right now, as we’re seeing in hallways throughout the province, people are coming in for help in our emergency departments and there are no beds. Unfortunately, some people needing specific mental health beds are being placed in units where they shouldn’t be because there are no beds and there’s no place to put these people.", "Let’s contrast the stats.

So at a time when hospitalizations for other issues with children and youth are falling 18%, they’re increasing by 67%.", "I don’t understand; we have these stats available, we have front-line health care professionals calling out for help, we have the organizations saying they’re about to go bankrupt, and it’s silence on the government side—silence of action. I implore this government to do something. We can’t wait any longer.", "I’m proud of our party committing $1.9 billion in new funding to mental health, matching the federal government’s $1.9 billion—$3.8 billion in new spending purely for mental health. A good portion of that will be going to build up our community sector so we can release the burden on our emergency departments. And most of all, our children and youth can seek the treatment and help that they need and deserve.", "This government is a failure on this issue. They should be ashamed of themselves." ],

Of course, my colleague has done a lot of work on the children and youth file, and this is part of her ongoing work.", "The motion is regarding the provision of resources for the estimated 12,000 children and youth who are currently on wait-lists awaiting mental health services. Truly, it is a disgrace that Ontario has underfunded community-based mental health resources to this extent. I know that there has been some good work done, and I’ll talk about that, but it needs to be work so that we don’t have this number of 12,000 young children sitting on a wait-list.", "We know that 70% of mental health problems have their onset during childhood and adolescence, and that’s a key piece of information. We need to prevent mental health from escalating into adulthood. If we acknowledge that 70% of mental health issues happen in childhood and adolescence—this is why we are talking about this wait-list. We’re not acknowledging that that needs to happen—the onset of help when people are seeking it.", "This government brought forward a Moving on Mental Health strategy in 2012. The Liberals gave themselves three years to transform the children and youth mental health system. Like I said, has there been some movement? Yes. But it isn’t effective, as we can see.", "They stated, most importantly of all, that the system must deliver early and appropriate help for each child and youth who needs it, and we still have 12,000 on the wait-list. Six years have now passed, and we haven’t come close to that. That hasn’t stopped the Liberal government from hiding their real record on this issue behind a very thin veil of platitudes. There are a lot of platitudes when it comes to mental health, but it actually needs to happen so we can get rid of this wait-list of 12,000 and so people have access to treatment as efficiently and quickly as possible when they need it.", "They’ve announced that they have invested an extra $10 billion since 2008 and are establishing a network of youth wellness hubs. That $10 billion doesn’t have a portion targeted towards children and youth, and the wait-list just keeps growing. That $10 billion is for the whole mental health system, which is a good thing, but there is not a targeted amount to tackle that children and youth mental health piece.", "The commitment to the youth hubs doesn’t include an increase to treatment services. I met with the Canadian Federation of Students yesterday. I’ll just read from their booklet here. They say, “On May 3, 2017, the Ministry of Advanced Education and Skills Development ... announced an additional investment of $6 million per year for three years to fund initiatives such as mental health hubs, peer support programs and counselling,” This is a quote from this book: “Though this funding is a step in the right direction, given the prevalence of mental health concerns among students, the amount of funding does not go far enough. In 2016, the survey conducted by OUCHA also revealed that 65% of students reported experiencing overwhelming anxiety in the previous year.”", "That’s the piece I think I am bringing out: that something is done, but these students—these university students, these college students—know it’s not enough.", "In London, what we’re experiencing is something very similar to communities throughout this province. In the summer of 2017, I met, along with my colleague Peggy Sattler of London West, with different agency chairs—about seven, I believe it was. They expressed that, for the last 25 years, very minimal funding has been dedicated to child and youth services for mental health. The services are bursting at the seams. The wait-list is so large, they can’t help all the children they need to. That is a growing need among agencies.", "What they told us—this wasn’t an ultimatum or a fear tactic—they said, “If we don’t get some funding help to address the wait-lists in our community of London, some of these agencies are going to have to close down and shut their doors.” That’s what they told us. This is how dire it is.", "Speaker, also, when it comes to London–Fanshawe, my riding, I can tell you that we hear from families who are beyond frustrated with the current wait times for mental health for their children. I have a family whose son has been in emergency at Victoria Hospital at least seven times over the last year, but he’s always discharged without an appropriate treatment plan. The family reached out to patient relations at the hospital, but they received very little help navigating an underfunded mental health system. They suggested that the patient’s family doctor refer him to a psychiatrist. Here’s the clincher: He doesn’t have a family doctor, which is another crisis in my riding. Not a lot of people get access to a psychiatrist because you need that referral from a family doctor and they don’t have one. The young man’s parents say that the various mental health outreach organizations refuse to deal with their son anymore because he is beyond the scope of their care.", "This young man has been experiencing episodes of violence, causing problems in public and coming home and breaking things. It got so bad at a certain point, he is now in conflict with the law. He was incarcerated briefly and his family was actually relieved because they thought that at least he’s going to get an assessment with a psychiatrist and perhaps begin some sort of meaningful treatment plan. That’s what they thought, and that is pretty desperate, when that’s where you’re going to get the help for your child in mental health. Their hopes were dashed when they realized that there was no discharge plan for him in the community to continue his mental health care, and no referral to a psychiatrist.", "We have to ask ourselves: What has our province come to when parents of children with mental health challenges are faced with the sure knowledge that the safest place for them could be the possibility of incarceration? That’s not right.", "We’ve heard the horrible statistics around the escalation and the increase of mental health—and then the awful results where people die by suicide. That’s unacceptable.", "The member from Hamilton Mountain, rightfully so, has brought a very important issue to this House, but we need to take action and we need to do better. I’m going to, of course, support this. We need to make sure we can clear this wait-list up so that people can get the health care that they need." ],

I want to begin by saying that I support this motion and I congratulate the member from Hamilton Mountain for introducing it. I know it’s been said before, but I think it’s worth saying again. I don’t think anybody said it better than the previous Minister of Health, Minister Hoskins, when he would say, so many times, that there can be no health without mental health. I think that very elegantly captures the need and the importance of mental health and making sure that all of the supports are required.", "We’ve done, as a society—not as governments, but as a society—a really great job of taking the stigma out of mental health. Having taken the stigma out of mental health, there has certainly been an increase in the number of people willing to come forward and say that they are living with mental health issues and they need help. We have done one side really well, which is to make it easier for people to acknowledge and want to seek help without stigma.", "We need to do a better job now addressing the demand side, if you will. We have to do a better job of ensuring that the supports are there, in place, because we have empowered people to come forward and say that they have mental health challenges—that it’s okay to say that, that it’s okay to want treatment. And, with treatment, people can and do get better. So I am really pleased that not only have we invested over $10 billion more in mental health, we have also committed to putting forward an additional $1.9 billion over the next 10 years.", "We also recognize that it’s not just enough to invest more money. We need to make sure that the system works for people. One of the issues, I can say as a local MPP, is that sometimes, even when the supports are available, it’s hard for people to figure out where to go, which door to go to. So as a government, we are coming forward with policies. We are moving on mental health and we have identified lead agencies in 31 of 33 service areas across Ontario.", "I think there is a philosophy underlying everything which recognizes that there is no wrong door. That is quite a bit of what Ontario needs to do and will be doing, moving from that idea, because people find it so hard, so confusing sometimes, to navigate the system. We recognize that, and that’s why we will be moving on a mental health strategy.", "Finally, I just want to take exception to the member from—what is Jeff Yurek’s—" ],

That’s investing in health care. There are so many examples of our investments in health care across Ontario, so I am quite proud of what we have done in the health care sector and what we will continue to do in health care.", "I want to end by leaving you with some examples of concrete change; for instance, 24/7 walk-in counselling services, so children and youth can get the help they need when they need it the most. Community mental health agencies are working with health and education sectors such as schools and hospitals to better coordinate services and supports. Youth wellness hubs are another new concept that we’re working on, and a special focus on the child and youth mental health sector.", "Personally, as an MPP, one of the things that I advocate for is that it’s really, really important for us to look at treatment options, making sure that people have places to go, but also to look at what we can do to prevent—sometimes; not all mental health issues are preventable, but some are. For instance, we know that loneliness and isolation can be a predictor for some types of mental health issues. What we can do to address those root causes is also something that is important to me as an MPP.", "In summary, I’m happy to support this motion." ],

For 14 years this government has made life harder for Ontarians. We see the proof in the rise, sadly, of mental-health-related emergency department visits. Madam Speaker, the Hanover and District Hospital in my riding was recently forced to hire police officers at a great cost to watch over some of the patients in distress, who are a danger to themselves and to others.", "Tragically, we are seeing the reality in the growing number of suicides. This is a crisis that is destroying entire families in our great province. It’s interesting to hear the member from Mississauga East–Cooksville saying they’ve done a fantastic job. I hope she looks in the mirror and does a double-take when she knows that she supported borrowing $25 billion for a very short-term hydro rebate, yet she is saying that they’re doing a fantastic job, with all of the gaps in mental health services across our province. It’s hard to understand that she would even say that.", "Consider how many reviews this government has had over 14 years in power, multiple capacity reviews and the Moving on Mental Health strategy, and yet no action. Luckily, there are organizations such as WES for Youth in my riding of Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound, and Bell Let’s Talk, of course, across the province. I’d also like to acknowledge the many local groups that are involved in mental health services in Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound, particularly the staff who pour their hearts out and bring their skills and talents to this.", "But there is more needed. How many more children and people have to die by suicide before this government takes real action to stop the crisis? More than 12,000 children and youth in Ontario are currently waiting to access mental health services. In some parts of the province there are shocking wait times—up to 18 months—at child and youth mental health centres, forcing many to seek treatment in hospitals. Since 2006-07, there has been a 63% increase in emergency department visits and a 67% increase in hospitalizations for Ontario children and youth with mental health issues.", "I just met with some folks from the universities, who, again, were sharing with me that on their campuses, they’re very concerned about the lack of services that are actually there for people in mental health situations.", "When children receive treatment in hospitals, they are stabilized, kept for a few days and then discharged, only to wait in long lines for treatment at a child and youth mental health centre. In many cases, they go home empty-handed, with nothing, really, to fall back on. Tragically, some youth will die by suicide, waiting for treatment.", "Gaps in access to mental health services is one of the Liberals’ big broken promises. Their announcement just last month included a mere 61 new mental health beds. What I want to know is: How does that help the 12,000-plus kids and countless adults on a wait-list?", "Here’s what the government did get right: They created a hashtag called #kidscantwait. That is true; kids cannot wait. But a hashtag is not going to fix the youth mental health crisis they have ignored. It’s not going to fix the crisis any more or better than the 61 beds they announced last month to deal with the 12,000 kids languishing on the wait-list. Again, it’s about priorities, Madam Speaker.", "Here are some quotes from the pre-budget hearings on this issue:", "“It has gotten to the point that, on our campus, if you want access to a psychologist or a psychiatrist, the psychologist is a four-week wait, but for a psychiatrist, you’re looking at months. For my friend who booked an appointment with a psychiatrist in November, they can’t access a meeting until April.” That’s Roch Goulet, OUSA member.", "Another: “We have called for investment each and every year with little response by government. We’re losing too many kids from suicide. It’s way past time to act.” That’s Kim Moran from Children’s Mental Health Ontario.", "That is why our party has called on the government to make the largest mental health investment in our province’s history—$1.9 billion in additional new funding—to make sure we close the gap in mental health services in Ontario. It’s time to treat and fund mental health and addictions care like physical health care in Ontario.", "Madam Speaker, I can’t say it enough: We have to take action. When you are in distress and pick up the phone and you hear that there is going to be a four-month wait, that is horrendous and not acceptable for the great province of Ontario." ],

It was conducted by the Auditor General of Ontario. This audit found that wait-times are a substantive public health issue and that the Ontario government has not allocated sufficient resources to meet the needs of the growing number of children and youth seeking treatment. It is no wonder, Speaker, that there has been a 50% rise in the hospitalization of children and youth with mental health problems.", "During question period on February 20 of this year, in response to a question from the Leader of the Opposition on mental health services, the Premier had this to say: “I am the first to agree that there is more that we need to do to make sure that there’s coordination of services, to make sure that there are more services in terms of counselling and professionals.” The reality is that the growing mental health needs of children and youth have not been a priority for the government. They simply haven’t. They’ve had 15 years to address this crisis, and as we’ve heard, they’ve failed miserably.", "Earlier speakers have cited a $1.9-billion investment to build a comprehensive mental health system on behalf of the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party. Among other areas, these funds would be used to make targeted investments into youth and children’s mental health services across the province to reduce wait times for services, as we should. These funds would also include topping up elementary and secondary school supports for improving mental health and well-being, including funding awareness campaigns and investing in suicide prevention counselling.", "Speaker, it’s time for Ontario to replace fragmented mental health services with a comprehensive approach to help our most vulnerable children and youth. It’s time that mental health issues get the same attention and prioritization as physical health. It’s time to ensure that Ontario’s children and youth no longer have their well-being put at risk due to lengthy wait times and chronic underfunding.

These girls came together and they had to pitch what issue they wanted their government to focus on. They decided to focus on youth suicide prevention. After they chose that issue as the topic for their government, they did some research, and I can tell you, Speaker, that they were absolutely shocked to read from Children’s Mental Health Ontario that there are 12,000 young people on a waiting list for children and youth mental health services. These young girls knew from hearing their colleagues and from looking at what is going on in their community that services for children’s mental health are in crisis in this province.", "I want to quote from a letter that the member for London–Fanshawe, the member for London North Centre and I received last summer. This is a letter from seven agencies that provide services for children and youth mental health. They said that they wanted to express their “shock and disappointment in a provincial budget ... that provided no new funding to community children and mental health services.”", "They said, “We are not heading toward a crisis, we are there now.... Neglecting mentally ill children and youth when they are in the community and could be helped, only to spend money on them once their conditions have worsened to the point of an expensive hospital visit is not an outcome of diligent financial governance. Money aside, this is an unacceptable way to treat our children and their families.”", "Speaker, we know that since 1992, there have been only two base funding increases for children and youth mental health centres. There were no increases under the Conservative government, and there have been only two increases under the Liberals, and nothing for the last 12 years. These agencies are struggling just to stay afloat. When I met with the boards of directors of these agencies in my community, they said their monthly board meetings are about, “Can we keep our doors open? What services do we have to cut next that are going to affect the children, youth and families who live in our community?”", "In the last two years alone, London had a 23% increase in children’s mental health crisis intake—almost one quarter of these children who are going to the doors of our agencies where services are being cut—almost one quarter of these young people were planning or had already attempted suicide. In 2016, London police dealt with almost 500 incidents related to youth mental health crises. That was more than double the number that they had dealt with in 2010.", "Speaker, I look forward to supporting this motion." ],

I’m glad that they support my motion. I’m glad that they see that we need to do this. But, Speaker, they hold the purse and they have underfunded this ministry and this sector for years—and the Conservatives before them—because the base funding for these facilities has been 25 years with only two very small increases. Both of those parties talked about their commitment of $1.9 billion over 10 years. Children’s Mental Health Ontario alone says that they need $1.3 billion over those same 10 years just to deal with our children. So when they put in their $1.9 billion—that is fantastic; it’s over the lifespan of a person from child to death who needs services in mental health and addictions—but it’s not near enough.", "We need to get back to the root of things. We are never going to be able to correct our societies, to be able to ensure that people have healthy lives as adults, if we’re not taking care of them as children. We have underfunded them for so many years that every single part of the sector is now in a crisis.", "They talk about Moving on Mental Health.

I am glad that people are recognizing Brampton for what it is: a city with lots of pride and potential.", "But the real growth, Madam Speaker, will be led by young people. As I said, Brampton’s youth population is expected to grow by 20% by 2035. So, as the government, we have a responsibility to these young people to support them, to protect them and help them grow in the best possible ways. The actions this government has taken have done exactly that.", "Just look at OHIP+, the largest expansion of medicare in a generation.

OHIP+ benefits more than four million children and youth in the province. That’s a big savings for families in my riding of Brampton West and across the province. It provides that much-needed peace of mind for parents and young people who rely on prescription medications.", "But access to health care and medication is just one way we’re supporting the growing young community in Brampton. We also want them to grow up to get good, well-paying jobs that are being created every day, but as we all know, what these jobs look like is changing. More and more, they’re in science, mathematics, engineering and technology, so we need to make sure that young people have access to the training and education they need to succeed in these types of roles. That means connecting them with Ontario’s world-class post-secondary education system and getting that education in the community they love so much.", "This government made a commitment to the people of Brampton. We made a commitment to build a university campus in the city, one that will offer Brampton residents programs and courses that provide them with the skills they’ll need to find good, well-paying jobs. I’m happy to say that we’re very close to announcing more on the progress of that campus.", "I can tell the people of Brampton a few things about this project. First, we’re focusing on creating a talent pipeline for science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Enhancing an already talented and innovative region, tens of thousands of smart companies are already doing business in Brampton. By building this campus, these businesses will have the ready support of current students or recent graduates to draw from. We’re infusing arts programs in the mix as well because the challenges facing the province and the world won’t be met by any one kind of thinker.", "The second thing I want to share is that this new campus will help build a diverse and career-ready workforce. We’re looking for ways that business and schools can work together to create hands-on learning opportunities in Brampton. That includes more co-op programs, service learning, and placements. All of this takes learners out of the traditional learning environments and into the real world so that when graduates leave school, they have the connections and the training to find good jobs immediately. And it’s something we’re doing all across Ontario.", "Our government is investing almost $190 million in creating these kinds of opportunities. Our goal was to create 40,000 new experiential learning programs for students, but I’m happy to say that we’ve already created 70,000. That’s because schools and businesses recognize the value of hands-on training and they’re eager partners in creating more opportunities for people to get in-demand skills and in applying what you’re learning in this class to real-life situations.", "We don’t just want a talented workforce in Ontario; we want a diverse one. That means bringing higher education and training to communities that represent the multicultural backbone of the province and our country—communities like Brampton. Walking through Brampton, you can hear almost 100 different languages. By its very makeup, Brampton has the insights and ties to global markets. And we can capitalize on this by building up Ontario’s economy, both here and internationally.", "I’m very proud and excited about the work this government has done on bringing a campus to Brampton. But that’s not the only way we’re supporting access to post-secondary education for the people in my community. Access means having a physical space in your community to learn and grow, and it also means financial access.", "That’s why this government made tuition free for hundreds of thousands of families. This year, over 225,000 students are going to college or university for free. Many are people who previously wrote off higher education. They looked at the price tag and thought it wasn’t for them. Well, because of the actions of this government, we delivered a single message: university and college is for anyone with a desire and an ability to go. It doesn’t matter how much your family makes. The only thing that matters is your potential, and the young people in Brampton have a lot of potential.", "What has been great to see with our free tuition program is that it really is opening up colleges and universities to a whole new group of people. We can see that applications by indigenous students have significantly gone up since we introduced free tuition. We’ve seen that more single parents are going to college and university, with the majority of them being single moms, and, of course, we’ve seen many more applicants from families living with low or middle incomes. Our free tuition program is making education a reality for everyone.", "That means we’re building a workforce that is more fair and more inclusive. When everyone is able to get the skills they need to be their best and find good jobs, everyone wins. Families can support themselves, businesses can find the talent they need and the province is a more fair and prosperous place to live.", "I’m very proud of this government’s action on creating opportunities for education and employment for diverse people across Ontario. I’m glad that the Brampton campus will play a big role.", "There’s only one question to be asked: What’s the alternative? All of these investments will be lost if the Conservatives are elected. We know they have no plan to help young people. We know that, if elected, the opposition party will make billions in cuts. That means cuts to funding for things like upgrading our schools, hospitals, and social housing and building more transit. That means cuts to services like education and health care. It means job cuts.", "Sadly, students who are getting free tuition today will be under huge financial stress to pay for post-secondary tuition under a PC government. No matter who the leader will be, this is the same old Conservative Party.", "In conclusion, our government is proud to stand up for young people and make the investments that will make sure they have the tools required for the jobs of tomorrow. That’s why this government is moving towards the building of a university campus in Brampton. The people of Ontario need us to continue to make the right investments to build Ontario up. Building this university is part of that plan, and we’re pleased that young people in Brampton will take advantage of this great investment." ],

  "text" : [ "I rise this afternoon to speak to the motion related to a proposed new university site in Brampton, and I do so in my capacity as the official opposition critic for education and post-secondary education.", "I’ve travelled the province and had the honour of meeting with the staff and students from every university. What’s clear to me is that university innovation, research and entrepreneurship are the future of Ontario’s economy.", "Ontario’s universities have made discoveries and broken new intellectual ground that has dramatically changed and enhanced the way we live. Never before has the connection between the research being done at universities and the training of young minds in innovative ways been so intrinsically linked to the economy of today—the global economy.", "However, as competition in the global knowledge economy intensifies, Ontario will need to continue to innovate and adapt. We must continue to invest or risk losing ground. We must maintain and strengthen the culture of innovation on which our prosperity depends.", "The importance of what universities contribute is well recognized by students and those engaged in discovery and invention. The value of an education for the individual and the contribution of our universities to the social and economic vibrancy of our province as a whole is powerful.", "I look forward to advancing the contributions of Ontario’s universities for the good of students, their families, the betterment of Ontario’s economy and the communities we have the privilege of serving and representing.", "Speaking of communities, the motion before us today would emphasize the importance of these contributions and build upon them, recognizing that the city of Brampton is one of the fastest-growing communities in Canada and also that the province’s future jobs and prosperity will require students to have the skills and training in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.", "Consequently, the measures proposed by this motion would have some impact on alleviating the skills mismatch through Brampton becoming the home of a new university site focused on helping students acquire science, technology, engineering and math skills so they can thrive in Ontario’s knowledge economy.", "In addition to providing Ontario students with another option for post-secondary studies in these fields, the proposed university site is projected to bring significant economic activity to the local community. In an economic impact study conducted by urbanMetrics for the city of Brampton, it’s outlined that a proposed university site in Brampton will result in over 3,100 construction jobs and an annual operational impact of over 1,900 jobs and $308 million in economic activity.", "It’s also worth pointing out, Speaker, that some of the previous work that has been undertaken by Brampton’s committee of council, prior to today’s debate on facilitating a new university campus in the community, is underpinning this particular motion, specifically the development of both business and public sector partnerships for a science-, technology-, engineering- and math-focused university; an endorsement of an investment in principle of $50 million over 10 years; and up to $100 million in a joint-use community space to support a university campus space.", "These commitments and investments by Brampton’s council have together set the foundation for a new science-, technology-, engineering- and math-focused university campus. This is crucial, absolutely crucial, Speaker, as Ontario faces a growing skills mismatch, particularly in these sectors. In fact, a June 2017 Ontario Chamber of Commerce survey indicated that of the 62% of Ontario Chamber of Commerce members who attempted to recruit staff in the latter half of 2016, 82% experienced at least one challenge in doing so, the most common being finding someone with the proper qualifications.", "Speaker, this motion is timely, particularly as students continue to be unemployed or underemployed in Ontario, largely because steps have not been taken by the Liberal government to address the skills mismatch over the past 15 years. For example, the Liberal government has yet to implement the recommendation from the Premier’s Highly Skilled Workforce Expert Panel report released on June 23, 2016.", "Over a year and a half later, the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party believes it is every young person’s aspiration to become successful as an adult, and often an effective route to that success is by receiving a high-quality post-secondary education.", "The motion being debated this afternoon recognizes the importance of post-secondary education in relation to the needs of Ontario’s future jobs and economy. I’m inspired by how students look at the world. Our students see the world in a variety of different ways and perspectives. They are the driving force behind the work I do as the official opposition critic for education and post-secondary education every day, every week, every month, every year. I believe in the intrinsic importance and value of what universities do, and that’s why I’ll be supporting the motion from the member for Brampton West." ],

  "text" : [ "I am pleased to rise as the NDP critic for advanced education and skills development to speak to the motion before us today, that Brampton should be the home to a new university site: focused on helping students acquire skills in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.", "Speaker, we know that universities are critical to the economic prosperity and also the social well-being of our province. We also know that investments in university education have a huge return to the public. When you graduate an educated workforce that is able to go out and get jobs and pay taxes, there is a huge benefit to us collectively. In fact, the return on investment was recently estimated at $189,200 for each post-secondary graduate who enters our workforce. So this is a smart investment for any government.", "We also know that Brampton is the only top-10 city in Canada without a university. It also has the youngest population of any of Canada’s top-10 cities and sits on the innovation super-corridor between Waterloo and Toronto. So this focus on STEM and the efforts that are made to bring this university to that community are fundamental to the city’s economic development plans.", "Another key component of this project will be a joint youth centre for education, innovation and collaboration in downtown Brampton, as well as a new downtown library.", "Speaking of my own community, the city of London, we have seen—with Fanshawe College locating a program downtown, a digital media centre downtown as well as, soon, a tourism and culinary centre—that locating these university and post-secondary facilities in the downtown core can have a very positive impact on business, when you have students who are out using local businesses, going to restaurants, purchasing clothing and what have you. This is really a proven strategy to improve the downtown core.", "But we also know, from a study that was just released by the United Way of Toronto and York Region, that middle-income neighbourhoods in Brampton are virtually disappearing. We saw in that report that in 1980, 2% of the neighbourhoods in Peel, including Brampton, were considered low-income. As of 2015, 52% of Peel’s neighbourhoods are considered low-income. Brampton, in particular, has been hard hit by this income polarization that has occurred.", "The report notes that high- and middle-income neighbourhoods in Brampton have decreased at an alarming rate, and low-income neighbourhoods have increased dramatically. Much less than half of Brampton’s neighbourhoods have families earning $50,000 or more. So for these low-income families, access to university education where they live is very important.", "I heard the member reference the fact that his government’s reorganized system of student financial aid will help local students access this university education. But I also met, yesterday, with students from the Canadian Federation of Students–Ontario, who pointed out that only two thirds of post-secondary students in Ontario are able to benefit from the Liberal government’s program, which they like call “free tuition.” It is not providing free tuition for two thirds of young people in this province. So there will have to be a lot of work done to ensure that these growing numbers of low-income families in Brampton are able to afford to attend this university.", "I also heard the member talk about access to experiential learning opportunities. Certainly, we know from lots of research that work-integrated learning is a very important tool to enable new graduates to enter the workforce after they complete their post-secondary education. But we also know from the research that what’s most important about this work-integrated learning is that it be paid. There has been study after study done by the National Association of Colleges and Employers, which is a large organization in the US. They have shown, year after year, that participating in unpaid work-integrated learning is about the same as participating in no integrated learning in terms of transition into the workforce. It is those paid work-integrated learning opportunities that really give students a leg up.", "I will note that the government is expanding experiential learning, but nowhere in the government’s Career Kick-Start Strategy is there a reference to enabling more young people in the province who are attending post-secondary to get paid while they are doing their work-integrated learning programs.", "In fact, recently the government, in Bill 148, removed protections for young people who are doing work-integrated learning and who are studying at career colleges in this province. That means that students who are in secondary school, post-secondary school, public colleges and universities, and now private career colleges—none of these students have access to any of the protections of the Employment Standards Act, including minimum wage. When we are encouraging these young people to participate in these programs, there is a great danger that they could be exploited by employers who don’t provide any compensation for their labour or by employers who don’t have any regulatory obligations in terms of breaks or conditions of work.", "Those are a few of my comments on the motion. Certainly we support it. We recognize the value of a university, but we want to ensure that the students who attend that institution get the best possible supports to be able to afford the tuition and to be able to benefit from the experiential learning opportunities that are provide." ],

When I have a bit of free time, that’s where I go, because that’s where my family lives. My mother lives there, along with two of my brothers, my older brother and my younger brother, and their families. So I recognize that Brampton is a thriving, growing community in the GTA. It also is one of the GTA’s most diverse communities.", "We know that one of the areas that Ontario continues to lead in is the skills and the talents of our great people. We have one of the most highly educated populations in the world—the highest in the G7. A big part of that is due to our tremendous immigration here and newcomers who come with tremendous skills and talents, as well as our incredible system of education: both our K-12 system and our post-secondary education system, our great colleges and universities, as well as our apprenticeship programs.", "We know that Ontario’s economy is strong. It is growing, and we need to tap into that potential in our workforce, so that we can realize our fullest potential here in Ontario. There’s no better place to do that than in the technology sector. We know that our economy is changing. There’s innovation happening all the time, and Ontario has to be prepared for that.", "Our highly skilled workforce strategy is an area that we’re strongly focused on. It’s designed to meet people where they are, with the employment, the training and the resources that they need to find a job match in their chosen field. When it comes to investments that we’re making in post-secondary education, this is an area that we’re moving forward on.", "We have our Strategic Investment Fund. This is the government of Canada and the government of Ontario providing $950 million to enhance and to modernize innovation, training and research facilities at colleges, universities and indigenous institutes across the province.", "But, Madam Speaker, we’re here to talk about Brampton because the member from Brampton West has put this on the floor of the House today. I’m so pleased that we have already taken a number of steps to invest in this incredible community.", "Ontario is investing up to $180 million to build STEAM-focused, university-led post-secondary sites in Brampton and Milton. We’ve chosen science, technology, engineering, the arts and math because we know that represents the jobs of the future. We know that when we invest in the skills and the talents of our people, that drives innovation, which drives our economy. We want to create these sites so that they provide residents of Brampton and Milton and the surrounding area with easier access to post-secondary education within their chosen communities, helping to build the skills and the talents that we need right here at home.", "I’m very pleased to see the passion and the commitment of the member from Brampton West, recognizing that Brampton has a growing population, a growing economy, and that the investment of a university there will help to accelerate that and will help to graduate those with the necessary skills for a changing economy.", "With our rapidly changing economy, we know that many people need to upskill, they need to reskill and they need to keep pace with the changing technologies and practices.", "When I first started my professional career, I started off in tech. I worked with Bell Canada, and one of the responsibilities I had was, in fact, to connect the company with local communities, including Brampton and the surrounding GTA communities. We recognized that with the presence of technology comes acceleration of other companies that want to be co-located near each other. We realized that by having a highly skilled workforce, it means a workforce of lifelong learners, where people who are given the tools they need to adapt their existing strengths and the resources to bridge any gaps at all in our labour market.", "This is exactly what we need at this time, as we look towards the future. Madam Speaker, we want all of our young people and, in fact, those who are changing careers to thrive in Ontario’s dynamic economy. Focusing on our investments in the skills and talents of our people is the best investment that we can make.", "Let me be clear: Our post-secondary education system is one of the best in the world. It is recognized worldwide. I know that the Minister of Innovation recently attended a conference where one of our digital media innovation hubs was recognized as having the number one business accelerator in the entire world. That’s because of the investments that we’ve made in our post-secondary education institutions, in the technologies that are needed to set people up for success.", "We need more graduates of a diverse background. We need more women and girls participating in STEM, indigenous people, people of diverse backgrounds participating fully in this new economy, getting degrees and certified in STEM, because by developing our world-class talent in this area, Ontario is proving to be a chosen destination for innovative employers like GE. Amazon has just put us on the list of their selection list for headquarters. Reuters has just moved their head office here. Google is expanding its presence here in Ontario. The federal government has just selected the Toronto and Waterloo corridor as an innovation super-corridor.", "That’s just the beginning, because our institutions have a key role to play in ensuring that our students are graduating with the skills that are needed in this 21st-century economy. I couldn’t be more pleased to rise in the House and to support my good friend on his motion today to build greater supports in Brampton for post-secondary attainment in the area of STEM." ],

I’m fully supportive of the intent of this motion, but I can’t help but feel uneasy about it. It feels like déjà vu. Something isn’t right with this motion being in front of us at this time, just three months before an election after 15 years of Liberal government.", "I will talk about my uneasiness in a few minutes. Let me first talk about why I like what I read in this motion. The motion reads about Brampton being a fast-growing community, with the youth population expected to grow by 20% by 2035.", "I represent an area on the other side of the GTA. The area I represented as a Toronto city councillor, ward 42, comprises more than 50% of my current riding of Scarborough–Rouge River. Ward 42 has the highest youth population in the city of Toronto. More than 20% of ward 42’s population is comprised of youth—the highest in the city of Toronto. Ward 42 is the only ward in the city of Toronto where both the Toronto District School Board and the Toronto Catholic school board are building new schools. As a city of Toronto councillor in ward 42, we focused on providing more services for youth. We built more playgrounds. We provided more recreation services and programs.", "I understand the pain that the member from Brampton West is seeking to resolve. I can honestly say that in my part of the province, we are already where Brampton will be in 2035. So I’d like to see a higher-education facility in the Brampton area. I’d like to give youth in Brampton the opportunity to receive the appropriate education and training to succeed in the future job market.", "I came to this great country as a relatively young adult, 51 years ago, in March 1967. Before I came to Canada, I already had a BA degree in English from Korea. However, I soon realized that I could not find a decent job. It seemed that racial discrimination in Vancouver in the 1960s was very serious.", "After a long search, my first job in Vancouver was as a dishwasher. After a while of working tirelessly as a dishwasher, soon I realized that education is the key to success. In order to earn money for my future education, I worked in asbestos mines in British Columbia. In order to make enough money, I worked three jobs simultaneously: a mine labourer during the day, a waiter in the evening and a janitor in the middle of the night.", "I worked very hard to get my master’s degree in social work from the graduate school of social work at the University of Toronto, followed by a master’s degree in education and a doctorate degree in counselling psychology, all from the University of Toronto.", "In fact, higher education didn’t end with me. My oldest son, Raymond Jr., is chief psychiatrist at Lyndon B. Johnson Hospital in Texas after getting medical training at U of T. Ronny, our middle son, obtained his PhD in biochemistry at the University of Cambridge in England and completed medical training at Yale University. He is currently a plastic surgeon in Houston, Texas. Our youngest son, William, got a BA degree in education from McGill and a master’s in education from U of T. Currently, he’s teaching in Montreal.", "I could go on, but now I only have about 50 seconds, so I could summarize the points.", "Every young person’s aspiration is to become successful as an adult, and often, an effective route to success is by receiving high-quality post-secondary education.", "We continue to hear that universities and community colleges need the resources to be focused on preparing students for future success, in particular giving our businesses access to the talent they need for the jobs of today and tomorrow.", "That is why myself, and the MPP from Whitby–Oshawa, and all the PC caucus members will support this motion." ],

Having an investment in universities is something that helps grow the economy as a whole. Certainly in Brampton, given the large population, the very diverse population, this investment can be a really positive contribution to the GTA.", "I want to say, however, that there are a number of things that are going to have to be addressed by this government in order to have this university, should it proceed, be successful in the way that we need it to proceed.", "As the member who has moved this motion is well aware, increasingly in our post-secondary institutions, the faculty, the force that is teaching, is made up of people who have part-time, temporary, contingent employment, not knowing from one session to the next whether they will be employed or not.", "A friend of mine is taking a course this year at George Brown in downtown Toronto, and one of her teachers was hired the week that the course started. That woman was scrambling in the first month to make sure that she had all the material for her students.", "I think it’s a good idea to have a university, but I also think it’s a good idea to have the funding in place and the policies in place so that you have a stable workforce that knows what it’s going to be teaching in the session to come and the year to come, if you actually want to have the kind of quality that we require. I think this is one issue that’s going to have to be addressed.", "The other issue that was addressed by my colleague was the smoke and mirrors around funding for students going into university: the language that the Liberal government uses of “free tuition” that applies to one third of the population. Speaker, we aren’t interested in just ensuring that one third of the population gets covered; we want the whole population to be able to access post-secondary education.", "If the member wants this university to be a success—and I have no doubt that he does—he should be pressing for those changes in human resources so that we have long-term, stably employed faculty who have a deep grounding in the issues that they’re presenting and the time to prepare so that students get maximum value. We need funding for post-secondary education so that students are not excluded because they don’t have the cash. Those things, I think, are going to be critical for the success of any institution.", "In my remaining time, I want to note something that my colleague didn’t have a chance to get at, and that is that although science, technology, engineering and mathematics are really critical in building this world, too often, if that is the only lens through which you see the world, you don’t catch the whole picture. I would urge the member to look at ensuring that humanities are also part of this university. In so many ways, engineering is extraordinarily capable of focusing in on a very narrow problem, solving that problem—ones that we need solved—and moving on, but if you want to see the world as a whole, if you’re operating within the broader context of human society, geographically and over time, you need a much wider perspective. That’s why I think it would be useful to have humanities as part of the focus of this university." ],

Premier Kathleen Wynne has often referred to the fact that our people are our greatest assets. For that matter, for every nation, for every country, its greatest assets are the people. That’s why this government has been investing in our young people, in particular, since we came into office in 2003. We have increased the capacity of our universities and colleges by more than 200,000 since we came into office, through very historic investments—capital investments in our universities and colleges, as well as by increasing their operating budgets over the years.", "Madam Speaker, the city of Brampton is one of the major hubs for high technology in the province of Ontario, along with various other hubs we have; for example, Toronto, Kitchener-Waterloo and Ottawa. In particular, I would like to mention two major industries in Brampton. One is the aerospace industry, and the other one is the medical devices industry.", "These two industries are huge in terms of their potential in the world, in terms of sales and marketing and their contributions to our economy, as well as to exports of products and services from Ontario. For that reason, this government, under Premier Wynne, has decided to expand university campuses across the province of Ontario. We decided to establish three university campuses in the province of Ontario. The first one was decided to be in Markham, in collaboration with York University and Seneca College. And of course, the cities of Brampton and Milton are the choices for the next two campuses.", "We are increasing the number of STEM—science, technology, mathematics and engineering—students in our universities, from 40,000 graduates, as we have today, to 50,000 in the next five years to come. This is going to be a 25% increase in the number of engineers and scientists we are going to graduate, because the demand for engineers and scientists in our society is quite high.", "But I would agree with the member from Danforth that we need to pay attention to humanities, as well—which we do.

Wherever that bill is sent to, it would be hoped that some of those recommendations that are provided by both lay people and experts could be implemented into the bill at third reading. That’s the way you improve legislation. And the bill would be debated—" ],

The government is basically saying, “We are putting forward a bill”—they call it a procurement bill; it’s a retaliatory bill on Buy American, which might have a place.

We don’t care.” They really don’t care what anyone else in the province believes.", "I’m sure if there were committee hearings held, you would see representatives of workers come to talk about how this bill could impact people, you would see the chamber of commerce come, you would see all kinds of people—perhaps the steel companies would come; I don’t know who would come.

Basically, that money is going into a slush fund. We have no idea how it’s being spent or the accounting, much like the special purpose account in the hunting and angling community that they have where they collect the fees from hunters and anglers in the province and put it into a special purpose fund, which the past Progressive Conservative Party created. That money is to go into hunting and fishing resources throughout the province. Unfortunately, what we found is the government of the day is spending that money outside of those provisions.

It’s quite unfortunate. Hunters and anglers are seeing their fees go up—they’re getting an extra $2 fee—and all that money should be going into resource management. And what is this government doing with that money? They’re spending it outside what the act clearly specifies on how it should be spent.

Hunters and anglers do it so the resource is strong so they can continue with their activities.", "What should be done with the special purpose account, which this government is not transparent about, is to ensure that it’s truly spent on fishing and wildlife resource management. This government has destroyed the moose population in northern Ontario. The fishing opportunities have become less and less. In fact, I’ve tried to get the walleye or pickerel season reopened on the Thames River. The government had shut it down. They were only supposed to shut it down for six months to do a study—over 10 years ago. They haven’t done the study yet, and they’ve kept it shut down. That alone is restricting the fishing on the Thames River, but it’s also affecting the local economy. There are a lot of bait and tackle stores throughout the area that would do a tremendous amount of business if they were to actually open that fishing opportunity again. Those small businesses pay taxes. Those small businesses ensure that the economy is strong. They’re a local economy, and unfortunately, this government through its inaction—and we probably could have had this fixed because the fishing management zone was supposed to be created I think six, seven or eight years ago. I brought that forward and the comment from the Ministry of Natural Resources at the time was, “We don’t have the ability or understanding of how to create that fishing management zone.”", "I brought it up numerous times that the anglers of London in southwestern Ontario wanted to open up the fishing opportunities again on the Thames River, and unfortunately, because they don’t have the fishing management zone to do so, this government has stopped the progression of that opportunity.", "Now, after I forget how long—I said six, seven or eight years; it could be 10 years, knowing this government—they decided to look toward making that fishing management zone. I don’t know why it took so long or why this government doesn’t have a care for southwestern Ontario and their needs and wants. It’s unfortunate. Hopefully they can go forward.", "We’re asking to the walleye fishing again on the Thames River and we’re looking for some transparency and openness on this special purpose account—some $70 million a year which is unaccounted for.

In 15 years in power, my goodness, you’re looking at over a billion dollars unaccounted for by this government to look over resource management.", "What are you seeing?

To help with the climate, you obviously would like fewer cars on the road. I don’t know if their way of getting cars off the road is to jack up auto insurance rates so people can’t afford it, especially in rural and northern Ontario, where the only modes of transportation are the cars.

The other ones are, unfortunately, unable to do so, so their infrastructure has to be built with their local tax base.", "It’s quite unfortunate that this government doesn’t realize that for rural municipalities and northern municipalities, their transportation systems are the roads and they do need the support. This government has cut the OMPF funding for 10 years, and it has really hurt the municipalities, causing them, obviously, to forgo necessary infrastructure projects." ],

Unfortunately, the government is closing 600 of those schools instead of reusing them for better purposes, which is hurting our climate.", "It is terrible when small municipalities with one school in them are going to have to be shutting them down. They could be used for community centres. What they’re doing is breaking the backs of these communities. They are, unfortunately, causing these communities to bus their students, which is only adding to the pollution. I mean, I have students now who are on the bus for over an hour. Can you imagine the pollution?", "And that goes to what this government has done to independent school bus operators. They have made changes, and independent operations in small rural communities are going out of business because this government has decided they want to support the big conglomerates and are putting them out with these long tenders. Unfortunately, at the end of the day, competition will decrease. It’s only adding to the cost to the system later.", "Because of this government’s action, which they think is for climate change, we’ve got closed rural schools, we’ve got decreased small business owners because of the buses, and we’ve got auto insurance rates that are soaring through the roof. I’m sorry, Madam Speaker; this government has been a failure with their policies for the last 15 years, including the climate policy.", "I hope this government takes this motion for what it really is and maybe substitutes it with something more substantive in this Legislature.

We have some severe reservations, however, regarding whether some of the policies that the Liberal government has in place are actually the most effective way to combat climate change.", "We agree with the principle of cap-and-trade. Actually, our party voted for cap-and-trade. But we also, in the committee stage, put forward amendments that we would, once we form government, reinsert into the climate change agenda.", "One of those: In the California legislation on which the Ontario legislation is based, 25% of the funds that are generated by the cap-and-trade auction system are specifically directed to communities that will not be able to compete under the new regime. That is law in California. The NDP put forward exactly the same amendment to the Ontario legislation, and the Wynne Liberals voted it down.", "They really don’t seem to care about communities that can’t compete—and there will be communities that can’t compete. Take northern Ontario. We don’t have transit in most places. We have no chance for public transportation. Our climate is much colder. People have to drive to and from work. People have to drive to and from medical appointments. They have to drive all the time. They are not going to be able to compete, and the government of the day, the Wynne government, ignored that. That is an example of why the cap-and-trade system needs to be drastically changed.", "Another thing that should be changed in the cap-and-trade system of the Liberal government: We are unable to find an exact formula to prove that the money is directed for the maximum benefit of the climate. Now we have a program, the GreenON program. It’s a rebate program for new windows—a good program. There’s a rebate program for electric cars. But do we actually know the numbers, how much greenhouse gas, how much carbon is being eliminated by those programs? Because farmers could be doing something that actually reduces greenhouse gas more than electric cars. But where is that formula?", "There needs to be a formula where you can plug your numbers in that actually shows where you’re going to get the biggest bang for your buck. Right now, the climate change program by the Liberal government could just as well be influenced by where you get the biggest bang for the votes, because we don’t know. There is no public formula. If there is, I hope the government would give it to us. Then we could actually work with our sectors, to work with everyone for the long-term benefit of the people, the long-term benefit of the climate.", "Climate change is real. It’s one of the biggest challenges we face. But we need to face it with our eyes open and make sure that what we’re doing is for the maximum benefit of the climate.", "Two more points: If this government was really serious about climate change in the whole province, then why do they still refuse to bring back passenger rail to northern Ontario? You’re forcing everyone into cars because you made a decision to kill passenger rail in 2012. You’re unwilling to look at it, regardless of how many cars you’re forcing on the road—" ],

The Conservative Party—at the moment, their response to climate change is to ring bells. They are going to wait till we have flood sirens, till we have emergency bells, and then they’re going to wonder what happened.

The results of that trade were made public yesterday. The auction was a sellout—a sellout. It raised $471 million in proceeds.", "What this has gone on to demonstrate is that business is confident in the market, and the market is functioning as designed. That’s what we have been saying all along in front of the naysayers on the opposite side of this chamber. We have seen that business, as well as the experts, agree. They agree that cap-and-trade is the very best way to put a price on carbon, and carbon is what we have to deal with.", "In fact, in January, the independent—and I stress “independent”—Environmental Commissioner of Ontario said that Ontario’s linked cap-and-invest program “will save almost all of us money,” and that jurisdictions around the world are choosing cap-and-trade systems like Ontario’s because they have much lower costs than any other competing system to deal with carbon.", "Ontario and California and Quebec, in this joint undertaking, have become models for other jurisdictions around the world. That’s good for Ontario, because all of those businesses realize that Ontario has got it right. The program not only reduces pollution, but it also lowers various costs of production.", "I want to stress this again: Third-party experts and businesses alike have expressed their confidence in our cap-and-trade program, which the Environmental Commissioner of Ontario said—and this is a quote from the commissioner—is “best in” its “class” in dealing with the carbon issue.", "But the main focus here is not the funds. The funds are welcome, of course—$471 million. But the ultimate goal of this strategy is to achieve greenhouse gas emission reduction results.", "That said, Speaker, we are going to use these proceeds that I’ve referenced to invest in programs that are going to allow Ontarians to participate in really meaningful emission reduction programs and to charge their imaginations and to fund ways that we can make even more progress.", "Speaker, I want to also point out—and this is important to keep in mind—that 100% of the proceeds of our cap-and-trade auctions—and it’s by law, not by government choice—must be reinvested into green programs that help Ontario businesses and families reduce pollution.", "So there is no uncertainty about where that money is going to go, contrary to what they have been saying on the benches opposite—that the money is going to end up here, and the money is going to end up there. By law, that money has to be reinvested in green programs.", "In fact, last year, we were able to invest hundreds of millions of dollars into green projects like transit, electric vehicle incentives, and housing retrofits. These programs, these carbon reduction programs and emission reduction programs, help the people of Ontario to fight climate change and to save money at the same time. That’s the dual purpose: We’re making money and we’re reducing emissions. What could be a better strategy?", "Our plan isn’t just about putting a price on carbon and reducing greenhouse gas pollution; it’s about investing in Ontario. We’ve got the three elements here: We’re making money, $471 million; we’re reducing emissions; and we’re investing in Ontario’s future. By investing in Ontario’s future on these initiatives, we are creating a healthier society and a fairer society, where we’re all going to benefit. Even the members opposite who oppose this are going to benefit because of cleaner air, reduced energy costs, and clean and sustainable, new, well-paying tech jobs." ],

Certainly, as Minister of Housing, one of the issues that I was tasked with tackling early on in my time at the ministry was, of course, assisting social housing providers across this province in dealing with the repair of social housing.", "I remember, as a member of city council a number of years ago, when the party across the chamber was in power and had some interesting ideas about social housing. They were going to devolve it to the cities because that was going to be more efficient.", "The way that the Mike Harris Conservatives and their successor, the Ontario PC Party, or the Ontario party of cuts, proceeded at that time was—their idea of efficiency for social housing was, you announce that you will transfer it to municipalities in 18 to 24 months, and then you immediately stop spending any money on it. That’s efficiency. In essence, you abandon the housing stock immediately, you put no money in it, you let it degrade as quickly as you possibly can, and then dump it on the municipalities to deal with the fallout.", "In 2003, when the people of Ontario finally had had enough of that version of efficiency—this government has spent $5 billion on social housing since 2003, and we’ve actually accelerated it in recent years.", "Madam Speaker, last year, as a result of our cap-and-trade system and the monies that are flowing into the system to help support initiatives that will reduce the effects of climate change, we announced a program whereby we are providing $653 million for social housing repairs across the province. What that is assisting those social housing providers to do—in many cases, the municipalities that suffered so greatly under the Ontario party of cuts—it allows them to make sure that necessary repairs can be done in a way that not only fixes the deficiency but actually makes building the project more energy-efficient.", "Imagine you have a roof that’s leaking and needs to be repaired. You don’t just slap down some tar and gravel on it, the way that somebody might have done before. You add insulation. You do certain things to make that roof more energy-efficient, to better insulate the building, to give greater longevity to the building and its structure. You would do the same with the boilers and the water tanks that you install to heat the building, to heat the water. You improve the windows. Tenants might have drafty windows. They might have leaks around the windows, and mold growing on the inside of the apartment because of the deterioration that was caused by the Ontario party of cuts. We’ve given them the opportunity to replace them, but not just to replace them with the cheapest possible windows—something that the Ontario party of cuts might have deemed efficient—but with energy-efficient windows. So not only do you fix the problem; you actually provide a better living environment for the residents of that unit and you reduce the ongoing energy costs of that building.", "Madam Speaker, on this side of the House, we say that we acknowledge that climate change is real and that it needs real solutions. We have actually offered that. Through cap-and-trade, we’ve designed a system where those who pollute, or those who cannot yet quite catch up to reducing their energy consumption, buy these credits in an open auction. Then, that allows us as a government to set priorities for how we can improve the lives of everyday Ontarians and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.", "This is a particularly poignant example of where a well-thought-out mechanism for dealing with climate change can have a real impact on everyday Ontarians: by making their homes safe, clean and in good repair; warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer; and reducing energy costs for all. Madam Speaker, that is good policy. So when we debate this motion today, we have to acknowledge that climate change is real and that we have to take real steps and real action to do something about it. When we do that, we have the ability to solve other problems in Ontario as well.", "Madam Speaker, I can tell you that when we talk about climate change, one of the things that we know is a result of greenhouse gas emissions is that our climate has become less stable, that extreme weather is not as rare an occurrence as it used to be and that it’s actually becoming more of a norm to expect extremes: extremes of hot, extremes of cold, extremes of rain, snow or drought. We’re seeing this. We’ve had a bit of a peculiar winter here in Ontario this year so far—certainly in southern Ontario. We’ve had far more snow than we’ve seen in decades, and then we saw a sudden warming. Then we saw a lot more rain than would be normal at this time of year. Communities in southwestern Ontario have unfortunately seen the results of that, with extreme flooding and, very sadly, the loss of a young life.", "We, as elected officials on all sides of this House, have to make note of that. We have to make note of this, and we have to build new infrastructure in our communities to be more resilient, because while our efforts to reduce the impact of climate change are good and strong, it’s going to take a long time to really have an impact. Human activity over the last few hundred years, and certainly over the last 100 years, has had an immense impact on our planet. So as we try to take steps to counteract that, as long as it took to create some of the problems, it’s going to take just as long, or longer, to begin to undo them.", "As we build this more resilient infrastructure, we need to pay for it. So again, by having a mechanism to collect funds that stem from the use of energy, they can be reinvested back into reducing the use of energy and can help build the infrastructure that we need—" ],

  "text" : [ "And good luck, Soo. Bless you.", "The history of the bill: This bill has been incubating for a very, very long time—well before the last general election. I recall, Speaker, that the Ministry of Tourism, Culture and Sport began work on two trails-related projects in the fall of 2013.", "First, they began talking about the Pan Am and Parapan trails, which were supposed to be completed in time for the Pan Am Games in the summer of 2015. The idea behind these was to close some of the many gaps in Ontario’s Trans Canada Trail—about 250 kilometres in total. Once complete, we would have a continuous trail stretching over 2,000 kilometres.", "Second, they commenced consultations on a new Ontario Trails Strategy. I’m pleased to see that the ministry did reach out to consult with many interested parties and stakeholders, including aboriginal groups. The problem is that, nevertheless, the consultation and communication has not been as extensive as it needed to be.", "A new trails strategy is something we have needed in this province for a very long time. Also, we need the value of our trails as common public recreational spaces where we can absorb the natural world. The definition of trails includes hiking trails, pathways, snowmobile routes and more. There are 2,500 trails in Ontario, stretching over 80,000 kilometres. You have to walk around the entire world twice to reach that distance.", "Trails are not just for recreational use. In northern Ontario, people often rely on trails in the absence of passable roads or highways. We cannot neglect that, and this is one of the reasons this bill is so important to the north.", "This is an omnibus bill, as it establishes one new act and includes five additional schedules that amend five other acts: the Motorized Snow Vehicles Act, the Occupiers’ Liability Act, the Off-Road Vehicles Act, the Public Lands Act and the Trespass to Property Act.", "My colleagues will know that I’ve never been a warm friend of omnibus bills. Having said that, this omnibus bill’s objectives are coherent and consistent.", "The former Speaker of the House of Commons, John Allen Fraser, ruled in favour of the definition of acceptable omnibus bills as follows: “The essential defence of an omnibus procedure is that the bill in question, although it may seem to create or to amend many disparate statutes, in effect has one basic principle or purpose which ties together all the proposed enactments and thereby renders the bill intelligible for parliamentary purposes.”", "The schedules of this bill do indeed have one basic purpose: “To protect and improve thousands of kilometres of the province’s urban, suburban, rural and remote land and water trails network while encouraging its expansion.” To this end, this bill aims to “improve, sustain and encourage the expansion of trails by addressing liability, trespassing and crown land issues.”", "The purpose of this bill is reasonable, Speaker. You would find few members in this House in opposition to this bill’s objective. The question is of the bill’s efficiency and effectiveness. Being effective is about doing the right things, while being efficient is also about doing things.", "Does this bill do things right? In general I would say a qualified yes, but consultation and engagement in the communities that will be impacted by the legislation has not been extensive enough. This has created some major problems in northern and rural Ontario, most especially around the closure of some long-standing snowmobile trails this past winter.", "The parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Tourism, Culture and Sport said this past Monday that there had been extensive consultations, and gave some brief hints at that, including a mention of five regional sessions. For legislation that could have such a profound and specific impact on northern and rural Ontario, it simply isn’t enough.", "Our province is enormous, with a total area of over one million square kilometres. If Ontario went on its own as a fully sovereign state, it would be the 28th largest in the world. We’re bigger than Egypt, Nigeria and Pakistan. In fact, Ontario is more than twice the size of Thailand or Spain—really incredible.", "That really should put in perspective how utterly inadequate five regional consultations are for a bill that has its major impacts in rural Ontario. I can’t imagine the people of rural Spain being happy with one consultation session on the northern coast, another on the southern coast, and maybe, if they win the flip of a coin, one more in the western mountains. It’s not enough, Speaker, when you consider the size of this province and the distances involved.", "I will say that I’d be very interested in seeing the complete list of consultations, as it would give an indication of where this outreach needs to go next, and would help us demonstrate to our constituents that the consultations on this bill have been in good faith and not just limited to the usual stakeholders in the Toronto bubble. It is very important that people affected by this bill feel included in the process, because without that confidence this legislation will do more harm than good. I hope that the government will come forward and share that information with the opposition critics when the time comes.", "I’m encouraged to see that the legislation has been framed such that consultation is not a one-time affair. Subsequent to passage of the bill, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry will consult on a regulation defining damage to crown land and property. There will be consultations by the Ministry of Tourism, Culture and Sport on a process for recognizing Ontario’s trails of distinction, on a voluntary classification system, on voluntary best practices and on establishing trails-related targets. On a recurring basis, the ministry will consult on the periodic review of the Ontario Trails Strategy.", "This bill does have many right things with it, but some we have to look at. It promotes access and awareness of Ontario trails by making it easier for people to understand the trails available here, to understand their nature and their difficulty and by recognizing high-quality trails as trails of distinction. This is all very important, Speaker, because as of now, there is no coherent system province-wide to classify trails. Casual hikers, cyclists or ATV users have no way of definitely knowing the difficulty of a trail.", "This bill aims to establish greater clarity in the relationship between landowners and trail users. It allows landowners the option of granting time-limited or permanent easements. It’s just an option, but it will be very beneficial to many landowners and trail users. The creation of this possibility as a supplementary mechanism will in fact serve to protect landowners.", "However, Speaker, I will return to the question of easements later in this debate, because some of the omissions from the bill on this topic, as well as one questionable proposal, combined with insufficient consultation and communication, have allowed misinformation to seep into this debate and have really poisoned the well around the Supporting Ontario’s Trails Act. I want to take a lot of time to discuss this, Speaker, but I also want to talk first about some of the other aspects of this legislation.", "Further to this, the Supporting Ontario’s Trails Act creates more clarity around liability on the trails. It establishes that a lower standard of care applies to occupiers of trail property which are not-for-profit or public sector organizations. This applies even if there is an incidental fee—only an incidental fee—related to access onto or use of the land, such as for parking, or if a public benefit or payment is given to a not-for-profit trail manager.", "Another important change to the Occupiers’ Liability Act is that the list of lands to which a lower standard of care applies is amended to add portages.", "It is important to note that the standards of care themselves are not being revised.", "This is a very important change, because there are two standards of care in the province under the Occupiers’ Liability Act. The higher standard is that “an occupier of premises owes a duty to take such care as in all the circumstances of the case is reasonable to see that persons entering on the premises, and the property brought on the premises by those persons are reasonably safe while on the premises.” Essentially, this standard of care requires that a property owner or occupier protect a person entering his or her property from all reasonable foreseeable hazards or circumstances.", "If you are a landowner voluntarily offering access to your land to a trail organization or snowmobile club, then this is a demanding standard of care. It requires a lot of time and attention and creates a liability and risk for the landowner. It is a major deterrent to landowners permitting access to their land for recreational purposes. Who can blame them for that, Speaker, really? If they don’t benefit from people crossing their land, why would they want to assume the liability? It makes sense to me.", "The lower standard of care under the Occupiers’ Liability Act provides that the occupier owes a duty to the person who enters onto the premises “to not create a danger with the deliberate intent of doing harm or damage to the person or his or her property and to not act with reckless disregard of the presence of the person or his or her property.”", "The problem is that under the current statutes, there is some uncertainty over which standards of care apply to landowners who permit access to the trail.", "Subsection 4(3) of the Occupiers’ Liability Act states:", "“A person who enters premises described in subsection (4) shall be deemed to have willingly assumed all risks and is subject to the duty of care set out in subsection (1)”—that is, Speaker, the lower standard of care I just outlined.", "“(a) where the entry is prohibited under the Trespass to Property Act;", "“(b) where the occupier has posted no notice in respect of entry and has not otherwise expressly permitted entry; or", "“(c) where the entry is for the purpose of a recreational activity and,", "“(i) no fee is paid for the entry or activity of the person, other than a benefit or payment received from a government or government agency or a non-profit recreation club or association, and", "“(ii) the person is not being provided with living accommodation by the occupier.”", "The uncertainty in relation to trails has risen around subclause 4(3)(c)(i). To that end, the bill we’ll be considering today, the Supporting Ontario’s Trails Act, proposes to amend the Occupiers’ Liability Act by inserting a subsection to clarify that the following do not constitute a fee for entry or activity:", "“1. A fee charged for a purpose incidental to the entry or activity, such as for parking.", "“2. The receipt by a non-profit recreation club or association of a benefit or payment from or under the authority of a government or government agency.”", "Speaker, this is an important amendment, because it protects landowners and trail organizations that are not profiting from the trails, that are maintaining these trails or permitting access for the public benefit. I’m encouraged that this legislation removes this uncertainty in order to protect community-minded landowners, both because this is fairer and because it will encourage more landowners to permit access to trails crossing their properties.", "Outside this building, I’m not sure if anyone in urban Ontario has heard of this bill, leaving aside the minister’s staffers over on Bay Street and perhaps a couple of lobbyists. It’s not on the major media’s radar all—it will be. I give credit: There was one article in the London Free Press. But the lack of coverage is a bit of a shame, because not only does this bill affect urban and suburban residents, but our media should be covering stories of special importance to rural Ontarians. In this case, it hasn’t made the major newspapers’ priority list yet, but that doesn’t mean that it hasn’t made it into any newspapers. I may have missed a few articles in newspapers, but I have columns and news pieces on this bill in the Cornwall Standard Freeholder, in the Bracebridge Examiner, the St. Catharines Standard, the Pembroke Daily Observer and the Manitoulin Expositor.", "Some of the commentary has been well-informed. Others, unfortunately, have been influenced by the incredibly misleading statements and commentary put out by the Ontario Landowners Association. I really want to commend the member from Lanark–Frontenac–Lennox and Addington for speaking loudly and forcefully against this misinformation, because we know of his roots in this organization. The member said:", "“Bill 100 does not grant any new authorities over private land, nor does it infringe or impair private property rights. It is indeed unfortunate that the OLA”—a landowners’ group—“does not have people who are knowledgeable providing advice to them.", "“They’re suggesting that easements can be imposed on private landowners, and nothing could be further from the truth. It’s not based on fact.”", "I couldn’t agree more with the member from Lanark–Frontenac–Lennox and Addington. This misinformation has had some very detrimental effects already on people in northern and rural Ontario. We’ve had enough trouble with trust in government—much of it is caused by the numerous scandals surrounding the Liberal government—without people spreading patently wrong information and casting aspersions on constructive and well-intentioned legislation. We may as well close up shop and sell off the furniture here if people start believing that nothing can be done in this government or this building.", "As my colleague from Nickel Belt said a couple of weeks back, the way this bill is being interpreted is very problematic and is creating great difficulties in rural Ontario, but most particularly in parts of northern Ontario.", "A lot of land in the north is owned by private landowners, mainly farmers. The trails in northern Ontario are so important in winter. They are vital recreational resources for the people who live there, but they are also some of the biggest generators of winter tourism activity. The misinformation being spread has led worried landowners to cut off access to trails used for years—years—by snowmobile clubs and others. Agreements have been cancelled in Port Carling, in Athens and Gananoque.", "There have been problems all over northern Ontario, in Manitoulin and Nickel Belt, among other places. What happens to tourism in northern Ontario if all the snowmobile trails, ATV trails and hiking trails start shutting down? It’s not going to be good. It’s going to be ugly. It will be bad for a whole lot of businesses, recreational, food service, accommodation, gas stations, not to mention all the other jobs that are supported by the spending of the people who work in these businesses. We need to protect jobs in the north. They have been hit hard already. We need to ensure that the north retains a viable tourist economy; it helps to protect the northern way of life.", "This bill is well-intentioned. It is a piece of legislation that has been, if not needed, then desirable in this province for some time, to bring clarity and protection to the relationship between landowners and trail users and to expand the number of trails available in Ontario. It is something that I think needs some amendment at committee and certainly some very wide consultation, but it should be supported in getting there in this second reading at least. The NDP supports the objectives of the bill because we want to see trails improved, maintained and expanded. By addressing liability, trespassing and crown use issues, the legislation is targeting important areas to achieve those goals. It is good that this bill provides the trails community with improved and expanded tools to develop, operate and promote trails.", "It is important to remove barriers in order to connect and expand trails across this province. It is of great benefit to trail users and local tourism that this bill enables the recognition of trails of distinction and, for the benefit of local communities, the creation of a voluntary classification system and voluntary best practices. A classification system will also help users to find trails that match their interests and ability.", "The misinformation that has been spread about this bill has created fear, Speaker—fear. It has had some very negative knock-on effects for northern Ontario that need to be arrested now, but only the government has the ability to do this.", "I would like to see the bill move through the legislative process, but what I would like to see most of all is for the ministry to reach out to the public, explain what the bill is really about and talk to the people impacted one to one about their concerns, because trust in the government is probably at an all-time low, I’m sorry to say.", "If people start hearing that the government is effectively going to take the land, they get very anxious. They get scared—quite rightly, too; wouldn’t you? The government is not taking anyone’s land with this bill. There is an option in here for the landowner to grant easements—an option only, Speaker; not a law, just an option.", "There is a very long list of bodies eligible to have easements assigned to them. The bill sets out an eligible body as:", "“(a) the crown in right of Canada or in right of Ontario,", "“(b) an agency, board or commission of the crown in right of Canada or in right of Ontario that has the power to hold an interest in land,", "“(c) a band within the meaning of the Indian Act (Canada),", "“(d) an aboriginal community or organization prescribed by the regulations made under this act,", "“(e) a municipality within the meaning of the Municipal Act, 2001,", "“(f) a conservation authority established under the Conservation Authorities Act,", "“(g) a board within the meaning of the Education Act,", "“(h) a corporation incorporated under part III of the Corporations Act or part II of the Canada Corporations Act that is a charity registered under the Income Tax Act (Canada),", "“(i) a trustee of a charitable foundation that is a charity registered under the Income Tax Act (Canada),", "“(j) a prescribed donee under the Income Tax Act (Canada),", "“(k) a qualified organization, as defined under section 170(h) of the Internal Revenue Code (United States) and Treasury Reg 1.170A-14 (United States),", "“(l) a corporation created by statute that is a registered charity under the Income Tax Act (Canada),", "“(m) any other person or body prescribed by the regulations made under this Act....”", "This list demonstrates that the easements need not be granted to the government. The list of eligible bodies is quite extensive and inclusive. The easements may be permanent or they may be time limited. Schedule 1, section 12, subsection 9 states:", "“An easement is valid for the term specified in it. The term must be specified as a period of months, years or in perpetuity.”", "That means that it’s up to the landowner what he wants to do. That’s good, because it allows a lot more flexibility for the landowner and for the users, but it also doesn’t allow wasteful ideas such as a four-day or two-week easement hearing. The months provision is clearly intended to allow a landowner and eligible bodies to come to an arrangement covering one activity season, be it snowmobiling season or summer activity season.", "So whether an easement is perpetual or term-limited is the decision of the landowner. Let me make this clear: It’s up to the landowner, not these rumours that have been floating around that they’re going to take somebody’s land or they’re going to confiscate trails. It’s a load of baloney.", "Time for another water break. Jeez, Speaker, only another 38 minutes. I’m flying here.", "So too is the decision over whether or not to grant an easement at all. No landowner has to give any land away. No landowner will have their land forcibly taken. This bill is meant to reconcile the interests of the landowners and the trail users. It does that by providing a greater, stronger protective framework for both landowners and trail users, but that framework is of no use if people do not see it or if people don’t understand it.", "People have to communicate. As the member from Leeds–Grenville said earlier in the debate, the agreements reached between the trail users and landowners are very delicate.", "The interpretations of these arrangements are very delicate. All of us in this House, I think, have a responsibility to stand up against the spread of incorrect interpretations that are endangering this delicate balance and these delicate agreements because, if it isn’t stopped, then, trail act or no trail act, communities up north are going to suffer.", "I might have a tendency to say that the member from Leeds–Grenville might be just kind of creating a bit of a buzz about the negativity of this. It’s not negative.", "The Ontario Federation of Agriculture does not support every aspect of this bill, primarily around what they see as vague best practices for trail operators and what they believe are insufficient fines for trespassing. But they’re not against it, Speaker. We know that it has been a concern of theirs for many years now and that some of the members of the PC Party have felt the same way. The member from Dufferin–Caledon introduced such a bill in the fall of 2014, I recall. Despite not agreeing with every aspect of Bill 100, the Ontario Federation of Agriculture has publicly and repeatedly assured farmers that easements under this bill are “completely voluntary,” despite all the rumours that are being created by certain individuals.", "I think it is important that all of us in this House reiterate and clarify, clearly and loudly, and read into the record the agreement of multiple sources. I’ll repeat what the OFA has stated: “Section 12 of this legislation is clear that an owner’s decision to enter into a trail easement is their own choice and is completely”—I repeat, completely—“voluntary. The legislation clearly states a landowner may grant”—may grant—“an easement to allow use of their property and have the right to state the length or term of that agreement. That means Ontario farmers and rural property owners will retain a choice and should not feel obligated to enter into any easement agreement for recreational trail use” if they’re uncomfortable or they feel that they might have a liability, which they won’t, but some people are going around saying that all these things are going to happen. I’m saying it for the TV audience and I’m saying it for this Legislature: It’s a load of rubbish. It’s not going to affect them.", "To bring something concrete to this discussion—not that I want to be mistaken for a trail paver—I’d like to speak for a few minutes about some problems we’ve been having with trails in my community, difficulties that unfortunately this bill will do nothing to address. This is despite the problems having been caused at the provincial level.", "We have a beautiful beachfront and waterfront trail in Hamilton. If you haven’t been there, you really should make the effort this spring or summer to use it. The city of Hamilton and local communities invested years and years of effort and quite a number of dollars into beautifying this long trail, which runs right along the length of my riding, along the shores of Lake Ontario and on towards Grimsby.", "It’s not well known outside of the area, which we can safely say is true of most trails, but like most trails, it is cherished by the local community as a place to walk, cycle, jog, walk their dogs and get away from it all, right by the lake—a place to exercise; a place to relax. A few months ago, just before the holidays, Hydro One crews came in and started tearing up trees. They clear-cut the trees along the beach trail and sprayed herbicide all over the place to make sure the trees don’t come back. Great. Thanks a lot. Hydro One has left stumps of what was once a prized Hamilton attraction—beautiful trees. They cared nothing for our longest and proudest trail. There has been absolutely no accountability.", "As I said, the city of Hamilton had invested years in beautifying this trail for the benefit of residents and visitors alike. The city offered to maintain the trees along the beachfront trails at its own expense, but its offer was ignored, Speaker. Hydro One knows better. They’re clear-cutting. They’re cutting down trees they don’t even have to cut down because there’s some North American act, because years ago—remember the big blackout when, I think it was, a squirrel caused a big blackout in Ohio and knocked out half of the eastern corridor? A squirrel did that on a transformer in Ohio.", "Those days have changed. We’ve come a long way since then, but Hydro One now has to follow a North American line act where they have to clear out so many metres underneath or close to lines in case of ice storms or whatever. That’s understandable. Trim them way back. Trees take five to 10 years to grow before they become a problem. You could cut them back or cut the ones that are directly under the towers—it’s understandable—or the ones that may fall into the towers. I don’t have a problem with that. But you don’t have to cut 50 metres on either side of it. It also acts as a buffer for some highways like the Red Hill Expressway; now they don’t have a buffer from the noise because all the trees have been cut down. The neighbours are in an uproar, and they’ve even hired a lawyer.", "“But we’re Hydro One, so we’ve got to follow the law and do what we’re told to do.” That’s the way it is: “You’re out of luck. Tough luck.” It’s not good, Speaker. It’s causing a lot of aggravation.", "We may be talking a good game about trails in this Legislature. I think that the protection of our trails is something that members on all sides of the House can agree on. But what happens when our natural environment and people’s public interest in recreational trails collide with big money, hydro and their rules? Make no mistake, Speaker, now that Hydro One has been partially privatized and now that the government has taken great pains to remove all lines of accountability, Hydro One is big money, big say and big power. It’s not a public institution anymore.", "Not only are prices going to go up for our hydro, but we’re losing control over our environment and what surrounds the power usage and the towers. We’re losing more control, because big business can hire big lawyers. It may not be too late to save if the government corrects their course, but as it stands today, Hydro One is all about the mighty dollar.", "You see, Speaker, the reason why Hydro One has been slashing and burning the trails is that it’s looking to save a few bucks. It’s all about money. They don’t want to have to come in there every three or four years and trim. They want it for every 20 years or 15 years, so they don’t have to come back. That’s ridiculous. You’re ruining beautiful trees and the environment, because you don’t want to pay to come back and trim every five or 10 years. You don’t want to do that. For the amount you’re saving, the amount of pleasure that you’re taking away from the public is unacceptable.", "The Auditor General reported that Hydro One has been cheapening out on its vegetation management cycle, operating on a nine-and-a-half-year cycle, as I said, as opposed to the average three-to-five-year cycle of all its peers and everyone else. Instead of trimming trees selectively and responsibly, Hydro One has, under the watch of the government, allowed trees to grow wild for nine years—under the watch of this government—then razed them when a critical Auditor General report was looming.", "There’s no accountability, Speaker—none. Hydro One told our constituents to go to the Ontario Energy Board if they’ve got a problem. Good luck. The Ontario Energy Board told them that, thanks to the government, they no longer have any authority over these matters. It’s up to Hydro One. Wow. So any appeal body that we had is toast. They shrugged their shoulders. They threw my constituents back on the good graces of Hydro One. How did they make out? Not too good. The Ministry of Energy has nothing to say, because they say Hydro One is no longer a public institution. So you can sing for it. Have a good song, and so on.", "The circle continues, and all the while, Hydro One has been getting its red pen out to target any other trails they can find in my riding, like the one along the beautiful Red Hill Valley. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. Hydro One has not only razed the trees along the beachfront trail; it has sprayed large quantities of herbicide just a few metres from the shoreline. Isn’t that wonderful? You’ve got kids playing down there; you’ve got people walking their dogs; you’ve got other animals—creatures of our society, our world—being affected by these herbicides. They’re spraying it all over the place. I don’t know.", "I remember, Speaker, years ago up north, they were using—are you ready for this one? Like in the war in Vietnam, they were using Agent Orange all over the sides of highways up in northern Ontario. Are there long-term effects on people? Probably, and definitely on animals and creatures. Is there going to be a latency period for cancer? Probably. Lovely.", "It’s not just Hamilton, Speaker. The problem reaches far and wide. I know they’ve been in Guelph where they wrecked the Royal Recreational Trail, turning a tree-shaded walkway into a grassland which turns brown by July. It’s not too pretty. This may or may not be something that can be incorporated into this bill, but the Minister of Tourism, Culture and Sport needs to get a handle on this kind of reckless destruction. Put this into our trail strategy. It might be a good idea to protect some of these beautiful God’s creations. Make sure that our trails are protected from the carelessness and penny-pinching actions of both private corporations and public institutions. Demand an accounting from Hydro One of the similar clear-cutting of trails in this province.", "This government needs to find a way to ensure that instead of stiffing municipalities and local residents, Hydro One works in co-operation with them and uses responsible tree management practices to protect our natural heritage, amenities, as well as the integrity of our power transmission system in this province. These goals do not have to be in constant opposition. Trails are very vulnerable, fragile things.", "Interjections." ],

  "text" : [ "Well done, Speaker. Maybe they want to listen about trails in their area but they seem not interested. Oh, well.", "Trails are vulnerable, as I said. Trails are very long, narrow lines that thread through our entire province. All it takes is one anxious landowner to close a part of a trail to break that thread. Depending on the location, the trail could be permanently severed into two. Most likely, if one landowner is worried, others are too and they’re watching very closely. Pretty soon, you’ll have other landowners saying, “Hey, why am I leaving myself vulnerable when my neighbours are taking steps to protect themselves?” Then you’re cutting the thread in multiple locations, not just one. We may not have a usable trail anywhere anymore. It might be too fragmented, especially if goes through difficult terrain that’s not very accessible by good roads.", "We need to understand that there’s a pre-existing ecosystem here. The government needs to understand that. Even just the perception that this negotiated coexistence, a web of mutually beneficial but individual and distinct agreements, is going to be replaced with a hard legal framework will be enough to kill the ecosystem in our trail system.", "I know from our reading of this bill that this is not the intention—I hope. The intention is to allow for solid legal support to be put into place within the ecosystem where it could be beneficial for both landowners and trail users. This would only be reached through more individually negotiated agreements.", "But that is not the perception out there, unfortunately. Whatever we can say about good intentions, there has been a failure of communication around this bill in a lot of places. There has been a failure to shape the discourse, and the conversation has been running wild in ways that have been very negative in parts of this province. Unfortunately, some of those wild rumours are coming out of here, out of the people who are representing the people.", "That’s unfortunate because the bottom line is that we are supposed to give pertinent, good and straightforward information, and not feed into their frenzy—whether it’s the landowners or whoever it is that’s being negative about it—by standing up here and saying they’re right when they’re totally wrong, off-base, don’t know or haven’t read it. There’s no threat to any landowner on his land—owning it or government taking it off him.", "It’s really irresponsible for individuals to stand up in this Legislature and create havoc over something that’s not true. Whatever we can say about good intentions, there has been a failure of communication in more than one place. There has been a failure to shape the discourse and the conversation, and it has been running wild in ways that I can’t believe. Withdrawing the bill won’t fix that. There are amendments that could be made to improve this bill and clarify these issues. I would certainly support that.", "What it’s going to take is communication. Communication and consultation need to be expanded: outreach and a willingness—not too common with this government—to engage in a genuine dialogue with the people in rural and northern Ontario who are affected and worried by this bill. There needs to be a greater transparency in this bill and in the outreach. People need to have confidence that this bill will be of benefit to both landowners and trail users, that this legislation is a supplement to an enhancement of the existing trail system, not something new cooked up by the Liberals in their Toronto offices to destroy our trails. It’s not true.", "It’s not enough to engage with the lobbyists and stakeholders down here, either. Yes, the bill will affect urban trails, which are of enormous recreational benefit to the people of Toronto, Ottawa, Hamilton and other cities in our province. But the overwhelming impact of this bill will be in rural and northern Ontario, so let’s not pretend otherwise. That’s where it’s really going to play a big role, so take the committee hearings and the consultations there. Farmers and snowmobilers—who are often the same people, I might add—aren’t going to travel in great numbers here to Queen’s Park from Timmins–James Bay or Kenora–Rainy River or Timiskaming–Cochrane. They won’t be running down the 401 or on our 400-series highways on their snowmobiles—unless we can’t move. They probably won’t even travel in great numbers from Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound or Glengarry–Prescott–Russell, because it’s inconvenient and expensive for those people to come down here. They have to stay in a hotel; they have to stay for the hearings; they have to pay for gas. Take it to the people. Take it to the areas that are affected. Take it to the north and talk to the people who live there.", "I’m a firm believer, from any military experience my family has had, that if you really want to know what’s going on, you don’t talk to the generals or the captains; you talk to the guy in the trench. You go to the front lines. You talk to the people who do it every day, not the big guys who make decisions in glass rooms somewhere in downtown Toronto. It doesn’t work.", "This is a huge province, Speaker, bigger than 85% of the countries on Earth. Travel here is expensive and time-consuming. It is completely out of touch and insulting to rural northern Ontarians to say that they need to take time out of their lives and spend hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars to come all the way to Toronto in order to make their voices heard. And most times, when they come to make their voices heard, they don’t get the result they want, and then they go home even madder. That just perpetuates the poisonous idea that only Toronto matters in this province.", "People are coming to the conclusion that there are two provinces: the province of Toronto, and the rest of us. I’ll tell you, there’s a movement in the north. It’s almost like the old days of Quebec. They’re getting to a point where they want to separate. That’s how bad it is. The people feel that way under this government. It has to change. I’m not saying it’s absolutely true in every circumstance, but we have a real problem with people feeling that way. It’s not to anyone’s benefit on either side to divide this province. This is one Ontario, and we need to make sure that all Ontarians’ voices are heard equally and that they all feel like a part of the process and the decision-making. Ontario is Ontario.", "So if we have a bill sitting here that primarily affects rural and northern Ontario, then that’s where the hearings need to be. Unfortunately, to our great disappointment, the comments of many members of the governing party suggest that they feel otherwise and that they’ve done a marvellous job with their consultation.", "Speaker, I just have to insert something here. With all due respect to the government or other people in this building, people make decisions here—it would be like somebody over there who was a teacher telling me, after 30 years of experience, what goes on at a steel plant when they’ve never walked through the door; or like a bureaucrat in downtown Toronto telling me about Hamilton when they’ve never crossed the Skyway Bridge. You’ve got to walk in their shoes. You’ve got to feel for the community. You’ve got to know. How do we do that? You listen to the members from those areas who talk to their people. You listen to their ideas in committee. You don’t brush them aside and say, “We know best because we’re in downtown Toronto.” Sorry; that doesn’t work. You’re going to tell somebody who has never left downtown Toronto about the bear hunt—they probably haven’t seen a bear other than at the zoo. So I’m really, really shocked at some of the decisions that are made without input from the people who come from those areas.", "I wouldn’t dare to tell the member from Kenora–Rainy River—because I’ve never been there; I’d like to go there; I should—what’s going on in Kenora, and she probably wouldn’t tell me what’s going on in Hamilton. She probably hasn’t gone through a steel mill in her life. I probably haven’t fished on Lake Superior. I probably haven’t fished, period.", "When we start listening, in this Legislative Building, to the people who know their areas and know the people, this Legislature will work a lot better. And that’s what committee is supposed to be about: amendments to make changes. In my years here, Speaker, I sat many times on committee. Half of them walk out when you’re talking; they’re playing on their BlackBerry; reading newspapers. They don’t care. You want to get up and bang your head on the wall, walk out, phone the people—", "Interjections." ],

We’re lucky to be on the escarpment and to have access to the natural beauty of the Niagara Peninsula. We also have over 100 waterfalls. How many cities anywhere in the world can boast that—100 waterfalls? A great number of these are accessible by the trails.", "We have the Battlefield Creek trail, which is rich with history. It connects to both the Bruce Trail and to Battlefield Park in my hometown of Stoney Creek. This is a major historic site, as it was the location of one of the most important battles in the War of 1812. The British victory there was crucial in preventing US troops from seizing Upper Canada. Many of the members are probably aware that I’m a bit of a history buff myself. I participate in the re-enactments every summer.

It has some wonderful views of the lower city, of the escarpment and the former Hamilton Brick Works. We have Spencer Creek Trail and the beautiful Spencer Gorge Wilderness Area trails. Speaker, there are many, many more.", "Most people in Hamilton are aware of these trails, but the truth is that very few people have an idea of quite how many we have. I very much appreciate that there is a trails strategy in this bill, that as well as expanding the distance and the number of trails themselves, there will be a real effort to increase awareness of the trails and make it easier for people to access them.", "If we protect and expand our system of trails, we can open up even more of our spectacular landscapes and scenery to the public. This is a real public good we’re talking about. At the same time, we will improve our offering for tourists from both home and abroad. We have some of the world’s outstanding natural beauty here in our province. We should do everything in our power to facilitate public access to and enjoyment of it.", "The key word here is “facilitate,” Speaker; we cannot impose. Access to these trails is based on respect, trust and understanding with the landowners whose land these trails criss-cross.", "The crux of the question is how to provide and facilitate access to privately owned land. How do we promote that and facilitate that in a respectful and mutually beneficial way, where all parties are protected, where liability issues and ownership rights are clarified, and where we don’t create an undue need for the services of lawyers.", "Here’s an old Viking quote—that’s going back:", "“Kalf: We heard you took yourself away into the wilderness. Why?", "“Bjorn: I went to find someone.", "“Kalf: Who?", "“Bjorn: Myself.”", "Now, the minister is already quoted as saying this: “An easement pursuant to Bill 100, if passed, would be a voluntary agreement between a landowner and an eligible body or bodies. No property owner would be compelled to provide an easement unless they agreed to do so.”", "It is important that the government communicates this repeatedly, and that members on this side of the House do likewise in response to their constituents. But it seems to me that the concerns expressed by the landowners across this province cannot be eased entirely by spoken words alone. With all that has happened, the only way to reassure landowners of the truth of this statement is to insert clear language to the effect of this statement directly into this bill. We need an amendment that does this.", "Colleagues’ contributions to the debate: One of the benefits of having deferred my lead on this bill was the opportunity to listen to many more contributions than usual to this debate in the House.", "My colleague from Timiskaming–Cochrane brought his wealth of knowledge and experience to this debate on Monday. I think it’s very important that the government listen deeply to his comments as a farmer, a landowner and a snowmobiler from northern Ontario. It is doubly important because there isn’t an abundance of that experience in this government caucus. Proportionately more of the opposition members represent ridings seriously affected by this bill, and that needs to be recognized.", "Now, snowmobiling is both a practical means of transport in northern Ontario and a valuable tourist attraction. Northern Ontario is probably the best place in the world to snowmobile. But that isn’t just due to the blessings of nature, Speaker. As my colleague has said, it’s because of the very hard work of the snowmobiling clubs across the province that groom these trails and negotiate access to the trails with landowners.", "Sometimes I wonder if the governing party misunderstands the land ownership situation in northern Ontario and assumes that there isn’t really a problem because so much of the land is the property of the crown. Yes, it’s true that a lot of the land is crown land, but certainly not all of it. In well-inhabited areas, where most of the well-used trails are, much of the land is private. What that means, Speaker, is that very many of the trails in northern Ontario are on private land. The trail-use clubs, mainly the snowmobile clubs, negotiate access with the private landowners and obtain their permission to use their private land.", "As my colleague said, this opens up parts of the province that would never otherwise be seen. No roads go through many of these areas. Like some of the remote railroads in this country, such as the ones crossing the Rockies, these trails offer people an opportunity to see a part of the world that is otherwise inaccessible to the public.", "The private landowners don’t derive any profit from this, Speaker. They do it as good community citizens. They want to give back to their community and to their neighbours. Many are snowmobilers themselves. Of course, everyone gains when the landowners in a community participate in that sport. It’s the very opposite of the tragedy of the commons.", "Communities, especially tight-knit ones like those in rural Ontario, don’t operate purely based on laws. They operate by norms, by custom, by recognition, by trust and by goodwill. It can be very dangerous to a community if you try, without good reason, to impose laws to replace some of those informal mechanisms. Now, I don’t believe that this bill is attempting to impose legal arrangements such as easements on rural communities, but we have seen that even the perception that this is the case has upset the fine balance that keeps a community healthy and public-spirited.", "There are many good reasons why a landowner and a private trail-user organization might want to agree upon an easement as the best protective arrangement for both parties, and this bill facilitates that. But there will equally be a great number of situations where this is not the case, where the arrangements based on trust and mutual respect are enough and should be allowed to continue. This bill will allow them to continue.", "But people around this province are now worried that this is not the case. They’re worried that their agreements of goodwill will be converted into legal claims of one party upon the other. When that happens, when the seed of fear is planted, the trust that sustains these agreements breaks down. Again, no involuntary easements will be created as a result of this bill. I repeat: No landowners are under threat.", "My colleague from Timiskaming–Cochrane gave a great example of where an easement might be of great benefit to both a private landowner and an association of trail users. He got the example from the president of the Tri-Town Sno Travellers, so I’d like to recognize him as well.", "If there’s a farm or a piece of land that you’re going to go across and the snowmobile club needs to put a bridge there—and the bridge is a quarter million dollars right now—there’s no guarantee, other than a handshake with the landowner, that they can access the bridge after it’s up. If the snowmobile club could have an easement to get to that bridge, they’d have more confidence in their investment of time and money, which would improve the trails all over our province. The bridge would be more likely to go ahead, and both the club and the landowner could gain from it. The landowner could maybe drive his tractor across it to get to other parts of his property. There are mutual agreements that could work for both sides that should be looked into deeply.", "As he said, words like “easement” and “covenant” are trigger words for lawyers. The fact that this is optional is somewhat lost through that trigger, so we need a lot more clarity in the language and a lot better communication and outreach so that people can see for themselves and be reassured that existing arrangements are not affected. The cloud of lawyers and the possibility of losing power over your land are blown away. As for the options around easements, those need to be written and communicated very clearly as well so that everyone is clear about their rights.", "Now we’ll talk about assignment of easements. Something that many of the members and their constituents found problematic is the ability of an eligible body to assign an easement to another eligible body. There simply aren’t enough conditions on this, Speaker. This is the kind of provision that will have landowners dead set against this legislation. If a provision of this kind has to be included, then it should be conditional on the consent of the property owner. If no consent can be obtained, then perhaps in this instance there should be a provision for the parties to agree on termination of the easement.", "Let me read this problematic subsection aloud. Schedule 1, subsection 12(8): “An easement may be assigned by an eligible body to another eligible body, but the assignment must be in writing and must be registered on title to the land.”", "If and when the committee hearings and consultations are taken on the road and around this province, which is what needs to happen, then I expect you will hear a lot of opposition to this, and it is important to hear the opposition. We need to listen to the people it will affect and listen to the people’s ideas to fix the problem and make this subsection more acceptable to both sides.", "Alienation of rural and northern Ontario—and you would hope that if not out of respect for the people of rural and northern Ontario, and if not out of genuine desire for good public policy, the government might be persuaded to engage more deeply with these communities out of pure political self-interest because nothing’s going to alienate them further from this government faster than the perception that they’re ramming through a bill for rural Ontario designed in Toronto and that the only consultations they’ll hold or that matter to them are with other people who live in Toronto; that they won’t have the decency or respect to go and have open, two-way conversations with the people and communities most directly affected by this legislation.", "That infuriates people, Speaker. It alienates them, and it causes great resentment. And that mood is growing in this province. Every so often, we receive letters calling for northern secession. That would be awful. But it’s not just geographic. This government is going out of its way to alienate so many demographics and segments of the population across the province, and that includes people here in Toronto, believe it or not.", "There is a perception that when the government wants to make a policy, it talks to people in Toronto, it holds some sort of consultations here in Toronto and makes the decisions here in Toronto. There’s a lot of truth to that, Speaker, but I think we’re looking at this through the wrong lens. It’s not about Toronto as a place. The government is not talking to the 99% of regular people in Toronto. It’s talking to a very small group of influential people in Toronto with a particularly high concentration on Bay Street. It’s an old, tired government that is speaking to an echo bubble that is growing even smaller in diameter, and getting closer to the inner circle, a circle of powerful, influential and wealthy people.", "The ordinary person in Ontario doesn’t have a say in this government’s policy, whether they live in Windsor, Timmins, Hamilton or Toronto. It’s the big corporations’ interests and the top 1% that are driving many of these decisions. It’s a sad state of affairs, Speaker.", "Like I have said, this is a well-intentioned bill that we can support at second reading, provided that the government is willing to accept constructive amendments, and provided that the government is willing to take consultations on the road to communities impacted by this legislation. But the culture and—I hate to use the word—sleaze surrounding the government have created a deep distrust among the people of Ontario, and rightly so. Now they’re hearing about a bill that might take away their rights over their land. They’re willing to believe it, or at least consider the possibility, because the government’s track record doesn’t give them any confidence in its good faith or good intentions.", "Remember that the farmers and the landowners don’t gain personally from allowing access to their trails, so when they hear bad stories about the bill, they rightly get nervous, because they have a lot to lose if it’s true—a lot more than they have to gain if it’s false. It’s going to require very honest, good-faith outreach from this government to reassure private landowners that they have nothing to fear about this bill. I know it can be done because last year, when this bill was introduced, I had a very constructive, open round-table meeting with the minister’s staff about the bill. From that meeting and from the comments by the minister, I do believe that it’s a well-intentioned bill. But it’s going to take a lot of engagement and communication to reassure people around this province and dispel the doubts that groups like the Ontario Landowners Association have stirred up.", "Speaker, I see I have only a few seconds. This bill has a lot of potential, but as I said before, the people in this Legislature, especially the governing body, have to start listening to the people who represent northern Ontario. I wouldn’t dare to go into Kenora–Rainy River and tell their town council, their farmers or their hunters and fishing people what to do. It would be totally off base. Hopefully, when this goes to committee, the government listens to the people who represent northern Ontario. Then—just then—it might work." ],

I think he did a good job of raising concerns.", "I especially liked his points about consultation. I think a lot of the problems with the misconceptions with this bill have come about because the government didn’t do a very good job of consulting. They say they consulted with 250 groups. Well, they missed the Ontario Landowners Association. That’s kind of a key group that they missed. A lot of the trails are open because of our landowners that generously—they don’t get benefit from it, really; they just do it out of the goodness of their hearts, allowing snowmobile trails etc. on their land.", "I absolutely agree that we need clear language that makes it very clear that easements are voluntary. In fact, I have a letter from Bob Clarke, the president of the Snowcrest Riders in Gravenhurst, saying that they are having trail closures as of April 1, some that affect major bridges that cost millions of dollars to build.", "He says, in his letter here, “Mr. Miller, the landowners I have talked to want section 12 of proposed Bill 100 to be amended to include the simple wording below that Minister Michael Coteau has already stated:", "“‘An easement pursuant to Bill 100, if passed, would be a voluntary agreement between a landowner and an eligible body or bodies. No property owner would be compelled to provide an easement unless they agreed to do so.’”", "He says, “Add the above statement from the minister to section 12 of Bill 100, and we may address the concerns of the landowner.”", "I completely support what the member is suggesting. I also completely support the idea that this has got to be—if ever there was a bill that needs to be taken around the province by committee, this one needs to go around northern and rural Ontario so that those groups that have concerns about it can have a say and deal with that. I sure hope the government does that in this case." ],

He raises a few good points. The consultation and the engagement piece is very important. The piece about amendments that are already coming forward as we’re having this debate to make sure that the legislation reflects some of those practical, I think, solutions should be forthcoming.", "The problem has been, though, the last couple of times I’ve been in committee, none of these practical amendments that groups, agencies and stakeholders are putting forward are actually getting approved at a committee level under a majority Liberal government. Just this week in the budget committee, some amendments were put forward to address communication of budgets and policies that would have fallen under the AODA and would have improved communications for people with disabilities—those who are blind and deaf—and the government members voted those amendments down.", "A couple of weeks ago, a number of amendments were put forward on the PTSD bill, and once again the government members voted those amendments down. It’s fine for stakeholders to come forward, and it’s good. I think we need to travel the bill and make sure that we are reaching out to those people in rural and northern areas that are going to be affected. But if they’re going to put forward solutions that will make this bill palatable for them, we need to be assured that, when those amendments actually come to committee, the government members are not going to just shake their heads and vote those amendments down, as they did with the PTSD bill and as they did with the AODA amendments in the budget deliberations earlier this week." ],

I appreciated very much the passion he brought to it, but I would like to lay to rest this notion that this has not been widely consulted on.", "Starting in 2005, there was a whole series of consultations, with nine full-day sessions and 14 regional consultations. In 2013, 80 municipalities were contacted and 48 trail organizations, including the Moonbeam Nature Trails, Kawartha Trans Canada Trail Association, Forest Lea Trails Association, Eastern Ontario Trails Alliance, the Peterborough-Hastings Trans Canada Trail Association, Simcoe County Trails, Voyageur Trail Association, Rainbow Routes Association, Ontario Federation of Snowmobile Clubs, Kawartha Lakes Green Trails Alliance, the Dufferin-Grey ATV Club Inc., and it goes on and on and on.", "In addition, other non-profit organizations were widely consulted on this bill in 2013 so that we did get the bill mostly right. If there are to be amendments, let’s make sure they’re good amendments and not some of the spurious kinds of puffery amendments we often see from the other side.", "Speaker, we also had nine not-for-profit organizations, including the O’Hara Volunteers Association, the Escarpment Biosphere Conservancy, the Ottawa River Institute, Ottawa Riverkeepr—and so many more: the Ontario Federation of Agriculture; the Toronto to Algonquin Greenway. We had aboriginal consultations taking place. Let’s be clear, this has been widely consulted upon.", "I think there might be a great opportunity to hear more in terms of the bill and what the current bill looks like. I look forward to hearing from all across the province of Ontario on ways that, if it can be improved, we certainly would like improve it." ],

Believe it or not, in spite of the grumpiness, we can be hospitable.", "I’d also like to thank the member from Parry Sound–Muskoka for his insight. There’s the perfect guy to talk to. He probably rides snowmobiles. He’s from rural Ontario. He understands his people. He’s been here a long time. It’s because his name’s the same, but I certainly respect Norm’s knowledge of his surroundings and the people he represents. Certainly he would be beneficial to any discussions.", "Of course, my good friend from Welland is well aware, being close to Niagara Falls, that there are a few trails down there, too, and in Welland. Being a former mayor, she’s well aware of what people face, whether they be landowners or recreational groups.", "Now, my friend from Beaches–East York: Well, I have to say to him that he did rhyme off a lot of people. I’m not sure where the consultations took place, whether it was mostly here or in the particular areas he meant. You can have consultations, Speaker, but if you don’t listen to the people in the consultations—if you would have talked to all those people, who in the world would have put section 12 into that bill? That is the worst thing you could have done. If you were listening to all these people, you would have heard that, I’m sure, because the landowners have made it quite clear. So I’m not quite sure who was listening at those consultations or how many people actually attended them and came back.", "Thank you so much, Speaker." ],

I can tell you, having spoken to them on many occasions and having taken the odd family out for lunch, that they continue to do good, and that grows on an ongoing basis.", "I think at this point I’d maybe like to just briefly mention some of the challenges that are there, and then I will—I don’t think I actually read off which doctors were going to be here, or did I? Yes, I did. I did mention them.", "Down syndrome is known as trisomy 21, a naturally occurring chromosomal arrangement in which a person has three copies of the 21st chromosome. Approximately one in 800 babies are born in Ontario with Down syndrome.", "People with Down syndrome experience varying degrees of intellectual delays and lower muscle tone. Some people with Down syndrome can experience cardiovascular and gastrointestinal difficulties, usually in the first year of life. Having two doctors speaking to this today, they may wish to expand on that.", "But further, people with Down syndrome have faced discrimination in Ontario and around the world. Half a century ago, people with Down syndrome were denied the right to an education, were given inadequate health care and were placed in institutions where their life expectancy was approximately 25 years. People with Down syndrome are people first and share the same human rights as every other citizen in Ontario. They should be persons first and share the same human rights with every other person in Ontario.", "Advances in medicine and social movements challenging discrimination have improved the life experiences and expectancy of people with Down syndrome. People with Down syndrome are now living into their sixties and seventies. People with Down syndrome are active, contributing citizens of the province of Ontario. Children with Down syndrome are attending mainstream schools and are learning to read and write alongside their peers. Young adults with Down syndrome are attending college and living independently, and some are gainfully employed.", "At this point I’d just also like to mention another family friend of ours who had an infant son with Down syndrome. I know the family personally. It was many years back. In those days—as I indicated just previously—many decades ago, parents were encouraged to have their child in an institution.", "These parents with several children that I know kept their son and the other son that they had. The parents loved and treated Howie warmly for all of his life. He lived to be age 56. He died 10 and a half years ago. I remember him as a very special friend. He changed the entire family. The entire family belonged to Howie, and he belonged to them.", "I wish I had the time to tell you a story—he comes from a family rich in hockey talent, out of Oshawa. I can’t tell the story because it would take too long, but Howie, who had Down syndrome, was caught by the TV cameras the night that Bobby Orr and the Boston Bruins won the Stanley Cup because one of Howie’s brothers just happened to be the captain of the Boston Bruins. Howie wouldn’t give up the Stanley Cup. I’ll save that story for another day, but it’s just a precious moment when Bobby Orr has him on his knee and they don’t want to part. Bobby was a good friend of their family as well.", "I met a very special lady—my gosh, where does the time go? I met a very special lady by the name of Katherine. I spent an evening with her and her mother. Her nickname is Kassy. Her loving parents are Donna and Bruce. Kassy has two giant brothers. Her puppy is Tasha, a Maltese-Shih Tzu breed. Kassy just graduated from Clarington high school in November—grade 12. She’s very active in learning; she never stops. She has taken leadership training; financial training, referenced as Money Math; and the life lunches program, where you work with other students and help them. She has many great friends. She loves working with children, particularly Community Living employment support. She has first aid, CPR—I could go on for ever and ever; she actually skis. She skis at Brimacombe. I have to tell you, once you spend some quality time with that child—she’s a young lady now—you appreciate how great they are and how special they are to all of us. It was an honour for me to be with Kassy and her mother.", "Some of the other numbers that are very important out there are the number of babies that are born with Down syndrome universally across racial and gender lines, and that’s one in every 800 babies. The average IQ of a young adult with Down syndrome is 50, equivalent to the mental age of an eight-to-nine-year-old child. As you know, adults are generally in the range IQ-wise of 110 to 120.", "There is no cure for Down syndrome. We need education, proper care and awareness to show improvement in quality of life. According to the Canadian Down Syndrome Society, people with Down syndrome are now living well beyond 55; they’re completing high school, getting better jobs—skillful jobs—and gaining meaningful employment. The goal is to dispel myths, raise awareness and recognize the contributions that people with Down syndrome make in our communities.", "Further down the road: November 1 to 7 is National Down Syndrome Awareness Week. I’ve already asked my staff to commence working on that, pursuing any way that we could help to promote that. If that was the case—if possible—I would then approach the two opposition parties and ask them to co-author a bill so it would be that much quicker and more appropriate. It would be totally representative of this House.", "Something I should mention is that during National Down Syndrome Awareness Week there’s a Go21 walk held across Canada. It’s significant because people with Down syndrome have that extra chromosome on the 21st chromosome, and “Go, go, go” is part of their cheer, cheering people on and raising awareness absolutely everywhere.", "The very last thing I think I’ll say, Madam Speaker, is that I’ve heard different mothers and fathers speak. I’ve listened to them. One of them in particular said to me, “We’ll eat macaroni and cheese for the rest of our lives so it will allow for extra money for health care, for the protection and care of our special child”—loving care from very special parents. We should never forget that." ],

What’s clear is that in my lifetime, the understanding has changed so much, but we still have such a long way to go. Decades ago, it was not uncommon for families to protect children with this syndrome, but we’ve advanced so much, haven’t we, Speaker?", "Today, as they should, children with this syndrome attend school, play a part in the decisions that affect them, work, vote and contribute to society in a host of ways. Yet there remain many challenges that still need to be addressed.", "As an example, special services at home: Families can receive funding when their children are under 18, but those services end on an individual’s 18th birthday. Families must then apply for new funding through the Passport program, which still has wait-lists. Some children with Down syndrome may require extra supports at school, but the special education funding formula is not meeting the requirements of special-needs students, and educational assistants have been let go across provincial school boards, as an example.", "My good friend Mark Wafer, a resident of my riding of Whitby–Oshawa, for many years has played a significant role as a workplace disability agent. Mark owns several Tim Hortons stores in the GTA. Currently, over 20% of his employees have disabilities. In fact, his longest-serving employee has Down syndrome. Mark describes him often as his best employee.", "I’d like to also talk about research. The research is clear that people with Down syndrome benefit from early, coordinated, inclusive and targeted interventions to support their development and foster success. Furthermore, where children and adults with Down syndrome or other disabilities are given opportunities to participate, all children and adults benefit in the environment of friendship, acceptance and respect for everyone, and high expectations are created.", "Going forward, this particular motion and bill, as it speaks to this special day, I think speaks to what we, as a party, are looking for with respect to the types of supports for children with Down syndrome. This is a disorder, not a disease. Let’s support those who have the syndrome by proclaiming March 21 as Ontario Down Syndrome Day. I look forward to further discussion with my colleague opposite on his suggestions in terms of the co-sponsoring of a bill." ],

Our guests here today probably saw, if they saw the Toronto Sun or the Niagara papers this week, a young man in my community, Tony Yorfido. He is a huge fan of Steven Tyler, formerly from Aerosmith. Anthony is from Welland. He happened to be in Niagara Falls and they were in a store. Steven Tyler was going to be playing at Casino Niagara. And who walked into the store but Steven Tyler, so the mother and Anthony made their way over to Steven Tyler to get their pictures taken.", "He found out that he didn’t have tickets and invited him to actually come backstage, get up on the stage, and play the maracas during a song. Certainly that’s the kind of inclusion that we need to see in our communities.", "I also wanted to talk about the local Casa Dante Lodge 19 in my riding that does a lot of work supporting Special Olympics in Niagara. Every Friday night, they use their hall to hold dances for the Special Olympics so that they can raise money for the young people to participate in a lot of sporting activities. I can tell you that I’ve been to many a dance and I’ve played many a bocce ball game as well over the years, trying to do my bit in supporting that group of people.", "Interestingly enough, when we were doing a little research for this bill, we also found out that there is an increasing number of Down syndrome children with autism. We’ve been talking about autism here in the Legislature. Unfortunately, it’s a little harder to diagnose, but I’m sure that some of my colleagues will want to weigh in on that piece.", "I just want to shout out to a couple of other agencies in Niagara. The Pathstone Mental Health facility does a great job. Community Living Welland Pelham, as well as Bethesda—all great, non-profit community agencies that actually support people with Down syndrome who have dual diagnoses or support them at Community Living with all kinds of life activities and social activities.", "It’s a pleasure to have had the opportunity to say a few words.

Of course, it is one of many developmental disabilities, but perhaps it’s one of the most recognizable in terms of the appearance of people with Down syndrome and I think a very well-known genetic background to it.", "We have seen a real transformation in our society in terms of our approach to those with developmental disabilities. When I graduated from medical school in the mid-1970s, I can truly say that society was very divided. At that point in time, there were still individuals with Down syndrome being institutionalized, whose parents felt they couldn’t cope and felt that this was their only alternative. But at the same time, it was the beginning of the growth of the Community Living movement. In those days, 50 or 40 years ago, there was growing awareness of the abilities of those with Down syndrome, so instead of focusing on the developmental disabilities side, there was focus on the abilities of these individuals.", "That is certainly the way our government and my ministry with responsibility for those with developmental responsibilities view all individuals in society. We are trying to ensure that we have the most inclusive society that we possibly can. To this end, we have closed the institutions that existed here in this province for those with developmental disabilities. We’ve established, to the extent possible, independent living, perhaps with some support. We know that parents, caregivers, extended families of those with Down syndrome are often very anxious about the future. As has been referenced, those with developmental disabilities are living longer, thanks to modern medicine and all the interventions that have occurred over the past few decades.", "Independent living with some supports is an ideal. As we know with those with Down syndrome, there is a spectrum of severity of certain conditions, health conditions, intellectual ability and so on, just as there is with the rest of us. Therefore, in some cases, we need group homes and some specialized support for these individuals.", "In terms of what I’ve seen since I became minister, the next frontier is employment. We know that so many with developmental disabilities are fully able to participate in the competitive workforce. It is not only for the potential remuneration that we encourage employment; it is to be part of society. It’s to be part of what everyone wants to be, to have a job, a home and a friend. This is the philosophy of our ministry. I’m delighted that the member has put this private member’s bill forward, and I will be fully supporting it." ],

I, myself, was an optometrist, whereas the Minister of Community and Social Services just spoke about her career in medicine. We both had many patients with Down syndrome or patients who had family members with Down syndrome, and I can attest to the fact that there is a wide range of different abilities and personalities. I think a sunny disposition is a great way to describe some of the patients that I saw with Down syndrome, but not necessarily all of them.", "There’s no cure, as the member from Ajax-Pickering said, because it’s not a disease. There’s no reason to even look for a cure. It’s not a disease; it’s a genetic chromosomal anomaly, as I would say. Often, people like to use the word “defect.” I do not.", "As the minister said, all of us have different abilities and different interests.

One of them that comes to mind so quickly for me and my daughter, who loved to watch the TV series Glee, of course, is the very well-known Lauren Potter, who played the Cheerios’s co-captain on the show. She was an integral part of the show. It was just wonderful to see her playing that part and having some of the really witty acting lines. Jamie Brewer is another American actress with Down syndrome who played in the television series American Horror Story. She is also one of the first known Down syndrome models to walk down at New York Fashion Week.", "I just want to touch a little bit on the story of Tim Harris. Tim is the owner of his own restaurant called Tim’s Place. In high school, he was elected homecoming king by the highest margin of votes in the school’s history. Obviously, Tim has Down syndrome, and that’s why I’m talking about him today. He was also named student of the year. What a fantastic school and faculty that must have been.", "He dreamed of owning a restaurant, so he found jobs in the industry and learned as much as he could. One restaurant he worked at, the Red Robin, said that the revenues would absolutely skyrocket on Tim’s shifts. I saw a TV show where they told the story of Tim, and you could see why. Everybody who came into the restaurant was giving him a hug or a joke and had a real personal connection to Tim.", "He graduated from college with certificates in food services, office skills and restaurant hosting. In addition, he created Tim’s Big Heart Foundation to help other people with disabilities start their own businesses.", "As the minister said, the next frontier is employment. In Thornhill, we have DANI, which is Developing and Nurturing Independence. It is focused on helping individuals not necessarily just with Down syndrome but individuals who have special needs find the skills they need so that they can be independent and have employment. Their focus is on the DANI Café, which I hosted an event at recently.", "Ángela Bachiller, in 2013 in Spain, became the first person with Down syndrome to be elected a councilwoman. I want to remind people that not only could you be elected when you have Down syndrome—now it’s 2016—but you vote as well if you have Down syndrome or any other challenges in your life.", "I think that we would certainly welcome to see pages, and maybe the parents who are listening here today—maybe that’s something that we can work on, a program here. Maybe not exactly the page program, but maybe there is some kind of program that we can initiate here in the Legislature for kids who have some challenges.

I don’t know what segregation means in my own world. I’m very blessed to have a family that—I have a cousin with disabilities, and there was inclusivity. There was nothing different about my cousin. That is the way that I was raised, and this is the generation that I see happening today, and it makes me very proud to be a part of it.", "I’m not going to talk about Down syndrome and what Down syndrome is. What I am going to talk about is awareness. I’m going to talk about my city of Hamilton, and the great Down syndrome walk that we have every year. It’s pretty much like a carnival, for the excitement and the community and the organizations that come together. It brings extra funds in, too, for speech pathology, for other supports that families need—occupational therapy. These are things that families struggle for and that families need those extra funds for, because they’re just not there. Organizations like this, and days like this, make those happen and make it better for families.", "There’s a national campaign that Hamilton is part of, and it’s called Go21. “Go” is used to celebrate the advancement and the strength of the Down syndrome community. The “21” is used to represent the 21st chromosome, which is the determination of the diagnosis. Great work, to the Hamilton folks for always being there. I’m really honoured to be able to participate in that event.", "Being part of that event has allowed me the privilege of many new friends in my life.

It’s my Hamilton skating club for the Special Olympics, and Nicole Vespa and Tim Goodale, who are two folks with Down syndrome. They participate every time there is a national event. They just came back from Newfoundland with more medals than we can count. I can’t even imagine what the bedrooms in their homes look like, with all the medals and trophies for their great work.", "That’s all about integration, Speaker. That’s what this is all about. It’s about how we are making sure that everybody can participate in our society and have that wholesome experience.", "I don’t have a lot of time. I really want to talk about the Montoya family and my support for them. I know this is a federal issue, where the Montoya family is being told that it’s possible they will not be able to get their citizenship here in Canada. It concerns me. Their son, Nico, has Down syndrome, and the government is saying that it could possibly be a weight on our system, so they’re going to send him home.", "I’m going to finish with a quote from Rick Mercer.

Lisa Weidner of Hanover’s son Marrick has Down syndrome. I’m going to quote her: “One of my greatest fears is the lack of contained support. Marrick has just started to walk, stands at a little over three feet. He has some verbal language skills but uses signing more often. He is our pride and joy, we are confident given proper support that he will excel in school! But ... he needs that one-on-one in order to achieve all we believe is possible....”", "I fought for that.

I never want to be perceived as complaining about him because he has enriched our lives” so much.", "“However, today I am going to complain about the lack of supports for him. As an infant and as a child, Jason received a great number of services from a variety of agencies and for that our family is grateful. As Jason approached adulthood, I began to search out his options for life beyond school. He is allowed to attend until the age of 21, which for him means he has this year and next before he ‘ages out.’ Initially, I thought he might attend the ‘Building Bridges’ program at Cambrian College.", "“However, several years ago that program was discontinued. I began to look for other options and became comfortable with possibly preparing him for work at the Jarrett Resource Centre. We could get him a co-op” placement at the school he’s currently attending. “It is nearby and it is a realistic option for someone with Jason’s level of ability. Unfortunately, I’ve just learned of the expected closures of the Jarrett centres. I will be attending the information meeting ... however I’m not very optimistic.", "“You may be aware that in recent months, there has been frustration expressed by parents of individuals with special needs over the decision to disqualify people with intellectual needs from riding the Handi-Transit, making that service exclusively for those with physical needs. The idea was to accommodate individuals with developmental needs within the regular transit system. Of course, no changes have been made, no services added to the regular transit system in order to serve that particular population.", "“As Jason approached 18, I jumped through all the necessary hoops to have him lined up for adult services. He has been on a waiting list for Passport funding ever since. This funding could pay for a special needs worker to help” Jason train for transit, for example.", "“I don’t think it appropriate that in less than two years, we will be faced with the possibility of leaving Jason alone at home all day to fend for himself without support, without meaningful tasks to complete, with no peers to interact with. He can watch The Big Bang Theory on TV for hours on end and find snacks while my husband and I are at work, worrying about him.", "“I’m aware that I’ve presented you with several divergent issues which are not even handled by the same level of government, but I see it all looming. One big ball of concern that I can do nothing about. Our society is responsible for assisting its citizens, all of them, especially the ones who can’t write a coherent letter or present an articulate voice at a meeting.”", "I wanted to share her letter because this is 2016. Having a child with Down syndrome still comes with challenges: challenges with the Passport Program, challenges with supported housing, challenges with trying to find them a day program, and challenges trying to find jobs—meaningful employment—for people who have Down syndrome.", "I believe that the bill that hopefully will be passed this afternoon will help us all focus on March 21 and every other day as to what we can do as a society to make those challenges a thing of the past—the sooner, the better." ],

As you may notice, his licence plate is actually “VIPER”—and that bears exactly no relationship to this bill but I did have to mention it.", "paire chromosomique. Approximativement un sur 800 nourrissons nés en Ontario a le syndrome de Down. On note chez les personnes trisomiques divers degrés de déficience intellectuelle et un plus faible tonus musculaire. Certaines personnes trisomiques peuvent éprouver des difficultés cardiovasculaires et gastro-intestinales, habituellement au cours de la première année de vie. »", "Down syndrome has been recognized officially as a medical condition since the year 1866, originally in Britain by the physician and doctor John Langdon Down, hence the name. The chromosomal abnormality was actually identified officially by a French physician, Jérôme Lejeune, in 1959.", "I might just highlight, for a moment, a quick biological lesson. All human beings generally have 46 pairs of chromosomes, as you, Madam Speaker, would know as a nurse yourself. Unfortunately, on occasion, there is a triplication of one of these chromosomes. It is chromosome 21, which by the way contains 329 genes. That is why March—meaning month three—21 is the day that has been chosen to proclaim as Down Syndrome Day.", "I think I would have to echo my colleagues that the conceptualization or the thoughts around Down syndrome have a deep and perhaps not very noble history. If you look back hundreds of years, when it was recognized as, for example, a very nasty kind of condition, it was not really thought that folks with Down syndrome would be able to participate, would survive for too long, would be able to live independent lives, would vote and marry and graduate and participate as full members of society. But as the Right Honourable Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a different context, it’s 2016.", "So with that, I think that with a bill such as proclaimed today by my honourable colleague from Ajax–Pickering, we, as physicians, as legislators and as individuals who have the stewardship for the conversation that Ontario and Canada broadly have need to not only proclaim 03/21 as Down Syndrome Day—as, by the way, was proclaimed not too long ago by the United Nations General Assembly; we need to find more opportunities, just as we’re striving in other areas, whether it’s autism and so on, to allow individuals, their families and, of course, the mothers, grandmothers and great-grandmothers who are here today to be able to celebrate, to put away the stigma, and to help foster a more inclusive, integrated and generally happier society, particularly with regard to this particular condition, which, of course, can and often does lead to a number of different challenges, both social, intellectual, biological and medical.", "Madam Speaker, I would say that this is an important bill. It’s very much, I think, part of the thrust of the inclusivity of Premier Wynne and the Liberal government, and something that I can support in both a medical as well as parliamentary capacity." ],

I’m proud to bring this motion forward as a way of encouraging and stimulating this key component of a responsible and effective climate strategy.", "The science around climate change is clear, and skeptics of the underlying evidence are now, thankfully, very few and far between. The international community has acted boldly, holding key talks and global summits meant to stimulate further discussions and create meaningful solutions to back us away from the brink of an environmental catastrophe. Climate change threatens us all. As such, we all have a responsibility to work together to meet this challenge head-on.", "The people of Ontario have been directly affected. Communities have been severely damaged. Homes have been lost. Crops and businesses have struggled. Entire industries are facing setbacks. It hasn’t always been easy, but Ontario has and continues to be a leading force in the fight against climate change. But there’s always more to be done. Even though the science underlying climate change is now almost universally accepted—except for the Republican Party in the United States—there is a risk of becoming complacent or satisfied with the progress we’ve made. We must remain mindful not only of the human or economic costs of climate change, but the ecological ones as well.", "I’m sure all of us in this House can agree that Ontario is blessed with unmatched natural beauty, which makes it all the more pressing that we continue to raise awareness of lesser-known regions in the province under environmental threat.", "The Hudson’s Bay and James Bay regions are two such examples. These bays are the largest bodies of water in the world that seasonally freeze up each winter and become ice-free each summer. In Hudson’s Bay, the ice cover starts to form in northern areas by the end of October and continues to grow until maximum coverage is reached by April. In James Bay, the ice cover begins to decay in late May and nearly becomes ice-free by the end of July.", "One of the key features of these regions is that they are home to one of the most majestic species of animals we have in this province. I’m talking, of course, about polar bears. These cuddly but ferocious animals have been immortalized with a place on our toonie and continue to be a symbol of our national identity. Sadly, these national treasures are facing serious challenges due to increased ice melt brought on by warming climate trends.", "This country is home to approximately 16,000 polar bears, representing 75% of the population worldwide, with approximately 10% of those living in the Hudson’s Bay area. Polar bears are found in high densities along the Ontario coast, from Hudson’s Bay and the western coast of James Bay north of Attawapiskat, during the ice-free season, typically between mid-July and November. They currently have no federal legislative protection, but are listed as threatened, as a species at risk in Ontario. In fact, Mr. Ian Stirling, one of the world’s most esteemed polar bear experts, has claimed that by the middle of the century, we’ll be likely to have lost two thirds of the world’s polar bears.", "Polar bears are at the top of the food chain, and therefore play an important role in the overall health of the marine environment and are considered important indicator species because they rely on sea ice for their food. Here’s where the trouble lies: According to satellite images, the ice in the Hudson’s Bay and James Bay regions has been disappearing at a rate of 10% per decade since 1979. The polar bears living in Hudson’s Bay are at their most southern range and therefore at the highest risk of impact from a warming impact. In fact, it’s strongly believed by many experts that warmer weather will likely make it impossible for the polar bears to survive on the shores of Hudson’s Bay within 20 to 30 years.", "It’s not hard to see why this is such an important issue that this House needs to be aware of. While polar bears live on land during part of the year, they carry out many key functions, such as feeding and mating, on the sea ice. A warming planet means less ice coverage of the Arctic sea, leaving the bears with less time and less ice.", "For example, the open water season in Hudson’s Bay, the time in which bears are unable to survive on the ice, has increased by about three weeks since 1996. The time bears have on the ice is their best season, when they hunt for seals, fish and other prey. It gives bears the opportunity to restore their body fat and their fitness. But this vital period for storing energy for the warm season, when the ice is less and there’s less food available, is becoming more and more limited on account of climate change.", "This is particularly serious for polar bears that are pregnant or nursing young, and for the cubs themselves. In Hudson’s Bay, scientists have found the main cause of death in cubs to be either their lack of food or lack of fat on nursing mothers.", "Maternal denning sites, spring feeding areas and fall staging areas are the three most critical components of polar bear habitat. Spring feeding occurs on the sea ice, whereas denning sites and staging areas occur on land.", "Climate change has resulted in the loss of sea ice habitat and maternal denning habitat, having the greatest impact on the survival of cubs and older bears. Additionally, these changes have led to an increase in the number of encounters polar bears have with humans—encounters that threaten the safety of both parties.", "A recent research paper published by the National Research Council Research Press looked closely at this issue and served to further clarify its importance. I’d just like to quickly go over some of the findings.", "If you’ll recall, Hudson Bay undergoes a complete cryogenic cycle each year. It is entirely covered by ice by late December in most years, but the ice melts in summer, so there is a four- to five-month ice-free period in summer and fall. During the ice-free period, all bears are forced ashore, where they remain until ice forms again in late fall or early winter. While on land, polar bears generally survive on stored reserves acquired from hunting seals on the ice.", "This study found that the net result of increased ice melts in the Hudson Bay and James Bay regions was that polar bears were forced to spend about 30 days longer on land in 2012 than bears did in 1980. That’s 30 days they can’t spend on the ice carrying out the functions necessary to their survival. It is no surprise, then, that earlier breakup is implicated in declines in body condition, survival and abundance of polar bears.", "This is similar to earlier estimates of advances in breakup of three to four weeks in the western half of Hudson Bay between 1971 and 2003. A similar trend of earlier breakup and later freeze-up was documented in the northern regions of Hudson Bay, Foxe Basin and Hudson Strait. Simply put, polar bears are running out of livable ice in Ontario. Our polar bears are under threat, Madam Speaker. This is clearly evident in the role that polar bears play in our national identity. Greater awareness needs to be brought to the matter.", "I’m speaking fast, Madam Speaker, trying to get my whole speech in.", "However, what we need to keep in mind is that the problem of increased ice melts is merely a single representation of a larger threat facing Ontario ecosystems. These threats are significant, and it’s crucial that we in the Legislature be keenly aware of the destructive impacts of climate change in these critical regions.", "In the last three and a half minutes that I have, Madam Speaker, I want to talk briefly about the boreal forest. The boreal forest and lowlands of northern Ontario comprise the most intact boreal forest in the world, covering an area roughly the size of France. This ecosystem includes the Hudson Bay lowland, which is one of the most expansive wetlands in the world.", "According to various studies, recent global warming trends have negatively impacted the growth and survival of boreal tree species and have increased the frequency of costly wildfires and more severe pest-related damage. There is also evidence of the direct effects of climate change, such as increased temperature stress, drought stress and freeze/thaw damage. It is an ecosystem that has experienced increased fire frequency and pest damage.", "There is also increasing evidence of a systemic change in boreal wildlife that is consistent with a climate change signal, including shifts in species range and behaviours. Some of the boreal forest’s most beloved songbirds have faced steep population declines over the past 40 years, including the Canada warbler, which has had a 75% decline; the evening grosbeak, which has had a 75% decline; the rusty blackbird, which has had a 90% decline; and the olive-sided flycatcher, which has had a 70%-plus decline.", "Since the 1850s, the mean annual temperature in the boreal forest regions of Canada has risen from 0.5 degrees Celsius to 3 degrees Celsius, with increases of greater than 2 degrees Celsius west of the Ontario-Manitoba border. The intergovernmental panel on climate change recently published its fifth assessment report, and concluded that increases of 2 degrees Celsius in mean annual temperature by 2050 are highly probable, and the mean annual temperature across the Canadian boreal zone could be 4 to 5 degrees warmer by the year 2100.", "Warmer temperatures, coupled with changes in the distribution and timing of annual precipitation, are likely to cause serious tree-killing droughts. Climate change has already begun affecting the boreal zone, with projections indicating that the northern portions will be hit harder than further south.", "I could go on, Speaker, but suffice it to say that the Hudson Bay and James Bay ecosystems are at huge risk from what climate change threatens. The increased ice melt brought on by changing climate trends in the Hudson Bay and James Bay region threaten the existence of one of our most beloved animals and represents a much larger concern of ecological damage in those regions. It’s a serious issue that will carry significant consequences for our province.", "That’s why I’m putting this motion forward today. I wanted to also mention that other speakers will be speaking on other parts of this motion. Thank you very much, Madam Speaker." ],

It was formerly called Repulse Bay; it has now returned to his original Inuit name. I recall that we went up to visit them on the May 24 weekend one year. There was concern because the polar bears were coming close to the community. They had to go and deal with the threat accordingly. The only reason that particular bear was coming close to the community was that it was looking for a new food source.", "So I do appreciate what you’re saying, and I want to really stress the fact that the PC Party of Ontario remains committed to tackling climate change in a fashion that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions while protecting taxpayers and our economy.", "When we talk about what we’re facing around the Arctic Circle—again, the community that Lana and Michael lived in had the Arctic Circle run right through it. It was pretty cool to be up there.", "I just want to share with everyone here in the House today that the Ontario and federal governments have already invested significant time and resources to address this issue. For instance, the Canadian Ice Service produces daily updates on Artic ice levels and releases seasonal summaries describing ice conditions in the north. Yes, Speaker, this service includes several detailed maps of the ice conditions in southern Hudson Bay, the region immediately above northern Ontario.", "People in the House today might also be interested to learn that this same service provides an annual ice atlas, which offers year-to-year comparisons about ice levels in Canada and Ontario.", "We don’t want to get stalled and use a lot of time on a motion when we have yet to develop an effective response to climate change. But don’t get me wrong; we all know that we have to get this issue right, and, to the member, we are sensitive to and cognizant of that.", "In terms of getting it right, I don’t feel that it will put us on the right path if we pursue the cap-and-trade scheme that the Liberal government has introduced. As you know, the Ontario PCs are flatly against the cap-and-trade slush fund.", "I was just touring a business on Carlingview Drive, and even they are worried that cap-and-trade in Ontario will increase the cost of living and doing business in Ontario.", "As I said, it’s not just our party who is against cap-and-trade; so is the Ontario public. Last month, a Forum Research poll in the Toronto Star revealed that 59% of Ontarians disapproved of cap-and-trade altogether, and 68% disapproved of the rise in prices associated with cap-and-trade.", "While we’re amicable to this motion, and I applaud the member for coming forward with it, we really need to be cognizant that in the larger picture, when it comes to addressing climate change, we do not handcuff Ontarians with a costly scheme that will impact business as well as households. My fellow colleagues will pick up from there." ],

I will add to this that there are people who live in northern Ontario, and we are also having a very tough time. There are businesses that set up shop and are trying to thrive, and they are also having a tough time.", "I would look a bit at the record. We have known that climate change has been coming for quite some time. I was here in 2007, when the government directed an Expert Panel on Climate Change Adaptation to advise on how to minimize the negative impact of climate change. The expert panel produced its report in November 2009 with 59 recommendations and a call for prompt and vigorous action. Unfortunately, not much has been done.", "It was followed in 2011 by the Ontario government’s release of Climate Ready: Ontario’s Adaptation Strategy and Action Plan 2011-2014. That plan outlined the government’s action over four years—that is, to 2014—with five broad goals and 35 specific actions, but nothing was done, Speaker. The Environmental Commissioner of Ontario expressed caution: How come there are no timelines? How come there’s no funding? How come there are no accountability provisions in all of that?", "In a subsequent report from the Environmental Commissioner, he reported frustration with the government’s retreat from the responsibilities it had assigned itself on climate readiness.", "Then in 2013, the Environmental Commissioner of Ontario’s report was titled Failing Our Future. He said that “the government’s long-term energy policy could wipe out some of the gains that have been made in reducing greenhouse gas emissions,” adding, “There has been little progress to report this year.”", "In 2014, the Environmental Commissioner’s report came with a headline of “Ontario Is Failing in Fight Against Climate Change.”", "Despite the lack of action, the members continued to focus on awareness. I think it was quite telling that on March 12, 2015, about a year ago and a bit, a member from this House, Stormont–Dundas–South Glengarry, motioned to recognize that climate change exists and poses a threat to Ontario’s environment, businesses, communities and economy. It passed unanimously, but not without some questions. I think the member from Toronto–Danforth said it best when he asked why it was that we had to vote on whether or not we believed the earth is round. We’ve passed this, Speaker. We’re way past this.", "By the end of 2015, the government released its climate change strategy. That was a 40-page report, including a lot of pictures and cover pages, with few targets, no timelines and no details—very much like the 2011 document. But it does say that it promises a “climate-resilient” Ontario by 2030. On page 36 of that latest report, where one might hope to come up with an action plan, you see only a title page that says, “The Action Plan to Come.” We’re still waiting with bated breath a year later, and the action plan has not come.", "The government’s recent Bill 172, the Climate Change Mitigation and Low-carbon Economy Act, pretty well does the same thing: no provision for climate change adaptation.", "I started my remarks by saying that, yes, there are big, beautiful animals that live in northern Ontario. The polar bear is one. There are many others. But there are also people, and a lot of the people who live in the far north of Ontario are First Nations.", "I had the opportunity to talk with Ontario Regional Chief Isadore Day. Chief Day and I were both stuck at the airport on Monday, not able to fly because of inclement weather, and basically we started to talk about the environment. He shared with me his frustration as to how climate change is having a real effect on the people who he represents, on the First Nations who live in the far north of Ontario, but nobody has come to talk to them. Nobody has opened up a dialogue that says, “What do you think the action plan should look like so that we prepare the people of the north and the beautiful creatures that live there for what is coming?” Nobody has ever come to ask.", "Believe me, when it comes to knowing Mother Nature, when it comes knowing Mother Earth, when it comes to protecting our environment, you can’t beat the First Nations. When they make a decision, they make a decision for what that will mean for the next seven generations. They have spent a lot of time looking at their environment. They have intimate knowledge of the changes that are presently happening to their environment. They have ideas as to how we can make sure that those changes are mitigated if they need to be, or adapted to so that people, animals, polar bears and everybody else can thrive. But nobody ever comes to talk to them. Nobody ever asks them for their input. Nobody wants to hear the good ideas that they have.", "I know that I have to leave time on the clock for my colleagues; I will say thank you very much for this opportunity." ],

It’s been quite good this afternoon.", "I want to congratulate the member from Scarborough Southwest for bringing this motion forward. It is an important motion. As we read the motion, it talks about raising awareness about increased levels of ice melting in Hudson Bay and James Bay. That’s exactly what it says: increased awareness, and not just increased awareness of the kind of effects that it’s having in northern Ontario, which are incredibly important to this province and to the people who live there. I take to heart the comments from the member for Nickel Belt with regard to First Nations and their ability to think generations ahead of time. We could have done a better job of that ourselves, and I think that’s what this motion speaks to.", "I’m glad that the member mentioned the boreal forests. The boreal forests are part of this planet’s lungs. This planet needs the boreal forest to breathe, so having the effects that we have on that not only affects people in the north, but it affects people in the south as well, and around this province and around this globe. Increasing that awareness and increasing the awareness about what effects we’re having on the vegetation, the animal life and, most importantly, the human life that exists in the north is how we as individuals and as communities treat the issue of climate change.", "What do we do in our everyday lives in terms of reducing our use of carbon fuels and reducing our carbon footprint? As you know, our government is putting a price on carbon. That’s an important thing to do. I know it’s not supported by the members opposite. I do want to remind the member opposite, from Huron–Bruce, that when we closed the coal plants in this province, that was the biggest single carbon reduction anywhere. When it was going full tilt, coal plants in this province had a bigger carbon footprint than all of the oil and gas industry in Alberta. That was a tremendous change, and that wasn’t supported.", "I think that it’s important that we support this member’s motion, Madam Speaker, because I think that we can do a lot more to educate ourselves inside this Legislature, but also, it’s important for us to create awareness. We discuss these issues every day inside here. Sometimes we make the assumption that socially, everything that we discuss in here is prevalent outside of here, but people only have so much time in their busy everyday lives to take in so much information. Raising the awareness of the kinds of impacts they’re having in northern Ontario—in Hudson Bay and James Bay—I think will be very important in terms of changing people’s behaviour and carbon footprint." ],

It is an important issue and something we must look at. I don’t think anybody in this House disagrees with that. Climate change is real, but we need to work on a practical and well-thought-out approach to mitigate and solve what has been referred to as a very serious threat to our way of life.", "There are many solutions, but meaningful results can only be achieved collectively. We can’t do it alone. Ontario could and should be a leader who should work for our partners and our neighbours to the south. Ontario’s carbon footprint is one tenth of 1% of the world’s carbon footprint. If we embark, essentially on our own, on a foolhardy plan, we’ll be bankrupt a long time before an impact is made.", "Let us be clear: The Liberal cap-and-trade is just another tax grab. It’s not the silver bullet that everybody is professing. The government is out of money and this is their latest scheme to refuel their spending addiction, mismanagement and waste. Speaker, they’ve done a yeoman’s job at it: They’ve raised taxes and transfers that they collect by more than 100%—$65 billion to over $130 billion—and still, they doubled the debt. It’s the largest subnational debt in the world—number one—and there are some able competitors around the world.", "And waste: We have eHealth, gas plant scandals, smart meters, Ornge and more. We need to make an issue and make sure that people are aware of climate change, but it should not be an issue just to change the channel. I see this as a way of changing the channel away from the latest scandal we see in this House where we have discretionary funds being used that seem to reward people who make large contributions to this government. There’s little wonder why people mistrust this government. They see it over and over again.", "Again, I see another report in the Globe and Mail about a secret document talking about the same issue with large companies getting large amounts of government money. It just so happens—people would draw their own lines—they’re large contributors to this party. It’s little wonder that people are really wondering why we would want to change the channel.", "Speaker, there are legitimate fears about the cost to the consumers. Ontarians will have to pay nearly $900 more a year on gas and home heating. Small manufacturers will be hit with $170,000 in new energy costs every year. This will put jobs at risk, shut down our investments in our province and increase the cost of gas, groceries and home heating for families.", "I see these families in my riding of Stormont–Dundas–South Glengarry every day, who are having trouble paying the bills. This will only make it worse. We cannot take this issue lightly. We have to get it right and we have to be part of the big picture if we’re going to have any real success. We need sensible solutions that don’t just create another Liberal slush fund.", "The current budget shows the Liberal cap-and-trade scheme will raise another $1.9 billion in new revenues from selling carbon credits to businesses and big emitters. That’s $600 million more than the Liberals claimed in their fall economic statement. It’s about making this government look good and not about results. The approach will end up manipulating the deficit and surplus figures, giving the Liberals a political advantage. The money will not be able to be looked at by our Financial Accountability Officer, something else that was planned by this government and something that we see as an issue.", "I know that other members want to speak to this bill. I think we have to be careful. Climate change is an issue, but we need to look at the problems in this House." ],

I have no doubt that the member is sincere, and I would like to thank him for bringing this motion forward.", "In my riding, I have the Arctic watershed. If you go up Highway 11, you’ll see a big monument: “From here, all water flows north,” into James Bay and Hudson Bay. As a farmer who farmed my whole life in northern Ontario, I have no doubt about climate change. Farming in northern Ontario actually benefits from climate change. I’m not here to discount climate change, but the issue that we have to face with climate change is a very serious issue, and it’s an issue that has been faced by First Nations for generations—that our modern society has passed the First Nations by because, quite frankly, they didn’t fit into what our modern society was.", "As our modern society cut down the Carolinian forest and cleared all the land down here and built skyscrapers, roads and all that stuff, the people from northern Ontario dug the mines and did all those things to build this modern society. The people in northern Ontario, who are also being impacted by climate change—farmers are going to benefit, but the others aren’t. They are now also being bypassed by our modern society, which has realized that all this modern stuff we built impacts the climate. Climate change has been happening—it’s not a new thing. Where my farm is used to be a glacial lake, so there has been climate change before, but our society has sped it up, right?", "What about the people who are being passed by? As we do things to lessen our impact on the planet—which is great—we have to make that the people who don’t live in the major centres, the people who don’t quite fit anymore, are not the victims of climate change. The victims are the people who can’t pay the bills because hydro is more expensive because—there are a few other things we would disagree with, but closing the coal plants is good thing, and it made electricity more expensive. But not everyone can pay that cost.", "Last week in my riding, it was minus 30 degrees; today, 30 centimetres of snow fell. Climate change might be happening, but those people are still paying the bills, and a lot of them did the hard work and now are on pension, but the pension is not keeping up. They are victims because—again, with the increased tax on gasoline for the carbon offsets. We may agree or disagree, but some of those people who pay for the gasoline have no choice. There is not going to be a subway. In northern Ontario, our bus routes are being cut. The people who could use the train to get here for medical appointments—it doesn’t exist anymore. We hear, “We’re going to build more transit.” We’re losing ours because we’re losing our people. We are victims.", "The people in outlying regions, the people who actually live in the boreal forest, as I do—we’re the lungs of the province, the lungs of the world, but we shouldn’t have to pay a penalty because we live in the lungs of the world. Our society has to make sure that everyone pays a fair share and that everyone benefits from the changes in climate. I think that’s one we have to remember. Climate change is happening. We all recognize it. We’ve got to make sure that the solution which might be good for society as a whole doesn’t leave a bunch of outliers who suffer, as the First Nations have suffered for generations because of our prosperity. This could very well be happening to the people of rural and northern Ontario as we speak, and that’s something we have to be very careful of." ],

Changes in the water’s movement between air, soil, plants and bodies of water occur.", "More extreme weather like we witnessed a few years ago in places like Burlington—it had never seen flooding before, and it had a lot of flooding.", "There’s also erosion, shoreline damage, infrastructure failures and decreased water quality due to increased runoff and debris.", "Most aquatic species’ growth and reproduction are strongly influenced by water temperatures. Higher temperatures in the Great Lakes and inland lakes could result in fewer cold-water species in Ontario, such as lake trout, yellow perch and large-mouth bass, which my colleague from Trinity–Spadina likes to catch in Little Lake in Barrie. At-risk fish species such as the lake sturgeon may disappear completely from Ontario.", "Some wildlife species may be forced to move further north to a more favourable habitat. Climate change may affect wildlife reproduction, relationships between predators and prey, survival of species, rates of disease in wildlife species and the availability of food and habitat.", "I urge everyone to pass this motion.

I do want to talk about it, because why would you pick, of all the geography in the world, this particular place? The member shows great perception and understanding of this. I think that it’s a very brilliant thing to do.", "What do we know about our Arctic? It’s already 2.7 degrees, almost three degrees, Celsius warmer. Why should we care? That doesn’t sound like very much—unless it’s that your children’s body temperature went up that much; then you’re rushing them to hospital. Small incremental changes in temperature can have catastrophic effects.", "What is happening in Ontario as a result of the Arctic warming at that rate? In my friend from Timiskaming–Cochrane’s part of the province, over the next 30 years, that land will be eight degrees Celsius warmer than it was. Every one degree Celsius increase in temperature means that 7% more water is absorbed into the atmosphere.", "As a farmer, which he’s had a lifetime of, and his neighbours, you just think about that change in the hydrological cycle; all that water in the fields in the fall in large volumes, severalfold what’s there right now—how hard is it to get crops out of the ground? If you think about a warmer Arctic as some bonanza for food, it may be in the near term, but not for very long. What do we know about this destabilized warmer Arctic? Does it mean we’re always going to be warmer? I remember when 2014 came around and it was so cold on the Prairies that it went down to three or four metres of deep freeze, almost permafrost, that broke up the sewage and water systems there. Then a year and a half later, it was so hot and so dry that the Prairies were on fire and you had air quality warnings—very destructive to agriculture.", "But the problem is false springs. What happens is, just as we lost 80% of our apple crop in 2012, which was an anomaly that will now become a regularity, it got warm and then it got cold, and the blossoms died. The same thing happened last year in BC, where grapes and strawberries came out in January and they all died. Then in May and June, which is what most of us call summer or late spring, Halifax had four or five metres of snow, as did St. John’s. That was the biggest damage to the agriculture and transportation economies in Atlantic Canada and loss of GDP.", "What we’re doing is we’re losing our ability to grow food. It isn’t just temperate; our sycamore trees in the Rouge Valley and Pelee Island don’t bloom anymore because they come out early as part of the Carolinian forest, and when it gets cold, the buds die. So you don’t have pollination and you don’t have germination.", "Madam Speaker, where does our food come from? Eighty per cent of our vegetables come from California, if you’re an American or a Canadian. They’re in a 40-year severe drought: no water from rivers, no more rain and their aquifers are being drained. This is all the result of changes in the Arctic from behaviours of people like us.", "I commend the member for pointing this out.

It’s so important to think that way. I had some dealings with the aboriginal communities that came to Scarborough because there’s a big burial mound in Scarborough that was discovered in 1961. As they were developing that area, they found this huge native burial ground. It’s still there, and it has been commemorated many times.", "Other members have talked about various parts of this issue as well.

At some point in time in the future, I’m sure the ministry or someone will bring forward something with regard to polar bears. As I mentioned during my two minutes’ time, Madam Speaker, they are being threatened.

  "text" : [ "We in this Legislature observe the 28th day of April as Workers Day of Mourning, and we’ve done that since 1988. The purpose of this bill is to standardize the way we in Ontario acknowledge the significance of the 28th of April. With this bill, we intend to increase the public’s awareness of the Workers Day of Mourning. We intend to promote workplace safety, and we want to see more respect paid to injured workers.", "We lower the flags on the Workers Day of Mourning as a sign of respect for the men and women who have been injured on the job.", "We lower the flags for the men and women who became diseased because of the conditions they had to put up with at work.", "We lower the flags to honour the memory of those who were killed while earning a living.", "We lower the flags to show solidarity with the families they left behind.", "We lower flags to validate and reinforce that those lives had real meaning and won’t ever be forgotten.", "We lower the flags here at the Legislature, and we lower flags at our provincial buildings, including the Ministry of Labour and WSIB offices.", "The lowered flag is a powerful symbol of our respect for the day of mourning, our shared loss and our commitment to workers’ safety. It shows we care, and it demonstrates that we care for their surviving family members as well. Lowering the flag is a sign of dignity, a symbol of respect and a call for justice.", "We’ve done that here; however, sometimes it’s been hit-and-miss elsewhere. For example, some school boards may agree to lower the flag at the board office, but they won’t do it at all the schools within their jurisdiction—there are nearly 5,000 elementary and high schools throughout Ontario. Some municipalities will do it; some don’t. I’m told it’s the same at hospitals and college and university campuses. It’s an inconsistent approach.", "This has to change. That is the purpose of this proposed legislation. This bill will make the public, especially our younger citizens, more aware of the Workers Day of Mourning. It should send a message to employers that they have to do more to train their employees and secure and maintain a safe place to work.", "The Ministry of Labour is the first to acknowledge that workers new to a job are three times more likely to be injured during their first month at work than more experienced employees. One horrific example in Oakville, at a bakery: Eighteen-year-old David Ellis, on his second day on the job—no training, no supervision—was left alone on the shop floor. He was cleaning an industrial mixer, a mixer that had been previously designated as faulty by ministry inspectors, a mixer on which the bakery failed to install a low-cost safety device, a mixer that was accidently activated, and David Ellis was sucked in head-first and killed on his second day at work. That was 17 years ago, Madam Speaker, and we still have young people dying on the job in Ontario every year since.", "Caleb and Kelly, members of David’s family, came to Queen’s Park this morning. They’re here this afternoon to support this bill and to continue their ongoing campaign for safer workplaces in our province, with their Jersey of Courage campaign. Thank you very much." ],

That was in 1999. The company was fined $40,000—$40,000 for the death of a 19-year-old young man just starting out in the Ontario workforce.", "Speaker, 30 young people in Ontario between the ages of 15 and 24 died in work-related accidents between 2009 and 2013. During that same time period, more than 30,000 young people received injuries resulting in lost time at work.", "When a serious injury or a death occurs on the job site, ministry investigators are called in, charges are laid and the case makes its way through the legal system, which usually takes a year or two but sometimes a lot longer.", "In 2009, you may recall that on Christmas Eve, four men fell 13 storeys to their deaths from what is known as a swing stage at a Toronto high-rise. Originally, the company was fined $200,000. The appeals court boosted that fine to $750,000, and this past January the manager of that construction project was sentenced to three and a half years in jail. He’s appealing his sentence.", "“Kill a Worker, Go to Jail”—that message was launched by former OFL leaders Sid Ryan and Nancy Hutchison, and that’s still the message today from Chris Buckley, the new president of the Ontario Federation of Labour.", "We realize that no time behind bars or no financial penalty can bring back a worker who was killed on the job. No jail time can undo the pain inflicted on the families of the men and women who are killed while at work in Ontario, but it sends a powerful message to other employers to clean up their act and make on-the-job health and safety training and supervision more of a priority.", "Following that Toronto high-rise accident, Speaker, an expert panel made a number of recommendations. One of them included increased health and safety curriculum in our high schools. Lowering the flags at high schools would be a meaningful teaching tool for what recommendation.", "There are something like 200,000 new claims a year opened at the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board, the WSIB.", "Injured workers in this province shouldn’t be treated as criminals or people trying to scam the system, yet many of them tell me that’s exactly how they are made to feel when dealing with the WSIB.", "Dignity, respect, justice—three small words with great significance. Injured workers deserve dignity, respect and justice from the WSIB.", "We have nearly 500 new claims a day for occupational injury or illness; 54,000 lost-time injury claims came in last year, and another 126,000 injury cases were reported which didn’t end up with time lost.", "Health and safety is a critical issue. Last year, ministry inspectors issued 131,197 orders for non-compliance. Last year, the ministry levied fines totalling $9,365,870. Employers need to step up. Our public institutions need to do their part to highlight unsafe work in Ontario and the struggle to make things better. In the construction industry alone, an average of 20 workers are killed every year in Ontario. Between 1998 and 2015, 359 workers were killed on construction sites in Ontario. One is too many.", "How do we get workplace safety to be more of a priority? Well, for one thing, we make the Workers Day of Mourning more of a priority. We make more people in our communities aware of the enormity of the injuries and the deaths workers face every day on the job. We strip away any complacency. We say to those who have neglected to lower their flags: “You are funded by provincial money. You will join us in honouring the Workers Day of Mourning. It’s the right thing to do.”", "Together, we can make Ontario workplaces more safe for each and every one of us, our sons, our daughters and our grandchildren. We owe it to them so they can go to work and receive the training they need for the job they do and come back home safe and sound each and every day after work.", "My hat goes off to the men and women who hold the annual ceremonies in their communities in observance of the Workers Day of Mourning on the 28th day of April. In Windsor, Rolly Marentette and Tracie Edward have done it for our district labour council. We have surviving family members who attend every year, so we don’t forget people such as Cindy Libby, Claudio Cardoso, Johnny Hunt and Elie Seremach, just to name a few.", "Speaker, we had eight workplace fatalities in Windsor and Essex county in 2014. One is bad enough; eight in one year in our small community is outrageous.", "I want to thank Vern Edwards, the OFL’s director of health and safety, for the work he does on the importance of April 28; and OFL director Laurie Hardwick, who is a strong advocate for injured workers.", "Day in and day out, we leave home to earn a living to put food on the table, to keep a roof over our heads and to provide for our families, yet not all of us return healthy, and some of us never return at all. We all have the right to come home from work safe and unharmed in any way.", "Asbestos and other occupational hazards will be the theme of this year’s annual ceremony in many communities. As a reporter, I remember well the stories we did at CBC Windsor on people such as Tommy Dunn. Tommy worked at Bendix Automotive making brake shoes. He died of mesothelioma. He was 35. His widow, Lucy, comes to our day of mourning ceremony every year. Lucy has also lost a brother, a brother-in-law, a sister-in-law and an uncle to workplace hazards.", "We have to do more to make workplace safety much more of a priority. We need more inspectors, more enforcement, better training, tougher sentences, and we need more compassion for the injured workers in this province.", "I know I’m running out of time, Speaker. I just want to say that, yes, lowering the flags is a symbolic gesture, but it’s the least our publicly funded institutions can do to increase recognition of workplace fatalities, injuries and occupational diseases. Thank you for your time this afternoon." ],

I don’t want the member to think that the brevity of my remarks, which will be about three minutes, is any indication as to the seriousness, or the admiration I have for him for bringing forward this very, very important issue.", "It’s an issue I hope will meet with the pleasure of all members around this House, because we’re joined today by some people who have some lived experience in this regard. I know that Caleb Ellis is here. Certainly, I’ve gotten to know Caleb’s dad, Rob, and his sister Jessica, as a result of the work that they do to educate young people about what can really happen when an industrial accident takes place or an accident at work takes place.", "I know we’re joined by some folks from the injured workers’ groups who do a wonderful job on a daily basis ensuring that politicians and the rest of the people, including businesses, unions and organized labour—everybody—understand the importance of this issue and how seriously we must treat it. I know we have SEIU up there and perhaps some of the other folks from the OFL, as well.", "I think we’re all here today because we agree, as the member said, that one death is too many. If you look at the progress that has taken place since 2003, we’ve been able to reduce the incidents in this province by about 40%. What’s remained stubbornly high, though, is that the fatalities haven’t dropped. The fatalities have plateaued—there’s that straight line. Even though the number of jobs is going up and you could say in one regard maybe they are coming down, they’re not coming down enough for me and they shouldn’t be coming down enough for anybody in this House as well.", "We are making some progress in the fact that since last April, we’ve been targeting places where a lot of the fatalities occur. Where people are killed most often on the job sites are falls from heights—people falling from as little as six feet, people falling off high-rise buildings, off projects like that. I can tell you, Speaker, that as a result of introducing mandatory—not voluntary, mandatory—falls-from-heights training, we have had 100,000 people since last April who have taken that training, not because they wanted to, but because this House told them they had to because we treat this issue with the seriousness that it deserves.", "We’re the only jurisdiction I am aware of in the world—and until I’m proven wrong, I’m going to keep saying this—that has a Chief Prevention Officer; that has one person who acts on my behalf as Minister of Labour. That person’s sole job is to prevent injuries in the province of Ontario. Other jurisdictions, I know, have looked at that and thought it’s a good idea. I hope that they would follow suit. I think we should be proud that we’ve taken than road.", "But, Speaker, I think what the member is doing today is bringing forward an expansion of an idea that started in this country a few years ago. We should recognize people who have been killed on the job and people who have been injured on the job, the same as we would mourn any other death, with the seriousness that it deserves.", "When people go and serve their countries in different ways, the people who participate in the economy expect to come home at the end of the day. Too often, they don’t. I think the idea that’s being put forward by the member from Windsor–Tecumseh is an excellent way for this House to come together and ensure that people around this province have that symbol on the day of mourning, when those flags are lowered, and that we think about it at least for one day.", "Thank you for bringing this bill forward." ],

Thank you very much. I’m thinking of you.", "When I thought of speaking to this bill, it brought me back to my time at Bruce Power. I remember, every year there, participating in the day of mourning. A total of 11 workers were killed during the construction of the Bruce Power nuclear site many, many year ago. Those names are immortalized on the cairn outside the administration centre.", "The annual gathering always includes members of the Grey-Bruce Labour Council, the Power Workers’ Union, the Society of Energy Professionals, the building trades union, Ontario Power Generation, members of Saugeen First Nation and, of course, most importantly, family members of those who lost their lives during the construction of the Bruce site.", "CEO Duncan Hawthorne always said, “Safety is our number one value at Bruce Power. That means every one of us has to care enough to act to ensure our workplace is safe for our colleagues.”", "That was the culture. That was the principle. But most importantly, that was what Duncan and all the people there ingrained. Everybody who came through the gates in the morning had to go home at night to their families and their loved ones. I can tell you, standing there, it was the most powerful and very impactful ceremony, to look at those families that had lost a loved one, to really make you stop in your tracks for at least a little bit of time and think, “What if that was me? What do I need to do?” It gave you the courage to act, regardless of what your skill was, what your job was. It was encouraging every employee and union partner to never forget the people who have died or become ill in the workplace, and to prevent it from happening again.", "I remember from my time there—and I think Percy is doing a great job of it, trying to bring this across our whole province and country, for that matter—that workplace safety is everybody’s responsibility. Each person, in every work site, from the shop floor to the boardroom, in the Legislature, every single job: Take time. Take time to care enough to act. If you see something that could even slightly endanger one of your fellow workers, do the right thing. Step out and step up.", "We all have the duty to ensure workplace safety.

The NDP was in opposition, and we brought forward this motion that recognized April 28 as the day of mourning for all of our province. At the time, we only asked that the buildings that belonged to the government of Ontario bring down their flags. What we’re bringing today is making sure that many other institutions lower their flags.", "You may wonder, Speaker: Why April 28? Well, it’s quite simple. April 28 was chosen because this is the day, in 1914, when this Legislature in Ontario was the first one to bring forward the Workmen’s Compensation Act. We were the first ones to bring that forward, and we did that. The Legislative Assembly of the time did that on April 28.", "Actually, I have a cut-out from the Toronto Star from 1914 that says, “Jubilation reigns in the Labor Temple to-day over the passing of the Workmen’s Compensation Act....", "“The passing of the Workmen’s Compensation Act will be a source of great satisfaction to the workers throughout the province.”", "It passed with unanimous support through a voice vote, and it was under a majority Conservative government that this particular piece of legislation happened.

It was extremely important to me that we came to a fair conclusion in matters that involved injured workers and their families.", "Workers and those who have unions do important work in advocating for their own—because it is a daunting task for an individual to stand up to an employer, especially a large employer—to protect and ensure that workers can enjoy the rights they’re entitled to.", "Many of you in this House know that I also represented injured workers during my time with the Office of the Worker Adviser. I did that for two years, and it was one of the most rewarding experiences when I could win a case on behalf of an injured worker.", "All too often, workers have settled for what the corporation they work for wants instead of what’s right and what they’re entitled to after working hard for that employer. It’s especially tragic when workplace injuries or death occur, and I have dealt with many cases where that was the case.", "As a former speaker said earlier, one death is one too many. Maybe those deaths aren’t a consequence of negligence—we all have varying amounts of risk in our work—but it’s important that we have an occasion to reflect, and that the occasion is observed as widely as possible, so that awareness of the importance of workers and their craft is recognized and that those who are killed on the job receive the thanks and recognition they so richly deserve.", "I guess my time is up.

My father was an absolutely ardent, active unionist in the painters and decorators union, and in the early 1970s he died because of it. He died from emphysema complications from lead-based paint back in the day. That was before the Workers Day of Mourning was even instituted. I can tell you, we mourned, and we also fought for the living. Every year at the Labour Day parade, I remember, and I still watch the injured workers and I salute them for all their incredible work. Many are right, and they have spoken about it: It’s not just about death; it’s also about injury.", "I also very clearly remember the Metron tragedy. I was up there. There was an impromptu rally around the site when the police tape was still up. It was a horrific time. It was a horrific accident. And yes, finally, in January, it was recognized, and finally a manager did go to jail. That was a huge victory for workers everywhere.", "The sad reality is that only about one in a hundred employers ever sees somebody from the Ministry of Labour. Only about one in a hundred employers ever gets a visit. That is the crux of the problem, because employers everywhere need to be visited not only for injuries—I have employers who don’t pay their workers. For precarious employees, for all sorts of other psychic and physical injuries, employers need to be visited and they need to be held to account.", "The Conservative member from Thornhill mentioned post-traumatic stress disorder. That was a step forward. We just got royal assent for that bill yesterday. It’s not just physical injuries either; it’s also mental injuries—38 suicides since January on that account. So we passed that—that’s good—but it took eight years. I hope this doesn’t take eight years. I hope we not only pass it today, but that it becomes law virtually immediately, and I hope even before it becomes law, this April, people listen, hear this debate and lower their flags. They don’t have to wait for the law.

I think we all have a role to play in that regard, whether it’s this Legislature, whether it’s employers or whether it’s trade unions and individual workers as well, working together to continually raise the bar in terms of improving workplace safety. This also provides an opportunity for us to remember those who have been killed or injured in the workplace, and to show compassionate support for their families.", "We have heard estimates that up to 90% of workplace deaths are preventable. Obviously, our PC caucus believes that we must do all that we can to improve workplace safety, with the goal of preventing any death in the workplace.", "There are actually four speakers from our caucus who want to participate in this debate, so I don’t want to take too much more time, but certainly I want to inform the House of my intention to attend the day of mourning event that’s coming up on April 28 at the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board offices as our party’s labour critic. I’m sure I will see the Minister of Labour there and some of the other members of the Legislature. It is a constituency week, but we do think it is obviously very, very important to demonstrate our interests and our support, and I certainly intend to be there.", "I want to again congratulate the member for Windsor–Tecumseh for his presentation this afternoon, as well as the initiative that he has brought forward. I would encourage all members of the House to support it." ],

Thank you very much for your work, Caleb.", "Many workers across Ontario are injured, maimed or killed every year on the job. People die in terrible accidents. They are injured or killed under avoidable circumstances. Speaker, we have laws; we have standards. We prioritize safety. There is no reason why anyone should be injured or killed on the job. There is no reason for anyone to be working under unsafe working conditions.", "Employers who put their workers in jeopardy must be held responsible. Employers whose workers die on the job must be held responsible. The government must enforce its laws and regulations pertaining to workplace safety and make sure that working Ontarians are safe.", "Every year on April 28, our labour councils, unions and organizations across our communities have beautiful and meaningful ceremonies and services across the province, but the greater community often isn’t aware. By lowering the flags to half-mast across sectors, we’re better able to spread that message of understanding.", "Speaker, it has been over a year since firefighter hopeful Adam Brunt set out one day and did not make it home. He tragically lost his life in a training exercise while taking a private pre-service training course. Technically he wasn’t yet a worker, but he was going to be. He and countless others across the province are unprotected while they train to become workers in their field. They are in a health-and-safety loophole.", "There can be no loopholes or grey areas when it comes to health and safety in Ontario. We continue to call on this government to ensure that all our trainees and all our workers are kept safe as they pursue their careers.", "We’ve been having very emotional conversations about the nature of work, and traumatizing work done by our first responders and high-stress service providers. Just this week, there was a terrible violent incident at the Waypoint Centre for Mental Health Care. This is an awful incident, and avoidable. This is a workplace with known dangers. We need to address these concerns.", "Thank you, Madam Speaker. I’m running out of time, and I’m getting tangled, and there’s so much to say on this. But really, safety needs to be our top priority. Our nurses, health care service providers, front-line works, first responders, builders, tradespeople, professionals, trainees and everyone else who sets out in the province to do their jobs deserve to work in a safe and secure environment, and deserve to come home." ],

We have one right near the Welland Canal because there had been an accident where someone had fallen off the Skyway Bridge at that time and died. It was an accident on that occasion. We use the word “accident” advisedly because an accident is something that can be prevented if we really think of it, and prevention is very significant.", "But as we attend these ceremonies, we get to meet the individual who has an incident that’s happened, and within that family someone has died. Someone went to work one day; the family hoped that person would come back and the person did not because of death in the workplace. It’s an extremely solemn ceremony, and I commend the members of the labour movement who, over the years, have ensured that we remember those whose lives have been lost in this way.", "I was a member of the Legislature in 1988 when the resolution was passed unanimously by members of this House—on that occasion recognizing April 28 as a day of mourning for those who are killed in the workplace. This piece of legislation will further bring to the attention of the public these tragic situations which happen to occur in the workplace from time to time.", "One can say, “Well, it’s symbolic,” and yes, there is some symbolism in it, in terms of the flag lowering. But it’s important for two reasons. It’s important because it’s an educational opportunity as well; people can see that something has happened, that there is a day to look at, that there is a circumstance to reflect upon. Second, it is a tribute to those who have lost their lives and to the families of those who have lost their lives.", "I think it’s incumbent upon all of us, because we have to think of those individuals who—a cold hand comes over their heart when someone comes to the door to say there’s been a death in the family, or they receive the news by telephone or other means.

I’d like to start by saying that of course we wholeheartedly support this bill, and it will make a difference.", "It is important that we take the time to create symbols that recognize the lived reality of workers and worker safety in this province. Lowering the flag is a powerful symbol of our shared loss and our respect for the suffering of those who have lost loved ones. It raises awareness of the seriousness of the problem of death and injury in the workplace. Even more importantly, I wholeheartedly support this piece of legislation because it is directly connected to the work we should all be doing in this place to prevent any further deaths, injuries and diseases that occur in the workplace.", "As proud as I am to stand in support of worker health and safety, I am just as disappointed at how much work needs to yet be done. Worker safety in Ontario has not improved in any appreciable way in the past 20 years. In 1993, Ontario saw 292 worker fatalities. In 2014, there were 289. That’s just a 1% difference. It’s not nearly enough, when we consider how our youth, our young workers, are injured in the workplace, and when you think of the 30 young people in Ontario between the ages of 15 and 24 who died in work-related accidents between 2009 and 2013. During that same period as well, more than 30,000 young people received injuries resulting in lost time at work.", "One of these recent fatalities in 2013 hit very close to home for me. Nick Lalonde was 23 years old when he was killed on the job in 2013, on a construction site in Waterloo. He was knocked off the side of an 11-storey apartment building. He had not been properly trained. He left behind his partner and his young daughter, Aloe. This tragedy was entirely preventable. Since then, we have repeatedly asked the government to act on the recommendations to establish proper fall prevention training that finally happened on April 1, 2015.", "It bears noting that at that workplace, there were 17 work orders put in place after this accident. The point is that you can inspect these workplaces after a worker dies, but that doesn’t prevent the injury and it doesn’t prevent the death. It’s going to take more than a Chief Prevention Officer to keep workers safe in the province of Ontario; it is going to take all of us in this place, starting with the member’s motion today. This bill recognizes that lowering the flags is an opportunity for us to share in this work together, and I commend him for bringing it forward." ],

We see it on Remembrance Day every year. As a young boy, I used to go to remembrance services with my grandfather, a First World War vet—my father was a Second World War vet—and uncles and aunts. It instilled in me a deep belief in the importance of remembering what happened in war that I carry with me to this day. It is an extremely important day in my life.", "The same will apply if we recognize in this expanded way April 28 as the Workers Day of Mourning. We’ll see this, if we reach out to the schools and hospitals, everywhere across publicly funded institutions. It’s so important because young people will now have a better sense of why this is happening and will be able to talk about it.", "Just yesterday, we had the Ontario career colleges here and I met a young man named Emidio D’Alfonso. He runs a company called Pre-Apprenticeship Training Institute; they provide pre-experience for apprenticeships going into construction, in which worker safety protocols are extraordinarily important. He does this on behalf of the Merit OpenShop Contractors Association of Ontario and the CLAC sector. Those workers who will be working in construction will get that excellent training they need to go forward and work safely.", "It was important for me as young man when I went out west and I worked on the oil rigs. I met up with a friend of my father who was in the oil industry and I got a job out in the oil rigs. He told me the day I went out there, “Be sure that you read the safety logs in that rig every morning before you start work.” I was able to see the kinds of things that were happening in oil rigs across the province. I was 19 years old. I noticed, as a result of reading that, one of the big wrenches they use for tightening pipes was fraying. At the age of 19, I stood up to the drill rig boss and I said, “No, we’re fixing that before we carry on.” I know it helped me in that situation. The right to refuse is extraordinarily important. It’s a great bill and you will have my support." ],

  "text" : [ "Good morning, Speaker. I am pleased to start this fine day with a 20-minute speech on the budget. I have waited patiently for a chance to speak on this budget, and here we are.", "What is in the budget, what isn’t in the budget—these are conversations we’re having across our communities at length. I’ve had a number of fantastic chances, as I’m sure we all have, to connect with our constituents. We have hosted a number of round tables at our constituency office that have been inspired by the significant need in our community. We’ve had seniors’ round tables. We had a round table on developmental services. Goodness, we’ve had a dental needs round table. And this is just at my constituency office, bringing folks together to do our best to understand their needs and do our best to problem-solve.", "Unfortunately, the budget that we have in front of us doesn’t do what it needs to problem-solve. It throws a couple of pretty words at these conversations but not the money, not the real investment, not the real intention that is deserved.", "We’ve heard this before. There was a fair bit of lead-up to the budget. People were wondering, was this going to be a campaign budget? I anticipated that it was going to be. You know what, Speaker? It even fell flat for that.", "This was a government that brought forward this budget because they thought they wanted to build themselves back up in the eyes of the community, but the community has been paying attention and knows that this is not enough, that this was not even stretch goals. They didn’t even commit fully to dental; it was just a little bit: “Here’s enough for a tooth, but only for you and not for the rest of your family. Here’s a bit towards your cleaning.” That’s not what a family can rely on. That’s not what people need.", "So, it was clear that this Premier believes it’s more important for her to look good than for the people of Ontario to actually feel good. Certainly, when it comes to health, when it comes to wellness, this budget falls short.", "I’d like to bring it back to dental because, of course, people were excited about the NDP dental plan; they continue to be excited about the NDP dental plan. Then out came the budget and the budget didn’t have any teeth—ha ha—let alone a significant commitment to dental. I got some cynical responses from my community but also some pretty sincere concerns, and I’ll share one here. This is a letter from a woman named Donna, one of my constituents, who’s in her thirties. She works full-time. She wrote to me:", "“I do not have any benefits, I am employed full-time and I might have some friends with younger kids that benefit from OHIP+, but my immediate circle of friends and colleagues do not qualify. As a single-income earner I’m so excited about the prospect of an Ontario dental plan. I have voiced my concerns about this issue a few times and I feel like finally someone is listening. As a professional vocalist, my mouth health is so important, and often on display. I know how important oral health is to your overall health and I have had a lot of issues affording the dental care I need. I currently am in need of over $400 of cavity work done. As a single earner it comes down to my teeth or my rent; my teeth or my rent, my teeth or my car payments and insurance. I hate that I have to go into debt to take care of my teeth. I hate that I will have [to] pay interest on something that should be under the provincial health care umbrella.”", "Interestingly, she has shared that she needs $400 worth of cavity work done. Well, under the Liberal plan, $400 is all she would get, so I hope she doesn’t need a cleaning and I hope she’s not part of a family that requires any other work done." ],

  "text" : [ "Okay. Sorry. They were laughing about something else. Maybe it was the lack of funding for health care; I’m not sure.", "Another letter that I would like to share—well, it’s not so much a letter; it’s another case that I’d like to share. It’s from Darlene. I want to tell you a little bit about Darlene because Darlene is a firecracker. She came into my office and, like many who come to our constituency offices, didn’t come with just one need; she came with several.", "Darlene came to see us. She is 72 years old. She’s a tiny little woman who is a firecracker and is a survivor and has a really special energy. She came to our office, unfortunately, just on that verge of crisis and really needed not just to be heard but needed help. We’re continuing to work with her but we’re finding it really challenging within this system to get her the help she needs. She’s 72; she has not been able to afford dental care since she turned 65 and she lost her benefits. She has 14 teeth left in her mouth. She’s developing gum disease. She is having trouble chewing and swallowing. She told me that she hates to eat. She hates to eat because of the pain and because of her challenges. The hospital won’t do anything for her; they just send her home with antibiotics.", "She’s not asking for anything fancy. All she wants is to have her teeth cleaned and she wants to have a cavity filled so that she can feel healthy. This is someone who, before she hit 65 and she got pushed off that seniors’ cliff where you’re on your own—she told me that she desperately wanted some kind of dental work done so she could keep the teeth that she had. She wanted some kind of appliance so she’d be able to keep chewing and eating past 65. She certainly didn’t qualify for that, certainly couldn’t have that and so now, one by one, she has been losing her teeth, and had a number of other concerns when she came to us.", "We’ve had folks come to our office who have undergone cancer treatments, not for a mouth cancer, not for an oral cancer, but some of the side effects of the cancer treatments are tooth damage; again, something not covered. We need to have a fulsome plan that allows people to have that oral health that they deserve, because we know it’s connected to everything else.", "For goodness’ sake, the government almost shouldn’t have touched it rather than just $400 and then another $50 or whatever it is; it’s piecemeal. The thing is, all Ontarians who don’t have enough money for dental and don’t have dental coverage—they know what it costs. They know that they can’t afford that $1,600 root canal. So when they see those numbers, it’s insulting.", "We’ve talked at length—I would say that we’ve spoken ad nauseam in this room—about health care and the lack of the supports that people need in our hospitals and in our communities. I love being in Oshawa, but being in the Central East LHIN, we are at the very bottom when it comes to funding. We don’t have equity around the province. It depends on where you live—the amount of care that you can get. My understanding is—and I’m sure that my Conservative colleagues will be happy to speak to this and correct me if I’m wrong: Back in the days of Harris, the funding for the LHINs was—I think it was reduced first and then frozen at that moment in time. The thing is, that was a snapshot of how things were at that time. Our area has grown and other areas have grown, but the funding has not been re-evaluated. We are frozen at that point.", "Our LHIN is right at the bottom in terms of funding. We see that when it comes to our long-term care; we see that when it comes to our hospitals. It isn’t right. It isn’t fair. It shouldn’t matter where you live in this province; you should have access to the services that you need and the health care that you require and, of course, deserve.", "I asked a question in this House a couple of weeks ago about Anna. Anna is someone whose adult children came to our office. They were very concerned because Anna was being held or stored or I don’t know how to put it—has been in ALC, alternate level of care, at the hospital. There is no space for her. Where she had been in a seniors’ residence, they could no longer meet her needs. There was nowhere for her to go, so she literally has been in holding in—rather than long-term care—long-term storage at the hospital, in our ALC beds, waiting for a space.", "I’m glad that I pressed in this House. I’m glad I brought it up, because, interestingly, she has been moved. She has not been moved to where she will be permanently, but she has been relocated. I’m glad to hear that, but her family continues to advocate to get her into a space that is close to home so that they can continue to see her and spend time with her. They were so worried that, like many of the other people around her, two or three that they got to know personally over the months that she has been there who died in hospital, she was going to die in this holding bed in the hospital rather than a space where she was welcome and wanted and could spend time with her family with dignity.", "Stories like this are all across the province. We hear them on a regular basis. We don’t see these issues addressed in this budget, and we should; we really should. We keep talking about how the government has had 15 years to do something about this. They’ve had 15 years to figure out the problems. I’ve only been here for four, but I know what the problems are, because I pick up my phone in my constituency office and I make appointments with folks and I listen to them. So if I know what the problems are in four years because I’m doing my job, I’m going to trust that everyone else in this Legislature is doing their jobs: that they are answering their phones and that they are working with folks in their constituencies. So they’ve known.", "We see right now with this budget and all of these announcements—the flurry of investments and, “You have a car, and you get a car, and you get a car, and you get a car,” and all of this stuff—they knew what was needed. It’s not just that it’s insulting, but that gets to the heart of it. If they knew how to fix it, then why wait? Why not address it? Why not be honest with the people of Ontario and say, “You know what? This might be too big for us to get accomplished, but we’re going to start.” Nope. It’s: “We’re just going to pretend it’s not a thing. We’re not going to own up to it. We’re not going to get working on it.”", "Here we have—in how many days is it now, Speaker?—an election on the horizon. It’s not even on the horizon; it’s right around the corner. I think, in that election, there’s going to be a clear message sent. But I think what the message is—regardless of how folks vote; regardless of the outcome of the election—people deserve to live and work in a province where they don’t have to worry about absolutely everything.", "In the last four years, first we’re dealing with the sell-off of Hydro One. This is something that will always mark my career: that I had to sit across from the government and watch them slowly sell off Hydro One and dismantle what we owned as a province. With Hydro One, you can’t get much broader than the ownership of everybody in the province. But they sold that off and got rid of the revenue stream that came with that.", "They are underfunding our public services without even thinking about it: “Just sell it off; we don’t want to deal with it.” They’ve got friends who need to make a profit, and here we are. We don’t have enough money coming in. They don’t have a plan to bring money in; they just have a plan to spend it. At least, with the NDP and our platform—and we’re getting good reviews, Speaker; I don’t know if you’ve had a chance to check it out—our math checks out. We’re going to bring more money in and we’re going to be spending in places that are so desperately in need. People are fine with that.", "People don’t want to go to the hospital and be treated in a hallway. People don’t want to have mouth pain and know that they can’t even get their tooth pulled until there’s an abscess; they have to have a disease before they can get treatment. People want what’s best for their kids. They want affordable child care. They also want affordable housing. They want to be able to look around their community and see that there is a way forward. We don’t see that in this budget, quite frankly.", "Speaker, I’m going to shift because we haven’t had too much of a conversation about developmental services that I’ve heard in this room. I have had a number of meetings with folks who work in this sector, with families who are standing patiently in the Passport line, with management, and with the caregivers on the front lines. I want to share a little bit about that.", "First, I had met with OASIS—when we’re looking at the management side of developmental services—and they are very concerned. They are concerned about the increased administrative burden, that they won’t be able to give the training that is needed, and that folks will not be able to provide that specialized, individualized care when they just can’t meet the staffing needs. The lack of funding to this sector means delays to infrastructure repairs, and the maintenance of homes is being delayed. We’re just pushing this further and further down the field, like everything else, and we have not been investing in developmental services. If you can’t appropriately staff, then you can’t appropriately care.", "What I heard from the front lines, from CUPE members in developmental services—they spoke at length about the complex needs, and they don’t have the training that they require. Sitting them down in front of computer screens and giving them an online workshop is not the same as appropriate training when the needs of our community members that they serve are increasingly complex. It’s far more demanding. You see increasing need and decreasing morale. Speaker, that is not what we should imagine when we think about our vulnerable community members who need strong and supportive developmental services.", "I’m going to read some quotes from, like I said, the front lines, from CUPE members who are in developmental services. Here’s one from a direct support worker: “Basically, they’re cutting away all the extras. They’re leaving us enough time to feed, shower, clean—you know, the basic necessities—but all the extra stuff like going to hockey games, all the stuff that makes our guys part of a community, is being taken away slowly until they’re going to be housebound.”", "Another one from a group home support worker: “The price of everything in group homes has gone up—food, hydro, heating, insurance, the cost of maintaining vehicles, taxes, health and safety equipment.... But the funding from the province for my agency doesn’t take any of this into account.”", "Another one from a developmental services worker: “This work [with people with developmental disabilities] is all about consistency. But staff turnover here is high because the pay is so poor. We’ve been making the same hourly wage since 2007. Families would be appalled.”", "And another one, because we’ve got the time and I’ve got an audience, and I’m so inclined: A vocational instructor said: “The employer’s financial inability to hire new staff, coupled with cuts in hours for part-time employees ... makes it impossible for us to provide the personal support that clients need. At the same time, employers are—at least ours is —looking at increasing the staff-to-client ratios in day programs.”", "Lastly, from another vocational instructor: “[The agency I work for] is looking at expanding their services to include clients with mental health issues.... Mixing clients with a primarily developmental disability with clients that primarily have a mental health disorder isn’t good. The two groups require different kinds of support, and we are trained to support with individuals with a developmental disability, not mental health disorders. Nor will employers have the ability to educate us to work with mental health clients.... More clients and staff will be put at risk of violence.”", "When it comes to providing the care with dignity and with resources, we are falling short in this province. We are falling short when it comes to developmental services. We are falling short when it comes to our classrooms.", "I had met with CUPE 218 a while back, when it came to the issue of violence in our schools. I have spoken at length about this. When I met with the CUPE workers—there are an astronomical number of violent incidents that the front lines are seeing. Where is the commitment to hire and properly resource? When it comes to PTSD and stress-related leave, there need to be fewer appeals. We’re catching on that these are stressful work environments and that people are legitimately suffering and struggling.", "In this budget, again, we don’t see enough. We see some funding, but how far will that go? Not far enough, when this government has chosen for the last 15 years to neglect all of our different ministries, all of our different care systems, be it developmental services, be it health care or dental care. Goodness, I didn’t even talk about pharmacare. But don’t worry, Speaker. I have a lot to say, and I’ll save it for another day.", "When it comes to all of our care sectors, this government has chosen to neglect them, and now they are pretending that they care. They’re going to throw a couple of dollars at it, and they’re going to cut a ribbon and have a parade for it. Nobody is buying it. It is time for change; it is time for change for the better. People deserve a better Ontario. It’s not just that they want it; they know that it is possible, and they will have it." ],

But I appreciate her passion and her dedication to those issues.", "I do have to disagree with her on the substance of the things that she said. One of the arguments that the member made, and that others have made, is that suddenly, the government awoke to the challenges that the people of Ontario are facing, and suddenly, in this budget, at the last minute, decided to invest in services that are important to people.", "First of all, that’s not true. If we look back, the facts indicate that that’s not true. In the previous budget, we invested significantly in hospitals. We had the $7-billion booster shot for health care. We increased hospital funding. Over the past number of budgets, if you look at the amount of money we have invested in community care, that number continues to rise. It’s one of the fastest-growing parts of the provincial budget. The health care budget as a whole continues to grow, and so on and so forth.", "We’ve invested in mental health. We’ve invested in infrastructure. We’ve invested in all of those services that the member opposite has been talking about, and this budget just continues along that trend.", "Certainly, there are some new initiatives in this budget: pharmacare for seniors—I think that’s great news; funding to help people cover the cost of dental care; increases in community care funding; increases in mental health funding. The increase in mental health funding brings that investment to more than $17 billion over four years. How can anyone argue that this is something we suddenly started doing now? This is something we’ve been working on for some time.", "I think there are some really important initiatives in this budget that touch on the issues that the member from Oshawa was talking about. I think it’s important for the member, and the members opposite of both opposition parties, to recognize that this is the continuation of a trend where this government continues to try to address the priorities of Ontarians." ],

We had the Ontario Volunteer Service Awards—two sessions in Elgin and one in Brockville—so we were able to recognize hundreds of volunteers in the community.", "I also had a visit from my leader, Doug Ford, at rallies in Brockville and a whistle stop in Gananoque, and also two visits to two industries—two job creators in my riding—Northern Cables and Canarm. The member for Renfrew–Nipissing–Pembroke, as our labour critic, toured Northern Cables with me, and I know some of the concern that they’ve expressed with this government’s policies.", "I look forward to the Auditor General—she’s going to be presenting her pre-election report—and I really hope that for a change this government embraces what she says and doesn’t wage war against her. There’s an incredible appetite for change. We saw it last week with Doug Ford’s visit to my riding. A lot of people are really looking for a government that recognizes and respects the taxpayer dollar and doesn’t just decide, after 15 years of waste, scandal, and mismanagement, that they’re going to look at voters in Ontario and say, “We’re not going to spend your money unwisely, and we really, really mean it this time.” It’s pretty rich, coming from this government.", "I can’t wait to hear the Auditor General’s recommendations.

Time permitting, I will be focusing my comments on important initiatives as they relate to the justice portfolio that I’m responsible for. I’ll be speaking about things, like community justice centres, that the budget speaks about. Then, hopefully, if I have some time, I also want to highlight some of the important initiatives that are taking place in my community of Ottawa Centre as a result of a strong, progressive, bold plan that is outlined in this budget.", "Overall, this budget recognizes the sacrifices families must make and the value of the care they provide, but it also speaks to how our government intends to improve the circumstances of the many vulnerable and marginalized people who come into contact with the justice system. Today, I would like to talk about how the province is continuing its efforts to transform and modernize the criminal justice system by developing an integrated strategy that brings together various sectors, including health, social services and the justice sector.", "We know that many people in Ontario—people facing mental health issues, addiction, poverty and homelessness—will also find themselves in contact with our justice system. And far too often, these individuals will fall into a cycle that includes arrest, charges, court and jail. These are not isolated instances. They are the result of an intersection of complex socio-economic, health and historic factors. As the Attorney General, Speaker, I would like to stand before you today and say that the justice system is well equipped to deal with all of these people, but that is not the truth, and the truth is not that simple. Although police officers and corrections staff, lawyers and judges do amazing work, they are hard pressed to manage issues that, at their core, are social and health issues.", "It has become clear to our government that what is needed now is the increased integration of policing, justice and corrections services with health and social services. To be fair, community safety and well-being demands that we find innovative ways to hold people accountable for the harm they cause, yet we still need to address the underlying factors that lead to conflict with the law. That is why, in this budget, our government is investing in community justice centres. This investment is something I place a great deal of hope in.", "Community justice centres will improve outcomes for offenders and their communities by working to address the root causes of crime and criminal behaviour. We know this because the model has proved effective in 70 communities around the world, communities that vary in size, cultural and ethnic backgrounds, and even legal traditions. What works is the idea of placing everything in one place, a justice hub, putting restorative and therapeutic courts with culturally relevant, community-based triage and case management services. That means having judges, crowns, duty counsel and probation workers on-site with social workers, nurses, and mental health and addictions staff, as well as indigenous court workers, in our communities.", "Last year, I had the opportunity to travel to Brooklyn, New York, to visit the Red Hook Community Justice Center, a community justice centre that has been in operation for 20 years. It was incredible to see a former school building transformed into a place where an intake officer can guide a vulnerable offender to the services he or she needs most, where a judge can put an arm around a man’s shoulder and ask how his addiction treatment is going and how his children are doing. Speaker, I saw that first-hand taking place at the Red Hook Community Justice Center. This particular community in Brooklyn, New York, at one time in the 1980s, was known as the crack capital of the United States, with drugs, drug-related crime, and the devastation of families everywhere, to the point where even once, in a gang rivalry, a school principal was shot and killed. That’s when the community, along with the New York government, came together and said, “We need to do something different,” and hence came the Red Hook Community Justice Center.", "Since then, inch by inch, day by day, the community, along with the community justice centre, has been working to focus on individuals and some of the core health and social issues they may be going through, and to assist them—not just penalize them, but assist them to live a better life.", "The result is that this community justice centre, this court, is thriving. Better services are being provided for people who may be engaged in low-level crime but actually are dealing with issues around social service safety networks, homelessness or poverty.", "The community is thriving as a result as well. We did a walk-around in the neighbourhood. It was incredible to see businesses opening up. It was incredible to see people smiling and feeling safe walking on the streets. They were really proud to highlight that the largest IKEA in New York City has opened up in Red Hook, creating hundreds of jobs. They were really proud to highlight the first Tesla dealership in New York City has opened in Red Hook, creating jobs.", "That’s the magnitude of the difference we’re talking about. It has taken them a couple of decades to get there, but nonetheless, it’s quite telling in terms of the right direction they are moving forward in. That is the essence of a community justice centre: to put people first.", "The question we asked in my ministry was: Could community justice centres improve how we are delivering justice in certain communities in Ontario? Starting in 2017, a project team from my ministry embarked on a month-long needs assessment process in Kenora, in London and in Toronto’s Moss Park neighbourhood.", "With satisfaction, I can say that my ministry received and continues to receive strong support for doing justice differently in these communities. These needs assessment meetings were successful. People came from all different aspects of service provision in terms of health and social services, education, justice—folks who work in the community day in and day out—to tell us how something like this can help their particular community and could result in better outcomes.", "The investment put forward in this budget bill, if passed, will create three unique community justice centres in three different communities. At this moment, I would like to outline for the members present just how these three centres will operate.", "In Kenora, the criminal justice system has quite literally become a holding place for indigenous peoples from the northwest who face multiple challenges rooted in intergenerational trauma and colonialism.", "Our government’s response has been to work very closely with local indigenous organizations and First Nations leadership to develop a bicultural community justice centre. This centre would be the first of its kind in Ontario and would provide parallel criminal and indigenous restorative justice processes. By putting both processes in one space, this model will support access to culturally appropriate programs and services and could help to reduce the number of incarcerated indigenous people and remove barriers to accessing justice.", "We are further extending the reach of the centre and exploring opportunities to establish satellite hubs in Sioux Lookout and Timmins to better serve the unique needs of those in remote northern communities.", "Toronto’s Moss Park is not far from here and is a very different community than the one in Kenora. It is a vibrant neighbourhood, but this area of Toronto’s eastern downtown presents some of the city’s highest rates of crime and of priority calls to our police. The result: Area jails and emergency rooms have become holding places for community members with acute addictions and mental health needs.", "To help local justice and social service partners address the contributing factors related to crime in this area, we will work closely with local health authorities and service providers to create an urban community health and justice centre. Through information-sharing and on-site coordinator services, the centre will seek to promote continuity of care, which means increased access to harm reduction and therapeutic justice solutions in order to address the complex factors that lead to criminal behaviour.", "Moving on to southwestern Ontario, Speaker, London’s criminal justice system is also responding to a high-priority population: transition-aged young adults, those young people between the ages of 18 and 25 years old. In London, this group accounts for a disproportionate share of criminal charges. Compared to the rest of the province, London has some of the highest numbers of at-risk young adults. More often, these young adults are falling through the cracks once they age out of child protection or teen-focused social and health services. By working with local youth service providers, we are creating a youth-in-transition community justice hub. This innovative centre will focus on preventative interventions aimed at building abilities and self-esteem, and creating purpose for young adults.", "Speaker, as you can see, these are exciting and innovative solutions. But I do want to be clear that these centres will not replace the existing court system. Instead, they will work in conjunction with courts to provide holistic and targeted justice solutions while balancing public safety. This is the beginning of an important journey to bring criminal justice, social service integration and community together in a way that Ontario hasn’t seen before.", "You can see, also, Speaker, that each one of these proposed community justice centres is unique. They are unique because their design is a result of looking at the data and looking at the evidence and the kind of challenges faced by that local community. They are designed by listening to the service providers, not just in the justice and law enforcement sector but other members of the community, who try very hard to work together, by asking them what challenges and gaps you see and how we can address them. All three of them then address the unique circumstances of the community.", "That is, in fact, the beauty of community justice centres, that although the model or the principle is the same, which is to bring all service providers under one roof, the delivery is unique. There is no one model that fits all. The delivery has to be inspired by the community based on the data and evidence. I would suggest and recommend to members that if they are interested to learn more about the potential of community justice centres and how they will look and feel, there is a chart on page 48 of the budget book that outlines a sample. There’s an infographic that outlines a model or a sample of the potential of a community justice centre and how different service providers are going to interact.", "Speaker, I also wanted to quickly talk about the bail beds program that we started as a result of the last budget and in the response to the Jordan decision, to ensure that we are creating an opportunity for those individuals who are vulnerable or low-risk to be able to be released in the community. One of the things that we learned is that a lot of people do not get bail because they don’t have housing. They live in shelter space, they may have complex needs, and therefore they are not given bail. So we created 75 bail beds across the province to create that opportunity where they could be out in the community, under supervision and getting support, but have housing to go to. Instead of being remanded in the local detention centre, they could be out in the community.", "As I said, there are 75. Some 24 of them are in Ottawa: 12 for men, run by the John Howard Society of Ottawa, and 12 for women, run by the Elizabeth Fry Society. That model has been very successful. We’re seeing a great uptake of those beds. We’re seeing these individuals doing better, in terms of working on their needs, and they are getting to the courts to appear when their hearings come up. This budget, Speaker, I’m glad to say, also speaks about expanding bail beds in northern, rural and remote communities to provide community-based supervision for higher-need individuals who would likely otherwise be held in custody pending resolution of their criminal charge. This is good news, Speaker, because now we’re targeting them even further in northern, rural and remote communities, where we know distances are even greater.", "If you take the northwest, where you’ve got a lot of indigenous offenders being brought in to Kenora, for instance, they come from remote communities, from the Far North, and their home is not there. The only solution is that they will be remanded to the local detention centre. This would allow an opportunity for them to be in a community setting, in a supervised place, and getting care while they are dealing with some of the underlying factors.", "Speaker, I know I have only a few moments left, but in the remaining time I would like to highlight another important initiative, and that is ending gender-based violence. If passed, this budget will build on our government’s commitment to create a province free of gender-based violence.", "In March, we announced a comprehensive new strategy, investing up to $242 million over three years to help support survivors and their children, and to end the cycle of violence. At its core, this is a strategy to help build a stronger system so that those who have experienced gender-based violence and those who are most at risk will be safer and receive the help they need when they need it. My own ministry heard clearly that the justice system needs to be more survivor-centric and trauma-informed, and we responded. Let me just give you two quick examples.", "In this budget, we are expanding a pilot project that provides free legal advice to survivors of sexual assault. Now any survivor, no matter where they live, regardless of how much time has passed, will have access to free legal advice when they are ready.", "Also, because violence is most likely to occur at a time of family breakdown, Ontario is also increasing funding to help survivors navigate the Family Court process. This increased investment in the Family Court Support Worker Program will support survivors who may be at a heightened risk of violence.", "Speaker, it comes as no surprise that the economy is changing rapidly and that many Ontarians are having a hard time keeping up. In this budget, we have made a deliberate choice to invest in programs that help these people, but also to invest in programs that help those who are struggling most: those vulnerable and marginalized people who have reached rock bottom and who come into contact with the justice system when they are at the lowest point in their life.", "This budget sets before the people of Ontario our government’s plan for care and opportunity for each and every person living in this province. It’s a plan that, in my view, everyone should support; a plan that I am quite proud to stand by. It is really putting things like mental health care, child care, health care and long-term care right at the core, right in the centre of delivery of important programs by the government.", "Day in and day out, these are the issues that we hear about from our communities; from my community of Ottawa Centre, where a lot of middle-class families live, a lot of the sandwich generation families live—very much like myself—whose parents are getting elderly and need more care and support, whose children are young and need an opportunity to get good care and education, and the rest of us in the middle trying to accommodate both while progressing in our own careers.", "This budget speaks right to all those people, to make sure that we have all those supports in space. For that, investment is necessary, and we’re doing that." ],

He brought up programs, he brought up models, especially in the justice system, about hubs and coordination of community services and helping victims. Certainly we are supportive of models like that. We have yet to see it really come to fruition, but it’s in the works and I appreciate that.", "He spoke about gender-based violence at the end, and I do want to bring to his attention that there has been movement. In Durham it’s called Driven, and in my riding it’s called the Bridges of Kawartha Lakes hub. They are bringing together service providers for victims of gender-based violence and they coordinate services, which is what we like to see.", "The government, under the former minister of MCSS—we worked a lot for the Rural Realities program. I don’t know if he exactly mentioned that program, but anyway, it is that format that we are encouraging. But the problem is that they push the communities, and rightly so, to create these hubs, but the fact is that now I’m getting letters that the hubs cannot survive. In fact, it’s now under threat by the government—I know it’s the Ministry of Children and Youth Services and the Ministry of Community and Social Services—that they’re not going to be able to sustain this hub model that the government had helped them initiate.", "The services they provided have been wide-ranging. It’s effective. They need assistance for one full-time person. This is going to be province-wide. I’m giving you two examples right now, but that has been neglected. Again, to the government: You start programs, but there are no ongoing initiatives to continue the programs. You know violence against women is rising when one in six women is affected every day in Canada. So I say to the government: Start a program and continue it." ],

We need to look at those pathways. We need to look at the people and to make sure that we are putting systems in place that support them all the way along.", "When we’re talking about increased integration, that’s wonderful. I just did a 12-hour ride-along with our DRPS human trafficking division, and it was excellent, because other folks on the ride-along with came from the social work sector. There was a fantastic woman from Bethesda House; she was actually interfacing and working with the women who are trapped in this net and trapped in this horrible nightmare. She is reaching in and helping those women to get out. The police are doing phenomenal work as well, but they are doing it alongside each other. This world was the most horrible thing I have ever seen, and yet I’m so hopeful because of that integration and the potential to help.", "As long as we put the people first, as the minister said—but remember, this was a budget that didn’t even use the term “child poverty.” If we’re going to talk about putting people first, we have to look at their entire justice needs, from the beginning. We do need to talk about affordable housing. We need to talk about supporting our students in school all the way along. We need not just deterrence, but supports all the way so that folks cannot find their way into the justice system, or fewer folks do.", "I understand that this is a massive undertaking.

That’s not to say there isn’t more work to be done—not at all, of course—but there is some significant progress that has been made over the last number of years.", "I remember being with the Attorney General and a number of others, looking at how smaller and smaller numbers of young people are reoffending. A lot of that has to do with the reforms that we’ve put in place, where we’re no longer incarcerating young people as often as we used to. Instead, we’re trying to provide them with the supports that they need to be able to rebuild their lives, to re-integrate in society and to get the mental health supports that they need, if that’s appropriate. These are the kinds of things that the Attorney General and others have been leading, and I think that that is something to be very proud of.", "When the members opposite question the commitment and question the progress that has been made, I think there is a lot of tangible progress that has been made if you actually look at the facts. I compliment the Attorney General on that work. I think it’s very, very important.", "I would also say that when you look at this budget and you look at how we continue to make investments in those things that provide young people with the best possible start in life so that they don’t encounter the justice system, so that they have success, they achieve their potential in life and they’re less likely to be part of any kind of justice process—that means child care, that means a good start in life, that means education at the elementary and high school level, that means post-secondary opportunities and opportunities in the trades, that means good jobs, all of those things. When young people succeed, they don’t encounter the justice system. When they don’t encounter the justice system, we don’t need to be as concerned about it.

In 2003, spending was $68 billion. I think the question that the people of Ontario are going to be asking, when you increase the budget spending by over two and a quarter times in the last 15 years, that the spending has gone up by that much—they are going to ask themselves, “Are we doing any better here in Ontario under this government in 15 years?” The reality is no.", "But I’ll tell you who is doing better in Ontario: people like David Herle. David Herle is doing all right: sole-source contracts from the Liberal government to service them, and then he becomes the campaign chair and he is sent out to insult the leader of the Progressive Conservative Party. So the people in Ontario like David Herle, who have been enriched by secret deals and sole-source contracts by the Liberal government, are doing very well.", "When you start to add up the $150 billion in spending, the question that needs to be asked for those people who are hurting in Ontario—who they finally recognized after 15 years and are now trying to buy their votes by bringing in all kinds of programs at the last dying gasp of this government, trying to make a Hail Mary pass to try to survive. Now, they want to spend this money. But where has the money gone other than to the David Herles of this province in the last 15 years? That’s the question they should be answering." ],

In this budget, 1.8 million hard-working Ontarians will see their taxes go up, 1.8 million people who carefully save their money and work hard to earn a living and who will now have to fund government waste.", "But it’s not just individuals who will be paying more to the government. Some 20,000 businesses will also see a tax increase, another burden added to them by a government that continually makes it harder and harder for them to operate in Ontario. Businesses cannot afford to continue to pay all these additional costs. That means that we all pay. Businesses can’t afford to hire more people. Prices go up. Our communities lose these important local resources that often help fund sports teams and community events.", "To make things worse, even with these increased taxes, they are still running large deficits. They promised a balanced budget, but in this budget, the government breaks that promise with a $6.7-billion deficit this year, and deficits for the next six years—six more years.", "As you know, Mr. Speaker, interest on the debt alone is $12.5 billion this year, more than $1 billion a month just to service the debt, with more debt being added annually if the government continues to run deficits.", "In 2012, the Premier was on record as saying, “I think everyone here knows that eliminating the deficit is the most important thing we can do to move to economic growth.”", "In 2014, she said, “I actually believe that fiscal prudence and a strong economy are connected. I think that they are absolutely connected, and that’s why we have remained committed to our elimination of the deficit by 2017-18.”", "What has changed, that the Premier now thinks a deficit is the right answer for the future of Ontario? Why has the government decided to blow the budget this year, when, last year, they were boasting about balance? Is it because, in a few weeks, we’re going to have an election?", "The people in my riding aren’t asking the government to run a deficit. Later this morning, a whole group of my constituents will be here to deliver a message to the government, and they aren’t here to ask the government to spend more money. They’re concerned about the waste in this province, both in the government and the waste being sent to landfills.", "I’ve been consistently raising concerns about landfills in this Legislature through petitions, statements, questions, and in debate. However, the government doesn’t seem to be listening.", "As you know, Mr. Speaker, in my riding, there’s a proposed landfill in Beachville on fractured limestone near the Thames River and close to one of the town of Ingersoll’s main wells. Should this landfill be built, our water would be at risk of contamination.", "There is nothing in this budget to address the waste problem in this province or to provide solutions that can ensure that landfills are not pushed on unwilling hosts.", "Earlier this year, I introduced the Respecting Municipal Authority Over Landfilling Sites Act, which would allow municipalities to have a voice in the location of proposed landfills. If passed, my bill would ensure that landfills only go ahead when waste companies can earn community approval. This is about respect for municipalities and their residents. Ontarians are tired of governments forcing everything from wind farms to landfill sites down their throats. There is support for my bill across Ontario. Last fall, the mayor of Ingersoll came to Queen’s Park to request this authority as part of the committee hearings on Bill 139, Building Better Communities and Conserving Watersheds Act. Following his committee presentation, I put forward an amendment that would have ensured that garbage from other communities cannot be forced on unwilling host municipalities, but the government, of course, voted it down. In fact, over 30 municipalities have passed resolutions of support, and a further 150 municipal leaders have signed petitions demanding the right to approve landfills in their communities and are in the process of passing similar motions in their own councils. This is a priority for people, and yet there isn’t even a mention of it in the government budget.", "Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned previously, the Premier said that eliminating the deficit is important to grow the economy. Yet, despite all the job losses we’ve already seen in Ontario, they have introduced a budget in which they have deliberately chosen to run a massive deficit, and they are predicting deficits for six years. I’m concerned about the impact it could have on our economy, provincially and in my riding of Oxford.", "Jobs and economic growth are a priority for the residents of my riding. Last year, 1,500 people were laid off as a result of businesses leaving Oxford because government policies made it harder to operate in Ontario. One business in my riding had been operating in Oxford for 81 years, but the government kept adding so many new burdens and costs that they made the decision to close the local factory and increase operations in one of their American facilities. Last fall, 2,800 auto workers at the CAMI plant went on strike, trying to keep their jobs in Ontario, worried that the government was driving their jobs out of the province. That’s an issue that they think should be a government priority.", "Residents in Oxford take pride in their local businesses and locally made products. In fact, in my recent newsletter survey, 96% of respondents said they shop local to support local businesses, something that I agree is very important.", "In the wake of these layoffs and strikes, I launched a Shop Local, Buy Local initiative to highlight Oxford businesses and encourage residents to shop at their local stores and look for local produce and products. With a strong agriculture industry in my riding and many great shops in the communities all throughout Oxford, you don’t have to look very far to find what you’re looking for.", "A number of municipalities in my riding also passed resolutions supporting my Shop Local, Buy Local campaign and encouraging the provincial government to support small, local businesses to make it easier for businesses to operate in Ontario. Unfortunately, this budget misses the mark. In fact, it puts part of that industry at risk.", "Mr. Speaker, I’m concerned that this budget talks about high-speed rail but doesn’t contain a real commitment to a full and open consultation. The government is proposing a limited environmental assessment that won’t look fully at items like alternate routes. As you know, the proposed Toronto-Windsor rail corridor primarily runs through agricultural land and the proposed route would also mean the closure of many level crossings at country side roads that are important for the production and delivery of farm products and for emergency vehicles such as fire trucks and ambulances to arrive at emergencies.", "I’m supposed to stop because my time is consumed for today. I’ll be back next week." ],

I said this morning that, as the city wakes up, there are family and friends of this horrible tragedy and the victims themselves who have survived whose lives will never be the same. Our hearts reach out to them and we desperately want to give them some comfort. As Mayor Tory said last night, that desire to comfort can perhaps help us all in Toronto and beyond to be a bit kinder and a bit more gentle with each other today and in the days to come. In my role as Premier, it is my responsibility to ensure that any provincial resources that are needed to cope with the ongoing investigation and security measures are available. I want to report to Torontonians and Ontarians that that is happening.", "I was briefed again first thing this morning. Our provincial security officials continue to work hand in hand with federal and municipal officials.

When you look at the economy of the province, Speaker, you’ll see an economy that is growing stronger. Unemployment is at the lowest it has been in almost 20 years.", "When you look at how we’re doing compared to other jurisdictions, you’ll find that Ontario, as a subnational jurisdiction, still is leading the G7 in economic growth. There are some pretty powerful members in the G7, places like the UK, Japan and the United States—leading economies.", "As a government, what we’ve done is work very hard to increase fairness in the workplaces, but there’s still more that we can do, and that’s what Bill 53 is about. Bill 53, at its core, is really all about ensuring that we protect workers’ wages when they work on contracts that are let by the government of Ontario. What that simply means is that workers are going to be paid a fair rate when they work on a contract that is let by this government, by the government that is here in the province of Ontario. It means that if you work on one of these projects, in either construction and building services, building cleaning, or any one of those sectors, you’ll be paid fairly. That’s the overall intent of the bill. It’s that simple.", "It’s about preventing employers from undercutting workers’ wages in order to provide a lowball bid on provincial projects. Bill 53 enshrines the principle of a fair prevailing wage in law, as well as provides the necessary supports and enforcements that we need at the Ministry of Labour to make it work.", "Enforcement is so important. What you want is compliance, obviously. You want people to be able to understand the law; then you want them to be able to comply with the law; and they need to know what they need to do to comply with the law. The vast majority of businesses in the province of Ontario—good, decent organizations—want to comply with the law. They want to be productive. They want to treat their employees well, and they want to earn a good profit.", "There are some where enforcement is needed. There are some companies still in the province of Ontario that somehow think they’re beyond the law, that the law applies to somebody else but not to them. That’s where we need the supports, and that’s where we need the enforcement to make sure this works.", "Within the Ministry of Labour, obviously, we’re used to performing that function. We need a sector within the Ministry of Labour that’s going to help set that fair wage. It’s going to base that information on collective agreements that are out there today, and ensure that contractors stick to what the fair wage is set at. It’s a fair way of doing things, and it’s the right thing to do.", "What the bill would do, if passed, is enable the government to set a fair wage policy. It would establish minimum rates of pay for work that’s performed by contractors or by individuals under certain government contracts.", "Right now, we do have a fair wage policy in the province of Ontario. It sets wage rates for employees who are working on government contracts in certain sectors of industries, like the construction industry; industrial, commercial and institutional, which people often refer to as the ICI sector; and things like sewers, water mains and roads, as well as the rates for protection, security or the cleaning services that are contained in those buildings.", "The current policy is contained in an order in council. What that order in council does, amongst a host of many other things, is that it establishes the scope of the policy. It gives the Ministry of Labour the authority to issue schedules and to set out hourly wage rates for certain classes of employees. It also requires that contracts to which the policy applies include provisions mandating that the contractors who are successful pay employees at least at the fair wage rate. So it establishes a floor; it doesn’t establish a ceiling. The current policy applies to contracting ministries and to certain agencies.", "Speaker, the fair wage schedules established under the current policy—three for construction and one for building services—run approximately 100 pages in length. They detail very specific wage rates in support of certain trades in certain geographic areas of this province. Unfortunately, these wage rates and these schedules that exist have not been revised since 1995, and the rates, as you will understand, Speaker, may be a little outdated. When you think of what’s happened in the economy since 1995, you would have seen a few changes in government; you would have seen a recession in the middle of all that; you would have seen the advent of technology that just didn’t exist in 1995. Quite simply, it’s a much different economy, and the wage rates and the wage schedules would not apply to today’s modern economy. A growing number of those schedules are now below the current minimum wage.", "The prescribed enforcement mechanism in the current policy relies on claims and it relies on holdback processes. It’s just not appropriate for the procurement models and practices that we have today, and it’s not appropriate for the complex funding models that we have today for government contracts.", "In addition, three of the four agencies that existed in 1995 in the current fair wage policy no longer exist today. Those three agencies—people might remember if they go back in their memory a little bit—that no longer exist are the ORC, the Ontario Realty Corp.; the Ontario Housing Corp.; and the Ontario Transportation Capital Corp. Of the four that are named, only the Ontario Clean Water Agency continues to operate today.", "Speaker, if you look over that period of time since 1995, you’ll see the way that the government purchases—the procurement policies and the practices that it has today—has changed very, very significantly. Previously, ministries once were more likely to directly engage in infrastructure procurement themselves in things like construction and building services. Today, in 2018, most of that procurement is now managed by Infrastructure Ontario and by Metrolinx. I would like to point out that both Infrastructure Ontario and Metrolinx are not on the current list of agencies named under the fair wage policy.", "As well, Infrastructure Ontario’s practices include the use of alternative financing. In the past, it was called P3 and all sorts of other names. It’s alternative financing and procurement, and those simply did not exist in 1995. They weren’t even contemplated at the time that the current policy that’s in place was developed.", "Speaker, the Premier has committed publicly to updating Ontario’s fair wage policy, and that’s what we’re proposing to do at second reading today. I’ve reiterated this commitment to the people of Ontario as I’ve travelled around as the Minister of Labour because it aligns perfectly the proposed legislation we have before us with our goal of promoting safe, fair and very harmonious workplaces.", "Bill 53 also aligns with a broader government commitment to continue to create an innovation-driven economy. This includes the government’s role in the adoption of innovation procurement, and in helping small and medium-sized firms demonstrate that they have innovative solutions, thus improving their profile both here in Ontario, in a domestic or Canadian market, or even internationally throughout the world.", "The revised policy, though, would also support other initiatives that we’re dealing with:", "—the gender wage gap strategy: Men and women are still not paid the same. Women are paid, on average, about 70 cents for every dollar that a man earns, and that just has to change;", "—the Changing Workplaces Review that led to Bill 148, which led to the reforms that took place, I think the most extensive reforms we’ve seen in a generation;", "—the Poverty Reduction Strategy that we have in the province of Ontario; and", "—the province’s record-breaking infrastructure plan.", "All of these align with the government’s efforts as well to promote the skilled trades as a career option for young men and women who are considering a career or are trying to see what they’re going to do with their lives in the future. We hope that they look to skilled trades.", "When you look at some of the projects that are taking place, from a transportation perspective, from an infrastructure perspective; if you look at the nuclear industry right now, and the refurbishment that’s taking place at Bruce; the decommissioning, eventually, of Pickering; the refurbishment that’s taking place at Darlington, that is a career’s worth of work for young people who go into the skilled trades.", "I’d like to remind members that in our 2017 budget, the government committed to the largest infrastructure investment in Ontario’s history, and a projected $190 billion—that’s with a B, Speaker—in public-infrastructure spending over a 13-year period that commenced in 2014-15.", "You would think, Speaker, that with such a historic investment, we’ve got the moral responsibility, I believe, as a level of government, to ensure that the people we hire to carry out that work, to perform that work, on behalf of the people of Ontario are paid a good wage that reflects the value, the hard work and the effort that they put into our projects.", "With that in mind, we’ve introduced this legislation, Bill 53, which empowers that government to create a new fair wage policy. In reality, it is a revised fair wage policy that is relevant to current government procurement activities, initiatives and practices today. It demonstrates the government’s commitment to an updated policy on fair wages in certain government procurements.", "What the legislation would do, if it was passed, is it would enable the government to develop a new policy on fair wages in government procurement for those certain construction projects, and for things like the cleaning of our buildings, the maintenance of our buildings, and security services. What the aim is, what the target is, is permitting flexibility, and minimizing any disruption at all to existing procurement practices.", "What we intend to do through this legislation, if passed, is we intend to achieve the objective I just outlined by enabling legislation, which we are debating right now.", "The following elements are addressed very, very clearly by the proposed legislation.", "It would give the authority to a person employed by the Ministry of Labour to establish minimum government contract wages by order. When you look around at other jurisdictions around the province, throughout the world, or even right here in the city of Toronto, other jurisdictions deal with this issue, and they deal with it in certain ways. Bill 53 proposes a way for the government of Ontario to deal with that.", "The orders that would be issued by the individual who performs this task would set out the minimum rates of pay for work that is performed in relation to those certain contracts I outlined, for construction projects with government entities, and for contracts for building cleaning, for security services work at government-owned and -occupied buildings and, where prescribed, buildings that are also leased by those entities as well.", "The bill would apply to certain work for government entities which are defined as a crown in right of Ontario, including any ministry of the government of Ontario, and to any public body that is prescribed under the Public Service of Ontario Act, 2006.", "The bill would also enable the addition, as prescribed by regulation, of a body or a class of bodies that directly or indirectly receive public funds.", "The bill would apply to the following types of work: work in relation to construction projects provided under contract with government entities in the following sectors of the construction industry: industrial, commercial, institutional—that ICI sector that I talked about earlier—roads, sewers, water mains and heavy engineering—all associated with the infrastructure program of this government—and people we meet on a regular basis as we all do our work here: building security services, cleaning work provided for buildings owned and occupied, or, where prescribed by regulation, that have been leased by entities of the government.", "Once applicable, minimum government wage contracts are established by order. There would be an obligation for contractors and for subcontractors to pay their employees at least these rates. In other words, Speaker, what it says is that employees who are performing work on the construction and building service contracts covered by this bill would have to be compensated at least at the wage rates established by the government. As I said before, this is the floor; it certainly is not a ceiling.", "There would be a requirement for the government to promptly publish those orders that establish those minimum government contract wages.", "It provides for enforcement for unionized workers through the grievance process, and for non-unionized workers by way of complaint to the Ministry of Labour, should they feel a contravention has occurred. Complaints would be dealt with by the director of employment standards and also by employment standards officers, and the relevant provisions of the Employment Standards Act, 2000, that have been incorporated into the bill by reference would also apply during those enforcements or during the investigation of those complaints.", "Anti-reprisal protection for employees is something that I hear a lot of at the Ministry of Labour. It’s one thing to grant an employee or a citizen of Ontario the right to make a complaint or to assert those rights; it’s another thing if you have employers who decide, as a result of an individual asserting their rights, that they are going to fire them or they are going to treat them in a way that’s different from other employees. In this act, there will be very, very clear anti-reprisal protection for those employees who find, unfortunately, that they need to assert their rights. This is built right into the bill.", "It would authorize the appointment of a director of government contract wages. That individual would have the authority to establish, to amend or, from time to time, even to revoke orders setting minimum government contract wages, and the authority to establish a list of employers or directors who have contravened the act.", "It would also permit the creation of a regulation-making authority to enable, among other things, changes to the scope of the legislation, including, for instance, if need be, the exemption of government entities or of certain classes of work as workplaces change.", "Speaker, this is what our proposed legislation would do, and I think I have explained that in some detail; I may have even put some people to sleep in that explanation. But there is a reason we did it. There is a reason we did that. So that is the “how,” Speaker, and maybe it’s time to talk about the “why.” Why would we bring this in, and why would it not be supported by the opposition parties, for example?", "In doing so, I intend to quote extensively from a report on fair wage policy in the province of Ontario. It was authored by Morley Gunderson. Anybody who is around the field of labour relations and employment standards would know that name very, very well, and would have a variety of opinions. It was delivered to the Minister of Labour in January 2008.", "Mr. Gunderson is a very highly regarded economist. He does international work as well. He is an academic. I believe he even had a role to play in the Changing Workplaces Review. What Mr. Gunderson specializes in, where he has got very, very special interests, is in the labour markets impact of trade liberalization and globalization and what that means to our economies, what certain changes in trade agreements might mean; gender discrimination—why are women still today, in most of the world, paid 70 cents for each dollar that’s earned by a man? He looks at things like youth unemployment, minimum wages, retirement and pension issues, workers’ compensation and disability issues.", "There is a little bit of a history that goes along with this. This is not a novel or a new idea. In 1936, Ontario enacted fair wage legislation—1936, Speaker. This legislation was not repealed until 2001. I don’t have to tell you who repealed it, Speaker. For decades prior to the repeal, the government’s fair wage policy was implemented not under the authority of the legislation, but as a matter of contract where the government retained private sector employees to undertake certain types of work. That’s the approach that continues to be used today. There was a fair wage policy that was put in place; however, it is currently regarded as not being effective, as the schedules have not been updated since 1995.", "Market conditions have dictated that the wages paid, naturally, just in the course of events, are invariably well above what are the existing scheduled minimum rates. In fact, as I said earlier, some of those wage rates in that fair wage policy that exists today have fallen under the current minimum wage of $14 an hour.", "So now is the time to begin establishing an effective fair wage policy, working with stakeholders, working with people who have a specific interest in this, talking to employers, with organized labour. Now is the time to move forward on a fair wage policy that is relevant to the economy of today, to the procurement practices that are used by the government in 2018 and beyond.", "I think it shows a commitment to fairness to those people, who, when they get up in the morning and come to work, come to work for a contractor that is working for the government of Ontario. I don’t think there’s any side of the House, regardless of whether they’re going to support this bill or not, that doesn’t feel that people who are working should be fairly compensated for that work. I think that’s a universal part of life in Ontario and the lifestyle that we enjoy. We believe that nobody who is working full-time in the province of Ontario should live in poverty. We believe the government has a responsibility to address precarious employment and to protect Ontario workers by updating the province’s labour and employment laws.", "The Fair Workplaces, Better Jobs Act, 2017, or Bill 148, was introduced to create more opportunity and security for Ontario workers. At the same time, it modernized our labour laws to help businesses and to help the economy grow. Certainly, every indication is that despite many naysayers—many economists, the Fraser Institute and others who were talking about doom and gloom and how the economy was simply going to crumble—that hasn’t been the case, Speaker. The economy is healthy. Young people are facing employment prospects for this summer coming up.", "If you read the Spectator in Hamilton or you read the Globe and Mail article that was out today and others, Speaker, young people have a choice of jobs. It’s quite clear in the one article that if you’re a young person in Hamilton and you want a summer job, you’ve got one. In fact, you’ve got your pick of the jobs.", "Many businesses—the Better Way Alliance, for example—across the province have come out in support of our plan because they know that it helps them attract employees, it reduces the labour turnover, and it encourages employees to become more invested in the business and to have a sense of ownership in the business themselves.", "The same sentiment that drives the thinking behind the Fair Workplaces, Better Jobs Act also holds true for creating and using a fair wage policy. Just as government has a responsibility to address precarious, low-paying, vulnerable work, the government, I believe, also has a responsibility to set an example to ensure that workers who are working on government construction projects, workers who provide the cleaning for the buildings we work in, the security services to those government-owned and -occupied buildings that we work in as well, are paid fairly for their work.", "We, as a government, have a responsibility to ensure the contracting work in these areas does not result in that race to the bottom that we’ve seen in other jurisdictions, that race to the bottom that could result as prospective contractors trying to attain a government contract cut wages to remain competitive or cut wages in order to win that contract.", "Government business should benefit all: the citizens who pay for the work, the taxpayers of the province of Ontario, but also the citizens, the people, the taxpayers of the province of Ontario who perform that work as well. We often forget that, Speaker. We often think of them as two different people. The people who work for our contractors are taxpayers in the province of Ontario. They’re taxpayers who live and work and raise families here. What this does is, it ensures that they’re paid fairly.", "There are a number of arguments that are clearly in favour of a fair wage policy. It prevents, as I said just a few minutes ago, that race to the bottom that we’ve seen around the world as globalization takes hold. It certainly is seen by some as a way to secure contracts, to simply try to pay people less. As members can imagine, the bidding process in construction often leads those contractors to compete on wages, with workers paying the price so that their employers can try to win those contracts.", "What it does is create a level playing field for all those excellent contractors in the province of Ontario. A fair wage policy would help prevent contractors from competing for bids by lowering wages below applicable minimum contract wage rates that could be established by the passage of this legislation.", "Secondly, our proposed legislation reduces accidents. It reduces accidents by encouraging contractors to use more trained workers now that they’re paying a higher wage rate. It ensures that they have the ability to put into their own practices work practices that comply with the Occupational Health and Safety Act, so that we’re not using health and safety as a shortcut to a lower price.", "We all know that the more experienced a worker is, the more training they’ve had, whether it be an apprenticeship or whether it be a skills training program; and the more experience that a young worker gets, the more likely they are to work safely. A fair wage policy enhances training. Employers who would be required to pay the applicable government contract wage rates would have a very, very clear incentive to expand that training for their own workers.", "Speaker, if you’re paying more, you expect more productivity. A well-trained worker should be more productive, and clearly is more productive. Our proposals raise the quality of work that’s performed for the government. It leads to a much higher quality of construction labour. What that leads to, as any economist will tell you, is a higher quality of construction output. Simply put, the finished job—the bridge that is left behind; the tunnel that is left behind; the building that is built—is of higher quality if trained workers are used to build it. And it’s a safer project if trained workers are used to build it.", "As I mentioned earlier, the bill and this new policy would enable us to set and also support other government initiatives. We talked about the gender wage gap—perhaps this would help attract more women into the skill trades—the Changing Workplaces Review, the Poverty Reduction Strategy, as well as the infrastructure plan; as well, as I said earlier, the government’s efforts to promote the trades as a career option for both men and women.", "Speaker, a lot of this centres around Ontario’s economy. Over the past three years, as I said a while back, Ontario’s economy has outperformed all other G7 countries in terms of real GDP growth. We’ve seen exports increase from the province, we’ve seen business investments within the province increase, and Ontario’s unemployment rate has been below the national average each month for the last 24 months.", "But the numbers do not tell the whole story. The economy is changing. The economy is constantly changing. Some people look to the future with uncertainty, and they see challenges in the future as that technological change takes place. Everybody is running to keep up. Everybody is running to get the new technology, or to invent the new technology. But as I said earlier, as we go through that upheaval that takes place when you have technological innovation like that, the government believes that nobody who works full-time in this province should live in poverty.", "The Changing Workplaces Review final report estimated that over 30% of Ontario workers were in precarious employment in 2014. We believe that a government—any government, Speaker; this is not unique to Ontario; this is right through North America—has the responsibility to address that precarious employment and to protect Ontario workers by updating the province’s labour and employment laws on a regular basis. That’s why we introduced Bill 148. When it was introduced, it was designed to create more opportunity and security, as well as modernizing our labour laws to help businesses and the economy grow. We know that that act passed in November 2017, and the people of Ontario have been very, very supportive of that act.", "Even people who don’t earn at the minimum wage levels know how important it is to those people who do earn at the lower levels, because we know that that act increased the minimum wage. It created new equal-pay-for-equal-work rules and introduced, for the first time in the province, two paid sick days for workers who had been employed by their employer. It also established card-based certification for the temporary help agency industry, the building services industry, and home care and community services industry. It extended successor rights to the retendering of building services in an attempt—as I’ve said, we were talking about a race to the bottom when it comes to wages, Speaker. Successor rights was cited as one of those things that caused the race to the bottom. It provided authority to further extend these rights to other publicly funded service providers as well.", "There again, when we talked about employment standards, a lot of people raised enforcement. As I said earlier, a lot of people—the vast majority of Ontario businesses—understand the rules and just want to obey the rules, Speaker, just want to get on with it. They understand the value of treating their employees with dignity and with respect and adhering to the rules. And they expect a lot out of their employees. They want productive employees. They want a good day’s work for a good day’s pay. Nothing wrong with that at all; I support that 100%.", "The act was introduced to ensure that all workers are treated fairly and properly, that they’re compensated fairly for their work, and that act, as I said, passed last year. It’s in the same spirit that we’re proposing a bill that, if passed, would enable the creation of a new wage policy with respect to the procurement of government construction projects and building services contracts.", "We’ve taken other steps in other bills and other initiatives in promoting fairness, equality, and support for women and others who, over the years, have experienced disadvantages when it comes to the workplace. When you see increases to the minimum wage, when you see enhanced employment protection, when you see investments in child care and education, they all go along with this initiative of treating people with fairness and taking decisive action when it comes to that fairness.", "Speaker, the women’s economic empowerment strategy was announced on March 6 by the Premier at the Women’s Empowerment Summit in Toronto. The strategy that we have is a key part of the government’s approach to building a very strong economy and a very inclusive economy in the province. We’re going to do this by removing systemic barriers that prevent, and have prevented in the past, women’s full economic participation. We’re going to do that by promoting fairer workplaces. We need to change all our perspectives about gender. We need to promote women’s leadership and access to jobs and career advancement. The number of women on boards across the province of Ontario, for example, is nowhere near what it should be.", "Across this province, women represent about 48% of the labour force—almost half. They represent more than half when it comes to university and college grads today. Yet those same women continue to experience marked economic disadvantages in our province: in business, in workplaces and in our society.", "As I said earlier, the gender wage gap in Ontario, despite everybody’s best efforts, is still, on average, about 30%, and has remained largely unchanged for the last little while. What that means is that, on average, daughters and wives and granddaughters earn 70 cents for every dollar that is earned by men in our society.", "We find that women are also more likely to reduce their hours of work, or they take part-time jobs only, because they’ve got to balance paid employment with unpaid caregiving responsibilities at home, which still fall primarily on women in our society.", "Speaker, it gets worse if you’re racialized, if you’re an immigrant, if you’re new to this country, if you’re just establishing yourself. If you’re an indigenous woman in our society or if you have a disability, it’s further exacerbated. They experience even greater disadvantages and, sadly, the wage gap gets even larger.", "Our government understands that this is unacceptable. We’re committed to developing the conditions and the supports that are needed for inclusive economic growth that helps all Ontarians realize their full potential. It’s not only a social equity and not only a fairness issue; it’s also an economic one, and our government is seizing the opportunity to take action.", "If passed, this bill and the ability to establish those minimum government contract wages for certain government construction projects and for building services contracts would work towards fair wages for everybody in the province. What we’re proposing to do in the bill is not new; it’s not radical. As I mentioned before, this goes back as far as 1936. Fair wage policies have been instituted by governments in Canada, in the United States, our neighbour to the south, and in Britain and the UK for over 100 years.", "Currently, a number of other Canadian jurisdictions—municipal, provincial, federal—as well as at the US state and federal levels also have fair wage policies. What those governments see, as we do as well, are the benefits of a fair wage policy that sets minimum government contract wages.", "Our government’s economic plan states that our number one priority is to grow the economy and to create jobs. Fair wage policies are needed in recognition of some of the more intense competition that exists in some sectors of the economy. You look at the construction, building cleaning and security services that are included in this bill. In these industries, what makes them unique is that limited-term contracts are the norm, and businesses have to compete over and over and over again. As you win the contract, the contract is performed, and you bid on the next contract. You’ve got to compete over and over and over again to win those contracts.", "As I mentioned earlier, what this policy would do is prevent contractors from competing for bids simply by lowering wages below those applicable minimum government contract wage rates that would be established. Such a policy limits the degree to which bidders can lower bids based simply on reduced labour costs.", "We’re committed to building a strong workforce that’s fair, balanced and progressive for Ontario workers and for their employers. We recognize the need that stakeholders have brought to us to update Ontario’s policy on fair wages when it comes to procurement for certain construction projects, building cleaning and security services, as outlined before. The current policy we have has simply become out of date. It needs to be updated to be effective. Stakeholders have told us that, and we agree.", "Our economic plan includes making the largest investment in public infrastructure in Ontario’s history. That’s going to create thousands of jobs for workers in many sectors across this province. What this would do is ensure that workers on those government contracts are being treated fairly. It would minimize conflicts between unionized and non-unionized labour in competition for that work. And it aligns with the government’s efforts to promote the trades to all as a career option.", "Speaker, now is not the time to go backwards or to make deep cuts to things we rely on. Now is not the time for standing in the way of the $15 minimum wage. You can’t simply just tell workers, “We’ll just let the market decide what you’re worth.” You can’t tell women, “We think you’re doing well enough right now when it comes to pay equity.” That would be Doug Ford and the PCs’ approach to things. It’s not my way; it’s not people on this side of the House. It’s not the government’s way, and it never will be.", "I, obviously, as a minister, fully support the legislation that I’m putting before you. I support any action that’s going to ensure that those who work on government contracts are paid a fair and livable wage. In fact, I’m convinced that almost all Ontarians support that policy. Our proposed legislation is going to help us to achieve this goal. I would ask, but I don’t expect, all parties to support this bill.", "I would like to now turn it over to my colleague from Eglinton–Lawrence." ],

I gleaned from his remarks a number of clarifying points that I think help to explain a bill that is inside baseball in many ways, but it is about fair wages. It’s about levelling the playing field.", "The thing is, I guess, that when a company bids on a government contract that might be unionized, and another company bids on a government contract that is not, it is possible that the non-unionized company may get the bid, because they don’t have to pay union wages, so they’ll pay the workers less. Therefore, there is an attempt to try and level the playing field, so that if someone is trying to get that government contract to do government work, at least the wages are fair. You can’t dictate the exact wage, but at least there’s a fairness there.", "I think that the essence of this bill is to ensure that workers who, through a second or third party, basically work for the government through contracts, are abiding by government wage rules.", "As the minister said, this hasn’t been updated since 1995, so there’s a need to include a lot of organizations, a lot of new workplace entities, that would not have existed back in 1995.", "He mentioned Metrolinx, which is the public transit, construction and capital project arm of the Ministry of Transportation. I know it very well, in that Metrolinx is undertaking a huge project in my own riding of Eglinton–Lawrence. They are building a rapid transit line, the Eglinton Crosstown LRT, that goes from the town of Weston along Eglinton, all the way to Scarborough. More than half of it is underground. It’s a huge tunnel that has already been built, that runs now from Jane Street all the way to Bayview Avenue. In fact, the rail is already in and the tunnels have been built.", "Above ground, there’s huge construction, because they have to build the stations. There’s major work, and very complex work that’s being done by Metrolinx through their construction arm, which is called Crosslinx.", "We want to make sure that anybody working for those entities that are building the Eglinton Crosstown, and their subcontractors—that they all pay their workers a fair wage. But right now, Metrolinx is not covered under the legislation, because they came into existence in the last 10 years. Therefore, that’s one of the reasons why we have to update this.", "I also want to mention, besides the infrastructure construction that’s going on—and the Eglinton Crosstown line is basically, I think, the largest construction project in North America right now. It’s a $6.3-billion undertaking. It is extremely complex work, moving sewer lines—conduits for electricity, for cable. It is, to say the least, a daunting task. I’ve been underneath in the tunnels, and I can’t believe how these workers are behind a computer screen, managing these tunnel-boring machines.", "On the other side of that, in my riding, the two largest employers are—I don’t know if you’ve ever been there—Yorkdale Shopping Centre. Yorkdale is at the 401 and Dufferin Avenue. It is the most profitable shopping centre in Canada, which essentially means that they’re selling all kinds of products, from clothing to computer high-tech stuff to sporting goods. They have movie theaters. They even sell Tesla cars there. If you’ve got $180,000, Mr. Speaker, you might go and buy a Tesla. I walk by and look at them, anyway.

They sell everything, as I said, from Harry Rosen clothing to Rolex watches to Tesla. But what the manager was saying to us was that when you are asking people to pay top dollar for certain products, you need highly trained sales staff. If you don’t train the staff, she was saying, and they’re not well paid, there’s going to be turnover. So by the time you train someone to deal with very complex customer needs, the costs of then turning it over to someone else are just prohibitive. What they really believe in is sales force retention. They pay them a good wage, give them good benefits. That way, they ensure they get the best productivity out of their sales force. You can imagine, sales is not as easy as it looks, as we all know. It’s a special talent.", "In Yorkdale, besides all of the cleaners and security staff, there are exceptionally well-trained salespeople and managers throughout the plaza. In fact, Yorkdale is really like a tourist destination now. People come for the weekend. They stay in a hotel. There are restaurants there. There’s a food court that none of us here could afford—no, but there are some reasonable—you can still get a hamburger. But anyway, it is an exceptional food court, restaurants, movie theaters—the whole spectrum. Those are the new kinds of jobs. There’s a major employer that pays people for expert work.", "I also have another excellent employer that would come under this: Baycrest hospital. Baycrest hospital started off as a nursing home for seniors, an old age home. It existed here in downtown Toronto. It was done by the Jewish community to house their seniors, then it moved up to Bathurst and the 401. Not only does it provide an old age home and a retirement home, but it also provides cutting-edge research into brain health. There are even top-notch scientists working there, along with the PSWs, the nurses, the doctors, the cleaners. Baycrest is another major employer, whereby through government funding, they undertake all kinds of government initiatives.", "This fair wage policy would apply to all these workplaces, ensuring that if they get government money, there is a fair wage policy in place that they adhere to. That is, I think, very important, because if we’re passing laws that govern the $15 minimum wage and fair workplace rules like paid vacation and equal pay for equal work, as we’ve done with Bill 148, it only makes sense that we also have this fair wage policy for anyone who undertakes work under a government contract.", "These contracts are being let out on a continual basis, and it’s not only for construction projects, infrastructure projects, road repairs, road maintenance and bridge repairs, but also, as the minister said, for security services in all these buildings. More and more you have to also have security in a workplace. You also have to have cleaning services.", "We have cleaning services here in this building. We’ve got some excellent cleaners who work here. I know that they are very dedicated, hard-working men and women who are very conscientious. All these government-contracted entities also employ not only the construction people, but also the security services, the cleaners and all kinds of other technicians.", "This bill ensures that there is a fair wage policy in place, so they’re not outbidding each other. Because what will happen is that one cleaning company will come in and say, “We’ll give you a great deal: Instead of this contract costing you 500,000 bucks a year, we’ll cut it down to $400,000”—but then you realize the way they’re able to undercut the competitive bid is, they’re not paying their workers as much. That’s what this tries to do when it relates to government contracts, that there is a level playing field in terms of wages. This really helps to ensure that there are fair practices taking place. This, as I said, is something that is definitely overdue since these rules have changed; the type of work has changed.", "This legislation also creates a director of government contract wages who has the authority to establish minimum rates of pay for work performed in relation to certain government contracts in construction and building services, and establish and maintain a registry of non-compliant employers and directors. So if there are bad actors, they’re recorded. Therefore they can keep track of them and say, “Well, listen, you’ve had a track record that isn’t very good. You want to bid for this new contract? Well, look, you haven’t been paying fairly.” That’s what he or she can do as the director of government contract wages.", "There’s an obligation for contractors—and subcontractors, too, because, remember, every contractor always has subcontractors. You want to keep some kind of continuity there for the subcontractors so you have an eye on them.", "I just wanted to mention—I don’t know what it’s like in Chatham-Kent, but I know that in Toronto, there has been such a frenzy to get things done—renovating homes, adding on extensions to a home or upgrading a facility—so there has been a huge demand for skilled trades, whether it be plumbers, pipefitters, electricians or carpenters. It is really the Wild West sometimes; you can’t find workers.", "You know what’s happening? I don’t know if it’s happening out your way, but a lot of young people are not looking at getting into the skilled trades. They don’t understand that you could make a good living in the skilled trades. You could essentially perform a trade that you could find great fulfillment in. There’s always going to be a demand for a good plumber, electrician, glazier, cement finisher or bricklayer. There’s an incredible demand, and a lot of the people that have small contracting companies say that their biggest challenge is trying to find skilled workers who will know what they’re doing and be able to perform everything from cement finishing to doing roof repairs etc. There’s such a frenzy to get things done. The homeowner or small business owner may say, “Well, listen, I’ve got to get my best price,” but never asking the questions, “Let’s see if there’s workmen’s comp coverage. You’ve got a licence? What are your references?” If you let that person into your business or your home, and something happens and they injure themselves on the job because they haven’t been trained—and the roofing business is notorious for this; people fall off roofs—you may be liable. You will be one of the ones sued if there’s an injury on the site.

Can I call a couple of people you’ve done work for before? How long have you been in business in Chatham?” You’ve got to go to tried-and-proven people. You may pay a bit more, but is the extra 10% you pay not worth it?", "There’s just such a push to get the job done at the lowest price, and that is why we need to have contractors and subcontractors that obey the same rules and not undercut the rules so they can underbid through wages etc. on getting, especially, a government contract, given the fact that there’s such a pressure—I don’t know whether there is, down Brighton way, but it’s hard to find trained, skilled people.

There’s big money to be made, you get great satisfaction, and your friends and relatives will always call upon you: “Come fix my electrical problem.” But you should consider that. Don’t just consider the white-collar jobs. There’s a great satisfaction in being an architect, a carpenter or a plumber. Those are jobs that are out there. They are always going to be there.

We’ve got over 150,000 people who work in film and television production here in the Toronto area. They produce television shows of all descriptions, but you need technicians to work there. You need lighting technicians and sound technicians.", "I ran into a woman the other day canvassing. She said she was a wrangler for a television show. I said, “What does a wrangler for a television show do?” I don’t know if my friend from Brighton understands what a wrangler does, or maybe the pages know what a wrangler is, but I didn’t know. I said, “What does a wrangler do?”" ],

There is a totally different dynamic out there. It’s totally different. That’s why this fair wage policy legislation is just updating, to make sure that the workplace and government rules and laws on equal treatment, equal wages, and fair wages and compensation are reflective of the workplace that exists, because there is no longer a static workplace with the same old people doing the same old—in Brighton, they’ve still got the blacksmith there, still working away, but these things are changing.", "In Liberty Village, as I mentioned, as the member from Trinity–Spadina knows, that’s a whole new city of 150,000 people.

There are a couple of hundred little companies all working out of an old carpet factory down there in Liberty Village, off King and Shaw and Dufferin, in that area.", "Again, that’s another example of the dynamic change that is taking place.

We get a piece of legislation that leaves a lot of questions and concerns.", "For instance, the Minister of Labour actually said—he challenged us here in the House today—“Why now? Why are we bringing Bill 53 forward now?” I’d suggest to you, Speaker, that some of us were smiling on the other side here, because it’s like, “Really?” Bringing forward Bill 53 right now is probably the most transparent thing this government has done in days. It’s because there is an election around the corner, and they’re trying to garner, and carve out, every piece of support that they can, because they know they’re in trouble. That’s why Bill 53 has been brought out now.", "I do also want to mention the fact that I heard the Minister of Labour talk about Bruce Power. I’m very proud of the fact that Bruce Power calls Huron–Bruce home—the amazing riding of Huron–Bruce. Just last week, I was there with the member from Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound as well as our leader, Doug Ford. It was an absolute pleasure to be there on site and recognize unit 8 in Bruce B. Unit 8, particularly, was recognized for the 623 days of continuous safe operations from May 31, 2016, through to February 13, 2018.

They are not happy with the performance of this government.", "You see, Speaker, I was hoping I’d get a chance to speak to the budget. The budget bill was already voted on today, because they brought in time allocation on the budget bill. Speaker, of course, through you, you can rest assured, as God is my witness, as they say, that Bill 53 will be time-allocated too. Bill 53 will be time-allocated—a bill that they brought into the Legislature and only recently introduced.", "Where was the consultation on this bill? How are we going to be able to even have a proper hearing? How are we going to be able to have proper committee hearings on a bill as extensive a labour bill as this, when it’s going to be time-allocated? In fact, I guarantee you we’ll have probably one, maybe two days of hearings; clause-by-clause will be a couple of hours. Those people who want to comment on this bill will not have the opportunity. They won’t even feel that they’re part of the conversation.", "On the issue of fair wages in contracting and also security and cleaners in government buildings, it’s interesting that, as my friend from Windsor–Tecumseh pointed out, it only applies to those people in the buildings, the security and the cleaners. This is a government building; there are more than security and cleaners. Now, the security guards that work here probably come under a different collective agreement, but for government buildings that have contracted security work with private firms, I suppose it would apply to them.", "It’s interesting that here, in 2018—the law was repealed in 2001 and has been effectively ineffective since 1995. In 2007, the government commissioned Professor Morley Gunderson from the University of Toronto to do an independent review of Ontario’s fair wage policy. Interestingly, it was received positively by both labour and management stakeholders, who generally regarded the ambiguous status of Ontario’s fair wage policy as undesirable.", "But here we are 11 years later, on the eve of an election where the Liberals are throwing every possible Hail Mary pass that they can, hoping—" ],

I would presume that all road projects on provincial highways are government projects, so this new law would apply to them.", "I had some great jobs in construction, because it was a great business. We would work long, long days on paving crews. You know the old saying: You make hay when the sun shines. Well, you make blacktop when the sun shines too. In those days, you didn’t pave at all in the rain. You could pave a little bit on gravel, but you couldn’t pave if you were doing a repaving job, because you just couldn’t get it to adhere, if it was even a little bit wet. Today, they have some better adhesives, and they’re a little bit more able to deal with light moisture and still get the blacktop laid down.", "I’ve got to tell you, my dad was an MPP for 24 years. In those days, in the 1960s and into the 1970s and 1980s, but particularly in the 1960s, there was a lot of new highway work going on, because the highway network was expanding. My dad used to say, “In an election year, there was nothin’ as beneficial as layin’ down a lot of miles of blacktop.” In rural Ontario, they were trying to grow and they were trying to expand. They needed new roads, and putting that asphalt down was very, very beneficial to the incumbent member of the Legislature, and a welcome announcement.", "My father was successful in—God, I’d better get this right—I think it was seven elections: 1963, 1967, 1971, 1975, 1977, 1981 and 1985. It was seven elections, yes. Seven elections he was successful in, because he did what the rural people in Ontario’s constituencies, his constituents, expected him to do, and that was be an honest representative at the Legislature and not be afraid to—and he was in government for 22 of those 24 years, so he had to answer for a government record. He had to answer for a government record, and that is what’s going to happen here this year. They’re going to have to answer for a government record.", "He was able to go back to those constituents. It was a smaller constituency then; the population was less. I remember my dad saying one time, “You know, John, it was the Progressive Conservatives of Renfrew South who elected me in 1963. But,” he said, “it was the Liberals who kept re-electing me, because if I did my job as an MPP, at home the good people of Renfrew South would reward me with a re-election.” That’s essentially why we come here: to represent those people of our constituencies.", "My dad loved construction; he loved construction projects. I remember that my first construction job was on the paving crew with K.J. Beamish Construction—King John Beamish. They were paving Highway 60 all the way from Whitney into Cache Lake in the middle of the park. It was about 26 miles: a big job, a big paving job. Oh, and it was hotter than the hobs of hell that summer, in 1975. Oh, man, it was a warm summer, and you were working on that paving crew.", "I’ll tell you one thing: You were in the sun all the time, and we weren’t taking the precautions that you do today, with lots of sunscreens and better ways of protecting yourself. Man, I got a lot of sun that summer. I think I might have got beaten to it, but some people might say I got too much sun that summer. The effects of it did wear off.", "Interestingly enough, the next summer, I was not working in construction. I worked as a canoe ranger in Algonquin park. And 1975 was a hot, hot summer. I don’t know if it’s been eclipsed since. I was a canoe ranger working in the park, so I was in the bush. I’d be in the bush for 10 days, and I’d come out for four.", "The summer of 1976, Speaker, had less sunshine than any summer ever recorded up until that time in southern Ontario, the part that includes Algonquin park. So we got a pile of rain in the summer of 1976—unbelievable.", "But it was a great job as well: mowing trails, scything the trails, chainsawing the deadfalls and stuff like that, building campsites and putting up privies—" ],

It was quoted in the Globe and Mail.", "“‘What surprises me is they don’t need legislation,’ he said about the updates. ‘They have the [regulatory] authority to bring the schedules up to date.’” So, Speaker, they already have the authority, with the current legislative powers they have, without a new bill, to bring this up to date, according to Mr. Frame.", "“Wayne Peterson, executive director of the Construction Employers Coordinating Council of Ontario, said the industry welcomes the new bill and would have liked to have seen it introduced earlier.", "“The Liberal legislation should spell out how the new rules will be enforced, he said. ‘It’s fine to pass legislation, but if it has no enforcement and no teeth, then it’s just frivolous legislation.’”", "Again, that’s from that Globe and Mail article. The people who are being affected by it the most see through it the same way we do, and it’s not comforting to them that in the final days of a desperate government, they’re bringing this forward. But it will never be enacted before we go to the polls. It will receive royal assent because they will make sure they time-allocate the bill. They’ll make sure that it passes before we leave here, but nothing in this bill will ever be enacted before we go to the polls.", "What they were hoping for was that if the government really believes in what they’re doing here, they would have done it much sooner, as Mr. Peterson says. Why wouldn’t we have done this many months ago? There were opportunities. This legislative calendar has had lots of time to have dealt with these pieces of legislation, but what has happened as they get desperate before the election—I honestly can’t remember the last bill that came before this Legislature that wasn’t time-allocated, other than the private members’ stuff that we hear on Thursday afternoons, which often receives approval on second reading but never goes any further. The government votes for the bills, even if they’re opposition bills, on Thursday afternoons, but there’s little chance that the government is ever going to advance the bills on the legislative calendar.", "They have all the power, Speaker. They have a majority. They can practically do what they want here. That’s why I say that when Premier Wynne says she’s being bullied, no one believes that. She’s the Premier. She is Premier Wynne. We can call her Premier Wynne. Just like we talk about other Premiers, she is Premier Wynne. She can’t hide from that. I know she’d like to. She’s trying hard to hide from the record of the past 15 years, but there’s no place for her to go." ],

We’re going to get the chance to find that out after June 7. I can tell you, I am looking forward to it, just as they are." ],

I had the opportunity to speak on Bill 35 before, but I’m very happy to speak again on this particular motion.", "It’s an interesting position for me as I speak on this motion, because I’m wearing two hats: my hat as the government House leader and my other hat as the Minister of Community Safety and Correctional Services, the ministry that brought forward this particular bill and has worked on this for some time.", "I can speak from the point of view of the importance of the passage of this bill. I can, of course, share with the members, as I have done in the past, as to the history of this bill. I think members have a good understanding and recognition of what events precipitated this bill and, of course, the many times the bill has been introduced and debated in this House, and I’ll elaborate on that as well for your pleasure.", "Of course, I very much look forward to hearing from my colleagues in the House, and I would urge them to support this important motion.", "It is my hope that with the support of all members in this House for Bill 35, the reintroduction of the Security for Courts, Electricity Generating Facilities and Nuclear Facilities Act, 2014, will carry through and we would, before the end of this year, have this bill into law.", "As many in this Legislature already know, this is the third time that our government has introduced this important bill—not once, not twice, but three times. As the saying goes, third time lucky, so I’m really hoping this is the time that this very important bill passes through this Legislature because, as we have heard in the debate in this House from many members, from all three sides of the Legislature, this is a bill that’s needed. This is a bill that has been sought. The community at large, the partners that we have in policing and civil liberties, all have asked for this bill. So I think it is due time that this bill passes into law.", "This bill first passed second reading on March 20, 2012. I’ll repeat: The first time this bill passed second reading was March 20, 2012. It was over two years ago when this bill was introduced for the first time, passed second reading and was then, also at the same time, referred to committee.", "While at committee, important feedback was provided—of course, as committees do important work—during public hearings by over 15 organizations that participated in the public hearing process back in 2012.", "Some of those organizations that participated in the conversation that took place during the committee included organizations like the Ontario Bar Association, a very important organization that I have been a part of in my past life as a lawyer; the Canadian Sikh Association, another very active community group in our province; the Ontario Association of Chiefs of Police, an organization that we all listen to very carefully, because they represent all the chiefs of police in our province; and Ontario Power Generation. These are just to give you an example of the over 15 organizations that presented. They were part of the process that took place in the committee. As a result of that, a number of important amendments were also made before referring the bill back to the Legislature for third reading.", "The bill was then reintroduced a second time on April 10, 2013. The government has been very much committed to making sure that this bill becomes law. We first introduced it in 2012. We went through the entire process, we went through committee, got to third reading, and then I believe the House was prorogued and that’s why the bill died on the order paper. Immediately, on April 10, 2013, we reintroduced the bill under our new Premier, Premier Wynne. That bill then was stalled for a year before dying on the order paper, when the NDP forced the election last May.", "I know the NDP likes to think they didn’t call the election, but we know how the system works. In a minority Legislature in particular, if you’ve got a budget tabled and both parties opposite, which at that time had the majority of the members, say, “We will not support the budget bill,” the way the system works, that means the government falls. That is why, once we heard from the official opposition—they have said for every single budget, in fact, that they would not support it, and I respect their very consistent position on that—and then the NDP also said “No, we will not be supporting this budget,” an election was called last May, which we all participated in.", "After the election, after June 12, we were back, with the privilege of having the opportunity to serve Ontarians with a majority government. We are committed to the passage of this bill in this House. That’s why we have introduced this bill for the third time. I just wanted to give you, by way of an example, the amount of work that has gone on, on this very important bill, over the last two and a half years, and the persistence the government has shown to ensure that this modern, very focused and balanced piece of legislation, which deals with the security of critical infrastructure like our courthouses, electricity generating facilities and nuclear facilities, becomes law. That’s why we’re keen to see that this Legislature approves this bill before the end of the year, so that this law can come into place.", "Speaker, because we’re talking about the fact that this bill has been tabled and debated three times in the House, you can imagine the number of hours of debate that have gone on, on this bill. By my last count, including, I think, the debate that took place yesterday, we are getting close to about 20 hours of debate on this bill, and—wait for it—how many speakers? About 40 speakers have spoken in this House on this bill, and the substance of the bill hasn’t really changed much. The bill changed after the amendments that were made in committee, which was extremely important. But that’s a lot of speakers. And I encourage debate, because that’s exactly what we are supposed to do in the House, and I’m happy to see the kind of debate that has taken place.", "I just noticed that our Attorney General is here as well. The first two introductions came from the Attorney General, who has done an incredible amount of work on this particular file, and I want to thank the Attorney General, the MPP from Ottawa–Vanier, for her great work on this file. I just want to get this done for her; I’m just the messenger. She has done incredible work and has met with many, many stakeholders. Be it the Ontario Association of Chiefs of Police, all the civil liberties associations or the Sikh associations, she has met them all and has struck the right balance that is presented in this bill that will ensure, as I said earlier—" ],

This bill was developed in response to the recommendations that were made by Ontario’s Ombudsman in December 2010 and also the very important work that our former Chief Justice of the Ontario Court of Appeal, Roy McMurtry, did and provided to the government in April 2011. I want to thank not only the Ombudsman, but most importantly I want to thank Mr. McMurtry for his incredible work on this particular file.", "During the G20, the use of the Public Works Protection Act had become the subject of significant public concern. Both the Ombudsman and the former Chief Justice recommended that the Public Works Protection Act be repealed and replaced with more modern, focused legislation. Our government, under the leadership of then-Minister of Community Safety and Correctional Services, now our Attorney General, the member from Ottawa–Vanier, conducted extensive consultations while developing this bill to determine what measures would be needed to ensure security should the Public Works Protection Act be repealed.", "We sought input and advice from nuclear operators and regulators, electricity producers, justice partners and municipalities. We also consulted with civil liberties advocates to be sure that the appropriate balance was struck between security and civil liberty, including the organizations I mentioned earlier: the Canadian Civil Liberties Association and the David Asper Centre for Constitutional Rights. All of the legislative debates, amendments and extensive feedback that we have heard are incorporated in this particular bill.", "If passed, this bill will (1) repeal the Public Works Protection Act; (2) amend the Police Services Act as it relates to our courthouses and safety and security in our courthouses; and (3) create a new bill that outlines a security mechanism for our nuclear facilities and large electricity generating facilities—all, you would agree, Speaker, critical infrastructure in our province.", "I’m going to end at this point, but again, I urge the members that this is an important bill. This is a bill that is a result of extensive work that has been done over the last almost three years. That this is a bill that is tabled for the third time demonstrates government’s goodwill and commitment to pass this bill into legislation. This is a bill that has gone through extensive debate, significant input and changes as a result of work that the opposition parties have done. I really urge, Speaker, through you, all members to support this bill and ensure its speedy passage before we recess for Christmas." ],

But he has grown so much now that he ignores everything I say when he’s speaking. Either I’m losing my touch or he has gotten a lot better at tuning out the noise from within. That’s the compliment.", "Now I’m going to challenge him. I’m going to ask him why he won’t work with the opposition on this. This is a bill that—my goodness, as he said—when the current Attorney General, the then Minister of Community Safety and Correctional Services, the Honourable Madeleine Meilleur, introduced this bill, I was the critic for that portfolio at that time. We worked closely to come up with a bill that would represent what needed to be done. I think we’re there. But the House leader knows they’re in a majority now. This bill will pass. What’s the hurry? You see, since it was introduced in early 2012, the world has not fallen apart. We’re still having courts, and the nuclear facilities are still operating. In fact, Darlington won an award for efficiency last year. It’s not like the world has come to a stop. It’s not like we’ve shut down our nuclear facilities, and it’s not like the court system has been put into limbo; it’s still functioning. Why would he not take this opportunity—on a bill that we’re going to work with them again—and allow us to have the input at this stage to see if there’s anything further that can be done to improve this piece of legislation?

That’s what I’m appealing.", "I’ve had about five different approaches in my speeches on time allocation in this session, because I am trying every angle I can think of to appeal to the sense of fair play and justice in the hearts and the minds of the members on the opposite side. I have come out and railed against them. I have come out and spoken of dreams that I’ve had about the House leader and the ghost of time allocation past, not unlike the Christmas Carol and Ebenezer Scrooge, which I talked about.

I’ve tried getting up and venting my anger at how frustrated we are on this side of the House, and now I’m trying to appeal to their sense of fair play, to their sense of what is right, to their sense of giving something to the other members who were elected. Look, I’m not arguing with the numbers; you’ve got your majority. Congratulations to all the new members who were elected—12 or 13 new members on that side of the House, and I’ve had a chance to say hello to every one of them—but I don’t think this is what they believed they were buying into when they got here either. I think that they believed they were coming here to a House of debate, not a House of one side railroading the other, using its pure power, because in a democracy, 50% plus one gives you absolute power, but it is the wise ruler who uses that power benevolently.", "You can choose to be as callous and to be as controlling and to ignore everything that the other side of the House has to say. You can choose to do that when you have the majority, but you can also choose to say, “Those are good people over there, elected by their constituents. There’s a reason they got here. There are reasons they got here. They didn’t run on our platform.” Understandably, the people on the other side believed that that platform had everything in it that Ontario needs, and they won the election, but all the members on this side of the House ran on different platforms, yet we all got elected. There must be a reason that we all got elected; we must have been doing something right so that the people of our constituencies believed that we were the right persons for the job.", "All I’m asking for is that the government take that into consideration. New members: Do an examination of your conscience, and ask yourself, “Should we simply take the orders from headquarters, that corner office on the second floor, right over there?” If I had a straight line that I could pierce walls and concrete, it would be right about there. Would they take this opportunity to vote against, to set a precedent that might set things right? We can’t stop this time allocation motion. We’re getting two hours to debate it, and essentially it’s just fluff and just a waste of time in some regards, but we do have to fill the time. At the end of that two hours, there will be a deferred vote, and we’re going to lose the vote.

I spoke to the bill yesterday. There are an awful lot of good things in this bill, and we want to get it passed. I believe that absolutely we could have negotiated our way to passing this bill. We could have been part of that discussion; we could have been part of that decision. This government decided, “We don’t need you. We’re going to poke our finger in your eye once more and tell you when this bill is going to pass,” because it’s all outlined right in the motion, I say to my friends in the third party.", "There it is, right in the motion. We know exactly when this bill is going to pass. It’s like telling the future. The only thing that could change that future is if some of those members on the other side of the House decide, “You know what? It’s Christmastime and we’re going to do the right thing and we’re going to show the kind of respect that people in the opposition should be given.”" ],

It’s vital to our economy. It’s vital to our health and welfare. Everybody knows that if you’re out of power, it’s not a good life. Here in the Canadian winter, if you’re out of power it’s a matter of life and death. If you’re out of power for indeterminate or long periods of time, your safety is in danger. We know how vital power is, and we’ve got to do whatever we can to protect those facilities that provide that power. This bill will assist in doing so.", "In reality, the way we conduct security around nuclear facilities has changed already, and rightfully so, because we cannot leave those things to chance. There’s a significant threat, because of the fact that we have radioactive materials in these facilities, that they could be used for nefarious purposes as well. So we do have to protect them, and that’s what we’re trying to do with this bill. We’re working with the government on this bill. We have worked with the government on this bill. All we’re asking for is an opportunity to let this bill pass through negotiation and agreement as opposed to having it rammed down our throats every time we turn around.", "I think what they’re trying to do here is render the opposition irrelevant.

But everyone knows that unless they change the electoral system and make themselves dictators for life, there will be an election someday, and how they behave—not just whether or not their legislative agenda has been satisfactory to the people, but how they’ve respected democracy, the bedrock of our society.

But if they knew and if they understood that every bill in this House is being rammed through without following the usual procedures of debate and input from third party stakeholders, they would be distressed. They would be upset. They would be asking themselves, “What government wants to operate that way? Why wouldn’t a government want the input from those third party stakeholders and honest, constructive criticism from the opposition?”", "This is an opportunity for you to change the channel, so I appeal—I know I’m not going to get anywhere with the members of the cabinet, because they’re not going to disobey the Premier. They would be out of a job the next day. They would be out of cabinet. Maybe I should say to the members in the backbench that if a few of those people in the cabinet get fired, you might get in. There are only two kinds of people over on that side: those who are in cabinet and those who want to be in cabinet. You see? So there’s an opportunity there as well.

In fact, things are slower this way than they would be if we just did them in the normal way that Parliaments are supposed to.", "Here’s how it works. Mr. Speaker, you’ve heard me say this before. At one time, there was no such thing as time allocation in this Legislature. It was a completely foreign concept. Majority governments met in this very Legislature for over 100 years. Majority governments did not have time allocation, but they passed their business through this House, because what they eventually were able to do was sit down with the opposition House leaders and work out an agreement on whatever it was that they wanted to do in that session or that year.", "This is the way it worked: The Premier would go to the government House leader and say, “Here is what cabinet would like to have done in this calendar year—12 months. I don’t care how you work it out at House leaders’. Just go work it out. But here are the things that I want: I want Bills 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 done by Christmas and I want Bills 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 done by spring.

So the government House leader knew what his marching orders were.", "That actually meant to say that the Premier’s office had to manage, had to figure out what they wanted and had to be able to figure out a way of what it was they wanted and when they needed it. They really had to manage it in the sense of being clear with their House leader about what they wanted.", "Then the government House leader would come in to the House leaders’ meetings and say, “Okay, here’s what I need. What do you guys want?” The opposition would say, “Well, on Bill 2 and on Bill 7, we want more time at second reading. We want to be able to travel the bill on committee across Ontario in the intersession.”", "The opposition would give its wants when it came to how much time we were going to have on bills and debate.

Well, they actually got a chance to come to places like Thunder Bay, Ottawa, Cornwall, Sarnia and Timmins and to be able to speak to the bill and say, “I like this. Please change that. I don’t like this. Please don’t do it.” They just gave their views.", "The committee would come back. All members on all sides of the House would sit at committee. They would do clause-by-clause. They would amend the bill, based on what they heard. What you ended up with was a better product at the end.

Prior to time allocation, there was no debate at third reading—hardly ever.

You probably would have had a lead by the minister on the bill. You probably would have had an hour, maybe a little bit less, by the critics of each party, a couple of speeches and done, into committee.", "In fact, out of the seven bills that the government has brought before us, these seven bills, I will argue, would have not had six and half hours each of debate at second reading. Some of them would have had less. But here’s the thing: In exchange, we would have said, “Let’s travel some of these bills.” The government told us, and we found out through this fall session, that they didn’t want to have the bills travelled in the intersession because they wanted the bills passed by the end of the session this December.", "Well, okay, if that’s what the government wanted, the opposition would have said, “Okay. We have a constituency week coming up in there. Let’s use the constituency week to do the hearings outside of Toronto”; and possibly we might have been open to the idea of travelling the bill while the House sat. But at least there would have been an opportunity for the public to have their say on the bills and the government would have gotten its entire agenda through the House. But instead, the government says, “I’m going to time-allocate it.” My point is this: By the very nature of going the time allocation route, it’s less efficient use of this time than it would be if we just did things the way we normally should, by negotiations with the House leaders.", "And the other thing is that it’s a failure of management on the part of the Premier and the House leader. If they can’t manage seven little bills through the House by way of an agreement with the opposition, both the Premier and the opposition leader, well, then it’s a failure of management on their part. What does that say about the management of government overall? If they can’t manage a little agenda—a legislative agenda is seven bills on time allocation, and they’ve got Bills 6, 7, 9, 13, 37, 40, 45, 49 and 52, so they’ve got about 10 other bills on the order paper to deal with. If you’re going to tell me that as a government you can’t prioritize those 10 plus these seven for a total of 17 bills, and prioritize at the beginning of the fall which of these bills you wanted passed by the end of December and which ones you wanted to get done in the intersession, it’s a failure on your part. It means to say that the Premier is not taking the time to seriously look at her legislative agenda as to what it is she, along with her cabinet, actually needs passed by the second week of December, and it’s a failure on her part to decide what her priorities are, which stifles her government House leader to be able to do his job. I don’t think the government should be proud that time allocation is solving anything, because what it does is, it exposes the government’s inability to manage. If you can’t manage 17 bills through the House, how are you going to manage the Ministry of Health? How are you going to manage the Ministry of Education, if you can’t even manage 17 bills through the House?", "I say to the government across the way, I listen to the comments, especially the new backbenchers within the government caucus, and I don’t begrudge your comments. I used to be a government backbencher, elected in 1990, and I used to think that everything my cabinet did and my Premier did was the bee’s knees to everything. My God, we had the God-inherent right to govern. I believed all that pap at that time, too. It took me a while to figure out that, in fact, the only people being disserved were the constituents that we represented. It took the wisdom of certain members of this House—remember Bob Nixon? He was a Liberal, by the way, in case you don’t know who he is. But guys like Bob Nixon, Mr. Scott, Mr. Bradley, Mr. Rae, Mr. Pouliot, Mr. Laughren, Mr. Eves—it took listening to the speeches that they had in this House and the conversations I had with those people around the committees and around this House to slowly understand that the British parliamentary system is an amazing system if you allow it to work.", "You know, it was at one time a king who decided everything, decided literally life and death. At one point, the British, with the amazing history of the British parliamentary system and how it developed, created a Parliament in order to limit the power of the king. That’s what Parliaments were all about. Initially, it was to stop the king from being able to utilize his complete authority to the detriment of the people of England. You know, why did they bring the Magna Carta around King John? It was to stop the excesses of King John. So we created a Parliament. Parliament was around before King John, but Parliament started exerting its authority and its power over the years so that we could limit the authority of the king so that it is measured and done for the good of the people. Now we have kings, or in this case a queen, but the real executive power no longer resides with the monarch. It resides with your Premier and with your cabinet.", "So this Legislature, essentially, is here to make sure that we approve the budgetary measures of the government and we deal with the money issues—because anything that has to do with money has to be approved through this House, and that’s the way it should be—and the policies of the government. And if you think, as a member of this House, either on the opposition side or the government side, that time allocation is a wonderful tool that allows you to do your jobs and makes Parliament more efficient, well, I just suggest that you go back and read your history of Parliament and how it was developed. You’ll learn an appreciation that the British parliamentary system, as Winston Churchill said, is the best of the worst systems of democracy that we have, because over almost 1,000 years, we’ve developed this check and balance system in which the legislative and the executive are able to cohabitate in a way that complements each other. So if we allowed Parliament to work the way that it was, I think we’d probably be in a much better position to be able to actually get the agenda of the House done through here.", "Let’s look at what’s left. I’m going to leave the rest of the time in a few minutes for my colleagues who want to speak to this. But the government’s got a couple of more bills that I imagine might be time-allocated. They’ve got Bill 6, the Infrastructure for Jobs and Prosperity Act. I would not be surprised to see the government time-allocate that. They’ve got Bill 7 to enact the Burden Reduction Reporting Act. They might time-allocate that. I’m not going to go through the 17 bills, but the point is, there are a lot of those bills that would have gotten no debate time, or hardly any, if the government had actually negotiated with the opposition to be able to get things done." ],

The reality is that we would not have debated all of these bills ad infinitum, because we would have had to give something to the government. That’s how it works. If the government had come in and said, “We have 17 bills that we’re going to have on the order paper this fall; here are the three or four that we want passed, third reading, by the end of December, and here are the ones that can go into the intersession,” we would have sat down and worked something out. And yes, the government would have been forced by the opposition to travel a couple of bills in committee, maybe in the November 11 break and maybe in the intersession in January or February. But that’s what Parliament is all about.", "I would only end on this point: We have not travelled bills in this House in a long, long time in the way that we used to. We’ve had some travelling committees, but not anywhere near what we used to.

But what committee did was it showed us the human side of the relationship as parliamentarians and it allowed us to do our jobs better, because some of those people who were on committee eventually ended up in positions of leadership, in both parties. You grow together as far as learning and getting to appreciate each other’s position, and it allows this place to work a lot better.", "I would argue that the government is doing a great disservice by doing time allocation and should heed the advice of the opposition and actually sit down and try to negotiate how we get the agenda of the government through the House.

Obviously in that time there was nobody really opposing it. We were debating it, but they never even called it for debate for over a year. So why, all of a sudden, does this one have to be rushed through?", "I think it’s become clear, because I remember speaking on it the last time—it was one of my first debates in the House, actually—that it was an embarrassment to this government. They didn’t want to talk about all the details around the G20 conference that was held. When they enacted kind of a secret regulation, they didn’t even tell all the police forces about it, and it led to a lot of confusion, more arrests in this country than have ever happened in the history of it. I know it’s only coming up to 150 years old, but this government’s claim to fame is over 1,100 arrests. It just talked about a fiasco and really about not thinking things through.", "We see this is another bill that, yes, I guess restricts some of the powers of the minister, which we see now from the G20 was well overdue. We saw some of the talks about the Ombudsman at the time. André Marin said that it was an illegal regulation that resulted in a massive breach of civil liberties. I saw some of the videos that went on there, and it really was an embarrassment. This looked like a Third World country. The one instance where the amputee’s leg was pulled off and he was arrested because he wouldn’t move—those are just things that you’re really not very proud to see happen in this province, let alone this country, but that was happening under the Liberal watch.", "Roy McMurtry’s comments in the independent inquiry found the act “beyond troubling” and recommended that it be repealed. Of course, we agreed with that. At that time, the bill was introduced—I guess it was Bill 51—and it sat there. They didn’t want to debate it because any debate that we had pointed out major failings of this government. That’s something they have found a way around now. With time allocation, they can push this through and get it through without debate and without our pointing out some of the issues that we saw with this bill.", "I look through long lists—I guess this is seventh bill that they’re pushing through on time allocation. Every one seems to have a common agenda: They don’t want the debate that we think would be important. Bill 7, the Better Business Climate Act: Could there be anything worse than the regulation we have in this province? We would like to see it pass, anything that will take down regulation. But there is no debate on it. We have no say on what comes down, what this bill will include. I know they say it goes for amendments. There is no realistic public consultation.", "Bill 8, public sector and MPP accountability: A laughable bill, and, of course, I can see why that, again, was time-allocated, with the failings of this government: the gas plant violations, the deletions—anything but accountability.", "If you go around my riding of Stormont–Dundas–South Glengarry, people talk about this government and just can’t believe that a government that acts this way is actually in the free world, let alone in Canada, and now they’re talking about an accountability act.", "Talking about the Advocate for Children and Youth Services, he was trying to get some investigative powers—negotiating with this government for six years. Somebody that was appointed by them, a commissioner of this Legislature, had restricted powers. The bill comes out and, my God, they forgot to include him in the bill. They sent him to amendments, if you can believe that.", "He talked about how he’s the only advocate for child and youth services in this country that has no investigative powers. Why wouldn’t they do that? Why wouldn’t they want to know where there are issues? I guess, again, anything that is a threat to them, anything that points out an issue with wrongdoing or just a lack of oversight just comes back to haunt them, so the easy way around is to make sure it doesn’t happen. We’re going to be working through amendments on that bill to see that we can get this important role—what is more vulnerable than our youth? He talked about getting phone calls from children in trouble but was not allowed to investigate—a sad state of affairs. For a government that seems to be encouraging that, it’s hard to believe.", "Another bill we looked at: child care modernization—the loss of 140,000 child care spots. Again, no meaningful discussion with independent child care providers, which welcome being licensed. Now they have to join either a franchise or an association. All that does is drive up costs and make it—the people they should be helping, the people who are on low incomes who are having a hard time finding meaningful work, especially when they have children, now will be taxed even further by increased rates—again, certainly not working for them. When will this government start looking around and seeing how much trouble there is?", "I attended the new mayor-elect’s swearing-in last night in Cornwall—a very nice ceremony. Mayor Leslie O’Shaughnessy—I sat with him in the counties, actually, in Charlottenburg township, before. He was a great mayor there, and we’re looking for great things in the city of Cornwall.", "Employees in social services came up, and they talked about—they were asking, “What can we do about hydro? We’ve got people in our riding who aren’t getting services. They can’t afford their hydro bills.” They said that, generally, they used to have a way of covering some of these costs—United Way used to have money. We’re starting at the beginning of the winter; there’s no money there. What are people doing? I know, legally, there is a regulation that after December 1 you can’t cut their power off, but they can limit the power with power limiters.", "I talked to somebody just last week who had their power cut off. You know how expensive it is now to get it reconnected? These are people who can’t afford their bills, especially after last year, where we went through and saw places where hydro went into people’s bank accounts and took money out—more money than they were owed, and then refused to pay it back. Again, this is something that you wouldn’t expect in a province like Ontario, where a government crown corporation had the ability to go in, overcharge people and then have the gall not to pay it back. We’re talking, sometimes, well over $1,000. You’re looking at seniors that had cheques bouncing, rent cheques bouncing, because the government, in their wisdom, overcharged them and then refused—until it blew up last—it’s funny how bad publicity changes things. When people became aware of how bad it was, all of a sudden all the things they couldn’t do were just changed. All of a sudden there was no problem to change it. Change was very quick—between bills, actually; less than a few weeks.", "It’s our job here to really bring scrutiny to this government, to provide a meaningful opposition. We’re being cut off; we’re not allowed to provide that service. In our system, that’s a very important service. The member from Pembroke talked about the eagles and the owls. This is an eagle that seems to be ready to pounce on anything he can, and not always very favourably sometimes. I think we need a little more of the owls here on this side to point out some of the issues.", "This bill will go through with no debate again, with a problem that was so international. This was a huge embarrassment to this country, the way this province, this government, ran the security around the G20, and now they’re going to push through legislation without debate. I think that alone points out that this is a bill that should be allowed to move around in committee—should be able to talk to the experts and look at some of the fallacies or faults of this bill, because I’m sure there are some; there always are. Nobody gets everything perfect. But time allocation will push through a bill that this government had no hurry at all to put through just a year ago. Now, all of a sudden, it’s a panic.", "I think that speaks to the way this government is running things. This is the seventh bill now in a row that we see being pushed through—just introduced. Meanwhile, the province, as I say, is going to hell in a hand wagon, with youth unemployment at one of its highest levels. It’s a sad shame. We just need to get back to properly running this government, having the opposition providing meaningful opposition, going through committee and actually being listened to.", "I’m very curious after the ministry pointed to our Provincial Advocate for Children and Youth and suggested they will go the amendment route, because if the amendments actually get adopted, that will be a first that I can see. I sat through the last Legislature and this one as well, and amendments are just voted down, without any regard—and in some cases, when the bill was introduced, the amendments that they so strongly voted down were actually included in the new legislation.", "Everybody remembers when the House was prorogued by former Premier McGuinty when things got too hot the last time. Bills that were sitting on the table with amendments that we had proposed were turned down, but when the bill was resurrected, they were put in. There’s a case where there’s no working together. I think that’s a strong indication—and I remember that in the cellphone bill we were looking at the original bill that had your cellphone service cancelled on the day that your contract ran out and you lost your number, which I think was ridiculous. We tried to point that out to the minister of the day. We tried to put an amendment in, and both were turned down.", "When we came back after prorogation, we were surprised that that very amendment was included in the bill. All of a sudden, it was a good idea. This is a government that doesn’t seem to want to listen to the opposition, even when it’s an idea that obviously they thought was worthwhile. It speaks to what we’re likely going to see going through committee on this bill. We’re going to see a government that’s likely not going to adopt any of the recommendations of the hearings that we go through, the amendments we would make and any of the amendments that are suggested by outside parties or by the third party.", "I would encourage them—part of this—we’ve been very successful. We used to be the engine of Confederation until this government came to power. Everybody remembers that. People came to work in Ontario, but now it’s not that way. I think that’s because we’re not running the government the way it should be run. The opposition does have some good ideas, some merit, and I think we should work together to put those amendments, or at least listen to them.", "My son came back from working out in Fort McMurray for two years. One of his classmates in Toronto as a civil engineer out of Queen’s couldn’t get work—working as a waitress. She finally gave up looking for a job in her home province, moved out to Alberta and got a job within two days of moving out there. That’s the difference. That used to be Ontario: where people got their jobs. Maybe not in every degree but some degrees like engineering, that’s the way it used to be.", "My time is up for this morning, so we will look forward to further debate." ],

To time-allocate everything indiscriminately doesn’t really make sense. I mean, if there’s a reason, if there’s a strategy behind it, you could make your case, but to just blanket time-allocate every single bill isn’t really encouraging democracy and isn’t really productive.", "But in this case, there’s a specific concern. This bill is deeply flawed, and I want to raise a concern that the House leader brings up. The House leader brought up and named a number of organizations and said that the government had consulted with a number of groups. I hope the deputy House leader is paying attention to this. The House leader said that he had reached out to the Ontario Bar Association, an association that he is a member of, being a lawyer, and reached out to and consulted with the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, which is a wonderful organization, and said, “We’ve done these consultations.” Well, you certainly did consult with them, but you’re not paying any heed to what they said. Both of those organizations clearly indicate that there are some serious problems with this bill. So when the government talks about protecting civil liberties, they’re not. You’re not protecting civil liberties, because two organizations well respected for understanding civil liberties clearly indicate that your bill runs roughshod over the civil liberties of those people who wish to enter a courthouse.", "In fact, your bill is so draconian in nature that the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, the CCLA, did a comparison of other jurisdictions. They looked at what else is out there in terms of other laws that govern courthouse security. They compared nine provinces and one territory, so they did a comparative analysis. They looked at these other jurisdictions, and I’ll have you know that you should be very proud as a government: Your legislation is the only one, the only piece of legislation out of nine provinces and one territory, that gives security officials general power to demand information, the only one out of nine other provinces and one territory. None of them have this power to demand information from someone who wishes to enter into a courthouse. There is no requirement for it. Nine other provinces know that you don’t need to demand information from someone who wants to come into a courthouse.", "In fact, of nine other provinces and one territory, none of those has any authorization to have warrantless searches of vehicles. There’s really no need for that. That’s a clear violation of a charter-protected right. It’s a charter-protected right that you should not be subject to arbitrary search and seizure. However, this government, which touts itself as and claims to be a transparent and accountable government, is bringing forward legislation which clearly violates the charter. On your charter-protected right to protect you from arbitrary search and seizure—this government has said those charter rights don’t matter, those freedoms don’t matter. “We will impose”—the only one of its type out of nine other provinces and one territory. This government is imposing warrantless searches on vehicles. For what reason? These other jurisdictions didn’t need to do that. These other jurisdictions have safe courthouses. Why? What’s the evidentiary basis for this? There is none. This government is clearly showing that it doesn’t respect civil liberties.", "It raises the question of why this bill is being brought forward in the first place. Well, surprise: It’s being brought because there were civil liberty violations with the pre-existing law.", "So let me get this straight. There was an existing problem, the PWPA, which was responsible, because this government implemented and used this PWPA to create broad and vague power—it has broad and vague powers within the PWPA—and made amendments and regulation changes that allow the police to violate civil liberties. There were a number of reports that said this is a problem. You have a problem with a piece of legislation based on violations of civil liberties. What do you do? You get rid of that piece of law, which is a good step, to replace it with another piece of legislation that also has civil liberty violations. Why are you doing that? How does that make any sense?", "It’s great to be able to stand up and say you’re the only province that has something worthwhile—“We’re the only province that has an Integrity Commissioner” or “We’re the only province that has accountability in our health care system.” That would be a good thing to get up and say—but in this case, you’re the only province that violates civil liberties when people enter a courthouse. That’s not something you should be proud of. You’re the only jurisdiction that does that, out of those nine. You’re the only jurisdiction that violates the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, particularly section 8. Again, this is not something that you should be proud of. This is one of those cases where you don’t want to be the only one that does that.", "One other very telling comparison that the CCLA did is—the purpose for the search, if you’re entering a courthouse, should be very clear. The purpose is that we want to make sure that our courthouses are safe. How do you make sure they’re safe? Well, you make sure that certain materials which are dangerous—weapons, chemicals, explosives—aren’t brought into the courthouse. If you tailor the legislation and you make sure that it’s narrow, specific; not broad or vague or general—if it’s a narrow, defined reason that you’re invading someone’s privacy, and it’s specifically for the purpose of screening for these dangerous materials, that would make sense. In fact, in every jurisdiction that the CCLA compared, except for Saskatchewan, searches upon entry are explicitly and exclusively for the purpose of checking for weapons or other specifically prohibited items. That’s clear legislation. That’s defined legislation. That’s not overly broad. That’s not general. That’s not vague. That’s the type of legislation that we need here.", "We will be bringing forward some amendments to this bill. We understand that you have a majority, so the end result is not really a guess. We know which way it’s going to go. But we will make sure that, as New Democrats, we continue to raise the concerns of civil liberties, which this government clearly doesn’t care about, and we will make sure that there are amendments raised that address this issue, because we believe—and I’m sure you don’t believe, because this law clearly shows it—in an open courthouse. We believe in transparency in our justice system. These are hallmarks of democracy.", "I personally have experienced this, in the sense that I learned from going to a courthouse. I saw things when I was still a student in law school.", "It’s important that we encourage people to come into our courthouses. It’s important for people to feel that our courthouses are accessible. So you shouldn’t put up barriers that impede someone’s ability to go to a court. That’s what your legislation is doing.", "Another area that was touched on by this legislation, which was initially very problematic—and I have to give you some credit for this. You’ve definitely improved on the initial two iterations of this bill, so this was definitely a win for the attorneys in this province. There was a request to protect the privileged documents that lawyers bring into courthouses, so that their sensitive materials that are important for the defence of their client or for the proper representation of their client—that that documentation, those files, that privileged information remains privileged and is not something that is subject to a search.", "The lawyers in this province were able to apply pressure; the Ontario Bar Association was able to suggest amendments that were adopted—as well as other community advocates in this area, particularly the organization representing the lawyers across the communities, the county and district lawyers’ association. They have advocated effectively to allow for privileged documents to be protected. That’s definitely a win not only for lawyers but also for their clients, for the people of Ontario: to ensure that their documents, their personal files that lawyers are representing them on, are kept privileged. That was definitely a good piece, a good amendment, that we brought forward and that the government finally also acknowledged.", "One other area, though, that’s left to regulation and I think needs to be strengthened is, if a courthouse is to function effectively and efficiently—anyone who has been to a courthouse knows that there are significant backlogs, there are significant delays, and this is a problem. We also have a charter right to have a speedy trial; a trial within a reasonable amount of time. For the proper functioning of justice, you need to be able to get your matter brought to court in a reasonable amount of time. That’s in the interests of justice.", "To make sure that our cases are heard effectively, heard efficiently, heard in a speedy manner, it requires that the individuals who are actually running the courts, the people who work in the courthouse—the reporters, the clerks, and the lawyers—and the judges, for that matter, are able to access courts in a quick and efficient manner.", "Judges often have separate entrances, so they’re generally not concerned about this issue of access to the courthouses. But lawyers sometimes are subject to the whims of particular courthouses. What happens is, it creates delays. If a lawyer can’t get into the courthouse, can’t get in front of the judge to have the matter heard, it will delay cases.", "On behalf of the Ontario bar, on behalf of the lawyers of Ontario, this piece of legislation needs to include clear legislation that ensures that lawyers can get in and out of courthouses in a quick manner, that they are not subject to any delays, so that the process of justice can unfold in a way that’s quick, that’s not delayed. There are already enough delays in the court system. To create a further delay by impeding lawyers from accessing the court would certainly be a problem. So this piece of legislation doesn’t have enough to clarify that right of access for lawyers, so that they are able to access in a quick manner.", "One other major victory in this legislation that I have to raise is that, initially, when the government brought forward this bill, this bill had nothing in it that clarified an obligation on behalf of the courthouses of Ontario to accommodate individuals based on their creed or disability. That was a serious flaw. Again, we clearly believe that courts should be accessible. We clearly believe that a courtroom should be somewhere where everyone who wants to, who needs to, should be able to access it.", "Whether that individual is a witness in a case who is performing their civic duty or their civic responsibility and has been subpoenaed to appear in court; whether it’s someone who wants to be an observer, who wants to just go into court and watch what happens; whether someone is individually an accused person or subject to a trial matter or a lawsuit, all of these classes of people need to be able to access the court, regardless of their disability or their creed. In fact, put in a positive way, they need to be accommodated for whatever their creed is or whatever disability they’re facing.", "We’re very proud, as New Democrats, that we put forward this amendment—this was a New Democrat amendment that we put forward—and we requested that the government accommodate this. We put this forward in committee. It was supported in committee and passed and made its way into the legislation. Now, in this bill, we proudly have, in accommodation, a requirement that courts accommodate people based on their creed or their disability.", "This means that people, whatever their faith may be, if they wish to express it by wearing a hijab, by wearing a yarmulke, by wearing a turban or a dastar, by wearing a kirpan—these articles of faith should be respected and they should be accommodated in a courthouse.", "That’s a definite victory and something we’re very proud of. I personally am very proud of being in that committee and being able to raise that issue and raise that amendment so that we could see that now in this piece of legislation. And for those folks who face disabilities, it’s important that they also are accommodated, so that the courthouse, again, is accessible to all people. That’s something we’re very proud of and that’s an amendment that’s here in the bill.", "I just want to go back to the issues around the PWPA. What did the PWPA do? Schedule 1 of this bill seeks to repeal the PWPA. What that bill was, was essentially a law that applied generally to all public works in this province. Effectively what it does is, it’s a blanket piece of legislation that allowed for certain powers—for the state, for the province, for police—to ensure that certain areas were safe.", "The problem with that piece of legislation is that it was written a long time ago. It had broad powers that were no longer relevant to this time, and Justice McMurtry said we needed to have a more modern piece of legislation.", "The problem with this law is that it allowed the minister and the cabinet to make changes to the powers that the police had in cabinet, through regulation. The problem with that is that there’s no accountability. If you can make changes in regulation, those changes aren’t brought before the House. They’re not debated in the House. There is not the same level of scrutiny. People can’t stand up and say, “Listen, I think there’s going to be a major problem if you give police the power to arrest somebody for no reason, if you give people, if you give police the ability to go into someone’s backpack or into their bags and start searching around without any grounds”; that if you give these powers to the police, it’s going to result in some serious problems.", "The opposition could have stood up and said, “Hey, there’s a problem with that.” But because these changes were made through regulation in cabinet, there was no scrutiny. There was no ability to shed light on the problems that could have arisen from this and that in fact did arise. That’s a serious problem.", "And it’s a trend. If you notice the legislation that comes before the House, more and more the majority of the powers conferred by many of the pieces of legislation we see—much of the power is kept in the regulation-making. What that means is, in terms of public scrutiny, in terms of what we can vote on, what we debate on—we debate on a bill, and some parts of the bill, in terms of the substance of the bill, are out there in the legislation, but a lot of the bill is left in the regulation-making. What that means is that we don’t really know what the government will do with it. There is a lot of discretion, and that’s a problem in the sense that the public, and particularly the opposition, doesn’t have the same amount of say in terms of what’s going on. In terms of the scrutiny, in terms of the accountability, there is a great deal less when decisions are made through regulation and not made in the House here.", "This bill is interesting in the fact that we all agree that we should repeal the Public Works Protection Act. It certainly needs to be repealed. What happened in the G20 was one of the worst civil liberties violations in the history of Ontario, and arguably in the history of Canada, so we certainly need to see some remedy on it.", "But if you look very carefully at Justice McMurtry’s recommendations, Justice McMurtry clearly states that the problems with this bill were vagueness and overly broad legislation. Back in 2012, when the Ontario Bar Association made their recommendations with respect to this bill, they talked about that problem. They looked at the problems of this bill and they said, “Listen, the problem with this bill is that it talks about overly broad powers and vague powers.” Now you’re doing the same thing with this bill. And on top of doing it with this bill, you’re time-allocating this bill, so you’re compounding the mistakes that you’re making. You’re bringing in a piece of legislation that’s going to deny civil liberties, that’s going to create the same mistakes that the Public Works Protection Act did, and on top of that you’re time-allocating this.", "What does time allocation seek to do? It just seeks to silence debate, it seeks to silence dissent; and it’s utterly not necessary. My colleague the member from Timmins–James Bay brought up a great point: that if you actually look at it and look at bills, you could negotiate a settlement or negotiate with the other House leaders and look at the timeline it would take to get a bill from start to finish that way, and compare that with how long it takes to time-allocate everything. And if you measured how long it was taking, I think the member from Timmins–James Bay makes a great point when he says that at the end of the day, you might find that time-allocating everything is actually going to take longer, that you could actually streamline some of these bills and they could actually get through quicker if you actually negotiated and worked out a deal that was respectful to all the other members of the House.", "At the end of the day, you have a bill before the House that, again, you’re time-allocating. You’re time-allocating everything indiscriminately. There’s no rhyme or reason; there’s no strategy behind it. Bills that we agree on, bills that we disagree on—all of them—are being time-allocated. It seems nonsensical. It seems illogical. I invite you to explain to me what your idea and your thought process is behind that. I also invite you to explain to me why you’re stripping people of their civil liberties in this bill." ],

He said there have been some changes to this bill, much to do with the fact that we actually maybe got the bill to committee. We had opportunities in this Legislature to talk about various bills, including the one we’re facing right now, here today, and that’s where positive changes can occur. The member from Bramalea–Gore–Malton challenged the government to maybe tell us what their motivation is, but I think it’s quite clear what their motivation is. They don’t want us standing up here and dissing the legislation they are bringing forward, pointing out the flaws in the legislation.", "I think it would serve the members of the government extremely well to hear those faults and those oversights here in this Legislature, because it will help them in passing bills that are going to have a harmful effect on the people of Ontario. We’ve seen examples of that over the years, none larger than the Green Energy Act.", "You’ll recall, Mr. Speaker, that when that was passed it was in a Liberal majority government, much like we have in this Legislature right now. They haven’t learned a darned thing, apparently, because they hammered that through the Legislature as quickly as they possibly could, in spite of the fact that the official opposition and, I’m sure, even members of the third party had some concerns about the Green Energy Act going forward. I wasn’t here during that time, Mr. Speaker, as you were not either. But I know there were some concerns, on behalf of this side of the Legislature at that time, about the effect the Green Energy Act would have on manufacturers in the province of Ontario and driving up energy costs in Ontario for our residential homeowners.", "I can tell you right now that the net effect from the Green Energy Act has been people being cut off of their electricity in Prince Edward–Hastings riding. They have been cut off of their electricity because they can’t afford the bills, because they have gone up 56%. As I read in a petition earlier, the Auditor General reported that a large part of the increase in electricity was because of the global adjustment. That is something that could have been corrected had they had proper debate in the Legislature.", "We’re seeing it on the daycare bill, which was time allocated by this government. It passed third reading earlier today, as a matter of fact, because the government time-allocated this bill. They refused not just to hear from the official opposition or the third party; the government refused to hear from independent child care providers in Ontario. They refused to hear from those people and listen to their concerns when they are telling the government, through petitions and through our critic from Simcoe North—who has done a fantastic job at least getting their voice on the floor of the Legislature, outlining the concern that that bill is going to reduce daycare spaces by well over 100,000 in Ontario. Why they wouldn’t listen to that before the roof caves in and people can’t afford to put their children in daycare, Mr. Speaker—it’s beyond me why they won’t listen. As the member from Bramalea–Gore–Malton just indicated in his speech, there are times when we can offer very constructive criticism and make a bill better, and very clearly, it could happen in this case.", "Instead, they’re doing exactly what they did when the G20 hit Toronto. They went into their little bunker—I don’t know where they were; if they were in Premier McGuinty’s office or they were back here somewhere in their cabinet room—and they designed a secret bill that gave our security officials, our police officers, wartime powers, Mr. Speaker. They did that then. They’re doing the same thing with every bill that comes before this Legislature. Day in, day out, they’re time-allocating bills. They’re muzzling the official opposition. They’re muzzling the third party. Why are they doing it? They’re trying to silence their critics, Mr. Speaker.

I looked today to try to find some other reduction; I can’t. We’re the only jurisdiction that has completely closed coal. In 2003, 25% of our generation was coal; today it is absolutely zero in the public utility. The only coal- or coke-generated is for steel, for purposes for which there is no substitute, but that is a relatively minor part of our emissions. Particularly as we move toward our target of 80% reduction by 2050, we realize that there are certain parts of the economy that cannot completely eliminate coal, so we have to make sure of those parts that can.", "We will be going to Lima with our fellow provinces—with Quebec, British Columbia, Alberta, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Manitoba and others—with a very united front as Canadian provinces, both the energy ministers and the environment ministers.

The federal government had blocked and prevented a discussion on climate change for five years in a row; the federal government exercised its authority to not allow ministers of the environment to even discuss climate change. Pretty bizarre.", "It’s also interesting—I have to say it as an aside—that I’ve been hearing from members of the official opposition that they wanted to debate this and that it’s very serious, and they’re not paying any attention. It’s kind of interesting that this debate is so important to them. I want to commend the members of the third party, who are actually paying attention.", "This is particularly important, because I don’t think there’s an issue more important to us, to my four-year-old grandson, than getting this right. I was reading an editorial in the Toronto Sun, and the person writing for one of the more Conservative organizations said that I was exaggerating, that we’re not on track for four degrees Celsius. Well, the last five years in the world, quite frankly, had the largest emissions of GHGs in our history. We are emitting more greenhouse gases every year, not less, and breaking records. And 2014, as of this date, if the year ended now, will go down in history as the warmest year ever recorded. We have just lived through the warmest year ever recorded, and the last 20 years have been the two warmest decades since anyone has been recording this in millennia.", "This is a very serious problem. I talked about California. Our food prices are going up 20%. There is no tax increase I can think of in the modern history of the country that is going to hit people more than the fact that California’s three years of drought are going to bump our food prices by 20%. Nothing hurts middle-income families more than that. And next year, after this continuing pattern of drought, it will go up again.", "From a conservative political philosophical perspective, you want to maintain an effective market, and you don’t want to have unnecessary scarcity of essential goods. Food is pretty essential, and it’s becoming scarce because of inaction on climate change. Even that blessed Tim Hortons Canadian coffee went up 10 cents on Friday, and will be going up a lot more, because the impact of burning coal around the world is causing massive droughts in Brazil, and the biggest reason is that that’s where Tim Hortons gets most of its coffee from." ],

Any other jurisdiction that has done it—Alberta has a price on carbon; the Alberta Conservatives brought it in. BC has a price on carbon. Quebec has a price on carbon. Mexico has a price on carbon. California has a price on carbon. If you closed coal plants in any of those other jurisdictions, you would have gotten money back through those cap-and-trade systems to recapitalize it.", "When I was with Resolute Forest Products—it’s interesting, because when they actually make investments in Quebec now to reduce their GHG and modernize their plants, they take those reductions, put it on auction and get money back. They said to me, “You know, we realize that right now the opposition parties are making that a difficult conversation, but it’s a market mechanism, and maybe someone should come up to Thunder Bay or go to Dryden and come and sit in our boardroom like you have, because we haven’t seen opposition members up here having a conversation with us about that.”", "We’ve had a cap-and-trade system now in Quebec, and they think it’s a terrible thing, but none of them operate a cement plant or a pulp and paper mill. They’d better get smart about this, because, you know, the member from the Pembroke area—I don’t have his riding right in front of me; I apologize—is telling me that I don’t know anything. Well, I would suggest that that member go talk to some of the heavy emitters that are operating in other jurisdictions that have those. The steel industry is asking us to actually start putting a price on imported rebar, because they’ve cleaned up their act, and then we get stuff from Turkey that has high emissions, because it doesn’t matter where in the world greenhouse gases come from, whether it’s Turkey, Canada, Chile or China—they do the same damage. So what our strategy with Quebec and British Columbia and Alberta, with Premier Prentice—who I give a big shout-out to; he’s going to be arriving in the next few days. He has taken on this idea. He has said that the future of Alberta has to move beyond oil because we’re getting into the age of unburnable carbon. We can now only burn 20 years’ worth of oil in this century before we exceed the unburnable carbon. That means that two-thirds of all the coal and fossil fuels out there cannot be burned, because they cannot be burned without the massive destruction of our ecosystem. Jurisdictions right now like the Conservative government in the United Kingdom—I would say to my friends in the official opposition, look at what your cousins in the UK have done. They have a five-year carbon budget, Mr. Speaker. In the UK, you are only allowed to burn carbon within a very restricted budget, and every five years they shrink that budget. They have actually exceeded their greenhouse gas emissions and they’re a pretty conservative party, Mr. Cameron’s.", "When we get into a trade agreement, I’d ask my friends opposite, especially my friend the honourable member from Renfrew–Nipissing–Pembroke, how are you going to have a free trade agreement with the UK and Germany? Do you think they’re going to allow us not to have a carbon budget? We’re just going to burn all the carbon we want and we’re going to be able to trade into California and New York and the UK when they all have cap-and-trade systems and they have carbon budgets? Nonsense. They’re going to put a price on Canadian products, and you can have other people write it or we can actually have an intelligent conversation in this House, because we actually have some moral authority in Ontario, as do Quebec, Alberta and British Columbia, because we’ve done the heavy lifting. Alberta, while it is the largest source of emitters, now has a government with a new Premier that’s taking this issue seriously. China has gone to a cap-and-trade system, Mr. Speaker.", "But on seven different occasions in the federal House of Commons, the federal Minister of the Environment has—the exact same sentence I just read. She stands up in the House and she says, “Well, what has Canada done? Why should Canada be taken seriously?” Because we’re not being so right now in the courts of public opinion around the world and at the negotiating table. Why? “Because we closed coal plants and we reduced transportation sector emissions.”", "It wasn’t so, Mr. Speaker. It was California that set the auto emissions and gas standards, and Canada adopted them because you can’t sell cars into the United States without meeting those standards. It was California that took the political heat. It was Governor Brown and Governor Schwarzenegger who ran on that and forced it on other jurisdictions, including us. That’s what they’re taking credit for, and they are taking credit for our coal plan, because they’ve got nothing.", "Mr. Speaker, they then said that they were going to pass legislation that was going to force all of the other provinces to reduce their coal emissions. They ran on it, and then in 2012, the previous minister, Minister Nicholson, stood up in the House and withdrew that. So here is the government of Canada taking credit for coal when the only thing they’ve done is that they actually broke their promise and did not adapt any clean coal standards in Canada. We do not have federal clean coal standards, so it’s pretty nervy and pretty ballsy to actually take credit.", "You know what Ms. Aglukkaq, my federal counterpart, said? She said, “Well, you know, emissions are down and they wouldn’t have gone down if we had a Liberal federal government.” It was actually a Liberal government under Gordon Campbell in British Columbia, a Liberal government under Jean Charest in Quebec and a Liberal government under Dalton McGuinty in Ontario that reduced the GHGs that they’re taking credit for. The only thing the Conservatives have done is exactly what they’re doing in the House, catcalling and saying that they don’t believe in climate change, that they don’t think it’s a problem, and they think the world will come to an end if we take any of the reasonable actions that others did—and their federal counterparts.", "So you know what’s happening right now, Mr. Speaker? I now serve on an international body established by the Climate Group and by the UN. All of us at the subnational level are actually outmanoeuvring, if I have to say that, the US Congress, which has gone crazy on this, and the federal government here and the federal government in Australia, which have withdrawn from this. Subnational governments across North America and through the Americas are teaming up with the Netherlands, with Brazil, with China to actually get these agreements in place. When I’m in Lima next week, I’m doing what the federal government should be doing. While they are out there trying to convince other countries not to sign on to deep decarbonisation, almost every single subnational in Canada save Saskatchewan is out working on Deep Decarbonization Pathways.", "Here we have the federation—and when we existed it was the provinces that went to Charlottetown to create the federal government; the federal government did not create the provinces. So how does the federal government go internationally when nine out of 10 provinces and three out of three territories all want deep GHG reductions and want to seize the opportunity of the $6-trillion expansion of the economy to a low-carbon economy?", "The other thing that’s coming out in Lima, if you’ve been following it, is that the economics are saying that when we went to the tech boom with ICT, the thing that made Jim Bradley, one of the smartest guys in the world because he just embraced the BlackBerry and the iPad, and no one does it like Jim, transformational, my predecessor in this thing—thank God for people like Jim Bradley, who helped us drive that IT revolution. That was a $1-trillion expansion of our economy.", "This low-carbon economy: When General Motors makes better cars that are made in China, when we have these things that last forever and use almost no energy in our solar panels, when our houses have thermal and have low heating costs, when we do these kinds of things, when we do things like what Guelph has done in reducing the amount of energy to move water within the municipality, when we’ve created the next generation of products and exported them to the world, we are going to lead. Quebec is going to lead, British Columbia is going to lead, Alberta is going to lead. My friends in Manitoba, governed by the third party in this House, are going to lead. Nova Scotia is going to lead. Why? Because we disagree with the federal government. We’re not afraid of this issue and we recognize this that is the biggest economic opportunity that we’ve ever seen in the world. The federal government not only is neutral, it’s actively campaigning to avoid getting the tough decisions made now to give our kids a future.", "The honourable member said—and I’m going to conclude with this—that I don’t know what I’m talking about. I took my bicycle two years ago, in year 2 of the drought in California—and my friend the Minister of Agriculture and Food, from the great community of Peterborough, has talked about this. The farmers down there said something to us: “You need pollinators and you need water. Right now, we don’t have a lot of pollinators and we have almost no water,” because they were draining their aquifers. If you think that we can live in this—because every time you talk about trade with China, they get up and object that the Premier’s in China, like there are no jobs there. She brought back over $1 billion in investment and over 1,000 jobs—because we’re not afraid of the world and the party opposite is.", "But it is the downside of this: If we don’t solve this problem—where do you think food comes from? One third of all the food in North America comes from California, billions of dollars of trade, and we actually are now becoming, I think, the third—and the Minister of Agriculture will correct me if I’m wrong. We are now going to emerge out of his leadership and out of the Premier’s leadership to become the new centre of food security. Why? Because we have the Great Lakes, we have a water supply, and we probably have a little bit more stable climate, as much as our temperature will change by about five degrees in this century. We have to look for these new opportunities. Whether it’s in corn or whether it’s in market garden vegetables, we need to do that. Because the one thing we know is that the economy is going to change and agriculture is going to change, and while land doesn’t move, what you can grow on that land is going to change.", "When the federal government continues, in seven different statements in the House of Commons—the only thing the federal Minister of the Environment could point to that Canada has accomplished was closure of the coal plants in Ontario. That’s it. That’s all.", "Mr. Speaker, what I would like to leave you with is this little thought: If you don’t want any part of the solution and you’re going to continue to be part of the problem, get out of the way. Because right now, the federal government is undermining the reputation that Canadians have for good environmental stewardship.", "I will conclude so that my parliamentary assistant can step up and make me look not quite as smart, because she’s a lot quicker about this than I am." ],

We must ensure that our future generations inherit a clean and green Ontario.", "I read an article in a 2009 issue of the Lancet, a respectable medical journal. The gist of the article was that climate change is the biggest global health threat, even bigger than cancer and heart disease. By eliminating coal power, the Liberal government is creating history by reducing sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions that pollute our air and cause diseases. Cleaner air means healthier citizens. By taking positive steps in this direction, we have already realized an estimated $4.4 billion in associated health, environmental and financial benefits from eliminating coal power in Ontario. To the average citizen, this means that we have had fewer smog days since closing coal plants. This means more sunny days that we can enjoy with our families.", "As this House already knows, this government’s strategy of eliminating coal power is equivalent to taking seven million cars off the road—considering the fact that there are approximately 10.4 million registered vehicles in Ontario, we can take pride in this accomplishment.", "In eliminating coal power as an energy source, Ontario has become a leader in combatting climate change in North America, and we have no plans to stop. We are not alone. Even international agencies such as the WHO, the IMF and the UN are also asking all governments to take action in this regard. By putting this law into effect, Ontario will be sending a strong signal both nationally and internationally that we are serious about the fight against climate change. It will be the first of a series of steps that will lead to a full strategy to combat climate change.", "The great thing is that with coal power gone, we have the ability to pursue better alternative energy options: cleaner, renewable and future-oriented. Already 80% of our energy options come from clean sources such as water, nuclear and renewables.", "As we shift away from fossil fuels—dirty, non-renewable sources—Ontario has the prospect of becoming a leader in clean technology. Even the United States and China are becoming more serious about environmental issues and how the environmental changes are adversely affecting our planet. However, it is sad to see that our federal government is still in denial. They are not stepping up to the plate. US Secretary of State John Kerry has stated that the clean technology revolution will be a $6-trillion industry. Ontario can and should be a leader, not just because it is morally right; it’s a step in the right direction and it’s sound economic policy.", "The importance of this bill is to ensure that the health and environmental benefits that come from eliminating coal power are protected by this legislation. This is an important piece of legislation. This bill must be passed for the sake of our children’s health, for our economy and our environment.", "I hope all members of this House will help to get this bill passed swiftly." ],

We kind of nurture our home in a way, right? We want to make sure it’s a place where our families feel safe and secure, that our children feel it is a place that they can enjoy and where they’re safe. Similarly, we should have that same responsibility and that same obligation with the planet that we live on. Our community is broader than just our neighbourhoods and our homes; it’s the place we call our home in a broader sense, and we have a fundamental responsibility to make sure that we leave it better than we found it.", "We’ve failed in this obligation. If you look at the impact we’ve made on this planet, we’ve failed so far. But that doesn’t mean that that’s our future. It doesn’t mean that we don’t have any hope and it doesn’t mean that it has to always be that way. We can make changes. We can actually change the direction that we’ve gone in. There are very optimistic signs. We can move away from the dead end-type of technology that requires fossil fuel burning. There are alternatives out there, and we can pursue those if we have the conviction to do so. I think more than anything we need to really look at, on a broader scale beyond just coal, what we can do as a society to move towards a more sustainable future." ],

We want to ensure that by regulation some government can’t further make a change, so we want to place it in legislation, so that you could not have, for the purpose of producing electricity, a circumstance where you would have coal being burned in the province of Ontario.", "I was glad to hear my colleague from the NDP speaking about this because I was looking for it in the NDP platform. I look at the platforms, and I looked in the NDP platform and saw no reference to it. I remember in the old days, when I would talk to people like Ruth Grier and Bud Wildman, environment was way up here in terms of the concern. So I’m encouraged by the fact that the member for Bramalea–Gore–Malton was able to raise that specific issue.

I listened to this presentation, and this was all about, “We have completed the task,” that we don’t have any coal generation in the province of Ontario today. I will be researching the bill more to find out why we would need a piece of legislation to say that we did what we already had finished. That usually doesn’t need to be regulated.", "I do want to say that, as I was listening—and I appreciate that that was done—the whole process of doing it when, in fact, we were talking about building wind generation to replace coal generation seems to be a little bit of a problem area, because the wind doesn’t blow whenever we need the energy that was generated by the coal. So what they have been doing is building gas plants to supplement it, when we need energy and the wind isn’t blowing. All the capacity we have to replace coal now has to be gas generation, because we can’t depend on wind generation.", "Now, wind is generating when the wind is blowing and our air conditioners are not working and we don’t need that power. That’s where we get the challenge of what we do with the power we’re producing that we’re paying premium dollars for but can’t in fact use in our grid. I think that’s why we end up having to sell power at a very low price or, at times, we even have to pay them to take that power.

The bill itself speaks to the cessation of coal-burning plants which, I guess, is a retroactive pat on the back for what we have done in the past as opposed to moving forward, because we don’t burn coal anymore.

Phasing out coal-powered electricity has been a commitment made by all three parties, starting with the regulation—I’d be remiss if I didn’t touch on it—issued by Elizabeth Witmer and the PC Party. Elizabeth Witmer is a great Huron-county-born and bred and proud rural resident who has demonstrated leadership on this particular issue for years and years, more than a decade ago, actually. She did so by closing down the first coal plant in Ontario, the Lakeview generating station. We certainly appreciate the vision and commitment that she had in that regard.", "But, you know, it’s interesting because we have to ask, really and truly, when you take a look at Bill 9, why do we even need this new legislation?

Action speaks louder than words. Even our own Minister of the Environment and Climate Change said himself that it’s time to stop applauding coal plant closures and move on, yet today, through the introduction of this bill, we still see this Liberal government posturing and pontificating about issues that they tend to use to further complicate things.

That is a problem, and I invite the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change to wake up to that and wake up his caucus to say, hey, Ontario can’t afford any more ill-conceived plans, visions—legislation, if you will—that handcuff us in putting Ontarians to work.", "Again, it’s interesting, in terms of the pontification that we’ve been having, because the current minister acts like there’s so much urgency when it comes to climate change, yet it’s important to point out that this Liberal government has had over a decade to do something.

Now this government, as well as all of us, have been warned by the Environmental Commissioner that this government needs to perk up, stand up and do the right thing, do the honourable thing, and start meeting their own greenhouse gas emission targets.", "There’s an issue with Bill 9, because it fails to address how they’re going to reduce private sector coal use. It’s one thing to lead by example, in terms of coal power generation, but we need to take a look at reducing the source of coal pollution, and that, Speaker, is where a real opportunity lies to clean up Ontario’s air.", "Again, I’ll share this with you: The cement industry has been calling on the Liberal government for quite some time now to make regulatory changes that would allow them to use alternate fuels in cement kilns.

Even the organizations and agencies that are in place to assist people to keep their lights and heat on are having trouble as well.

A billion here, a billion there—it seems like this Liberal government doesn’t care how much their scandals are costing Ontarians. But we in opposition do, because we are close to our constituents and we hear what they’re saying. We meet with our constituents, and we try to elevate their voices. But unfortunately, the party opposite continues to prove they have deaf ears to true concerns from Ontarians.", "The decision to move the gas plants, for example, was supposed to facilitate the transition from coal to alternative energy sources, yet we know that this did not happen. Further, we see failures in the use of industrial wind turbines and how they’ve devastated rural Ontario. Speaker, I could go on and on about how the failed Green Energy Act has totally destroyed my riding in terms of relationships between families, neighbours, constituents and municipalities—and between neighbouring municipalities, as well. That’s just a start. Then this government continues to perpetuate the farce when they go against their own Environmental Review Tribunal—when an ERT decision ruled against the Ministry of the Environment of the day with regard to planning hurdles.", "It just goes to show that the only way this Liberal government today knows how to rule is with a huge stick. They don’t care what’s happening across the province. They don’t care how their decisions are negatively impacting Ontarians. Really and truly, I hope that at some point—we’ve got members in the Liberal caucus who surely can’t agree with all this legislation and all the heavy sticks that are being used right now. I hope with all my heart that around their caucus table, they have enough confidence from us opposite, as well as from their constituents, to stand up and say, “Enough is enough.”", "We can talk about how wind farms are popping up everywhere across the province, yet all the while, the people that own the wind projects are changing their plans. They don’t have to go back to the Environmental Review Tribunal at this point, and that needs to be addressed as well. They don’t care about setbacks. They don’t care whether a municipality is a willing host or not, and it’s just a shame.", "It shows that this government lacks foresight: the investment in industrial wind turbines where storage technology has not yet made this type of energy profitable or sensible for Ontario’s needs.", "It makes me come back to the Fraser Institute, and specifically, a report that recently confirmed electricity rates are skyrocketing under this government’s continued mismanagement of the electricity file. “Wind and solar power systems provide less than 4% of Ontario’s power but account for 20% of the cost paid by Ontarians, yet the government wants to triple the number of wind and solar generators. That’s a good deal,” in terms of the subsidies being paid out for wind and solar producers, “but a raw deal for consumers.” That was specifically said by Tom Adams. He is a co-author of the study I just quoted and also an independent energy analyst.", "This particular report also recommended that a solution to any electricity shortfall is not more wind, but recommissioning the four units that have pollution abatement equipment at the Nanticoke and Lambton generating stations. That was a recommendation that had come forward." ],

When people are coming forward with so many various reports at different levels, it shows how Liberals have failed Ontarians on so many levels. They lack the leadership to address priorities, including the debt and deficit and, again, soaring electricity rates, a failed green energy plan, gridlock. This list is seemingly endless.", "But you know what? The real band-aid that the Liberals continue to pull out of their tool box is tax. When there’s a problem or they need more money, they just think nothing of taxing Ontarians once again. Time and again, during the last election and leading into this fall and another winter season—we hear time and again that there is nothing left in so many pockets, and it’s a real concern. With that, we issue a concern that the Liberals’ climate change initiatives have come out of left field, really and truly. They have come out of left field and have essentially proven that while this government has sat on their hands for years and years, now they’re jumping on the bandwagon, again to pontificate a sudden concern when there’s a possibility of finding them another revenue source, or rather, another way to empty Ontarian pockets. That’s what this is really coming down to, Speaker. It’s about finding another revenue source to offset their mismanagement and costly decisions that are driving jobs out of Ontario.", "Recently, Quebec, who the government seems to be following the lead on on a variety of issues, has announced they will introduce a carbon tax, starting January 1. It’s predicted to generate $500 million. Again, we raise concern over the fact, does this government really, really care about climate change, as we all should, or are they seeing it just as another opportunity to take more dollars out of Ontarians’ pockets to help their Liberal deficit and the debt that’s amassed over the last decade?", "It’s interesting and very curious that in the recent Liberal economic statement, this government just revealed that they are short $500 million in revenue. There are parallels here. Quebec has generated $500 million in revenue through a carbon tax, and we have a shortfall. I think this government is going to try to do anything they possibly can to fix their fiscal mess, all on the shoulders of Ontarians.", "Recently, PC interim leader Jim Wilson questioned the Premier on a carbon tax, and she would not rule it out. We see this government getting money any way they can to make up for their mismanagement, and this concerns me. As I said before, Speaker, how much more can Ontario families take? In 2017, this government will introduce an Ontario pension plan, which we all know will kill jobs and take yet more money from Ontarians. Ontarians are overtaxed as it is. Our business environment is already unfriendly. The Premier claims she is concerned for the future of Ontario’s children with regard to climate change, but she doesn’t seem concerned at all by the debt she is leaving those very same children. This will be a burden for future generations.", "Today our debt is $289 billion. That is $21,356 for every man, woman and child. We shouldn’t have a revenue problem in this province with the amount of taxes and money that is taken in. Yet we do; we have a huge debt that this government chooses to carry because they can’t find a fix to their spending problem. That’s underscored by a total disrespect for the taxpayer.", "The amount of scandals we’ve seen from this government underscores and emphasizes the disrespect. Gas plants, eHealth, Ornge, MaRS: It shows us time and time again the blatant disrespect for the taxpayer and the serious lack of concern for future generations who will hold this debt." ],

She led the closure of Ontario’s first coal plant, and it would be the only one closed until recently.", "In 2001, Elizabeth Witmer, as the former Minister of the Environment, issued a regulation requiring the phase-out of coal burning at the Lakeview generating station, which reduced the province’s total coal-fired electricity generation capacity by 15%. However, for the Liberals, this has been an issue on the back burner for the last 11 years. Liberals, once again, cannot even meet their own goals.", "In 2003, the Liberals ran on a campaign promise to end coal-fired electricity generation in the province by 2007. Well, 10 years after the announcement and six years past the deadline, they’re just finishing up the job. So, yes, it’s nice to cheer about the elimination of coal-powered plants, but we must also acknowledge how poorly this file has been managed and just how behind they truly are. Because of the Liberal mismanagement, Speaker, the hard-working people of this province continue to pick up the tab, paying considerable financial costs, and health costs as well.", "I recognize the importance of clean air and the need and the importance of breathing easy. Last week, on COPD Day, we were reminded of the importance of lung health. Today, more than 780,000 Ontarians live with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD. It is a life-altering disease, and more actions need to be taken in our province. As a proud supporter of lung health, I’m actively involved in advocacy and action on this issue and support those who are helping Ontarians breathe easy. I sit on the lung health caucus, which is dedicated to developing a lung health strategy and promoting it through all parties in the Legislature.

It called on the government to establish an action plan focused on health promotion and on disease prevention, detection and management. And I advocated for a constituent of mine who suffers from IPF, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, to have Esbriet, a vital drug and the only medication currently available for the treatment of the disease, to be funded through the Exceptional Access Program.

We’re really here to try and make a difference. I’m very passionate about this issue, and I will continue to advocate for lung health, as we did with the passing of second reading of the Lung Health Act.", "However, Ontario’s industries, be it manufacturing, be it agri-food, be it restaurants or small business—those sectors need to breathe easy as well, Speaker. All parties have committed to phasing out coal, but it’s the PC Party that recognizes specifically that there’s a delicate balance that needs to happen to ensure we maintain the much-needed manufacturing jobs in Ontario that keep our economy moving.", "As the Premier said earlier this morning, we do not live in isolation from the rest of the world. With that in mind, we should be mindful of the cross-border pollution and the need to not overburden Ontarians with hefty regulations. We should be creating a more competitive environment for our industry and manufacturing sectors, but in order to do so, this government needs to work alongside industry to help create a clean environment and a healthy economy. Frankly, Speaker, recent events suggest—and prove, I dare say—that this is not how this particular government operates.", "Last week, the farming community was blindsided with the government’s decision for an 80% reduction of neonics used for soy and corn crops by 2017. This industry, we heard time and again, was under the assumption that they were working alongside this government in addressing the issue of bee mortality, which we all care about. Focused on best practices, they were working on innovative solutions to contain the residue and reduce the exposure of bees to dust. Further, the recent Health Canada study that very same afternoon that the introduction was made indicated that the number of incident reports associated with neonic pesticides during the planting period in 2014 was 70% lower. That means bee mortality had dropped 70% lower than in 2013.", "Despite all of this, though, and further, the fact is that nowhere in the Liberal recommendations did they consider what the industry was doing with regard to bee mortality. Again, I repeat: Nowhere in their announcement last week did they take into consideration the advancements that industry had taken to help in the reduction of bee mortality in Ontario. I might also add that the Health Canada report did not suggest a ban either, yet the Liberals again went in their own direction.", "This has to stop. We need to base regulation and legislation on science and fact, not just a knee-jerk reaction. Again, this type of knee-jerk activity has the potential to seriously affect the economy and drive jobs and industry out of our province.", "When it comes down to where we’re going with Bill 9, I would suggest to you again, Speaker, that we don’t need this legislation. We’ve already phased out coal plants for power generation. I would suggest that if this Liberal government was truly concerned about this issue, they would be meeting their own targets for greenhouse gas reductions.", "This bill does not address how to reduce private sector coal use, and there is no plan to convert existing coal plants into natural gas or biomass facilities, as suggested by the Auditor General.", "I would close off at this time, before I pass the baton over to my colleague, by saying and suggesting that this government should be inviting industry and other stakeholders to work alongside them in creating policies that will help our environment but will also ensure that we foster a strong and inviting business climate." ],

I know the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change is not going to like this, and he’s certainly not going to like me for it, but I’m going to be blunt.

That’s the shelf life of a Liberal promise. As soon as you put that carton of milk on the shelf, Dalton McGuinty was, “Oh, we’re not going to be able to do that.” But then again, that’s not the real kicker, because they also gave you another promise, and that was that they wouldn’t raise your taxes, and then they brought in the biggest single tax increase in Ontario’s history, the health tax. Do you remember that, the health tax? “We will not raise your taxes,” and then they brought in the health tax.

I’m sure they’re celebrating on every street corner right now, because the Liberals are now bringing in a bill that they’re not going to burn coal.

The issue is the tying up of this Legislature to debate this piece of legislation. Why? I say this to the minister: We all have to account for ourselves. We have to account for how we’ve spent our time. You’ll be asked: Did you spend your day productively? Did you accomplish something for the greater good today?

One of the bills I think was essentially important that we didn’t see this House or this government take priority on was the bill that would protect public participation, that would protect our ability to have dissent, the anti-SLAPP legislation. The bill that the government did choose to move on before they brought forward the anti-SLAPP legislation was the better business climate bill, which essentially added no new powers, added no new regulation-making authority to the government, really didn’t do anything that the government couldn’t already do.

I would never forget you, but I can’t forget Percy, either—Windsor–Tecumseh as well.", "I want to thank them for their comments. I appreciate their views. I say to the Minister of the Environment that in spite of his two-minute criticism of my address, my views have not changed. We still don’t believe that this bill was necessary, and I can assure you that if there are so many important pieces of legislation that the government wants to talk to us about to get through this House before the Christmas recess, we’re all ears. But, unfortunately, that’s not what has been happening. What has been happening is, we come into the House and the House leader stands up, takes the floor and introduces time allocation.", "We have spent as much time debating time allocation as we spent debating legislation almost in this House since we came back here on the 20th of October. I somehow don’t believe that that was what this chamber was designed for. We’re here to debate the legislation itself—the merits, the pros, the cons, the weaknesses—to see if we can’t make it stronger.", "This bill—there’s nothing we can do to make it stronger, but, Speaker, there is nothing we can do to make it any weaker, either. Why don’t we just move on, tear it up, forget it ever happened and bring in some bills here to this House that the people of Ontario really need? How about a bill that does something about our economy? How about a bill that does something about employment? The government is lost when it comes to doing something that would actually help the average taxpayer in this province." ],

It’s An Act to amend the Environmental Protection Act to require the cessation of coal use to generate electricity at generation facilities—“the cessation of coal use.”", "Speaker, I have to tell you, I’m going to be a bit redundant, I guess, after listening to the member from Renfrew–Nipissing–Pembroke. I used to work at the CBC; I was declared redundant there as well. I won’t be as funny and I won’t be as eloquent as the member, but let me get started.", "This bill is also known as the Ending Coal for Cleaner Air Act, and on this side of the House, we think of it as—perhaps it could be known as the “Why are we spending time on a bill when we’ve already taken the steps, already shut down the coal-burning power-generation plants in Ontario? Oh, yes. I guess we need to change the channel” act. Or the “Let’s pat ourselves on the back and tell ourselves we’ve done a good thing here” act. Or how about the “Gosh, we missed our deadline for closing the coal-powered plants four or five times, so now that we finally got there, let’s pretend we knew what we were doing” act?", "Don’t get me wrong, Speaker; the bill makes sense, believe it or not. It made sense before the plants were actually shut down or converted to other fuels. We all know there are no more coal-burning power-generating facilities in Ontario, and there haven’t been any coal-burning facilities for some time. Most people would agree that that’s a good thing, so some of us are wondering why we’re here today discussing this bill, as opposed to debating more topical issues.", "Speaker, as you know, the government has been beating up on the opposition parties lately, shutting down debate, imposing time allocation, not willing to listen to further debate on matters and bills that were substantive. We’ve even gone to night sittings. Some of us were here last night till 9:30.", "So why isn’t the government putting on the table the issues and the bills that require lengthy, in-depth debate and discussion? Somebody wants to spin the news cycle. Somebody in some corner office down the hall wants the public to think that this is new. This isn’t new; this is retro. This is dredging up the ashes, Minister, and fanning the flames. This is a Hail Mary pass, tossed in the hope that some of the people can be fooled into believing that this is all new and exciting.", "This bill specifies four generating facilities that will never be allowed to burn coal again: the Atikokan plant, which stopped burning coal in late 2012; the Lambton Generating Station, which ceased burning coal in September 2013; in Haldimand county, the Nanticoke Generating Station, which used to be one of Canada’s top 10 single sources of greenhouse gases, and hasn’t burned coal since 2013. As a footnote to give some historical perspective, 201 years ago, in 1813, that’s where the Battle of Nanticoke was fought. The Norfolk militia beat back a marauding band of Americans. The battleground was declared a national historic site in 1924. If we get back to the present day, the fourth one, the Thunder Bay Generating Station, specified in this bill, hasn’t burned a piece of coal since April.", "So why is this bill in front of us today? The smoke from those coal-burning emission stacks is long gone, but this bill seems to be based on—wait for it—smoke and mirrors. Coal used to provide 25% of Ontario’s electricity, and the emissions from those plants were polluting—" ],

I respect the minister for expressing those views.", "I’m still curious, if not downright suspicious, why this proposed legislation is on our desks at this time. Getting rid of coal was a good idea. Even Energy Minister Chiarelli admitted to knowing of four or five young girls on his daughter’s hockey team that he used to coach about 10 years ago who had asthma so bad that they had to use puffers.", "Asthma continues to be a problem for some people. I’ll just give you a little background information, Speaker, or should I wrap up now? I see you’re getting nervous over there. This is a good chance; I’m going on to another side topic.

We asked a tag-team question in the House last week, and because of the standing orders, I think it requires that the first one who stood initiates the late show, so I’m speaking on behalf of my friend the member for Perth–Wellington, and together we’re making our presentation this evening.", "Last week, as I said, my colleague the member for Perth–Wellington and I raised an important issue with the Premier during question period. We asked the Premier whether or not she thought it was appropriate for a defeated Liberal candidate to be making public announcements on behalf of the government about infrastructure funding going to area municipalities when local MPPs had not been officially notified.", "We further established that this clear breach of respect for parliamentary democracy had already taken place, as the former Liberal candidate in Perth–Wellington, who now works as a policy adviser in the office of the Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, had sent out a news release on behalf of the local Liberal riding association, taking credit for the funding while at the same time attacking the official opposition with false and misleading statements. And it gets worse when you consider the fact that the former Liberal candidate most likely had access to privileged information on the funding before it was released.", "The Premier’s replies in this House were not satisfactory either to the member for Perth–Wellington or to me. In her response to our second question, she indicated she had no “information on the specifics” of the news release. Hearing that, and having a copy of the news release in my possession, I immediately asked a page to deliver it to the Premier to back up and verify the points we were making. She glanced at the news release and then continued her answer by saying the news release wasn’t an “announcement,” but instead, it was a “statement of something that is happening.” I think she believed that government staff had sent her the news release.", "My quotes from the Premier are taken from Hansard, the verbatim, official record of debates in the Ontario Legislature. Mr. Speaker, any fair-minded, objective person reading the news release that the Liberal candidate had sent out would conclude that it was his intention to announce the funding on behalf of the government, take credit for it, and in the process, diminish the role of the official opposition.", "Mr. Speaker, when I was first elected in 1990, this sort of thing never happened, to the best of my recollection, even though I served in the opposition to the then NDP government of the day. In fact, if municipalities in my riding were in line to receive roads funding from the province, for example, I would receive a phone call from the local Stratford office of the Ministry of Transportation, and I would be informed of the funding allocations they were providing to the municipalities before the municipalities were even informed. As such, the announcements of government funding were non-partisan, and rightly so.", "How things have changed. Now, 24 years later, we have a defeated Liberal candidate making the public announcements, slighting MPPs who were actually elected by the people just a few months ago, and attacking our party for good measure.", "In the past, when MPPs have raised points of privilege complaining about governments making key announcements outside of this House, a former Speaker, in his ruling, spoke of the “syndrome of casual diminishments of the legitimate and key role of the opposition.” This is one of those situations, another example of the syndrome of casual diminishments of the legitimate and key role of the opposition that the former Speaker lamented.", "As someone who has been privileged to serve on both sides of this House, in opposition and in government, and having seen it from both sides, I would offer the government members my observation through the years that while we can always make a conscious decision to do the right thing, it is a breach of parliamentary tradition to show such lack of regard and respect to duly elected members and the democratic process that caused their elections. Indeed, it is an affront to the people who elected them in the 107 ridings across this province, and it cannot go unchallenged.", "I call upon the Premier, tomorrow, to rise in this House on a point of order, correct her record, and acknowledge and admit that the Liberal candidate’s news release was in fact intended to be an announcement. I further call upon the Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs to call in his new policy adviser and admonish him to never again use privileged information that that office possesses in that manner.", "Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker." ],

I think our government is still proud of our record when it comes to infrastructure investments in Ontario.", "Notre gouvernement est fier de notre travail et de nos investissements dans les infrastructures en Ontario.", "On November 14, the government announced that through the Ontario Community Infrastructure Fund, 426 communities across the province will receive annual funding to support improvements and repairs to roads, bridges, water and waste water projects.", "Le 14 novembre dernier, notre gouvernement a annoncé qu’avec le support du Fonds ontarien pour l’infrastructure communautaire, 426 communautés à travers la province recevront un financement annuel afin de moderniser et réparer les routes, les ponts et les systèmes d’eau potable et d’eau usée, ainsi que d’autres infrastructures essentielles.", "These improvements to local infrastructure, Speaker, will help revitalize the community while creating jobs and strengthening the local economy.", "The press release directly referenced by my honourable colleague from Wellington–Halton Hills, by members opposite, was issued by the local Liberal association and links directly to this public Infrastructure Ontario announcement. It highlights positive action being done by the Ontario government. In fact, all of the information contained within the release was already public at the time that the Liberal association issued its press release. I repeat: All the information contained within the release was already public at the time the Liberal association issued its press release. There, of course, no doubt, is the nub of the issue, including the fact that the PCs, by the way, voted against our budget and didn’t support those particular vital investments.", "The release also contained a link to the public website which lists all 426 communities that received this funding. So not only is it public, but it’s generally broadcast across the province.", "I would encourage all members of this House and the public to make their communities aware of such important investments. In fact, all parties generally do. I could come up myself with countless examples of riding associations, by the way, from all parties, including the Conservative Party, our honourable opposition, commenting on government actions. I would generally applaud anyone who highlights these vital investments for the public.", "I applaud, Speaker, with your indulgence, Mr. Skinner for participating in political activities and supporting his local communities.", "As the Premier said, to requote, if the Conservative member had wanted to talk about these investments that were being made in his riding, I think that would be a very good thing. We would, in fact, encourage it. I can’t help but wonder if the only reason the member from Perth–Wellington is upset—perhaps there are others—is because he was caught failing to communicate this important information to his constituents.", "Speaker, this is a great announcement and good news for communities across Ontario and Perth–Wellington.", "I conclude with respect to my honourable colleagues from Wellington–Halton Hills and Perth–Wellington.

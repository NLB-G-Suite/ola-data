Of the 36 firms with interns that were subject to the Employment Standards Act, fully half were not meeting their obligations under the ESA.", "It seems that the minister’s efforts to educate employers are not working.

This strategy will provide new forms of support to all schools, with increased support to some schools and intensive support to schools with the greatest needs in math.", "We will also be giving parents more resources to support their children’s learning at home. This is something I will often hear about from parents: “How do I help my kids at home with their math?” We will be encouraging and supporting better access to online resources and math supports, such as Homework Help and SOS Devoirs.", "The strategy also draws on what we know about culturally responsive teaching and learning so that we can support all of Ontario’s diverse children and students, including French-language students and First Nation, Métis and Inuit students. Speaker, it is our shared responsibility to support student success and well-being. We strive to do this while always being mindful of our renewed vision for education, which includes these goals along with ensuring equity and enhancing public confidence. All students, from their earliest years into adulthood, have the right to a brighter future, and they all deserve the opportunity to succeed and pursue their lifelong dreams. We will never stop working towards these goals.", "Speaker, as we celebrate Education Week and our theme of promoting well-being, I want to extend my best wishes to all of my fellow members and to each and every person in the province who works to make Ontario’s publicly funded education system one of the best in the world." ],

Speaker, before I do that, I want to welcome some very good friends who are in the members’ gallery: Carmen Santoro and Ernie Thorne of the Ontario Professional Fire Fighters Association; John Blair, Damien Walsh, Ken Webb and Steve Buckingham from the Toronto Professional Fire Fighters’ Association; Claudette Holloway, Shirley Kennedy and Searle Schonewille from the Registered Practical Nurses Association of Ontario; Theresa Agnew from the Nurse Practitioners’ Association of Ontario; and Bruce Chapman and Stephen Reid from the Police Association of Ontario. I want to welcome them all today in the House for this moment on First Responders Day.", "Every day, Ontario’s first responders put their lives on the line to protect us, our friends, neighbours, communities and loved ones. They provide emergency and often life-saving services when we need them most and look after us in our time of need. We’re able to take comfort and rest easy in knowing that Ontario’s first responders are ready at a moment’s notice to protect our homes, businesses and communities.", "To recognize the ongoing commitment to community safety, the Ontario Legislature proclaimed May 1 of each year as First Responders Day. It is my great privilege to rise in this House to recognize and express our eternal gratitude on behalf of our Premier, our government and the people of Ontario to our first responders. This includes police officers, firefighters, military personnel, paramedics, medical evacuation pilots, dispatchers, nurses, doctors and emergency managers. It also includes the many volunteers and professionals who dedicate their careers to the service of others. Those we honour here today put themselves in danger so the rest of us can live safely. We hold them up as heroes because that is what they are.", "We know that being a first responder is more than a job. It is even more than a career. It is truly a calling. It takes a special person to run into a dangerous situation when everyone is running the other way, to put themselves in harm’s way to save a total stranger, and to be the one others turn to in their desperate moments. Emergency service providers are important members of our communities. They are also our neighbours, relatives and, of course, friends. Whether they are on the other end of the line when someone calls 911, or save a heart attack victim, or put their lives on the line in defence of our country, these men and women bring professionalism, calm and a helping hand in the greatest hour of need. Answering the call to keep the rest of us safe is not just something they do; it is a reflection of who they are.", "We also know that what they’re exposed to, frankly, are circumstances and situations that none of us should ever see or experience and that can take a physical, mental and emotional toll. We have seen the devastating and far-reaching impacts of PTSD. I’m extremely proud that our government recently passed the Supporting Ontario’s First Responders Act to ensure that they get the comprehensive supports they need to prevent, diagnose and support their recovery. This is absolutely the right thing to do because first responders are always there when we need them, and it is only right that we do the same for them.", "As the Minister of Community Safety and Correctional Services, I think it is also extremely important to recognize each and every police officer, firefighter, and correctional services staff who play a key role in keeping our communities safe. I’m pleased that correctional officers and other front-line staff in our institutions are included in this bill.", "Our government also recognizes probation and parole officers, nurses and other professionals who work each and every day to help those in need and keep our communities safe. These groups face unique stresses in their service to Ontarians. I want to be clear that our government will continue this conversation with them. We will build on and enhance programs to ensure that they have the supports that they need and deserve.", "We know that Ontario families and communities are safer thanks to the dedication of our first responders, who are there to help us when we need them most. I also want to recognize the sacrifice of their families, their partners, their mothers and fathers, and their children. Thank you for sharing your loved ones with us.", "We must take the opportunity to pay our respects to those who have lost their lives. Working with firefighters, police and correctional officers, we have created an annual tribute to honour those who have given their lives in the line of duty.", "Yesterday I was honoured and humbled to join our Premier at the Ontario Police Memorial Foundation’s annual ceremony of remembrance at Queen’s Park right here in Toronto.", "In addition, I also had the opportunity and the honour of attending the Ontario Association of Fire Chiefs memorial service for fallen chief officers. The names of these fallen officers are inscribed on the wall of honour—in the case of police officers—right here at Queen’s Park and in a memory book in the case of fallen chief officers. Let’s all take a moment to reflect on their courage, dedication and sacrifice.", "Heroes are defined by the way they live their lives in service to their communities and protecting those in harm’s way. To the families of those who have given their lives to protect others, we owe you an eternal debt and we keep the memory of your loved ones in our hearts and minds so that they may be never forgotten.", "Ontarians are privileged to be protected by our first responders. We are grateful for their dedication, for their public service and for their commitment to duty and service. To our friends here in gallery today, I want to extend enhanced gratitude to all the family members of first responders through them. Please, let them know that we thank them, we respect them and we owe them a huge gratitude for the service they perform in our communities across the province." ],

I often witnessed endless hours of marking and prepping for her classes. She encouraged her students to do their best and learn everything they could not just from books but important life skills as well.", "Ontario’s educators love their students and they work extremely hard on their behalf. I’d like to thank our principals, teachers, support staff, administrators and school boards for the excellent work that happens in our schools each and every day and for their ongoing commitment to putting students first.", "I fervently believe that the choices that we make in how we educate our children and young adults are at the centre of Ontario’s resurgence as the economic powerhouse of our nation. It is of the utmost importance that we support Ontario’s educators so that they have the resources to equip our children with fundamental numeracy and literacy skills to succeed in a competitive global economy. When we invest in young minds, it pays dividends to society.", "On behalf of the Ontario PC caucus, I want to applaud all those who spur student achievement and acknowledge the important role that our educators play in building our society.

I was especially honoured as Chatham police officer William Lorenzo Pickard, who died in the line of duty in 1922, was recognized at that ceremony.", "The ceremony also celebrates the ongoing commitment of first responders who are heroes in life. I was also very pleased to have spent some time with the president of the Police Association of Ontario, Mr. Bruce Chapman.", "First responders include police officers, firefighters, military personnel, paramedics, medical evaluation pilots, dispatchers, nurses, doctors and emergency managers. It’s important to note that those people working in correctional services, including correctional officers, nurses, doctors, mental health workers, probation and parole officers and bailiffs, are also first responders. They are our friends and our neighbours—some in the public spotlight and some outside of it—but all bring dedication and professionalism to their important roles. They all deserve equal respect and, perhaps more importantly, our support.", "However, not all first responders are treated equally by the province. When we call on first responders for help in times of crisis and chaos, they listen and they deliver. They do not leave anyone behind. Nurses, probation and parole officers, as well as bailiffs, were unfortunately left out of the government’s PTSD bill, and we hope that this is something that will be addressed. When it comes to first responders seeking support after coming to our rescue, we must not leave anyone behind. Our first responders are calling on us for help and we need to answer that call.", "Thank you to Ontario’s first responders for serving our province so faithfully and being our heroes in life." ],

Year after year, they claim to be investing in education, but year after year, we see the government not spend dedicated education dollars. In this year’s budget, there was a commitment to cut $430 million from education. Over $1 billion dedicated to our education system was not spent by the Liberal government over the last three years.", "The result is a continued and alarming decrease in supports for students with special education needs. This year alone, the Liberal government cut $8 million in special education funding to 25 school boards. Children with autism have been thrown off the list for IBI therapy, and there is no plan or additional funding to school boards to be able to not only support these students but help them reach their full potential.", "Provincial schools for the deaf and hard of hearing as well as demonstration schools for students with severe learning disabilities are under the threat of closure. Support staff and teachers are being laid off. Even today, during support staff appreciation week, 20 educational assistants in Bruce-Grey—these are the professionals in our education system that assist our highest-needs students—may lose their jobs.", "The repair backlog for our schools is out of control.

The government continues to starve school boards of the money they need to maintain these buildings, the very buildings that our students are expected to learn in.", "Child care regulations were brought forward where they redefined a 12-month-old child as a toddler that would place them in a room with children twice their age. Luckily, they have backed off on this plan, but the minister has promised to bring forward regulations again.", "We’ve seen attacks on education workers, both under Bill 115 and Bill 103—it’s important to note that the Conservatives supported both of those bills.

We see the good-news stories and we see the bad-news stories, but we will never see the gut-wrenching and impossible decisions they make all the time. We won’t feel the pain that they carry with them day in and day out. We don’t know the sense of responsibility and duty that they feel every day.

While we’re glad that police officers, firefighters, paramedics and correctional officers were covered under this legislation, we continue to fight for those who were not. First responders and front-line, high-stress service providers were left out quite decidedly. Nurses, bailiffs, probation and parole officers, and special constables were among those who were left out. We cannot leave behind those who are at the greatest risk for stress and trauma.", "When it comes to nurses, it was wrong that they are not considered first responders, as they brought up in committee. This government recognizes nurses on First Responders Day but not when it comes to legislation.", "We need to appreciate all our first responders and respect the work they do. They are heroes but, more than that, they are our friends, our families and our neighbours. They deserve to be supported and cared for too.

  "text" : [ "Yes, start over. Get comfortable.", "As always, it is my pleasure to rise in this House and speak on important topics, and none is so important as dignity and retiring with that dignity. So here we are, further discussing Bill 186, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Act (Strengthening Retirement Security for Ontarians).", "As I recall, I delivered about the first 40 minutes of my speech before we rose for constituency week two weeks ago, so I look forward to delivering my last 20—give or take a couple of seconds—this afternoon.", "We’re discussing Bill 186, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Act, which is the third bill related to the ORPP. I’m going to double back to a few of the issues that we were discussing before the break, as what we’re talking about is pretty important and I want to make sure the government is listening.", "When we first started this discussion about our concerns regarding the ORPP, we spoke a lot about the consultation process, or the lack thereof; the fact that this is a non-universal plan that will leave millions of Ontarians excluded; and our concern that by excluding Ontarians and complicating the plan, this government is seriously jeopardizing the potential for future CPP expansion, and what this will mean for all Canadians, not just Ontarians.", "We spoke about the definitions surrounding comparability and what would and should be considered comparable; portability and the minimum income or earnings threshold; and whether the investment body would be arm’s-length or if the government was looking to privatize the delivery model, like they have privatized so many other important public assets and programs.", "We asked whether experts and stakeholders were being included in every step of the conversation or if they were compromising the plan by caving in to external pressures.", "We asked about PRPPs, DBs, DCs and the PBGF. We had a good 40-minute conversation.", "Finally, Speaker, we asked about where the security, strength and reliability of existing pension plans fit into the government agenda—but more on that later.", "These are all important conversations, and just when I start to think that they’re all talked out at some point, the government continues to fail us on so many of these issues. They continue to delay and diminish, water down and walk away.", "Let’s not forget that these decisions have real consequences on real Ontarians’ real lives. It’s easy to get lost in the bubble of this building some days, but the decisions that the government is making are important ones. They affect how people will live in retirement or how they will plan for their futures, and they will continue to affect Ontarians for generations to come.", "That’s why we need to make sure that we get it right, now. That’s why the government should be listening to the experts around them. I don’t claim to be an expert, Mr. Speaker, but I have been meeting with as many of them as I can find, and let me tell you, there are some very smart people in the pension community, and they are smart people with their hearts in the right places, too. That isn’t always an easy quality to find, so I hope that the government has taken their advice more diligently than we saw during the ORPP consultation process.", "We’re getting down to the nitty-gritty now. As I said before, the clock is ticking. Of course, the government also has the ability to simply turn back time, as they did just recently by delaying the phase-in by a full year.", "It’s important to note again, Speaker, that this delay was only for the first phase of employers, which is comprised of the largest corporations in the country. The government seems pretty content reassuring Ontarians that enhanced retirement security simply cannot wait when they’re glossing over the consultation process, but they were quick to hit the brakes when their friends on Bay Street interjected.", "We see this fairly often. When the folks on Bay Street say, “Jump,” this government says, “How high?”", "By the way, smaller businesses are apparently more equipped to adjust for the plan, so the delay only pertained to the largest employers.", "Delays and adjustments, as I’ve said before, are okay. The government is supposed to adjust their plans as they gather new information. They’re supposed to re-evaluate as appropriate, take in new information, and make things better. But it just seems convenient that the new information always seems to come from the same place and benefit the same people, while Ontarians wait to hear what compromise is next to come.", "Let me remind you, Speaker, that New Democrats are supportive of a strong public pension plan. We recognize that Ontarians need the kind of fundamental change that will address a fundamentally changing workplace. Part of that involves ensuring that all workers in the province have a pension plan, because no one should be left behind. I think that when we leave people behind, we’re doing something wrong. We want to make sure that it’s done right.", "Everybody in the province deserves to retire with dignity and to share in the benefits of an Ontario public pension plan. We are, however, concerned that the legislation doesn’t align with the previous Liberal promises in all the ways that I’ve already discussed, and more.", "We hope that the Premier will continue to push the federal Liberal government to expand the Canada Pension Plan. Like everyone else, we’re waiting to see if the Prime Minister delivers on his campaign promise to see what an enhanced CPP will look like.", "As you all know, the CPP is a universal plan that covers all Canadians, including those working for the federal government and the self-employed, while the ORPP is targeted towards those workers who don’t have a comparable workplace pension plan.", "It’s important that we remember that any departure of the ORPP from the CPP will make it difficult to integrate the ORPP into a future and potential CPP enhancement. If the government truly prioritizes strengthening retirement income security for all Ontarians, then, in addition to the ORPP, it should be making sure that Ontario pensioners and pensioners across Canada are put first. That means working towards a CPP enhancement and it means protecting the security of existing plans as they continue to fall under siege. These are troubling facts, Speaker, and ones that shouldn’t be taken lightly. All Ontarians deserve to retire with dignity, and we are here to remind the government that “all Ontarians” is not a definition that the government can rework as they see fit.", "So back to it.", "During the first portion of my speech, I discussed some of the design elements and my experience trying to have an open dialogue with the government during estimates. For anyone who has the Hansard from that exchange bookmarked, as I’m sure many of you do and go back to and review on a regular basis for future reading, perhaps, I’ll give you a quick spoiler: They didn’t have too many solid answers to give. But that’s okay. It is what we have become accustomed to with this government. We will continue to hold them to account and fight to make sure that this plan is the best version it can possibly be.", "Let’s talk about exclusions. Moving forward, there is still a long way to go. The launch date of the plan is fast approaching and there are still a lot of details to be ironed out or potentially, more accurately, to be disclosed. This government has a penchant for secrets, but we ask that they deviate from their norm on this one and let the public know exactly where this plan is headed.", "The fact is that with each new announcement about the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan, a new group has been excluded, and often groups that the government has previously assured us would not be left out. As it stands currently, there will be millions of Ontarians excluded from the ORPP, including all Ontarians with a workplace pension plan that has been deemed comparable. That includes defined benefit plans, defined contribution plans, multi-employer pension plans, pooled registered pension plans, or PRPPs, and—where else?", "All of these groups represent millions of workers that could have made the plan stronger and more reliable, and they could have benefited from increased retirement security had the government not chosen to cater to the interests of big corporations. Hopefully, the list will stop here and we won’t see any additional plans deemed comparable before the rollout is complete, but we will be watching closely.", "Also in terms of exclusions, all federally regulated employees will also be excluded, such as those working at airlines, banks, post offices, radio and television stations, and interprovincial railways. It’s important to note that government jobs don’t always offer workplace pensions, particularly for those who are hired on a temporary or seasonal basis. For example, the Toronto Star recently found that 44% of the 10,682 jobs posted and filled at Ontario ministries in 2013-14 were temporary or seasonal, not including student summer jobs.", "Temporary foreign workers will be excluded, as would on-reserve First Nations employment, unless both the employer and employee elect otherwise; the self-employed, as to be determined under regulations; and whatever other groups the government decides to lump in and shut out as they see fit.", "The simple fact, Speaker, is that we just don’t know how much further this government will go to appease the special interests that are knocking on their doors. We believe that this plan should be for all Ontarians, and it is disappointing that the government doesn’t agree.", "We’ve asked a couple of questions. This isn’t the first time that we have brought this to the government’s attention. I’ll read to you a question that I asked the Minister of Finance back in February, following the government’s announcement that they would be delaying the phase-in period by a year for the largest corporations in Ontario.", "This is the question I had asked:", "“All Ontarians deserve to retire with dignity. Unfortunately, this government doesn’t seem to understand what constitutes ‘all Ontarians.’", "“Since the day the ORPP was introduced, this government has looked for ways to exclude people. First, they have slowly but surely decreased the number of eligible people, and now they’re just delaying the plan entirely.... Pension plans are made stronger with more people ... but the government is scaling back this plan by the minute.", "“Will the minister please explain why every announcement they have made about the ORPP includes new exclusions [and] new delays....”", "That was one question that I had asked.", "Another question that I had asked:", "“Less than a month ago, the finance minister said Ontarians ‘can’t wait any longer’ for increased retirement security. But now he seems to think that [they] can wait an extra year while they focus on a dynamic business environment.", "“The Premier and her government have grown out of touch with the priorities of Ontarians. These aren’t small businesses or mom-and-pop shops that they’re delaying this for; they are the largest corporations in our province.”", "So the final question was: “Why has the minister put the interests of big corporations ahead of the interests of” Ontarians? I’m sure we’re still wondering, but, of course, we never really received an answer.", "I know that the government thinks that they don’t have to answer us, but we’re asking on behalf of Ontarians. We’re asking on behalf of the millions of Ontarians who have been excluded from the ORPP and the ones who are being included in a weaker plan because of the government’s actions. Ontarians deserve these answers and it’s disappointing that they’ve opted not to provide them.", "This is not our first question. We’ve been asking about who would be excluded from the plan as long as I have actually been in this Legislature. The government has worked pretty hard not to provide us clear answers the whole time. I know that they’re still figuring things out. Had we made it universal, we wouldn’t have these conversations.", "Here’s a question that I asked back in November of 2014 about whether PRPPs would be considered comparable and subsequently excluded from the ORPP. You’ll notice that this is a follow-up to the question I asked the previous month, which I also did not receive an answer to. I had asked the Associate Minister of Finance, “Questions remain about the government’s proposed Ontario Retirement Pension Plan. We know that ‘comparable’ plans will be exempt, but the government is still to define exactly what that means.” This is a long time ago, when they weren’t letting us know what “comparable” meant. We’re still discovering that now, and I am not entirely clear on what exactly “comparable” will look like when all is said and done.", "“They continue to prioritize their bank-friendly PRPP legislation.", "“Speaker, I had asked this again and had not receive an answer.” So that day we asked, “Will PRPPs be considered comparable and qualify for an exemption from the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan?”", "At that time, they were telling us that PRPPs will merely supplement the ORPP. But back then, there was foreshadowing. There were hints that it would become a substitute. And now—flash forward—we have a bit more of an answer. It took a year or two to receive it but, yes, PRPPs that don’t yet exist are going to be considered comparable. It’s a shame.", "But anyway, Mr. Speaker, that’s the way it’s supposed to go. We’re supposed to ask a question, they answer, and then we share with Ontarians. I’m not sure if this is the accountability and transparency that the Premier preached about during the last election, but I think that Ontarians expect more.", "Ontarians have real concerns, Speaker, concerns that are being ignored. They have concerns about the ORPP and concerns about pension security in general.", "While the government is focused on creating a new plan that will exclude millions of Ontarians, they are simultaneously ignoring millions of other Ontarians who are concerned about the safety of their workplace pension plans. I have met with workers from GM, US Steel, Nortel, Sears, Labatt, and a number of other organizations that are worried about the security of their existing pension plans, which means that they are worried about the retirement security of thousands upon thousands of Ontarians.", "Recently, I received an email from an employee at Fiat Chrysler that expressed a number of these concerns. I’d like to share that email with you today. I realize that it came from one individual, but it really represents the concerns of many, many more. This is the email:", "“I am a retiree who receives a pension from the Fiat Chrysler Automobiles Salaried Employees’ Retirement Plan. I am also a member of the CCRetirees Organization, which is an active member of the Canadian Federation of Pensioners, which represents the interests of more than 250,000 retired Canadians.", "“I write to you today because I am deeply concerned about the health of my pension plan and the accountability, reporting and transparency requirements of pension plans in Ontario. Nortel is an ongoing example of what happens to pensioners without appropriate governmental oversight and realistic enforcement of the regulation to ensure employers meet their obligation to retired employees who upheld their end of the workplace bargain.", "“I consider my pension to be deferred wages—a promise to pay—earned when actively employed by my employer. I implore you to support changes necessary to ensure my pension security and that of all Ontario members of defined benefit plans.", "“Specifically, I request that you require:", "“(1) All plans must be funded to a minimum solvency level of 90%, with any deficiency below 90% to be funded in the following year.", "“(2) All employers must complete actuarial valuations of their plans annually, and to communicate these valuation results to plan members not later than six months from the prior year end.", "“(3) Prompt enforcement by the Financial Services Commission of Ontario to compel and ensure compliance with employer obligations. Underfunding in Ontario is commonplace and has been for years.", "“(4) Establishment of pension advisory committees with authority, access to plan information, and meaningful representation by plan members.", "“(5) Pension Benefits Guarantee Fund limits be increased from the current $1,000 monthly to at least $2,500. If plans were funded on the solvency basis as in point 1 above, the likelihood of requiring access to such funds would be greatly reduced.”", "He continues, “In my opinion the current 82% actuarial average solvency-based funding of pensions in Ontario is inadequate. The current Ontario initiative to allow a change from solvency funding to funding based upon the going-concern concept is a backward step demonstrating contempt for the bargain we have honoured.", "“I keep hearing retirement security is a priority of the current government but the failure to enact recommendations of its own findings and the continued acquiescence in the face of the financial sector lobby makes me question the strength of this initiative. I just want government to make the rules such that my employer, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, has to honour the promises made to me.”", "There are some excellent ideas in there, ideas the government should be listening to. I know the government doesn’t like to listen to me or to my questions, but I ask that you hear the questions of the thousands if not millions of Ontarians that are worried about their retirement security. We have an obligation to protect them, and listening is a great place to start.", "I think I have just about completed my 19 minutes and 44 seconds remaining. I’ll take this opportunity to, again, challenge the government to keep their ears open, as they are continuing to put final touches on this plan, to make it the best and the strongest that it can be and to be open to Ontarians and to really prioritize dignity in retirement." ],

Our goal is that, by 2020, all Ontario’s workers will either be in the ORPP or in a comparable workplace-based pension plan.", "Indeed, retirement security is about dignity. For me, the person who was the most dignified while I was growing up was my grandmother, Eva Hunter. She was a single mom of 14 children, and when her husband, Allan Hunter, passed away—an untimely death—she continued to be the matriarch of our family. I remember asking her many questions about life, and her advice to me was to put away something for when you get old so you can have your independence. That was very good advice.", "Section 23 of Bill 186 entitles the members of this plan to a pension for life. That will provide dignity to people when they are old and can no longer work because they will have income, and that will give them the opportunity to have choice. This is about ensuring that when people retire, they can retire with dignity and they can retire knowing that they will have a pension income for life. That’s why I’m asking all members to support Bill 186." ],

It makes it least affordable.", "Today, the Insurance Brokers Association of Ontario is in the Legislature, and they are talking about the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan to members as they meet with them. They are small businesses throughout much of Ontario—really strong in rural Ontario. Every one of us who are in rural Ontario knows our insurance agents quite well. They’re saying they’re disappointed that the government ignored their request to allow group RRSPs as comparable plans that would be exempt from the ORPP. By not permitting group RRSPs to be exempt, they will be doing more harm than good, as employers that do offer relatively generous plans may be forced to cancel their plans altogether in order to comply with the ORPP and control employee costs.", "My concern locally is what the Formet and Magna CEO said years ago: that if the government moved forward with the ORPP they would stop investment in our province. I have a Formet plant in my riding which employs over 1,000 people. They’re happily, gainfully employed. I’d hate to see investment end, because that usually means they’re leaving the province, and that’s terrible for my riding." ],

I would say: a little less Bay Street and a little more left direction, and then we would have a direction." ],

  "text" : [ "I would like to start by saying that I will be sharing my time with the member for Newmarket–Aurora and the member for Kitchener Centre.", "I’m proud to rise today and speak about Bill 186, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Act. As a newly elected member, I was propelled into this chamber by the constituents of Ottawa–Orléans, who believe that retirement security must be enhanced. I campaigned on this promise, and certainly it is a promise we will deliver on. As I was canvassing, I heard the concern of many parents and grandparents about the future of their children and also their grandchildren. I heard that our current retirement security will not be enough for the next generation of retirees. CPP will not be able to keep pace, and many fear that their children or their grandchildren will not be able to retire with the dignity they deserve.", "Also, I was a member who sat on the social policy committee. I heard from businesses that expressed concerns about the timeline of our contributions. This government has listened to their concerns and revamped the timelines. I would like to share that enrolment will begin in January 2017 and contributions will start on January 1, 2018. This will allow businesses the time they need to prepare.", "As a former business owner and as parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Economic Development, Employment and Infrastructure, I understand these concerns, but I also have to say that the ORPP can help businesses retain their employees. The ORPP is a way for businesses to retain good employees by providing them with the much-needed benefits of a pension plan. When both the employee and the employer are contributing to the long-term welfare of the employee, it signals a strong commitment by everyone to the happiness and health of this individual. A stronger and more secure retirement will make an employee happier, healthier and more productive, and I think it’s a win for everyone.", "Deferred savings in the form of the ORPP will also help our economy in the long term by creating savings for retirees to access that will help them retain their standard of living. This will ensure that they do not fall into elder poverty and also give them money to help support the economy through potential consumer spending. Collectively, we can solve a potentially large retirement income shortfall for our youth and young adults, who deserve to retire with the same dignity as their parents and grandparents.", "The ORPP also addresses a growing trend in the workforce. Workplaces are changing, and we are seeing greater part-time and contract work. Our youth and young adults are working in more less traditionally fixed workplace contracts. This is a concern we hear—and that I certainly hear—and we have an expert panel that is studying the issue of changing workplaces. The ORPP will ensure that those who work in this new workplace situation are able to contribute, giving them a secure retirement.", "With a growing number of people in the workforce not able to access workplace pensions or private pensions, we must enhance our communal pension system through the ORPP. Our pension enhancement will complement the CPP and also capture a larger portion of people who aren’t captured under the current CPP. Therefore, until we can have comprehensive CPP reform at the federal level, Ontario must remain steadfast in its commitment to protect the retirement security of our young adults of today.", "Enhancing our pension system through the ORPP is also a form of intergenerational equality. In our society, it is important that we realize that successive generations have a commitment to one another. As parents take care of their children and in turn are taken care of by their kids—I have to say that, working in the retirement home industry for several years, I definitely have seen this—we must ensure that retirement security is guaranteed for all generations across the generations. As our workplace changes and our generation passes, it is a matter of fairness that we continue to guarantee the same retirement security that each passing generation has enjoyed before.", "In closing, I know that we have debated the ORPP before. I actually spoke on this; it’s something I feel very passionate about. But I have to say it is important that we continue to discuss the virtues of helping the youth and adults who will have greater retirement security long after we are gone from this chamber." ],

There is real excitement in my riding of Newmarket–Aurora, as I am out and about, talking with residents of Newmarket–Aurora about Bill 186—the ORPP—what it means to them and, more importantly, what it means to their children.", "Residents have a lot of questions, but they are, and remain, exceptionally positive about the direction of the government, especially those parents with children in their twenties who are just starting out in the corporate world or are working in precarious employment. Parents, being good parents, are always concerned about the future of our children. So, for those people in the riding of Newmarket–Aurora, what I want to do is just take a few minutes to highlight some of the key, important parts of this important legislation. I am so grateful to the associate minister for shepherding this legislation to this point and I look forward to seeing it through the House.", "One of those key points that I think we need to be cognizant of is that the foundation of this legislation is that every worker deserves to have a secure retirement. It’s as simple as that, Mr. Speaker. The ORPP will help close the retirement savings gap for two thirds of Ontario employees who do not have a workplace pension plan. As I mentioned earlier, this gap is even worse for young people. Three quarters of Ontario workers 25 to 34 do not have a workplace pension plan. That’s why our government introduced the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan. Bill 186 is a critical leap forward in our commitment to deliver greater pension coverage and adequacy for Ontario workers.", "Carrying on, let’s look at some of the benefits of the ORPP. It will provide Ontario workers with a predictable stream of income, paid for life, in retirement. Ontarians will be eligible to collect benefits beginning in 2022; that’s not far off. The ORPP is designed to provide plan members a 15% income replacement rate after 40 years of contributing to the plan. A member would be eligible to begin collecting a benefit at 65, with actuarially adjusted benefits as early as 60 and as late as 70.", "The amount of money any individual receives from the ORPP after they retire would depend on how many years they contribute to the pension plan and their salary throughout those years. This legislation confirms that pension plans, contributions and maximum earning thresholds would be indexed to inflation, so that plan members’ benefits maintain their value for life. Similar to the CPP, this legislation also outlines a survivor benefit, and that is exceptionally important.", "I’ve had some questions from businesses in the riding of Newmarket–Aurora when we’ve been talking about ORPP. One of the things that’s top of mind is around the area of what is comparable. I want to take just a minute to run through some of those specifics, if I might, Mr. Speaker. As the government has previously outlined, Ontario workers participating in comparable plans will be exempt from participating in the ORPP. The government made this decision as we recognized that there are good registered pension plans that exist, and our focus is on ensuring those without plans are able to access financial security in retirement.", "Comparable workplace pension plans—and here are the specifics—are registered pension plans that meet a minimum benefit contribution threshold. Here’s the threshold:", "—defined benefit plans with an annual benefit accrual rate of at least 0.5%;", "—defined contribution plans which have a minimum total contribution rate of 8%, with employers contributing at least half that amount;", "—multi-employer pension plans; and", "—pooled registration pension plans, when available in Ontario.", "Those are some of the key things that need to be considered.", "A word around the administration of the ORPP, because I think people need to understand the thinking that has gone into how these funds will be collected and administered. The bill reaffirms our government’s commitment to ensure that the ORPP contributions are managed at arm’s length from the government. The ORPP’s administration corporation will have broad responsibilities, including enrolling members; collecting and investing contributions in trust; administering benefits; and communicating with employers, members and other beneficiaries.", "Through a very strong accountability and transparency framework, the board of directors and management team of the ORPP Administration Corp. will be fully accountable to plan members. The corporation will hold all contributions in trust for the benefit of the members of the plan. As I said earlier, and importantly, revenues will not form part of government revenues, and the government will not determine where and how contributions are invested. I think that is a very important point to reiterate.", "The government has designed the ORPP to be sustainable over the long term. The act would establish a formal funding policy to guide the actions of the ORPP and the government in the event of a funding shortfall or excess.", "In wrapping up, I just wanted to go back and reiterate one of the key points, one that is of great importance to the residents of Newmarket and Aurora and across Ontario: Passing Bill 186 will bring us one step closer to our government’s goal that all Ontario workers are enrolled in either the ORPP or a comparable workplace pension plan by 2020. It’s so important that we make sure those Ontario residents who are working will be taken care of as they enter retirement." ],

The one thing that I did hear over and over again in my riding of Kitchener Centre from our constituents was their concern about retirement security. After a lifetime of working, what a person in this country collects in retirement from the Canada Pension Plan and Old Age Security is hardly enough to live on. We want to ensure that our seniors here in Ontario can live with dignity and that all members of our society do have the ability to contribute to a healthier economy and to be able to spend.", "This is exactly why we’re introducing the ORPP. We need to help close the retirement savings gap. When two thirds of Ontario employees don’t have a workplace pension plan, it really became imperative for our government to take action, an action that the people in my community in Kitchener Centre tell me is very important to them.", "This gap is even bigger among our youth. When three quarters of Ontario workers who are between 25 and 34 are without a workplace pension plan, I do worry about the future of our young workers and I worry about my very own kids. My three children are among those who currently don’t have a workplace pension plan. They are all in their twenties. My eldest is the CEO of a tech start-up in Kitchener, and his younger brother heads the business development section of that company—you can say it’s a family affair. My daughter is graduating in a few weeks from the University of Waterloo with a degree in English literature. As their mother, I am very concerned about what lies in store for them when they retire in about 40 years’ time. I know they’re not thinking about that, but I’m thinking about it on their behalf.", "Because of the ORPP, we can be assured that not only my children but all children in Ontario, all youth, are going to be saving a little bit from each paycheque. That is going to accrue over time, and by the time they become senior citizens, that will be there for them.", "The ORPP will follow a worker throughout his or her working years. This is very important because today, as you know, people change jobs and careers far more often than they used to. This government understands changing times. Many young people don’t have the job security that we had years ago, when you might have spent 30 or 40 years working at one company. The ORPP is flexible. It’s movable, just like today’s workforce is.", "I’d like to share with you some of the other important details about this bill, Mr. Speaker.", "Our government made a commitment to ensure that the ORPP contributions are managed at an arm’s-length distance from government. This is important to us. The establishment of the ORPP Administration Corp. reaffirms that commitment. Its responsibilities include enrolling members; collecting and investing contributions in trust; administering benefits; and communicating with employers, members and other beneficiaries.", "The plan is built on a foundation of accountability and transparency. It’s going to be fully accountable to plan members, and to this end the ORPP Administration Corp. will not form part of the government’s revenues and the government will not make any decisions regarding where and how the contributions are invested.", "This legislation is made to last. The act confirms that pension benefits, contributions and the maximum earnings threshold would be indexed to inflation. Again, this is very important. This allows for plan members’ benefits to maintain their value over the course of time until you need them.", "The funding for this plan has also been designed to be sustainable in the long term, by establishing a formal funding policy to guide the actions of the ORPP Administration Corp.", "Finally, in accordance with our government’s focus on transparency and accountability, we have committed to introducing legislation this fall to establish an office of the chief actuary. This office is going to provide expert and impartial advice and guidance to both the government and the ORPP Administration Corp.", "Mr. Speaker, it was a very big decision for me when I decided to leave a 36-year career in broadcasting to seek the nomination in Kitchener Centre and run as the candidate there. I walked away from a very healthy pension plan—a defined benefit plan—at CTV in Kitchener that I’d been paying into for 33 years. This is what I walked away from in order to seek this position. It was—I see you shaking your head there, wondering why I did that—because I wanted to serve my community.", "However, for all of the people out there who don’t have pension plans, who are seeking more security in their retirement, doing this is important for the two thirds of Ontarians who currently do not have a workplace pension plan.", "Mr. Speaker, as a concerned parent of three young workers who are just beginning their careers, I say this to you and to the many people in my community of Kitchener Centre who spoke to me about retirement security when I was knocking on doors and getting feedback on what was important to people: I wish to express my sincerest hopes that my colleagues here today add their voices in support of the ORPP; in support of the dignity of Ontario’s seniors, who are looking for more support in their retirement years so they have spending power and so that they can pay their bills and live in dignity; and in support of the two thirds of Ontario workers who are currently without a workplace pension plan.", "I know that I’ll be supporting this. My colleagues on this side of the House will be supporting the ORPP. My desire is to see all members of this House stand up and say yes to this important piece of legislation." ],

Because the administration of this ORPP was also talked about, and I note that the government has hired their administrator for some $520,000. I can just imagine the bureaucracy that’s going to be created, so it seems to me to make a lot more sense, from the operations side, to just expand the CPP than to create a whole new bureaucracy.", "I note that today is the Insurance Brokers Association of Ontario Awareness Day. They left a position paper, and they say that “our membership does not support the planned ORPP.", "“We are disappointed that the government ignored our request to allow group RRSPs as comparable plans that would be exempt. By not permitting group RRSPs to be exempt, it will be doing more harm than good, as employers that do offer relatively generous plans may be forced to cancel the plans altogether in order to comply with the ORPP and control employee costs.”", "They go on to show that, “For the average brokerage earning $659,987 before tax, the cost will be in the range of $19,700 to $41,075, or 3% to 6.2% of average income.” They go on to say, “To impose a cost of between $788 to $1,643 per employee would take away 6.3% to 13.1% of operating profit per employee.”", "Obviously, they’re making this point today in their lobby day here at Queen’s Park, saying that this would be bad for all those many small businesses that are insurance brokers in the province of Ontario." ],

Sudbury is heavily unionized, with most unions having, up to recently, defined benefit pensions, the type of pension that the member was talking about and the type of pension that everybody wants. Why? It doesn’t need to be big, but it needs to be predictable. It needs to be managed in a way that you know how much money you will have and you can manage to live within this.", "I was giving the example of my father-in-law and mother-in-law. He was 93 years old when he passed. He had been retired for close to 40 years. He didn’t have a big pension, but he had a pension cheque coming every month. He knew exactly how much money he was going to get, and he knew exactly how to manage his budget so that he could afford to continue to support himself and his wife till he passed. They did that, like so many others in my riding, very successfully.", "So the problem I have with the model that is being put forward is that it is not fully inclusive. I come back to—we have the model of the CPP. The CPP covers each and every one of us in Ontario. Why don’t we build upon this? If we cannot get their Liberal cousin at the federal level to follow suit, why don’t we simply copy this at the provincial level so that, when the time comes, we can harmonize the two? But right now, with what they’re laying in front of us, it won’t be feasible, and it will be a huge opportunity lost, with some of the workers left behind.

I’ve been clear since this government announced the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan that I think it is the wrong course for families and businesses in the province of Ontario. In speaking to Bill 186 this afternoon, I am pleased to have the opportunity to dig into why I believe that to be the case.", "To begin with, Mr. Speaker, the ORPP essentially is like a tax on payrolls in this province. It’s more money off workers’ wages, and it’s a huge cost to the business community in Ontario. The government is taking money out of our pockets to invest in what they see as the public good. What defies believability is that in this case, the government contends that the public good is for them to oversee our personal retirement planning.", "Mr. Speaker, I think we should take a step back and look at the financial future this government has laid out for the next generation to date. Hundreds of billions of dollars of debt mean that higher taxes may very well take just as much out of our future retirees’ pockets as the ORPP proposes to put back in them. Even today, the debt requires that almost $1 billion per month is funnelled away from critical investments in the provision of vital services just to pay interest on that debt.", "The services that suffer for this, as all MPPs have heard over the last number of weeks, are education, autism services and demonstration schools that are robbing the children of today of a better future.", "Billions of dollars are spent annually on corporate welfare in Ontario, which the Ministry of Economic Development claims is to improve our economy, but in fact the government does nothing to track whether these vast expenditures create any beneficial long-term effect whatsoever. They don’t bother to track whether the jobs these companies promise to create in exchange for taxpayer money are kept for more than a few years. They don’t bother to check if the funding has any impact whatsoever on driving innovation or increasing exports.", "Just on this note, because it’s very topical and it ties into my message on Bill 186 and the ORPP, the member from Kitchener Centre actually just spoke a few minutes ago saying that this government is transparent.

To speak bluntly, with the planning we’ve seen from this government on a provincial scale, why should people trust their personal savings to them? Their record speaks for itself and it does not instil confidence with the people and business community in Ontario.", "Mr. Speaker, let’s talk more about the financial situation today as the government prepares to start taking more money out of our pockets for this scheme. Wages in this province have been stagnant. People are not bringing more money home today than they were years ago, but the cost of living in this province continues to escalate.", "The cost of energy has become crippling to many household budgets. I have constituents calling my office crying and yelling because they can’t afford their hydro bills and they don’t understand why those bills keep relentlessly going up.", "Meanwhile, this government is overproducing electricity while simultaneously building more wind turbines, refurbishing our nuclear power while hinting they plan to get rid of it, and all the while encouraging consumers to conserve. This schizophrenic and expensive approach to energy is costing the people of this province dearly.", "The carbon tax plan proposed by the Liberals has already outlined that the cost of transportation will also be going up. Because this tax will increase the cost of fuel, that means the cost of almost all goods will go up as businesses defray this higher expense by passing the cost along to the consumer.", "Perhaps the government isn’t aware of the level of personal debt most people in this province are already carrying. In a TD report from the end of last year, we saw Ontario hit a record high on the vulnerability index. Debtors in Ontario owe, on average, between $125,000 and $158,000. In a recent Financial Post article, Canada was singled out as one of most likely countries in the world to experience a serious recession in the near future, in part as a result of excessively high consumer debt.", "Many people took on consumer debt following the 2008 recession, as a result of the allure of ultra-low interest rates. This leaves people extremely vulnerable to economic downturns, which could quickly cause them to default on their loans or force them to try to sell their homes. In Ontario, this would be particularly devastating, because the over $300-billion provincial debt would inhibit the government’s ability to respond to meet new assistance needs or deliver stimulus.", "If the ORPP comes into effect, it will leave people with even less money to direct toward paying down their consumer debt, their high-interest credit card debt or their mortgage. It leaves them less money to invest in a business or education. It means they have less money to direct to retirement savings plans of their own choosing, all of which would almost certainly offer a higher rate of return than a government-invested pension plan.", "Even for those who can afford to lose that extra chunk from their take-home pay, it means that money isn’t available to put toward an emergency fund, pay down debt or buy a home. Not only would such measures likely offer a better rate of return; they would provide better assurance of financial stability in the short and medium term for families.", "In the tragic event that one partner passes away, the money they channel into the ORPP is gone, leaving their family even more vulnerable. If it had gone to paying off debt or to a rainy day fund, that family would have fewer liabilities to contend with. If that money had instead been directed toward home ownership, not only would that family enjoy the benefits of having a home; they would have that equity immediately available should a crisis arise.", "Home equity should not be underestimated. It increasingly figures into people’s retirement savings plans as they make strategic choices about what home to buy, with an eye to what they can sell or rent it for later as they downsize. The consideration of assets is a very valid part of retirement planning, and it’s a savings vehicle that would be made less accessible by the implementation of the Liberals’ ORPP.", "Having spoken briefly about the impact of employee contribution to this plan, I would like to turn to the other half of the ORPP contribution, which of course will come from employers in the province of Ontario. Along with paying the highest WSIB premiums in the country, high electricity rates and now the pending ORPP, our job creators are finding it increasingly difficult to grow their businesses here in Ontario. While this government may think that businesses have reserves of disposable cash available for this purpose, the fact of the matter is that it’s an added expense that makes each employee on the payroll a more expensive outlay. This cost will either divert money from further hiring or investment, which certainly won’t be beneficial for economic development, or companies will adjust how they compensate their employees.", "If it’s the latter, it will mean that the ORPP will be depriving people of even more take-home pay or will result in reduced benefits. Salaries may start lower or advance more slowly, so workers will take two hits, the first of which will be losing 1.9% in their take-home pay; the second, a reduction in existing and future compensation.", "The Canadian Federation of Independent Business conducted a survey of small and medium-sized businesses on this very subject, and the results were truly alarming. Their poll indicated that in order to cope with the additional cost of ORPP contributions, 69% would be forced to freeze or cut salaries and 53% would have to eliminate jobs.", "All of this fails to take into account that people are not approaching retirement saving the same way they once did. It’s a radically different employment landscape here in Ontario. We lost hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs in this province, most of which had provided extremely generous pension plans and benefits which extended through retirement. Those jobs are gone, and it should be acknowledged that this is due in part to the unsustainable strain of expense of providing such benefits in the long term. The truth is that we do not have evidence that this provincial plan will be sustainable either.", "The Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters certainly seem to believe that it will have a serious and negative impact on Ontario’s manufacturers and their 750,000 employees. Their report on the subject noted, “There is serious and widespread concern that this mandatory additional payroll tax will further undermine the confidence of an already fragile manufacturing sector. Simply put, as currently structured, the ORPP adds one more reason not to invest or employ more workers in Ontario.”", "The ORPP is modelled after the CPP, but the CPP benefits from an economy of scale bigger than what Ontario’s plan will access and it still suffers from a huge unfunded liability. It remains unclear what effect an expanded CPP would have on the ORPP. The government has been all over the map on this.", "During the recent federal election, the Premier very publicly lambasted then-Prime Minister Stephen Harper for his dismissal of the ORPP, while actively campaigning for Justin Trudeau and simultaneously spending well over half a million dollars of taxpayers’ money to advertise the ORPP during that election campaign. At the time, the Premier had indicated that if Trudeau were elected, she would reconsider the ORPP. Even just last week, the Premier was quoted as saying, “Our position has always been that the CPP needs to be enhanced, that it’s inadequate and needs to be updated. The previous government wasn’t interested in looking at that at all. This government is, and so we are going to continue to work with the new federal government.”", "So I would like to know what the Premier’s plan would be for the ORPP if the CPP were enhanced in two, three, five or 10 years. Once a new bureaucracy has been set up and money has been collected and channelled into investments, potentially for years, what does the Premier propose Ontario should do then?", "Saying that the ORPP would be folded or could be folded into the CPP is an extremely simplistic answer that takes a lot for granted, especially when so very recently, this Premier found that she could not work with the federal government on pensions. Not only that, but many employers who currently offer a pension benefit may cancel their program as a result of the implementation of the ORPP. If this program gets cancelled in a few years’ time, it seems unlikely that the employer initiatives will be re-established. Budgets will be rewritten and workplace pension plans will probably never be the same in this province.", "The Ontario Chamber of Commerce has long been raising the alarm about this problem. They are concerned that the ORPP would erode demand for workplace retirement savings plans and lead to a less diversified retirement income system.", "In Canada, we have a three-pillars approach to retirement savings. The first of these pillars is universal government benefits for seniors, the second is the Canada Pension Plan and the third pillar is employment pension plans and individual retirement savings. We’ve already seen this third pillar take a hit with the loss of hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs. Continuing to undermine it by forcing people to increasingly rely on the government is risky, especially when you’re asking for that money almost 50 years before someone will see any benefit from it.", "So far, this ORPP scheme has been long on advertising but very short on details, which is perhaps why it seems each successive poll on the ORPP shows mounting disapproval from the people of Ontario. The government loves talking about it in broad strokes, but the plan keeps changing and new questions keep arising.", "For starters, we don’t even know what this plan will cost to administer. That alone should raise red flags. The government hasn’t even bothered to figure out what this scheme would cost to administer. It seems unlikely they looked into any of the less-direct economic repercussions of the plan in a comprehensive way.", "The advertising the government has undertaken, while expensive, doesn’t seem to have been all that informative. During finance committee hearings, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business observed: “I’m not quite sure, though, that the average Ontarian actually understands that this is going to be money coming from their paycheque. I think they’re going to realize it after they see that deduction in 2017 onwards.... As a small business owner, you either have to take from your payroll, meaning reducing your labour force, or you have to pass it on to the consumer, meaning raising prices. If you keep raising prices you’re not going to be competitive and you’ll be out of business pretty soon.”", "The Canadian Manufactures and Exporters have laid out concerns that companies don’t understand what the ORPP means for them or how it will work. They also contend that employees do not understand that the ORPP will result in decreased private sector benefits such as wages, bonuses and contributions to their existing pensions and savings.", "It’s not simply understanding that is wanting, though, Speaker. These organizations have laid out well-measured and thoughtful critiques of the ORPP on the basis of unsustainability and the detrimental impact it may have on our economy.", "The CFIB and CME are not alone in raising such concerns. Many other well-respected organizations, groups and advocates join in their critique of the ORPP, including the Chartered Professional Accountants of Ontario, Primerica Financial, the Progressive Contractors Association of Canada, the Investment Funds Institute of Canada, the Air Transport Association of Canada, the Chemistry Industry Association of Canada, Trillium Automobile Dealers Association, Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters, the Ontario Chamber of Commerce, the Ontario Home Builders’ Association and other small and medium-sized businesses, citizens groups, municipalities, statisticians as well as public policy and business academics.", "This is what assistant professor Ian Lee from Carleton University’s Sprott School of Business had to say about it:", "“Under the ORPP, the mandatory employer and employee contribution that will be withdrawn from Ontario’s economy will be a combined $2,470 for someone earning $65,000 a year. That mandatory withdrawal from Ontario’s economy is money that will not be spent or invested otherwise, and this will slow down Ontario’s economy further than it already is. This is the last thing we need to do.", "“There is a perception that the ORPP will benefit the lower 40% of income earners. It won’t—because every dollar received from ORPP will reduce GIS benefits by exactly one dollar. Instead, it will provide a small net benefit to the top 60%.”", "To many of us, it is clear that the ORPP is a drag on the economy which offers questionable benefits. Employees, levied another charge on their paycheque, have less income to pump back into our economy; and employers, with the prospect of paying higher costs to keep people employed, have a disincentive to hire, and perhaps even an incentive to downsize.", "But what about the category of people who are self-employed? How does the ORPP affect those who work for themselves as carpenters, Web designers, plumbers or consultants? Unlike the typical employee-employer relationship, these individuals get punished even more—punished for the fact that they have decided to take a risk and start a business here in Ontario. The reason is that for a self-employed individual, they are both employee and employer, and as both employee and employer, the self-employed individual is responsible for paying the entire pension contribution levelled on their earnings. As we know, Speaker, an employee and employer share the burden of each contributing half of the pension amount; however, if you are your own boss, you must foot the entire bill.", "In closing, this plan has not been thought out. This is a made-at-Queen’s-Park pension scheme. It’s going to take billions of dollars out of the economy, as I said. It’s taking money and potential revenue from our small businesses in our community. But, of course, we know that this government only cares about the top 1% of big businesses in this province." ],

Clearly, there are provisions in there for survivor benefits, for continuing benefits, for the payout of monies that were paid in; that is in the legislation. That is also very similar to the CPP.", "I have to say that the member opposite, who’s a young man, a little bit younger than myself, perhaps isn’t quite thinking ahead 40 or 50 years to when he and his friends might need this money. People are living longer. The cost of providing home care supports for your loved ones is dramatically increasing, and it’s not realistic to expect government or taxpayers to be able to pick up all of those costs. That’s why a stable retirement income, especially for those people who have part-time jobs or have unsteady employment, is very important.", "Listening to the remarks from the member for Lambton–Kent–Middlesex, I can’t help but think that, 50 years ago, the very same speech would have been made against the CPP. We know how much that has done for the well-being of Canadians. This will continue that tradition of ensuring that Ontarians have enhanced retirement benefits.

They didn’t ask for it during the last campaign. I never heard that in the last campaign. What I did hear, though, in the last campaign was, “My hydro rates seem to be going up and up all the time. Can you help me out with that?”", "I also heard during the last campaign that there were more people using food banks because they can’t afford what’s going on in this province, and it’s very difficult for them to buy food and support their families. These are even families with two incomes—they’re low-paying jobs, but these families are going to food banks now, because even with two jobs they have difficulty paying their bills.", "That’s what the people of Ontario are asking for.

I strongly believe that this should be repealed, and any money collected should be refunded to those individuals or businesses who will have paid into this Liberal scheme.", "Mr. Speaker, I do want to be clear. This happens to many governments after they’ve been in power for a long, long time. I believe this government is, quite frankly, stale. It’s past its best-before date. They’ve been in power for 13 years, and I think, unfortunately, they’re making decisions here at Queen’s Park without thinking about what those impacts are going to be on the small and medium-sized businesses and individuals.", "When you see this government handing out $5 billion a year—or most of that money—to 200 of the oldest, most well-established, big companies in the province and they won’t reveal that list and let taxpayers know where the heck that money is going, I wouldn’t trust them to manage retirement savings for my daughter and future generations in this province.", "I just want to hit on the final point, and that is that this government is going to punish those people who are on the Guaranteed Income Supplement. As I said, every dollar received from the ORPP will reduce Guaranteed Income Supplement benefits by exactly one dollar, so it’s going to have a small net benefit to the top 60%. This ORPP should be dead in its tracks." ],

  "text" : [ "I’m pleased to speak on Bill 186, An Act to establish the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan. This bill is the third so far to deal with the ORPP, and I believe we are expecting at least one more bill in the fall session.", "My New Democrat colleagues and I want every worker in this province to be able to retire with dignity. We want them to have a good pension plan that allows them to retire free of stress and worry. We don’t want them to have to worry about paying their ever-increasing hydro bill, which is something this government has the most appalling track record with. Better public pension provision is the right way forward, and we in the NDP support a public pension plan. We recognize that Ontarians need the kind of fundamental change and retirement security that will address a fundamentally changing workplace. Part of that involves ensuring that all workers in this province have an adequate pension plan.", "Speaker, I’m going to take a few minutes and delve into some history. I remember, four or five years ago, that Harry Arthurs was actually hired by the Liberal government to study pensions in this province. Harry came to me a couple of times—maybe three times—in my office to speak to me, at the time, about pensions because he felt that I had experience after lobbying in Ottawa for a few years for the steelworkers on various issues, especially pensions. We kicked it around a little bit, and at the time, he agreed with me on some of the things we talked about, which I don’t see in this Ontario pension plan.", "One of those things, which is very important, is that this plan does absolutely nothing for a person over 38 years old. It does nothing to address current pension problems; it does nothing—absolutely nothing—to protect current pensioners. Yes, it’s good for my kids, and maybe my grandkids down the road. Yes, there will be something there, and I totally agree with that.", "However, one of the suggestions I made, which would have made this pension plan better and which this government did not listen to, was the potential of buying credits. So if you have RRSPs or other sources of income, you could take your RRSPs and buy credits toward the pension plan, which would allow you to get varying amounts—anywhere from $500 to $1,000 a month—with your credit. You’re only getting 1% or 1.5% on your money in the bank, or your RRSPs aren’t paying too well, so why not invest your RRSPs or other sources of income in a pension for you for life, starting at age 65, which would give you $700 or $800 and may allow you to pay your hydro bill, keep you in your house and not put you on the street, and, especially if you’re a single-income or elderly person, may allow you to stay in your home?", "They didn’t even consider that, and they did not talk to people who have experience in pensions. I never got asked anything about pensions. This minister went ahead, did her thing and didn’t talk to anyone who had previous experience. I sat with Mr. Arthurs for hours at a time talking about pensions; he’s the one this government hired to do that study. They’ve probably implemented about 10% of what he suggested.", "Then we talked about grouping pensions together: smaller pension plans that would be threatened at a time of recession or depression, that would fail or go under, or end up in bankruptcy or delinquency. We wanted to gather those pensions together into larger pension plans. There’s not a lot in here about that. They touched on it, Speaker, but didn’t do anything about it, really.", "I could go on for hours about what they didn’t do, but the bottom line is that it’s very important that the Premier continue to push her friends in the federal Liberal government to expand the CPP. It would probably enhance the ORPP. They’re saying that the ORPP will enhance the CPP—nonsense. The ORPP will not enhance the CPP unless I’m 110 years old. It’s not going to happen for 30 or 40 years, maybe. So that’s just a fallacy.", "We haven’t seen much improvement in the CPP thanks to the federal government. The Conservatives did nothing—kept talking about it and did nothing. Will she deliver on her campaign promise? I hope the Premier pushes for this at every meeting, especially with Mr. Trudeau. Of equal importance, if we do not enhance the CPP, what do we look for? Do you think the ORPP is going to help people in the next 25 or 30 years? Not. So all the struggling pensioners, our baby boomers—all the aging population—won’t see a dime. Great plan.", "Will the CPP be compatible with this ORPP, or will there be very difficult conflicts to resolve, conflicts that may be fundamentally unsolvable or challenged?", "When I saw this bill, Speaker, there were a few areas that gave me grounds for grave concern. In some key areas we are very concerned that the legislation doesn’t match up with the previous Liberal promises.", "This pension plan does not cover all Ontario employees. Some are in and some are out. That’s not what was promised a little while ago, and it’s not what we in the NDP have been fighting for for decades.", "Eligibility and inclusion is a really critical concern, especially if we’re talking about future integration with an expanded CPP. Any departure of the ORPP from the CPP, be it positive or negative, will make it difficult to integrate the ORPP into a future and potential CPP enhancement.", "One of the hallmarks of the CPP is that it is universal. We don’t see this in the ORPP, Speaker. There are some groups who will be covered by neither the ORPP nor what is defined as a comparable workplace pension plan. In other words, some people still won’t have access to a good pension, and many of those are precisely the people who need it most.", "There are other discrepancies with previous Liberal promises with regard to implementation timelines and benefit payments.", "I’ve been talking about this for my entire tenure in this building, Speaker, and for many years I’ve dealt with pensions. But as important as an Ontario pension plan is, there is much more that needs to be done for workers and retirees in this province.", "If the government truly prioritizes the strengthening of retirement income security for all Ontarians, then it should be making sure that Ontario pensioners are put first in the bankruptcy process. The Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act in this country is a disgrace, and the CCAA is a disgrace. People are treated much better in the province of Quebec. It’s not acceptable—and we’ve seen it time and time again—that when a company files for bankruptcy, money owed to the creditors is prioritized before the benefits owed to the pensioners, before deferred wages. It’s wrong, it’s unfair and it’s unjust.", "The ORPP is an important step forward to future retirees—young workers of today, Speaker—but it doesn’t do much to help those over 40, as I’ve said. There is not enough happening to protect current retirees and to ensure sustainability in existing pension plans.", "In Hamilton and Nanticoke, the US Steel debacle has seen the evisceration of pension benefits. We’ve seen explicitly that pensions themselves are under grave threat. Speaker, not only have they taken away the benefits from the steelworkers; now they are going to try and attack the pension plan. These are deferred wages which were negotiated over the years—benefits and pensions—under several contracts. We went out for four or five months at a time on strike to have these in legislation, in contractual agreements.", "The federal government has allowed US Steel to break contractual law. They’ve broken some labour laws; they’ve broken contractual law. They have broken all kinds of laws, and the federal government sat on their hands and did absolutely nothing. Mr. Clement did nothing. He had two years to nail these guys and take them to court. He let the time run out and then had the nerve to come into Hamilton and say, “Sorry, folks. The time’s run out; there’s nothing we can do.” Wonderful—really taking care of the people he represents.", "Okay, we see very explicitly that pensions themselves are under grave threat. As I said, the retirement security of thousands of my constituents is also in jeopardy. Just because the bankruptcy and restructuring processes are under federal jurisdiction doesn’t mean that they don’t have profound implications for the people of this province and the provincial government itself.", "I’m very worried, Speaker, that Ontarians working for the federal government are automatically excluded from this plan from day one, without any qualification. I wonder how many people that affects. Not every employee of the federal government has access to a good pension plan. In fact, we see more and more precarious work in both the federal government and here in the provincial government.", "We all know that the province has been ramping up the reliance on contract workers and temporary help agencies in order to avoid paying benefits, even basic benefits such as good vacation, paid sick days and access to a good pension. But at whose cost, Speaker? At whose cost is this? Precarious, uncertain work with low wages and poor benefits is one of the greatest challenges facing Ontarians. This government should be helping to relieve the stress, not making it worse.", "Instead of offering good jobs, many ministries and other agencies are helping to line the pockets of consultants and temporary help agencies while the people actually doing the labour are paid a pittance. We hear stories like this all the time. Every week in my office I hear this, and it seems to be getting worse. They can’t say anything on precarious work to private business with any credibility because everyone knows they’re one of the worst culprits.", "Beyond federal employees, there are lots of other groups excluded. It worries me that some of them are left to be defined in the regulations. We all know how far regulations go: At the whim of the government or the cabinet, they can change regulations. We need it in legislation; we don’t need it in regulation. These issues are too important to be left to regulation—far too important. We should be debating and examining them here in this Legislature. They’re going to leave self-employed people to the regulations as well as workers under federal jurisdiction, such as employees of airlines, post offices, banks, radio and television stations and interprovincial railways. That’s an enormous number of people in this province left to regulations. It’s very disappointing—very disappointing.", "We proposed a much more comprehensive plan in previous years, and I had hoped that the Liberals would be following that fairly closely. I put a plan forward a few years ago, a little more in depth, a little more solid and with a little bit more substance. Some of these things I’ve expressed here today would have been dealt with through debate, through committee and through input from the public and other pension plans. It didn’t happen, Speaker.", "The exemptions worry me. It’s nowhere close to being a universal plan—nowhere even close.", "The delays are of equal worry. Too much of this is being pushed back towards the next election, which makes me suspicious of commitment and motive—and with good reason. We don’t want to see this being used as a political football yet again. We don’t want it to be a succession of plans, consultations, announcements and re-announcements, like so many of this government’s projects.", "Transportation is a great example of that. Not the smallest project gets accomplished without having run through at least 10 re-announcements, 10 press releases and 10 photo ops. Often, it takes a few election cycles to get anywhere, like Hamilton light rail.", "Yes, we are finally relieved when a good project finally get on the books or gets shovels in the ground, but this constant cycle of delay, press release and delay in place of real action is not good for government or the people of this province. It hurts the people who are waiting on government action. Sometimes what matters is when—when, where, why, how and how much.", "We see that dynamic starting to unfold here. Are the delays creeping into this process happening because new information has come to light and for practical reasons of implementation—which is a much more defensible and understandable reason—or is it a combination of electoral calculation and successful lobbying?", "As late as January 2016—just four short months ago—the Minister of Finance and the Premier were assuring us that the first phase of contributions to the ORPP would begin in 2017. The February budget scotched those hopes. We discovered that the contributions would not begin until 2018, meaning millions of Ontarians will go an extra year without better retirement security. A year of pension contributions does make a difference at the end.", "This delay only affected the largest employers in the province, the ones who tend to have the most money and the loudest voices in the policy-making process—surprise, surprise. As our critic my colleague from Oshawa said, it just seems convenient that new information always seems to come from the same place and consistently benefits the same people.", "My colleague has gone through, in exhaustive detail, various aspects of this bill and the very worrying loopholes and weaknesses in it. For example, in the government’s discussion paper, they had said that the comparable—and therefore exempt—workplace pension plans should mean strong defined benefit pension plans. Well, Speaker, that definition has broadened considerably since that consultation paper, no doubt under the influence of various arms of the financial services industry.", "Some defined contribution plans are now considered comparable, as are multi-employer pension plans. But very oddly, there is a type of product classified as comparable which doesn’t even exist in Ontario right now. I’m talking about PPRPs, pooled registered pension plans. If I were feeling charitable—and I’m not—I might have called this legislation to accommodate a financial product of the future a rare example of forward-thinking government, but it’s anything but that. The banks have been through the revolving door here so many times they’re dizzy, because they don’t want their latest idea of a profitable product jeopardized.", "Several years ago, I was the NDP pension critic in this House, and our caucus made retirement security a top priority. We reached out to Ontarians across this province to hear directly from them what they needed in retirement, and what changes they thought were needed in Ontario’s existing retirement system. We came to the same conclusion that this Liberal government has reached: that a stronger, better public pension plan is the right way forward for Ontario.", "One of the things I suggested during the process was, as I said before, a buy-back clause, where you would take your RRSPs and buy credit for your past service in this new defined benefit public pension plan. People often make very little money on the interest on the contributions they make now. Other times, of course, they do very well. Some people would prefer the certainty of having most of their retirement income being based in defined benefit plans. This option would be very valuable to older workers who, through no fault of their own, were not able to contribute fully to the ORPP during their early working years, simply because it did not exist. It would also be of use to workers who, because of the exclusions and exemptions the government has included in this bill, spend part of their career unable to contribute to the ORPP.", "When we think about how precarious work has become, with people having to work multiple jobs or spend part of their time self-employed, and how difficult the labour market has become for young people early in their careers, it stands to reason that we should keep the ORPP as open as possible and accessible to all Ontarians.", "An RRSP transfer option could also be used to purchase past service credits. Unfortunately, this proposal for a buy-back of pension credit wasn’t included in this bill for the new ORPP. That’s very disappointing.", "The pooling of pension plans was never followed through to a great extent, like the Harry Arthurs report suggested, which would have made small pension plans more viable. What happened to that idea? How far has that progressed?", "The NDP, of course, supports a public pension plan for Ontario, but we want our public pension plan to cover the most people possible, and we want it to be in place as soon as possible. We think that this bill could be a lot better, and we certainly think the government could be doing a lot more to protect existing pensioners and pension plans.", "In closing, I just want to say that over the years I have watched a North American corporate attack on pension plans, on benefits, on working people. The results have been terrible. An example is that in some of the southern states, the people that worked for the city—the police chief, the fire chief and all that, in some of the cities in Alabama and Mississippi—went to get their pension, to sign up for it, and found out it was gone. The corporation had used it, just to survive, because the contributions weren’t made.", "The regulations and restrictions on the payments into these pension plans are not strong enough. Some of these companies had access to parts of the pension plan over the years, to put it into the market to try to make more money, or to put it back into equipment and improvements to the plant. Instead of using shareholders’ money, they used the pensioners’ money. That was criminal. And now the pension plans are underfunded—go figure.", "At Stelco, for example, we were funded at 72 cents on the dollar and it’s dropping. If the pension plan at Stelco was wound up tomorrow, pensioners have already lost all their benefits—I have 80-year-old women in tears phoning my office. They’ve lost their dental, they’ve lost their pills, they’ve lost everything. Now they may go after—the worst scenario is that they could get 30% of their base pension. Some of the workers who are not 65 have lost their bridge, which will happen soon if they go bankrupt—that would be $900 off their pension plan.", "Where’s the protection for the people who have spent their whole lives trying to build security and dignity in their old age? This plan is great for people in their twenties and 30s—it will help. It’s not the end to meet all, but it certainly helps. But it certainly does nothing for the precarious workers. It does nothing for the terrible situation in our province, all the pensioners that are phoning me up, afraid. Some of them could live 10, 15, 20 years more, but on what? They’re going to be on social assistance because they were robbed, deprived of something that they earned, or that their husbands gave their lives for or that they gave their lives for. It’s a disgrace.", "The sooner Canada and this province start protecting pensioners who earn those deferred wages and negotiated them fairly and honestly—until these governments start standing up to these corporations and say, “This isn’t going to happen in Canada. This isn’t going to happen in Ontario. We’re going to stand up for our people. We’re going to stand up for our people. We’re going to stand up for pensioners, we’re going to stand up for young people. We’re going to make Canada and Ontario the place to live.”" ],

That just, to me, makes sense.", "The survivor benefits portion, I think, is great.

As a single person, I appreciate that very, very much.", "When I look at the ORPP Administration Corp., as a business person, this is something that speaks my language.

The board of directors and the management team of the ORPP Administration Corp. would be fully accountable to plan members.", "Again, these are just best practices in pensions and retirement savings policy, so we’re applying these here to make sure that it’s at arm’s length, transparent and accountable, and that people know where their funds are being invested and that they’re being invested responsibly.", "The last piece of the bill is that it ensures plan sustainability.", "Again, these are all elements that lead to prudent management of retirement savings, and they ensure that the people who are putting their savings into the ORPP know what they’ll be able to get in return when they retire." ],

I guess they can wait another year, because in February 2016, in the legislation, it was announced that the first phase of contributions would begin in January 2018, not in 2017, as previously promised, which was, of course, a win for some of those stakeholders in the business community who have some concerns about this government’s ability, I think, to bring in an Ontario Retirement Pension Plan with some integrity.", "There are many, many outstanding questions.

I wanted to begin by just talking about this pension legislation in the context of what it means as a member of a government to bring forward legislation like this.", "We all know that governments—we’ve been fortunate and I’ve been fortunate, since being elected in 2003 to represent the riding of Thunder Bay–Atikokan, to be in government for all of that length of time, going on 13 years—can be transient and that you don’t always win the next election. We know that people see the civil service and the bureaucracy as the constant in our democratic exercise.", "Sometimes because of that paradigm, governments are seen as not making or developing policy choices in the long-term interest of the people that they’re elected to serve. We know and have been criticized—all governments get criticized for making what are seen or are purported to be by members of the opposition sometimes, or by members of the public or the media, short-term decisions that sometimes would be framed as being in the political interest of the government of the day.", "I think it’s important for me to start—and I only have six or seven minutes—by saying that clearly no one, whether you support the pension plan or you’re opposed to the pension plan, can make the comment that we’re bringing forward legislation here today that if passed is going to have some short-term benefit for the government. People are standing up on the other side of the aisle and criticizing this plan because it won’t have benefit for two, three, five, 10 or 20 years, but I think that speaks exactly to my point that we are bringing forward a piece of legislation that we know will build over time and that the benefit comes farther down the road. It makes my point that there is no specific short-term, near-term political interest in the government doing this, but that it’s a government that is doing it, whatever you may think, because they believe it’s the right thing to do.", "I think it’s important to remind people that this was not our choice. I can remember being in this Legislature years ago listening to Dalton McGuinty, when he was the Premier, calling on Stephen Harper and the federal government of the day and asking them—I could go back as far as 2008 or 2009, I believe is where it started, when the recession hit—to enhance CPP. That request went on incessantly for month after month, for year after year, and you can all pass judgment. My point is not to pass judgment on the decision that the federal government of the day made, but clearly they decided that they didn’t want to do it. They thought, I suppose, that $12,500 a year at maximum—not what people get, but at maximum—from CPP was good enough.", "Speaker, it’s important to remember that this is not a tax. Some will frame it as a tax. Please, we all know it’s not a tax. This doesn’t come into consolidated revenue. It’s set aside. It’s deferred benefits for people. This idea that they thought $12,500 was enough, I guess—fine. We’ll leave it that. There have been no increases to CPP in Canada for a very long time. The average draw from CPP for people in Canada is somewhere on the order of $6,500 to $7,000 a year, and it has been that way for a very long time. I offer that as just some backdrop as we discuss what we’re doing and why we’re doing it. We have been asking for an enhanced CPP for a very long time, and it just simply never happened, and so here we find ourselves. If you’re defending the status quo at $12,500 as a maximum and you’re defending an average of $6,500 nationally, well, so be it; that’s your position.", "Speaker, I want to offer a couple of comments; I only have one or two or three minutes left. The NDP and the muted, tempered support that now seems to be in place—they’re now saying that they support this pension piece, and they’re still finding the opportunity, when they speak on this, to criticize us on a variety of other factors. So I think I need to make the point that if they’re supporting it today, I’d ask them why they didn’t support it in 2014, when it was contained in our budget. There are still many people who wonder out loud why the NDP would not have supported—" ],

It didn’t matter to them then, but apparently it matters today. So when they stand and criticize not only the pension but find the opportunity to speak and criticize a whole bunch of other things, I need to remind people that this apparently wasn’t so important to them in 2014.", "To the Conservatives, who are in opposition, I would say just once again: An enhanced CPP was our preferred choice. I remember very clearly multiple requests for enhancement to the CPP. If people think that $12,500 at maximum is good enough, if they think that $6,500 a year an average is good enough, then so be it; that’s their position.

And whom do I hear it from? I hear it from women who have been retired—they are over 60, 65 or 70—and live in social housing because they don’t have the income they wish they had to have a good living and a good quality of life.

We should not think about tomorrow: “Am I paying into this pension plan and will I be a 100% beneficiary of this pension plan?” No. As a government, we have to plan.", "When I read that three quarters of Ontario workers aged 25 years to 34 years do not have a workplace pension plan—when I hear that two thirds of the workers don’t have a pension plan—it’s just a tsunami coming our way. So as a government, we have to plan to make sure that those who don’t have a pension plan now will have one.", "Yes, our number one choice was an enhanced CPP, but it’s not there.

Those benefits do indeed live outside of the confines of an electoral cycle. We are looking after the people of Ontario and the future of those seniors.", "Along with my colleagues, I’m very supportive of improving and strengthening the CPP. The CPP provides Canadians with a secure pension that is predictable, indexed to inflation and paid for life. Ontario has been a leader in advocating for an enhancement to the CPP. However, CPP enhancement needs a consensus, as we know, from two thirds of the provinces, representing two thirds of the population—a long and complex process.", "In the meantime, it would be irresponsible of our government not to move forward with our own plan to ensure a more secure retirement for the people of Ontario. Fortunately, our new federal government is ready to collaborate with us to streamline that administration and find potential cost savings for the implementation of the ORPP. We are also designing the ORPP to integrate with an enhanced CPP if it is one day achieved.", "Mr. Speaker, I support Bill 186, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Act, because it is a critical leap forward in our commitment to deliver greater pension coverage and adequacy for Ontario workers. Bill 186 enshrines the key plan design details of the ORPP in legislation, which were created after comprehensive consultations with businesses, unions and non-profit organizations all across the province.

We recognize that there are good registered plans that exist, and our focus is on ensuring that those without plans can also have access to financial security in their retirement.", "As a former business owner, I’m always mindful of the challenges and pressures businesses face, and I have spoken at length with many business owners in my riding of Kingston and the Islands. We’ve discussed that the ORPP should be seen as part of our overall economic plan that also aims to foster a dynamic business climate, create jobs and grow the economy, particularly, in the future. There are specific initiatives led by the Ministry of Economic Development, Employment and Infrastructure to reduce unnecessary regulatory burden, spur innovation, and help businesses grow their operations and compete in a global economy.", "I also want to make it very clear that pension contributions will not form a part of government revenues and that the government will not determine where and how contributions are invested.", "To support transparency and accountability regarding plan sustainability, the government is committed to introducing legislation this fall that would establish an office of the chief actuary. This office would provide the government and the ORPP AC with expert and impartial advice and guidance.", "This bill will bring us one step closer to our government’s goal that all Ontario workers are either enrolled in the ORPP or a comparable workplace pension by 2020, which will provide Ontario workers with a predictable stream of income paid for life in retirement.", "I strongly believe in promoting the interests of Ontario’s businesses while helping to build a more secure retirement future. While I continue to support a federal CPP enhancement, the likelihood of that happening remains uncertain. Meanwhile, initially, the ORPP would expand pension coverage to more than three million working Ontarians who do not currently benefit from a workplace pension plan.", "Mr. Speaker, I can’t tell you how close to my heart this plan is, this bill is. After spending some time in a federal constituency office before having the honour of coming here and serving as the member of provincial Parliament for Kingston and the Islands, I spoke with many senior couples. On occasion, one of the partners has passed away. They are reduced to trying to figure out how to live on $6,500 a month. That is not enough money. CPP is not sufficient to sustain seniors in their future years, in their retirement. It is just not working.", "I’ve heard today that there will be some support coming from the opposition, and I’m very, very pleased to hear that.

This is not their preference.", "I guess we can see why their new-found partner in the federal government is not coming through, to date, with an enhanced CPP that, obviously, would make a lot more sense than this Ontario pension starting from scratch, something that so many citizens in the province would not see full benefit from for another 40 years. We do see a failure here in provincial-federal relations: the failure to achieve an enhanced CPP that, at minimum, is preferable to what we’re debating this afternoon.", "One reason it would be preferable—and the Canadian Federation of Independent Business talks about this. They’ve indicated that the ORPP represents a 40% increase in pension payments that they would be currently paying, for example, through CPP. So regardless of whether it’s CPP or ORPP, or whether you call it a premium, or whether you call it a tax or investment or savings, one thing is clear: It’s a major subtraction from employees’ paycheques and a major subtraction of gross earnings of business." ],

So, obviously, that’s a long time.", "I come back to the question of why not, at least, try to expand the CPP. We heard, I think, from the member of Kingston and the Islands saying that we need two thirds of the population of Canada to be able to do that. Well, Ontario is one third, so it doesn’t seem to me to be that great of a challenge, and that’s what this government had talked about as being their first choice.", "I would say that that’s a better choice versus hiring the new administrator and paying $520,000 and then hiring communications people and paying large sums of money and creating a whole new bureaucracy. I met with the insurance brokers this morning, and the group I met with said, “Would you really want to give this money to the government with the track record that they have for looking after money? Wouldn’t you rather have the choice to look after it yourself?” I would say that that is a very real choice.", "There are a number of ways you can save money at the current time with RRSPs, with TFSAs and with pooled RRSPs. If you give individuals a choice to manage their own money, then they might want to use the extra money they have and put a down payment on a house. Generally speaking, the housing market does pretty well over a long time. It’s probably going to do a lot better than this ORPP. But with the government making the choice for people, they won’t necessarily have that down payment to be able to buy the house and then see the house appreciate.

I think that would be an interesting question to ask at most doors, considering that they’ve actually doubled the debt in their 13 years in government. They have the worst record in history, and they spend more money on debt and deficit than most of our actual ministries get. I’m going to talk about that a little bit more in my remarks.", "I believe that at the end of the day, the best way for Ontarians to have a strong and secure retirement is to have a strong and secure job or employment—jobs which many people are suggesting this piece of legislation puts at risk. The government’s own document shows we would lose another 50,000 jobs because of the ORPP. That’s half of my riding’s population. It’s a significant loss for our great province.", "We have a number of groups coming out. I’m hearing unequivocal concerns from my constituents in Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound about the timing and affordability of the mandatory pension plan.", "The Owen Sound Chamber of Commerce has stepped out and said they cannot support this $3.5-billion payroll tax. As my astute colleague from Perth–Wellington sitting beside me today said, “Any money coming into the government is a tax.” Regardless of what you want to spin and call it, a tax is a tax is a tax, and this is nothing more.", "There’s a united message being delivered by businesses, from the smallest member of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, the CFIB, to the Ontario Chamber of Commerce, Magna International, Canadian Tire and Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne, saying that this is definitely not a direction to go. That is someone who has the ability to influence a lot of jobs in our province, in our country and across the world. I think that what we need to do, at times, is listen to some of the experts who are out there and understand where they’re coming from. All the groups I just mentioned, with the exception of the Liberal government, agree that this is an unacceptable burden at this time.", "It is a payroll tax. Even the government admits that the provincial economy won’t fully recover from the shock of the ORPP for 20 years. So again, why are they rushing ahead to do this, based on rhetoric? It’s not like someone is going to get that pension plan paying out for them tomorrow. In fact, most people are suggesting it will be at least 40 years—20 years, minimum—before most see it, 40 years for the full benefit they talk about.", "One colleague across the aisle was talking about not being able to live on, I believe she said, $6,000 a month but then stood up and corrected her record, which was admirable, that she meant $6,000 per year. But I then have to ask: If they’re that concerned about people with $6,000-a-year income, why do they continue to double and triple hydro rates? Every time we ask them about that, they continue to find other ways to spin it and say, “We’re the best and we’re the lowest in North America and everything is rosy and it’s all good.” It is not rosy. Mr. Speaker. This is yet another burden on the people of Ontario, particularly our small and medium-sized businesses, although large businesses will be impacted as well.", "Disposable income and private investment will decline, and household spending isn’t forecast to recover until 2040. Mr. Speaker, think about those pages in front of you. By that time they’ll actually be in the workforce and paying some of the taxes. They’ll be the people who are starting to worry about their retirement, and they’re not going to be spun off on this rhetoric of a plan that is going to pay everybody out and treat everyone in the way they believe they want to be treated. It’s just not reality. Someone has to pay the piper on these things, and at the end of the day we have to be honest and sincere with people and tell them the true story.", "I remember the Premier standing up numerous times in this House criticizing former Prime Minister Harper for not buying into this plan—not doing it. Now they have the “sunny ways” Prime Minister, yet I don’t hear that they’re going to do that. In fact, there are other Premiers asking them to step back: “Don’t mess this up if we can enhance the CPP. It’s already in place. We don’t have to double the bureaucracy; we don’t have to put another whole administration and machinery in there if we can enhance it.”", "Again, I’m not certain why the government, who were criticizing the former Prime Minister for not allowing that to happen—in fact, they were pushing him to make it happen—seem adamant today that they’re going to continue to steamroll this bill through. I don’t understand, Mr. Speaker. They’ve got whom they want in Ottawa now—in fact, the Premier spent much of her time campaigning for the new Prime Minister instead of dealing with Ontario business—yet, at the end of the day, they’re not pushing today’s Prime Minister the same way, even though a number of her colleagues across the country are asking her to do that.", "This government has given no assurance that the pension plan will benefit Ontarians as intended—40 years before they actually get the full benefit of it. No one is going to argue if you ask them the simple questions: Do you believe you deserve a pension? Do you want a pension? Do you think you need a pension to have a better retirement? Absolutely, no one is going to argue that. But at the end of the day, what is the hit to the economy today? What is the hit to our business sector today? Who is coming to our province, and who is leaving our province, as a result of a lot of the challenges this government is putting in place?", "How do you justify the plan when everything is predicated on too much risk, when so much loss is expected? To the contrary, as I mentioned, the government’s own study and findings into this plan show that too much risk is involved. I ask again, Mr. Speaker, and I believe you might have said in your deliberation, who can trust this Liberal government to manage the finances after the track record they have shown over the last 13 years?", "We have to also factor in the lacklustre economy and our behemoth debt, the largest in the country, at $294 billion, and actually projected to go to $308 billion—unbelievable. You begin to understand why the Liberals are having such a hard time spinning and selling this policy to the people who truly are out there on the front lines trying to make a go of it in business.", "Despite public opposition and warnings from the business community, the government maintains that it knows best yet again. They told us that about the Green Energy Act. “We’re going to have these wonderful 40,000 jobs,” I think they said somewhere. I don’t think we’re anywhere close to that. At the end of the day, they said about the gas plants, “It’s only going to be a $40-million mess-up.” What was it? I believe it was $1.1 billion. So if we’re a little bit hesitant to believe when they state some of these things, part of it is that they have to stand there and look in the mirror of their own track record.", "The government maintains we should trust them with our tax dollars. Again, Mr. Speaker, I say to you, there’s not a tax they haven’t loved. I think a number of years ago—I can’t remember the exact year; maybe someone in the House can help me—they made a commitment that said, “We will not raise your taxes.” Then they said, “We will not implement a health tax.”" ],

As of today, Mr. Speaker—and you know this as well as I do—this government spends $11.4 billion every year just on interest payments. Just think of what we could do if we had that $11.4 billion in the bank. Then, when people come into your office and my office asking for special drugs for their children, when they ask for health care services—today, I brought in a petition about closing schools. We keep hearing from the minister that education is better than it’s ever been. Well, you tell that to the educational assistants that you cut. You tell that to the people with autism that you cut. You tell that to the special-needs students who don’t have the ability to have special education assistants with them like they had just a year ago.", "You tell them, the people that are actually losing their schools in small, one-school communities. There is no alternative. Some in my riding have more than one in a community and they’re amalgamating. Meaford had a great announcement last week, and I’ll applaud the government for that. That was a wonderful thing for Meaford. But there are five schools getting closed in my riding as we speak, and another round of cuts will come next year. They committed to address the funding formula two elections ago at least, and maybe a third before I got elected, and yet they’ve done nothing with that. So it comes back to trust.", "I’m going to go back to the $11.4 billion that they spend every year on interest payments because of the debt and the overspending that they have accumulated in their tenure. For much of the history of our province, we didn’t have the level of debt we have. In their 13 years, they’ve doubled that debt. They’re putting those pages in front of you—and all of the young people out there—at risk.", "They keep talking about retirement. What about the money we’re spending that we could be putting into some retirement programs, if we didn’t have $11.4 billion in interest payments? That’s more than this government spends on the whole community and social services sector, the people most in need. And yet, they’re okay with adding more debt and more interest payments and not helping out those who truly are in need. It’s more than it spends on post-secondary education. In fact, it’s more than all ministries, except health and education. I don’t know how anyone on that side of the House can come out with yet another budget when they continue to go down that path and think that that’s okay, that they’re not doing a disservice to the young people that are going to come along. My children—and hopefully, someday, grandchildren—and these young pages in front of you are going to be the people that suffer even more as a result. There are lots now. Our front-line health care services are getting cut. Our front-line education systems are getting cut. They seem to get away with all of these nurse cuts and with the schools closing. We don’t see a lot of backlash in the media, which I find interesting.", "We need to live within our means. We need to make sure that we’re not passing on that debt load to the next generation. I think you referenced your grandchildren that are going to bear the brunt of the decisions that they’re making today. The Liberals got to us in this financial pickle because of 13 years of incompetent budgets, overspending, mismanagement and scandal. Mr. Speaker, just for those people at home that may not follow as closely as you and I do here every day, I’m going to reiterate a couple of those, just to make sure that people understand a little bit of historical context, to understand why this really bothers me so much.", "We had eHealth: $1 billion was wasted. Gas plants: Again, remember, they told us, even after they got caught, that it was going to be a $40-million issue, but it was $1.2 billion wasted on gas plants, while the people of Ontario have got not one iota of power. Ornge: a half a billion dollars. SAMS: My colleague, again, from Perth–Wellington brought that issue up. It’s over $300 million and still is not providing the service to the people most in need the way it should. Time after time, the Liberal government’s projects have been a complete failure.", "With regard to SAMS, the government invested $300 million into a case management system that clearly was flawed from the beginning. I was the critic back when that SAMS fiasco came upon us, and I asked very directly the question, “Are you sure this is going to work?” They actually did delay it for a little while because they thought there were going to be some flaws. And yet, when they were ready to push the go button, they still did it knowing that this was not going to work. They miraculously found $50 million to pay overtime to the municipalities that got saddled with most of the front line. It’s not typically the minister who is answering all those questions; it’s the front-line people in our municipalities. It’s interesting that the government, with the flip of a switch, found $50 million to bail their own scandal out, and yet, when I ask for special drugs for children, we get a no. When we ask them for more needs, like our special education assistants, it’s, “No, we don’t have any more money.” They dumped millions more to fix that defective system.", "Now they want to run roughshod over our retirement savings. They’re trying to plant in people’s minds that they’re going to have this windfall, that there’s a money tree out there that’s going to spit out retirement cheques to every single person in our great province of Ontario—and I’d be one of those people who would love to do that. But as my mom told me, someone has to pay all the bills. She worked for next to nothing for most of her life, and yet I didn’t go without because she stuck to the moral principle of “I pay within my means. I only buy the things for which I have money. I’m not going to put a whole bunch of debt on and be the benefactor today but saddle someone else.” Sadly, this government is doing way too much of that.", "I hear a lot from businesses. In my riding, we don’t have a lot of large Magna types or a GM or a Ford, like some of my colleagues in Oshawa and other places. I have a lot of small and medium-sized businesses, mom-and-pop shops, a lot of contractors, a lot of people running a little general store, just trying to make a go of it. They’re telling me, “Bill, this is going to be one more thing that hampers my ability to maintain all the employees I have. In fact, I’m probably going to have to let one of them go because, with the red tape, with the rising cost of energy and with this new tax, I’m just not going to be able to continue to make a go of it.” There have to be people in the Liberal caucus who hear very similar things from their constituents. This isn’t necessarily a PC person talking to me; it could be a New Democrat, it could be a Green voter, it could be a Liberal voter. It’s across the board. I’m hearing it from all over the place. High taxes, high cost of energy, continual red tape and more administration are making it very much a difficult place for business-people to be.", "And then there are the people who are the employees. I’m not certain that many of the employees out there understand, or that it has been articulated to them: 1.9% is coming out of their back pocket. If you’re struggling now to pay the hydro—lots of us have discussions in this House. We have lots of people coming through our doors saying, “I can’t afford to pay my hydro bill anymore.” Where are they going to find the 1.9%? I believe, if I’m not mistaken, that hydro rates just went up again yesterday—another $37. So we’re going to miraculously find 2% out of their incomes? We hear all this talk about—I think you say it a fair bit—precarious work conditions, Mr. Speaker. I’m not certain how we figure that these people in precarious work conditions are going to find another 2% to put into this mandatory program—and they billed it that this is who is going to get the benefit out of it. At the end of the day, I’m very concerned about those people who don’t have enough now. They live paycheque to paycheque.", "It’s very disconcerting when you hear the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, the chambers of commerce and business-people saying, “This is not the thing to do. This is a job-killing tax.”", "They will even, to some degree, admit across the aisle that this is the wrong thing to do, because of the cost.", "We believe that all Ontarians deserve strong and secure employment, which then leads to a strong, secure retirement. Many people are not feeling that confidence. They’re very worried. There are companies that are leaving. There are companies that are coming to me and saying, “Bill, I was thinking of expanding my business.” But do you know what? With all of the things that are going on, particularly the hydro rates, particularly with more tax—they’re starting to get very worried about where this cap-and-trade is going to go and what the true impact is going to be at the front line. They’re very concerned. They’re concerned about the cost of food going up. Certainly, heat is going up, and insurance. Their kids are graduating with high debt and low job prospects.", "Youth unemployment in Bruce-Grey is a staggering 21%--the highest in the province, I regret to say. This is not going to help them. This is not going to create more employment and give people the ability to say, “I want to remain in Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound and work. I want to stay at home,” which I’ve been fortunate enough to be able to do. I’ve lived in my own riding my whole life.", "We have the highest rates, the fastest-rising rates, of any province or state in North America with our hydro. I keep going back to a couple of the members who spoke prior to me talking about how these people can’t afford to live on $6,000 a year. How are those same people paying their hydro rates? It keeps getting sloughed off by the minister, by the Premier, by the finance minister, that everything is rosy and all is good. It’s not rosy and good.", "I want to bring in, just in my closing, the cap-and-trade again. It’s very concerning out there that the Minister of the Environment is suggesting that a plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is going to cost a lot of money. It’s going to cost the private sector and it’s going to cost the public sector money. Finally, he at least has admitted that. Before it was all rainbows and, “Everything is wonderful. The world is good.”", "I heard today that on Twitter he actually suggested that we’re not going to have nuclear in 10 years. I can’t fathom it. Their government just committed to the rebuild, the refurbishment, of all of our nuclear units, which provide half of our energy in Ontario, and at six cents a kilowatt hour or seven cents a kilowatt hour with the new—and the jobs they provide. Think of the pensions that are paid in that industry, and he’s suggesting they’re going to be gone in 10 years? How is he going to do this? There are no emissions from nuclear. He wants to get rid of nuclear and the good-paying jobs, and we come back to the pension plan.", "Where does the money come to pay for this pension plan? They’re selling off Hydro One, a $750-million net revenue source, even though 85% of Ontarians suggest that we don’t want that. I’m not certain where all the money is going to come to pay for this pension plan. We’ve got lots of opposition from people suggesting it’s not the right thing to do. I would certainly encourage the government to go back to pushing the federal government to enhance the CPP and not mess that up so that they won’t do that.", "With taxpayers now that can barely afford Liberal policies such as the skyrocketing hydro rates, the government’s cap-and-trade slush fund and now the ORPP, I plead to the government opposite, the Liberals: If you want to bring dignity and security to Ontarians’ retirement after a lifetime of hard work, let them have the ability to have jobs and to have lower costs so that they actually have some money left to invest in their own retirement. That’s the best way. Let people manage their budgets.", "I have to say this, Mr. Speaker: Their financial management track record is certainly not stellar.

Within that critique, I did find some common ground with many of the issues that we on this side of the House have raised, many of the concerns that we have highlighted in connection to this bill.", "Foremost among those is the need to recognize the CPP as the preferred option to ensure the retirement security of Ontarians, and also the potential negative consequences of not modelling the ORPP as closely as possible to the CPP, because any deviation, any inconsistency, any discrepancy between what is being proposed in Ontario with the ORPP and the hopefully future expansion of the CPP could make that expansion very difficult. It could make the integration of the two plans unnecessarily complex, and it could therefore compromise the retirement security of Ontarians.", "One of the biggest concerns we have about the ORPP that has been proposed is its lack of universality. There are far too many Ontarians who are going to be excluded from this act. We would have much preferred to see a universal system that would include everyone regardless of whether they are covered with a workplace pension plan or not, and regardless of the type of plan they have in place. We know that workplace plans do not guarantee retirement security, and neither will the ORPP." ],

It’s our responsibility as government to take action when we see an issue that’s on the horizon. The fact is that two thirds of Ontario workers today have no workplace-based pension plan. If you look at younger workers, only one in four young workers has a pension plan.", "I was at Studio Y, a place for young, innovative social entrepreneurs. In my conversation with those young leaders, many of them have said that they have never been offered a pension as part of any workplace conversation. So when we look out on the horizon, if we don’t take action, that is of concern for us, because people will retire without adequate income and without that security that they need in retirement. With the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Act (Strengthening Retirement Security for Ontarians), 2016, should it pass, we are ensuring that over four million workers in Ontario will have the added benefit of a workplace-based pension plan through the ORPP.", "Speaking to the concern about coverage, we have looked at where the coverage is needed, and that’s for those workers without pension plans at work. If they have a comparable plan, they are exempt, because it’s deemed that they have adequate coverage. If they do not have a comparable workplace pension plan, then they will be part of the ORPP. For the self-employed, for federally regulated employees, we will continue to press the federal government to ensure that we can give them an option to be part of this plan as well." ],

I remember a while ago when the Associate Minister of Finance decided to have a round table in my riding of Perth–Wellington. The problem is, she just didn’t invite anybody to go to it. At the last minute, there were a couple of people that I know—I believe it was the night before, there was an email sent through that said, “We’re coming to town. You can come to this meeting.” When they got there, there was nobody invited from the business community except for these two people. They thought, actually, that they were at the wrong meeting; they didn’t know until the discussion got going.

I’d like to ask her how she grapples, when she goes to work every day and epitomizes a government that continues to overspend and put debt at levels that we’re never going to get out of for the next generation—I wonder what Grandma would say if she knew that she was voting to continue to go down that path. We’re setting a very dangerous precedent.", "She talked about responsibility. Part of that means having to listen to stakeholders like the CFIB, like the chambers of commerce, like big business. The Insurance Brokers Association of Ontario do not support it because they were actually asked and they put in a proposal and said, “We want to ensure that you allow group RRSPs because that’s a good, viable alternative to be part of for people’s retirement,” and they turned it down. So they didn’t listen.", "She talked about taking action. They are trying to, again, sell a bill of goods. My colleague from Timis-kaming–Cochrane, I think, called it the right thing: It’s a leap of faith that you actually believe that you’re going to get this. You have to be 25 and in very good shape to think that you’re going to have money at the end, particularly if they run out of assets to sell, like Hydro One, and keep spending the way they do, because at some point, the bank will come calling. It will be a living nightmare.", "People truly are out there struggling to pay their bills. They don’t have money in the bank at the end of the day, so where are they finding this 2%? All businesses aren’t making these huge profits that a lot of people like to think they do. They’re struggling to keep it all together.", "This government has the highest debt and the highest hydro rates in the continent. If they want to really help people take action, start taking responsibility, start being accountable for your actions; lower those costs across the board and ensure they actually have more money, so that they then can make choices about their own retirement and their own investments." ],

There are, of course, some very differing views on the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan.", "I want to just take a different tack, though, today. I want to talk about work. The nature of work, if you will, and the emerging trend or the entrenched trend, if you will, of precarious part-time contract work is part of this debate because of the changing nature of work in the province of Ontario, which has largely been overseen by this government.", "I’m going to quote a couple of things, and one is very, very current, Mr. Speaker. I don’t know if you saw this, but it was in the commentary from the Toronto Star, and it has to do with “Ontario Labour Laws Failing Vulnerable Workers.” These are the people we’re really talking about. These are the workers this government talks about and sort of waves the ORPP flag as the solution for these people.", "However, within the context of the world of work in the province of Ontario, we have outdated labour laws which “do little to remedy the dramatic power imbalance that exists between well-heeled company owners and their employees.” This is the title from the commentary.", "I would be remiss if I didn’t raise the issue of the Fresh Taste Produce company that operates as the Ontario Food Terminal, and these are 12 Tibetan workers who are entering one week into a strike as they fight for their very first collective agreement. Why is this important? Because almost every one of them is a refugee who came to Canada after a decades-long flight from persecution that left their families stateless. They’re not accustomed to having the law on their side, but their stories are similar to many people who seek asylum and new opportunities. And yet the promise of being a protected worker in the province of Ontario is turning out to be a very false promise.", "These workers are immigrant workers. They start their warehouse shifts while the city sleeps, sorting the produce you find at all of our grocery stores. Their wages are from $14 to $17 an hour. The opinion piece goes on to say that some have worked there for 19 years without an increase in pay. “Without a union, many haven’t had a raise in nearly a decade, and all of them earn wages well below the other workers at the terminal....” This is the nature of work where you have people who are doing the same work side-by-side and working at different rates.", "But, of course, “last November, these workers took the bold step of voting to join a union.”", "It was a process that should have ended with a contract, but, no, not in the province of Ontario. And “after five months of seeking wages, benefits and pensions on par with their counterparts, they are still without a first contract. Their only recourse was to go on strike, while the law allows their indifferent employer to simply bus temp agency workers past them to do their jobs.”", "How can these people, who are just fighting for some basic rights as workers in the province of Ontario, even think about contributing to a pension?", "This is the trend. “The use of replacement workers undermines what little leverage the law gives employees and the hardship of strike pay wears at their resolve. With no automatic mechanism to bring both parties to an arbitrated settlement, callous employers can simply play the waiting game.”", "We saw this with Crown Metal Packaging, which the op ed by Chris Buckley, from the OFL, actually references.", "This is “a frequent scenario that illustrates just how little Ontario’s outdated labour laws can do to remedy the dramatic power imbalance that exists between well-heeled” companies and the influx, and the increased nature, of precarious employees who work for them.", "So this is the context, and these are the people that we have to keep in mind as we talk about an Ontario retirement pension plan.", "The other one that I pulled out because of this debate is a Toronto Star review of public sector workers in the province of Ontario. This came out just before Christmas of this year, and it’s entitled “Public Sector Workers Feel Sting of Precarious Jobs, Data Shows.”", "This is a growing trend within the government of temporary work undermining public services, so there’s a direct correlation between the government as an employer and the nature of the services that the people of this province receive.", "There was an extensive review done by one company, one business here. They did a blitz, actually, and they found that three quarters of Ontario’s companies are breaking the law around precarious work, around contract work, around not honouring the rights of those employees.", "To see this trend play itself out in the very government that stands in this House and says, “We will not stand for precarious and part-time and contract work,” but yet they are part of the problem, is unconscionable. If this government wants to address the issue of people not having enough money to save for the future, then they should stop undermining the very people who are delivering the public services in the province of Ontario.", "“Despite its vow to tackle precarious employment”—this is a direct quote—“almost half of the Ontario government’s own job postings last year were for temporary positions....” This was data obtained by the Toronto Star.", "“In a province where around one third of all jobs are insecure”—one third—“a full 44% of the 10,682 jobs posted and filled at Ontario ministries ... were temporary or seasonal, according to documents accessed” through FOI. This is how we actually get information around there.", "Of note, this excludes students. These are not students. These are not seasonal positions.", "“Six ministries hired more temporary than permanent employees last year, including correctional services, community and social services, and the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities.” I think it’s atrocious that the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities is part of the issue of precarious employment.", "“Of the 300 job postings for provincial correctional officers, not a single position was permanent.”", "How can this government in good conscience, in clear conscience, say that these workers are supposed to be contributing to a pension plan when they can’t even pay their bills? They can’t get work, even within the government.", "“Critics argue that jobs that once provided a sure path to the middle class are now leaving more and more workers unable to access benefits or pensions.", "“They argue the large volume of temporary positions is creating onerous turnover and training costs.”", "Jessica Sikora, who is a caseworker at the Ministry of Community and Social Services and a young workers’ rep with OPSEU, says, “It’s a quadruple whammy.", "“It means there is no training. It means morale is down. It means those people cannot necessarily focus on the work they’re supposed to be doing. And that also means they are less likely to make the decisions that are most economically effective for the government.” So these people are focusing on surviving in the province of Ontario. They’re not focused on saving; they’re focused on just living day-to-day.", "This report went on to say that of the 63,444 people in the government, only 53,000 of those are currently full-time.", "“Critics argue temporary contracts are increasingly being used simply to avoid long-term commitments to employees.”", "You see, there are two sides of the coin on the pension debate. People have to have consistent, well-paying, safe jobs in order to contribute to a savings plan of any nature.", "Ms. Sikora goes on to say, “My experience is that it has become close to impossible to enter into the government of Ontario as a permanent employee.” This is a trend that we have seen, actually, in the workplace in the private sector, but it’s unconscionable that it’s also part of the government’s plan to outsource and contract out to save money when it actually compromises the level of services that we see.", "It says, “While temporary positions may often serve as a foot in the door, many workers—especially young ones—end up in a ‘cyclical situation where they’re in a job interview forever.’” These are the people we need to keep in mind.", "“All it really does is allow the employer to try people on for an extended period of time almost in a paid internship.”", "Finally: “Temporary workers in the public service do not receive a pension, benefits or paid holidays.” I’m not sure if government members know how bad it is, actually, on that side of the aisle.", "The other side of this as well is that last year, temporary caseworkers at the Ministry of Community and Social Services were hired at double the rate of permanent ones. The Star’s analysis showed that “while there were 42 permanent caseworker positions created, there were 84 temporary hires.” So it’s a one-to-two ratio.", "“The more turnover and the less experienced your staff, the more inefficiently (services) are being delivered.” This makes sense, right?", "Also: “When you work in a situation where you provide a front-line service, you have to be compassionate to the needs of the member of the public you are serving. And that is going to be that much harder to do if you’re thinking, ‘I don’t know if I have a job next week.’” That’s a very powerful quote from a worker in the public service, especially as we’re dealing with this whole issue and, quite honestly, debacle with the SAMS contract.", "Not only are these people just temporary workers coming in and dealing with very stressed-out clients because a computer program that was supposed to modernize the Social Assistance Management System—which was completely messed up by the company that was hired and contracted out to do the job. We overpaid by almost $300 million, and then that company just got another contract for $32 million to do the work to fix the problems that they created. Then we have people in your ministry—the minister has just entered—that are part-time, contract, precarious workers doing the work who are incredibly stressed out. These people are not thinking about saving for a pension plan. These people, as I mentioned, are really focused on trying to survive.", "Finally, Sheila Block, who is a senior economist at the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, said that providing good public sector jobs should be part of government’s efforts to reduce precarious employment. Of course, we agree with that. “If we have a government that’s committed to reducing inequality, we should expect that its actions meet its words.”", "A lot of this research actually was done by the Toronto-based Workers’ Action Centre.", "They have demonstrated a link between job security and overall well-being. “For example, a recent analysis by McMaster University and United Way showed that middle earners in precarious jobs have poorer mental health than even low-income workers in secure work.”", "Finally, “Earlier this year, the Star revealed that the government spent millions of dollars on contracts”—this will be good—“with temp agencies that its own inspections found to be violating the Employment Standards Act.”", "Now, I just need to reiterate that. This government is talking about securing long-term savings for retirement for the workers in the province of Ontario. The first place you start is by creating an economic environment where people can actually earn a half-decent living and where the government should be leading in this regard. We see that the government spent millions of dollars on contracts with temp agencies that its own inspections found to be violating the Employment Standards Act. That’s the nature; that’s the culture that we are dealing with in the province of Ontario.", "There is this general sense out there that the ORPP is a moving target. We saw that, actually, when the minister had said that Ontarians can’t wait any longer, and then, a few months later, “Well, they can wait one more year. One more year: That’s fine.”", "Language is really important, I think, in this regard, because the associate minister talks about “contemporary mobile employment.” You can’t make precarious, part-time contract work sexy. It just cannot be done. You can call it contemporary mobile employment, but that still means that you don’t know where your next paycheque is coming from. That still means that you can’t plan for the future regardless of the provincial strategy. Those workers are still trying to figure out if they are eligible, because when the plan was first rolled out, they were told that every employee in the province of Ontario would be part of the ORPP by 2020. In February, in the last budget, now we’re talking about “eligible employees.” If part-time, precarious, contract workers in the province of Ontario are not considered eligible, then 44% of the employees in the province of Ontario will not have an ORPP.", "Finally, just on the nature of work and the breaking of the law, this is from a Metro news article from January of this year: “A Ministry of Labour inspection blitz focusing on precarious employment has found 78% of workplaces in violation of the Employment Standards Act.” The violations of employment standards, it says, are becoming part of the norm.", "In this battle in the province of Ontario—because it plays itself out outside of this building—you have workers who are trying to fight for their rights as employees. You’re having workers that are trying to find stronger regulations around safety. You are trying to find workers that have a way to speak up. But “many precarious workers are too vulnerable to speak out about abuse.” Most of these people are young workers and they are new immigrants. Quite honestly, Mr. Speaker, it is an unacceptable model that “the ministry’s enforcement of employment standards still relies predominantly on individual workers coming forward to make claims against their bosses.”", "Well, if you are a part-time employee, new to Ontario and living on the margins of society as it is, for you to speak up and not think that you’re going to get fired is in large part why a lot of these crimes—because they are crimes; they are violations of a piece of law—do not come forward. One of the young men who actually had the courage to speak up against an employer said, “It doesn’t really make sense that a regulatory system is set up like that.... The onus can’t be on the worker who we already know is marginalized.”", "Let’s keep these workers in mind as we talk about the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan, because—while there is obviously this tension in the province of Ontario between those large corporations—they did win a one-year reprieve, and there are some people who are quite honestly happy about that—it is so important to get this pension plan right, to make sure that these vulnerable, marginalized workers are not left out of the so-called shared prosperity. Right now, they’re just trying to survive the so-called sharing economy, which really is not so much about sharing at all.", "A lot of people have written about the ORPP, and a lot of them have been very critical of the plan. One came from the Globe and Mail in January 2016, by William Robson: “Notwithstanding these announcements”—which keep coming fast and furious; more announcements—“and much advocacy pro and con, the government has published no numbers about the operation itself. How much savings would go in. What investment return it would earn. How much the ORPP would cost to run. The dollar value of benefits out. The basic business plan”—because there isn’t a basic business plan.", "While we are, obviously, supportive of a universal pension plan, we have serious concerns about the management of this plan and who will be running it. It was a little bit surprising to listen to who the government hired to do that, the former Pan Am fellow, which quite honestly didn’t seem like the best choice of leadership, if you will.", "But just to go back to the numbers—I only have a minute and a bit—if you compare the ORPP based on the numbers to the CPP, the CPP’s contribution rate is 9.9%. Its retirement benefit is about 25% of the earnings it covers. The federal Chief Actuary’s projections show that, working with real returns after expenses of 4.0% annually, the ORPP’s 3.0% contribution would be less than two fifths of its CPP counterpart, yet its 15% payout would be three fifths of its CPP counterpart, which implies net returns much higher than the CPP. However, it is unlikely that the ORPP will outperform the CPP, so even the numbers—the government hasn’t released them. This is actually a best guess, or speculation, if you will.", "But when you put this into context, because of government deficits and massive health care commitments, younger Ontarians are already on the wrong end of huge intergenerational transfers. It does not calm our concerns on the ORPP. In fact, we have many outstanding questions of it going forward, and we have a question of integrity of the plan moving forward so that it actually serves the people that it was designed to help." ],

There’s a huge amount of detail in figuring it out. She has figured out things like the details of the benefits, the contribution rates, what survivor benefits look like and all the details around what qualifies as a comparable plan because—I’m sure you heard from some of the same people in your constit office what I heard in mine—there was a lot of conversation around what’s comparable and what’s not comparable.

I want to make it clear that the pension plan isn’t part of government revenue; it isn’t some pool of money that the government’s going to play around with. It’s actually going to be like the teachers’ pension plan—a lot of people are familiar with that—or OMERS, the municipal employees retirement plan, which are administered by arm’s-length administrative corporations with a great deal of expertise, and what makes those plans so successful is the fact that they have independent expert administration." ],

According to the association—this is referring to the Ontario pension—they describe it this way: “A disaster—it will be a disaster. The industry is struggling right now.”", "The Retail Council of Canada, again representing precarious work, estimates the ORPP will cost their members $20,000 to $30,000 a year. You subtract $30,000 from one of their member businesses, and that would represent one employee, or that could represent perhaps two part-time employees." ],

We know that there are 100,000, and as many as 300,000, unpaid interns in Canada. Just as the member for Kitchener–Waterloo had reported about violations of the Employment Standards Act—flagrant violations of the Employment standards Act—with all kinds of marginalized workers, so are unpaid interns exploited and taken advantage of in workplaces across this province. Unpaid interns are not paid any salaries; they are not receiving any wages whatsoever. They will not see the benefit of this ORPP in any way, shape or form.", "Another point that she made was about the public sector and about Ontario no longer maintaining its responsibility to be a model employer in providing full-time, stable, secure work.", "We know that many senior women end their years in poverty, but currently, women tend to be more represented in RPPs because of public sector jobs. As we see more and more public sector jobs being lost and as we see the government moving more and more to precarious employment relationships, contract work, part-time work, we will see women who will be harder hit than others in this province." ],

Look, our government has made the ORPP one of the pillars of our economic plan. Why have we have done that? Well, we believe that every worker—every worker—deserves a secure retirement—I emphasize “every worker” and “secure retirement.” The plan will close the retirement savings gap for over two thirds of Ontario employees who do not have a pension plan. This gap is even worse for younger people. Three quarters of Ontario workers 25 to 34 do not have a pension plan. That’s why we are going to introduce the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan.", "Bill 186—the plan—is a critical leap forward in our commitment to delivering greater pension security coverage and adequacy for Ontario workers. It enshrines the key plan designs in the legislation. The bill also provides employers and employees with the time and the clarity they need to prepare for the launch of the plan, starting in January 2017, and for the collection of contributions, which will be phased in starting January 2018. Passing the bill will bring us one step closer to our government’s goal that all Ontario workers are either enrolled in a plan or a comparable workplace pension plan by 2020.", "Let me give you some of the details of the plan. The plan will provide workers with a predictable stream of income for life in retirement. Ontarians will be eligible to begin collecting benefits in 2022. The plan is designed to provide plan members a 15% income replacement rate after 40 years of contributing to the plan.", "A member would be eligible to begin collecting a benefit at 65, with an actuarially adjusted benefit as early as 60 or as late as 70. The amount of money an individual receives from the plan after they retire would depend on how many years they contributed to the plan and their salary throughout those years.", "The legislation confirms that pension benefits, contributions and the maximum earnings threshold would be indexed to inflation, so that plan members’ benefits maintain their value for life.", "Similar to the CPP, the legislation also outlines a survivor benefit. We’ve built on the success of the CPP by including a survivor benefit for plan members who are single. What this means is that someone who is not married can designate a beneficiary of their choosing.", "I do want to say something about the comparable plan exemption because we’ve heard a lot about this. As we previously outlined, Ontario workers participating in a comparable plan will be exempt from participating in the ORPP. We made this decision because we recognize that there are very good registered pension plans that exist, and our focus is on ensuring those without plans are able to access financial security in retirement.", "So, Mr. Speaker, what is a comparable plan? Here is what a comparable plan is. Comparable workplace pension plans are registered pension plans that meet a minimum benefit contribution threshold:", "(1) defined benefit plans with an annual benefit accrual of at least 0.5%;", "(2) defined contribution plans which have a minimum total contribution rate of 8% with employers contributing at least half that amount. Voluntary contributions would not be applicable for the purposes of the plan’s comparability test;", "(3) multiple employer pension plans;", "(4) pooled registered pension plans when available in Ontario. A pension contribution threshold will be set for PRPPs.", "Let me say a few words about the administration of the plan. The bill reaffirms our government’s commitment to ensure that the plan is managed at arm’s length from the government. The plan’s broad accountability responsibilities include enrolling members, collecting and investing contributions in trust, administering benefits and communicating with employers, members and other beneficiaries.", "There will be a strong accountability and transparency framework. The board of governors and management team of the plan will be fully accountable to plan members.", "The corporation itself will hold all contributions in trust for the benefit of the members of the plan. That is a very important feature, and I’ll say it again: The corporation will hold all contributions in trust for the benefit of members of the plan. They will not form a part of government revenues, and the government will not determine where and how contributions are invested.", "Let me say a few words about plan sustainability. The government has designed the plan to be sustainable over the long term. The act would establish a formal funding policy to guide the actions of the plan and the government in the event of a funding shortfall or funding excess.", "To support transparency and accountability regarding plan sustainability, the government is committing to introducing legislation this fall that would establish the office of the chief actuary. This office would provide the government and the plan with expert and impartial guidance and advice in the administration of the plan.", "Speaker, I’ve tried to outline the need for the plan, the details of the plan and the accountability provided in the plan. I think if we consider those three things—the need, the details of the plan and the built-in accountability of the plan to the members—and the very important fact that all contributions will be held in trust, government will not touch those contributions for its purposes.", "I think this is a good plan. This guarantees income security for all those Ontarians who worry about their future security." ],

It is always a challenge, I think it needs to be recognized, to speak following the Minister of Aboriginal Affairs. I want to thank him for his contribution to the debate this afternoon, and also for his consistent eloquence in defence of all that is good and progressive here in the province of Ontario. As he mentioned, we’ll be sharing some of our time with the member from Etobicoke Centre—interestingly, a community in which I grew up before I moved to Vaughan many years ago. So I’m looking forward to hearing our other colleague’s comments on this important bill.", "Earlier today, I had the chance to respond for a couple of minutes to one of the opposition members. I believe it was an NDP member who had spoken out, expressing grave concerns with respect to some elements of this legislation. At that point in time in my remarks, I had the opportunity to pay tribute to both the Premier and the Associate Minister of Finance responsible for the ORPP. I think it’s important to repeat and emphasize that we are moving forward with this critical component of our plan, of our agenda, that for many years to come, for generations, will help support thousands and thousands of people across the province because of the foresight and the leadership of Premier Kathleen Wynne and Minister Mitzie Hunter, who has been directly responsible. In that capacity, as per her mandate letter, the associate minister travelled to literally every corner of this province and met with business, met with the advocacy sector, met with so many others, and consistently was told that there needs to be something done on this critical matter that we are facing.", "The Minister of Aboriginal Affairs did speak to some of the specific details that are to be found in the plan. I’m not going to repeat some of those specifics, though it is crucially important for us to understand the mechanics of how the ORPP will function.", "When we had the debates here in the chamber itself and over the course of the last couple of years since we went to the people of Ontario in 2014 and asked for a mandate to deliver on retirement income security through the ORPP, what we heard consistently was that it is—and I’ve heard it in my own community of Vaughan, in York region, from a number of individuals who experience the challenge currently, in the seniors’ clubs that we have in Woodbridge and Maple, and thousands of others across my own community who expressed that because, historically, we haven’t had the foresight to undertake this kind of work, to embark on this kind of endeavour, they face some very serious challenges in their lives.", "One of the things that’s often overlooked in this place is that we have to give consideration to those who will come after us—not just serving as members of the Legislature, of course, but those who will live in this province, as I said a second ago, for generations to come—to make sure that they have the capacity to support themselves and to support their community, and to support our economy, frankly. From my perspective, this is not just sound social policy; this in fact, in the long term, is very sound financial or economic policy as well, and that’s something we shouldn’t forget.", "It’s also interesting, from my perspective, to listen to members of both the Conservative caucus and the NDP caucus when they get up—and I understand that this is just naturally part of the cut and thrust of debate that occurs here in the Legislature, as it should. Obviously they have concerns about the legislation, a lot of specific questions are being raised that have been answered already by the minister and members of the governing caucus and will continue to be answered through the rest of the legislative process.", "The one thing in particular, to both opposition caucuses, that I would remind them of: I get the role and I understand the importance of a robust opposition in the legislative process but, sometimes, on matters that are of such critical importance for the future well-being of our province, I think that we all have to remember, as the saying goes, to not let the perfect be the enemy of the good. The ORPP, frankly, is far more than just good; it’s actually tremendous in terms of being able to continue to move the yardsticks forward.", "So I would say to members of the Conservatives and the NDP caucuses to remember that, as we work on these kinds of undertakings together, we have to think, as I said earlier, about where we’re going to be not just this year, but where we’re going to be over the next couple of years, where we’ll be over the next couple of decades and looking forward to that point in time. Because I know, as I said earlier today when I had a couple of minutes to respond or ask questions of one of the previous speakers, that when you think about how we can best position ourselves to make decisions today so that, in the future, we not only continue to have a flourishing middle class in this province that we continue to support, but how we can continue to expand the middle class and give those who live here in the province today who are working—one of the speakers in the Conservative caucus—it might have been the member from Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound—earlier today repeatedly referenced the pages who sit near you." ],

It’s why those on this side of the House speak so passionately, so consistently and so eloquently, as the Minister of Aboriginal Affairs did, about this: because we recognize that it is extremely important for us to get it right. It’s extremely important for us to make sure that the ORPP is nimble enough to support that brighter and more prosperous economic future and, at the same time, help support the existing businesses that we have in this province that need to continue to flourish so they can employ more people and they can help us, in turn, leverage that for that brighter quality of life that we are all here to deliver for the people of Ontario.", "Again, I recognize that members of both opposition caucuses will have their questions and their concerns—it’s exactly in keeping with what they should be doing—but I would just say on this one that, at all times, a little bit of recognition that we are moving the yardsticks forward on this in such an important way on such a critical topic. I will hope, of course, as I often do, because I’m an optimist by nature in this place, that we can work together on something like this.

Early on, soon after I got elected, there were a number of constituents who came to see me to talk about a range of issues. In my community, as I’ve mentioned in this Legislature before, I have quite a large population of seniors, so people who are retired or are about to enter retirement.", "I remember one constituent in particular who came to see me. She was still in very good health, but well into her eighties, and she was talking about how she was simply running out of savings. She had had employment, she had saved for retirement, but she didn’t have enough. It was very sad. She was talking about how she was having to sell her home to generate the cash that she needed to be able to survive.", "That story, in particular, sticks out in my mind because—she would have been earning CPP, but when I think back to the time when the CPP was created and the current CPP regimen was put in place, I don’t think we anticipated that people would be living as long as they are or that the cost of living would be what it is today. It doesn’t accommodate the needs of people who are retiring in this day and age, and it’s certainly not accommodating those people who are going to be retiring when the Minister of Transportation’s children are retiring, as he noted.", "So I think that securing retirement savings is a really important initiative, and this bill helps support that. It helps make that a reality.", "I agree with what the Minister of Transportation was saying: I think we will look back on the foresight of our Premier and this government in taking on the issue of retirement savings. We’ll look back on this, just like we’ll look back on the infrastructure investments, and say that it took a lot of political courage but it was the right thing to do, and it changed the lives of hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people in the long term.", "The bill that we’re debating here today, obviously, supports the implementation of the ORPP. There are a couple of things that I want to speak to in my remaining time, and one of them is how it’s being set up in a way that is transparent and also at arm’s length. Through this bill, we create the ORPP Administration Corp. This ensures that this body is managing the contributions at arm’s length from the government. I think that’s really important for people to note and understand. Their responsibilities include enrolling members, investing contributions in trust, administering benefits and things like that—basically, managing the savings that people have put into the ORPP. I think that’s really important.", "The other piece that I think is important is that there’s accountability, a transparency framework and approach. That ensures that the administration corporation, which is managing the money of those who have entrusted their savings to this corporation—that they have a view and an ability to oversee what it is that the administration corporation is doing with their funds. I think that’s a very, very important thing.", "When I think about my experience in business, some of the most important elements of ensuring good governance—not the only ones—are transparency and direct accountability, and that’s what this does.", "Another piece of governance that’s really important is making sure that you alleviate conflicts of interest. By having this managed at arm’s length, you have a group of people who are professional, who are experienced or qualified, but also whose focus is to deliver for those people who have entrusted their savings to the plan.", "The other piece that’s important to highlight is the fact that this bill supports the sustainability of the ORPP, by establishing a formal funding policy to guide the actions of the administrative corporation in the event of a funding shortfall or excess. This is just prudent financial management, and I know from my business background that this is really important.", "In a nutshell, Speaker, we need to help people supplement their retirement savings, and to do that, we need to have good governance, transparency, accountability and arm’s-length implementation. That’s what this bill supports." ],

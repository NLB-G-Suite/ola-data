  "text" : [ "Good morning, Mr. Speaker. Thank you for allowing me to speak to Bill 109 here today. As with every bill this Liberal government puts forward these days, there are quite a few changes across a number of laws that are being pushed through under one piece of legislation. We started to see that some of these bills contain some provisions and changes that are good for hard-working men and women in Ontario, alongside policies that simply make no sense. Bill 109 is no different.", "I’m going to touch on several different aspects of the bill during my time. Hopefully, I can cover what makes sense in this bill and what needs to be removed or split into separate bills.", "I’d like to first touch on how this bill affects our first responders—our local professional and volunteer firefighters. Mr. Speaker, as we all know, one of the major roles of the bill is to amend the 1997 Fire Protection and Prevention Act. I have stood up in this House many times before and talked about the importance of our first responders and, frankly, I’m happy to do it again. I don’t think anyone here would disagree with me when I talk about how important our first responders are to all our communities. I certainly hope that the work they do for us isn’t lost on anyone in this chamber or anyone watching at home. It’s incredible, it’s heroic and it deserves to be recognized.", "When the unthinkable happens in our communities, it is those first responders who keep us safe. They are the ones who put their lives on the line to make sure that our loved ones are all right. Taking a look at these numbers, Mr. Speaker, all 11,000 professional firefighters and 19,000 volunteer firefighters in this province are normal, everyday people like you and me, who take on this great responsibility. Across the province, I am proud to say that they do an incredible job, and I’m even prouder to call many of them my friends.", "Briefly, I would like to focus on just one group of these first responders. If I had enough time to talk about all of them, I would; honestly, they all deserve our recognition. In my riding of Niagara Falls, the firefighters, whether they are full-time or volunteer, are an integral part of our community.", "These brave men and women already give our communities such an incredible gift that I don’t believe they owe us anything—and yet they continue to give and be the cornerstones of our neighbourhoods. Take the professional firefighters in Niagara Falls, for example: Just last week in Niagara Falls, the local firefighters held their annual haunted house, which brought in donations to our local food bank, Project Share. They were there using their spare time to get donations for those who need it the most. Despite the fact that many of them had spent the previous week working hard throughout the night to ensure that we could sleep well, they still came out for a great cause.", "This is no different than the fundraising efforts of the volunteer forces in smaller communities: in Fort Erie, Niagara-on-the-Lake, Stevensville, Crystal Beach and Ridgeway. I would be here all day if I tried to list all the dinners and fundraisers these people put on to help our community. Not one of these groups of dedicated men and women have ever felt that they were only first responders. They all give back to our communities, and they all do an incredible job.", "Mr. Speaker, what I’m trying to get at here is that these men and women give so much to us that it’s our obligation to ensure that they are taken care of. We’ve had some movement on recognizing that the unique cancers they face in their workplace need to be covered. But there is still work to do, especially around the issue of making sure post-traumatic stress disorder treatments are taken care of. When it comes to issues of mental health protection for our first responders, this province needs to move forward more quickly and ensure that we are not leaving any first responder behind.", "I’m happy to see some pieces of legislation coming in to protect our first responders, but more needs to be done. I’ve seen first-hand in my riding where firefighters have died because of workplace cancers or hazards. Simply put, this is something that our province needs to make sure they have support for.", "In my riding, there was a firefighter named Tim Hoday who served the force for 32 years. In April of this year, Tim passed away at the age of 55 after battling leukemia that he contracted during his work years. It was a sad day for the force and, really, for all of Niagara Falls. Clearly, this is an issue that is ongoing and one that needs to be addressed as soon as possible.", "In Bill 109, I see that we’re bringing a number of protections that exist under the Fire Protection and Prevention Act into the Labour Relations Act. It is my understanding that this would make the grievance arbitration process move more quickly. So long as firefighters aren’t losing any protection—and I don’t believe, with the way this is written, that they will—then this is something I can say is worthy of support. When I read about procedures to ensure we can have a quick grievance arbitration, I see that other unionized workers have this in their collective agreements—and have had it for decades. So it’s time that we expand these procedures to our firefighters. I understand that they’ve been extremely frustrated in the past by the lengthy nature of the arbitration process, so I’m glad to see it’s being fixed. If other workers have these rights and the Ontario Labour Relations Board can handle these issues quicker than the Ontario courts, then in my mind it makes sense to bring the two together.", "Mr. Speaker, we need to ensure that every single man and woman who wakes up in the morning and goes to work is fully protected, under the laws of this province, and goes to work in a safe workplace. That means we have to ensure that laws exist that keep them safe and that those laws are Unifor—uniform—across the province." ],

  "text" : [ "Sorry about that. Hey, it happens.", "In a lot of workplaces where there are gaps in these laws, it’s unions who step in to protect workers. They work language into collective agreements that provides safety training, safety regulations and protections in case of injuries. We need to do everything we can to ensure that every worker in this province has the protection they require to do their job safely and to be secure if the worse should happen.", "When a bill of this nature comes forward, I always like to ask my first responders how they feel about it. It’s very important to me to ensure that I bring these bills back to my community, discuss them and bring them back here. That’s the way we should get community input. It is my hope that when we bring these recommendations back to the House, they get implemented when bills go to committee. The Liberals may have a majority government, but they still have a responsibility to represent everyone in the province of Ontario.", "When I brought this bill to the local firefighters, they said they were happy with the language that was in it. So I can say I am also happy to know that they will receive the protection afforded to them and other workers under the Labour Relations Act.", "I’m also happy to know that grievances can be dealt with in a more efficient manner. We all know that the wheels of justice turn slowly, and there is no need to get these complex cases caught up in the Ontario courts. If there is a way for other workers to solve their problems quickly and cleanly, then our firefighters’ associations should have that same process.", "I’d like to touch briefly on section 3 of this bill as well, which amends the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act, 1997. The bill adds some provisions which will ensure that employers do not try to stop a worker from reporting a workplace injury. I think I stand with both workers and even employers in this province when I say that this is important. I look at the businesses in my riding, and I know that those employers want their workers to be as safe as they can be.", "No one wants to see anyone hurt on the job, or even killed. People in my riding are just honest, hard-working people. Employers do want to help their employees get ahead and live good lives, and they want them to do it safely. So when we write this kind of legislation, I believe it targets very few employers; the kind of people who do not have the health of their employees in mind. It’s unfortunate, but sometimes that happens in the workplace. I don’t believe any single man or woman should have to wake up in the morning and worry about whether or not they will come home at night.", "I’ve worked in manufacturing plants where there was quite a bit of danger. I’ve seen workers take up the cause of health and safety themselves. It’s important to them, and it needs to be important to us. As legislators, it is important for us to support them, and it’s the right thing to do.", "Frankly, there are reasons that accident reporting needs to happen. If a worker is injured on the job, they may need compensation to recover, or they may need to report an area of the workplace that needs to have safety checks immediately before someone else gets hurt. Any employer who tries to discourage reporting workplace injuries not only shows disregard for their own employees but also for their own business.", "I see that Bill 109 also increases penalties against employers who try to break their obligation to keep employees safe and to ensure that they have adequate compensation if they are injured. I’m happy to see that these penalties are being increased. Last year, there were more than 230,000 claims filed with the WSIB. We need to do everything we can to ensure that those people are getting the support they need.", "The sad reality of this province is that there are a lot of people living from paycheque to paycheque—far too many people, in fact. In a province as rich as Ontario, this should never happen, but unfortunately it does.", "Too many families are struggling to make ends meet. It breaks my heart, but I even see it in my riding: good, hard-working people who just want a chance to put in an honest day’s work and yet can’t find a place to do it. So when they do get a job, they’re worried about reporting a workplace safety violation because they’re worried about losing their jobs.", "When workers don’t have proper protection in the workplace, these kinds of things happen. It’s not hard to imagine. Picture a young person, maybe 20 years old, working their first full-time job. It’s easy to see how someone like that might be convinced not to report an accident. As a province, we need to do everything we can in our power to ensure those situations never happen. No one should wake up in the morning and worry about whether or not they’re ever going to see their family again.", "I believe this section of Bill 109 moves towards addressing that, but the NDP has offered many other positive ideas for workplace safety that need to be implemented. These are the steps the government must take to protect the working people who drive our economy.", "Mr. Speaker, I’d like to turn my attention to where I see the problems in this bill, particularly section 2. Section 2 talks about collective bargaining rights when two unionized workplaces merge. Right now, when two unionized workplaces merge, the membership of the new unit holds a vote, and whichever representative wins that vote earns the right to bargain on behalf of the employees. For some reason, which I hope the Liberals can explain, the Liberal government has decided to remove that right. They have decided to add another exception into when these votes happen, which will alter the way these mergers work.", "I have seen this happen in workplaces. Workplaces are changing all the time. Sometimes they are growing, but unfortunately today they are shrinking. When this happens, the representatives of the workers have to adapt, too. There are a lot of benefits that come from combining representation in two workplaces. It allows for the union to be diverse and well-represented. I’d like the Liberals to listen to this: For example, Mr. Speaker—I have to go through the Speaker—when I was president of my local union, Unifor Local 199, which I think I mentioned earlier, we represented workers who had been working in auto plants for decades but also workers in credit unions, security officers, even textbook shipping.", "At the time, the name of the union was the Canadian Auto Workers. Some people found it odd that the Auto Workers union had such a large and diverse membership. But if you get past the confusion of the name, you can see why the local’s diversity was a good thing. It meant that our union was well-rounded, that we represented people from all walks of life, not just one sector. It meant that people from all over the community came together for one purpose: securing rights in their workplace. It meant that when we went to bargain on behalf of the workers, we knew the impacts that our collective agreements would have on the entire community, not just a certain sector. Everyone who was part of the union offered a great insight that helped to make our decisions.", "What I’m getting at here is that mergers happen frequently, and typically they are for good reason. So for decades, when these mergers happened, it was simple: Let the workers decide who they want to represent them. That seems pretty simple to me, and in fact it’s something that we should all embrace; it’s actually called democracy. Let the men and women working on the floor decide who they want to speak for them instead of government. When you put it that way, I really don’t see how anyone can justify taking that away from them, yet that’s exactly what Bill 109 does.", "In a lot of cases, the larger union wins the vote because it has more resources to draw on to represent the workers. But at least—and this is what’s important to listen to, everybody in this room—the workers had a choice. It’s actually our constitutional right. You can find it in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in section 2(d), where it says everyone has the fundamental right of freedom of association. That association means the right to freely choose who you associate yourself with and who represents you. It’s a right that those in the labour movement hold very highly, especially when they feel like their rights in the workplace are under attack.", "This section of Bill 109 will fundamentally alter how that right of collective bargaining is carried out. Like I mentioned, these mergers aren’t that rare, and this is something we see impacts all of Ontario. I understand that some associations may want this to speed up the process for certifying a workplace, but it is clear there needs to be more discussion on this section.", "There needs to be more discussion about whether or not this removes a person’s right to associate, and there needs to be a discussion about how this will impact working people and their representatives. When these discussions happen, we need to have the representatives of working people present—the ones on the ground who actually deal with this.", "I’ve only got a minute left and I’m going to talk about CarePartners, but I’ll do that in my two-minute wrap-up. When you talk about labour and you want to make changes to labour to make it better for workers in the province of Ontario, there is no better example of how government should get involved than when people are on strike for six months, when a private company called CarePartners is taking on a union to break the union in a workplace in St. Catharines, when nurses are on strike for six months, when they’re getting paid $15 an hour. Guess who is replacing those workers so a private company can make money at the expense of nurses in the province of Ontario? If you’re going to be serious about labour, we have to talk about what’s going on in communities right across Ontario. No scabs should be replacing nurses in the province of Ontario and certainly not in my good friend’s riding of St. Catharines.", "I see my time is just about up. I’ll touch on that a little further in my comments. Thank you very much for giving me a chance to speak this morning." ],

Now it’s been folded in under the Ontario Labour Relations Act. That means that firefighters will now also have all the protections under the Ontario Labour Relations Act, which is something that they’ve asked for.", "One of the main benefits of this is, hopefully, that the cumbersome and very awkward arbitration process is going to be expedited, because it can drag on for months and years. This is one of the advantages of doing this.", "Also, in terms of this legislation, there is another important part of the legislation. There is the fair practices commission that’s going to be instituted, which gets rid of all the unnecessary delays in resolving workplace disputes between the employer and employee.", "This act is a step forward.

We’re hearing a lot more reports about assaults in hospitals and nursing homes and things like that. Everybody deserves to work in a safe work environment: safety in terms of physical trauma, but also safety in terms of emotional stresses.", "I think that we have to come up with a better plan. It’s not enough just to recognize the dangers. This is a good start, Bill 109, to address a lot of the problems, but we also need to address the fact that some jobs are so physically and emotionally demanding that, really, we have to have people who can kind of take a break the way university professors take a break—every seven years, they have a year of sabbatical where they do research or concentrate on something else.", "I’m sure it wasn’t meant to be a break from the classroom; it was meant to be a time to focus on the research. But a lot of the professors that I know say, “You know what? I look forward to that break every seven years. It keeps me, in some ways, mentally strong. It makes me a better professor because, in some ways, I miss it when I have that year off.” I think that that’s maybe something that we have to do.", "We have to recognize that we need to keep our first responders emotionally strong and that, perhaps, they have to have a certain time of the year—I’m not saying every seven years; maybe one month of the year—where they’re doing something else: they’re going into classrooms, speaking to students, and it’s not one person’s job that they have for their whole life and somebody else’s job to actually go into burning buildings or get people out of difficult car accidents, which we’ve heard of a lot lately, especially near my riding of Thornhill, just north. We’ve had some horrific car accidents.", "So I think we can all appreciate what our first responders have to go through and that there’s a lot more we can do to support them." ],

They don’t want to get caught in the weeds on this bill, and there are some weeds in this bill that we have to make sure don’t put them in that thing.", "So let’s be clear: The full-time firefighters, the volunteer firefighters, our first responders, agree with what you are doing in this bill. We agree with what you’re doing. The Conservatives agree with what you’re doing. We agree that WSIB has to be taken care of. I know because of my workplace, what I’ve done over a number of years, that a lot of workers would go to a worker when he got hurt on the job and say, “Hey, you know, we’re going to lose the $50 bonus we get every month if you report the injury. Why don’t you just get a paper, go sit in the office and don’t report the injury.” We know that goes on. And it goes on with big employers. Surprisingly, yesterday, my colleague from Welland said that it happened in the NHS, and it went on for years and years. So we understand that the WSIB has to be taken care of.", "What we don’t understand is why you’re attacking the fundamental right of workers to decide who they want to represent them as a union. Why are you pitting the firefighters against unions across the province of Ontario? I say to the unions out there that want this bill that I’ve always felt the worker should have the choice. If they don’t want Unifor to represent them, or if they don’t want Wayne Gates to be their president, they have a mechanism in place to choose. They have the right to choose. What I’ve always said to unions is that if you service your employees and the membership that you represent, you never have to worry about that happening. They will never leave you because they’re being serviced. So why are we doing this at the expense of the firefighters? Why are we doing this at the expense of WSIB?", "So I’m asking the Liberal government to, please, pull that part of the bill out. Let workers choose who they want to represent them.

I think one of the hardest duties we had—I know the member for Welland is smiling at me because I think she knows what I’m about to say. All of us go to funerals for firefighters, and we see the children. Mr. Speaker, it has always been, for me, particularly sad when you see the family of firefighters who have spent their whole life protecting other families so that moms and dads and children can grow old together. I think one of the hardest things I ever did when I was a mayor was having to spend time—it was a bittersweet thing—with moms, often, and sometimes dads, and children whose fathers were taken at far too young an age by a whole raft of horrible diseases. I always made a point of going to those funerals, but more importantly, following up with the families after. I don’t think anyone who has ever been in local politics, who has seen the sheer numbers of Canadians who have been firefighters who have died with these diseases—removing a lot of the obstacles that we’re removing today is just basic respect for them and their families.", "So I’m very proud of this legislation, Mr. Speaker, and obviously a little emotional. But it’s also just a moment to remind us of the importance of labour. I remember my grandfather worked at the Angus yards in Montreal. He had a stroke. He had nine children; two of them died in childbirth because of our health care system. We didn’t have medicare back then. I remember my grandmother, this incredible Ukrainian woman, who spoke hardly a word of English, raising seven kids with a husband at home who had had a stroke and who could not work. She got involved with the union to get that works yard unionized. It was only after the Angus yards were unionized that they got pensions. Her daughter, my great aunt, my Aunt Ann, was married to a mine worker, a miner in Sudbury. She was one of those union maids, brave women who took Inco all the way to the Supreme Court to win widows’ pensions and protect the hard-working women whose husbands all died of respiratory illnesses. My uncles in Sudbury, all three of them, died in their fifties, at very young ages, because of the air quality issues that they had that today we would think of as outrageous, but at that time—", "Interjection." ],

The federal health minister, who was Conservative, said AIDS was a moral issue, not a health issue. I spent more time raising money to provide basic clinical support—we went to our provincial NDP government to get a billing number for our nurses and doctors, and they wouldn’t give us one. So we had no federal money, we couldn’t get a billing number, and our docs and our nurses worked for free with young men dying of AIDS at a time when we didn’t know how that virus was transmitted. It was almost all volunteer-given health care. People would throw up and bleed on you, and many mainstream health care institutions were afraid to treat people in those early days of the epidemic.", "Then I joined CUPE, and I organized my workshop through CUPE. It was only after the labour movement and the Winnipeg Labour Council got on our side that we finally got financial support. All of that came from unions, including the firefighters, who understood public service.", "There’s a lot of detail in this bill that my colleagues, I’m sure, will speak about. I’m very proud to be part of a government—and I know we’re not the only people in this House; I agree with what the member from Niagara Falls said. But we should not get so picky about this. My own view is that firefighters deserve our respect and our support, and they’re getting that today, but so do all kinds of other workers in precarious and vulnerable situations out there who don’t have the rights of firefighters. So I hope that all of us who stand in this House who have been active in labour and come from labour families, who know that the laws we have weren’t created so much by Legislatures but were often hard fought in courts and by union activism, will see this as a beginning for a much more activist agenda around labour, which I’m very committed to.", "I think that beyond partisan politics, Mr. Speaker, we have a lot more work to do, because there are a lot of people out there who would love to have some of these rights and who don’t yet have them. There’s a bigger conversation to be had. Labour has been in decline in membership, and that concerns me as someone who knows that my rights—and my family is in this country and healthy because of labour unions." ],

It’s always a pleasure to follow the member for Toronto Centre, who brings that emotional piece to our debate so often, reminding us how important it is, the work we are doing; how important it is, putting a face to what is in black and white in statute changes, a face to the fundamental impacts that we will be having on people’s lives.", "The member from Niagara Falls spoke at length about the firefighter piece. We are delighted to hear that we’re getting the firefighter piece very much right, according to him and his analysis. Particularly, what we’re doing with this piece of legislation is that we’re streamlining the procedures for what firefighters currently do in their own labour relations environment with the Ontario Labour Relations Act.", "This is a very particular personal moment for me because my stepson, Devon Kerr, my partner Lisa Martin’s son, has recently qualified to be a firefighter and has taken his first position up in Bala, Ontario, as a part-time firefighter and is looking forward to a very long career in this field. I know the kinds of protections that we’re bringing in will be of benefit to him. He is, of course, following in his father’s footsteps, who was a captain in Toronto Fire Services, and we wish them both extremely well in their continuing work—those brave men and women who do front-line emergency service for us every year.", "As many of you will recall, I have a master’s background in labour management relations. I taught at Seneca for a number of years and I consulted in the field. It’s an old adage in labour relations that when you bring amendments forward, you want to make everybody unhappy, the reason being that you don’t want to be overbalancing in favour of one party or the other. So you inevitably, in most labour relations situations, make all parties a little unhappy. If one party is too happy, maybe the balance has gone too far the other way. I believe that this legislation is striking the appropriate balance.", "I know that the member for Niagara Falls was a trade union representative. I was typically on the other side of the fence as a management representative in some of the work I did as a consultant. It was always the experience that in previous administrations, we used to call the minister not the Minister of Labour but the minister for labour because maybe the balance was going the wrong way. I’m pleased to see that our ministry and our government are getting the balance right here.", "I used to teach at Seneca about how important this balance is. I would teach, in the general labour relations field, about how important it is to get proper procedures in place for unfair labour practices and to have expedited arbitration processes and that we have the proper union security and the duty of fair representation that’s contained in the act so that for the employer, the trade union and the employees it strikes the right balance so we have expedited processes and we’re not tied up in court processes. I would teach this from the perspective of general labour relations. I wouldn’t get into the weeds on the Fire Protection and Prevention Act; that wasn’t part of our program.", "Now what we’re seeing is that those pieces that were missing in the original draft of the Fire Protection and Prevention Act are now coming in under the Labour Relations Act, where we have, since the mid-1940s—postwar—first initiated this type of legislation for collective bargaining, which constitutionally recognizes the right of employees to come together, to unionize, to be certified, and to collectively represent themselves in their discussions with employers. So this is really important.", "What we’re also seeing in this piece of legislation is giving the power to arbitrators to enforce a written grievance settlement—it brings those powers forward—or for an arbitration decision from either party to be able to take to the Superior Court of Justice so it can be enforced as an order under the court. Likewise, the Ontario Labour Relations Board will have an opportunity, where necessary, to grant interim orders against parties, which will provide more stability and streamline labour relations processes.", "I wanted to speak specifically to that aspect of the bill because I do think we’re getting the balance right. But we will be taking a look more closely at some of the issues that were raised by the member for Niagara Falls. I recognize him and respect him as an expert from that point of view. I look forward very much to delving more into those details as we go forward with the debate of this bill." ],

As I’ve been sitting here listening to the hours of debate that relate to this bill, we’ve talked about some of the amendments. Some people were talking about the amendments on claims suppression. I think, Mr. Speaker, it is important to put on record that not reporting a workplace accident is a violation of the WSIA. The WSIB uses a zero-tolerance strategy to try and stop claims suppression.", "I know that our government’s proposed change aims to strengthen the WSIB’s efforts by legislating stronger deterrents against employers engaged in any activities to suppress or impede the reporting of a work-related injury or illness to the WSIB by a worker. I think I heard earlier my honourable colleague from the third party talking about schemes that are happening in some workplaces in relation to trying to get a worker not to report an injury or not reporting an illness. I think it’s important that it be recognized that that shouldn’t be happening. We need to ensure that the WSIB has stronger legislation to be able to try and stop these claim suppressions.", "I think, if we’re looking at claim suppressions, it can include a range of activities, from an informal agreement between the employer and the worker for paid leave as an inducement for not reporting, to more aggressive approaches such as threatening dismissal or other employment-related penalties upon the worker. Our proposal would add a specific prohibition in the WSI Act against employers engaging. No employer should engage in any activity with the intent to impede a worker from reporting a claim with the WSIB or induce them to withdraw a claim that has already been filed.", "If any employer does engage in these activities, they will be subject to administrative penalties and/or prosecution. I think that’s an important aspect to ensure that we get on the record today, to talk about some of the benefits and some of the proposals that are coming out in this bill.", "Also, I know the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change spoke about firefighters who he has dealt with, both as a recovering mayor, as he said, and again as an MPP and a minister. My colleague from Beaches–East York and colleagues from the opposition have spoken about this as well.", "If you’ll bear with me, Mr. Speaker, I had a great opportunity a few years back. I know my colleague from Nickel Belt attended this as well. It was called Firefighters 101, where SPFFA Local 527 in Greater Sudbury put together an opportunity for community leaders to learn a little bit about their job. They geared us all up and we went through many exercises—many difficult exercises—to learn what their job is like.", "Even though I knew I was in a safe environment, when they brought us into this firehouse where flames were rolling over the top of the roof—you know you’re in a secure environment, but it’s still very intimidating and scary. Imagine not being able to see your hand in front of your own face. It’s one of those things where you’re really grateful for the work that our firefighters do each and every day, because when we’re running out, they’re running in. We need to do everything we can to acknowledge that and thank them for that.", "For the last seven years, I’ve been holding a barbecue in my riding to say thank you to all our emergency services workers: police, fire and paramedics. For firefighters specifically, it’s one of those where, with these changes that we’re putting in place, I think it’s important for us to make sure that we get it right for our firefighters and to make sure that, as we say, we provide them with the tools to resolve disputes in the fire sector, because they’ve got the tools to keep us safe.", "With that, we say thank you to them, and I’d like to thank you, Mr. Speaker, for being able to stand today and be part of this presentation." ],

It’s bringing together three acts, as has already been discussed.", "I would also like to commend the member from Nickel Belt for her comments talking about the survivor benefits. This is one area that is of great concern to me as well: the issue with how the WSIB calculates survivor benefits for a worker who dies of an occupational disease and who had no or low earnings on the date of the diagnosis because they were retired. This situation can arise because of the long latency period before the onset of many work-related diseases such as cancer. The Minister of the Environment and Climate Change has also very eloquently spoken to that as well, so I thank him for his comments.", "One of the reasons why that particular piece of the legislation is very important to me is because I’ve worked in a constituency office; I have seen individuals who have gone through this process and who don’t have enough protection built into legislation, so I’m very pleased that we are bringing this forward. I’m also very impressed by the Minister of Labour. He has visited Kingston and the Islands, and we have had some discussions with the paramedics. We’ve discussed a number of issues with them.", "Just to go back to the survivor benefits section of this bill: Right now, in situations where a worker dies of an occupational disease and has no or low earnings at the time of their diagnosis because they were retired, the WSIB’s operational practice is to calculate survivor benefits based on whichever is greater, the average amount of annual earnings of a worker engaged in the same trade in which the worker’s disease was contracted, or the worker’s annual earnings in the 12 months prior to the date of diagnosis, rather than the statutory minimum provided under the WSIA. Now, I know that that’s not always appropriate. I think that it’s extremely important that this proposed amendment will allow them to continue their practice, which has been challenged on appeal.", "I’m pleased that the Minister of Labour has brought forward this very comprehensive bill.

First, the Minister of the Environment, the member from Toronto Centre, talked about being supportive of firefighters and supportive of labour. I believe he is being genuine in his remarks. However, he also talked about the importance of unions, addressing issues like precarious labour and low-paid jobs and their long history in this province and across this country of being advocates in all kinds of policy improvements in government. But at the same time, this government is interfering with the basic rights of workers in this same bill. He didn’t address that, that in fact they want to take away the right to choose which union would represent you at the end of the day. If you supported labour, you wouldn’t be doing that. You wouldn’t be pitting firefighters against every other public sector union and some private sector unions here in the province of Ontario.", "The other thing is that the member from Beaches–East York talked about his labour management training and consulting, and that the balance is to make everybody unhappy at the end of the day, to kind of keep everybody off balance. I don’t know; in my 40 years of negotiating, we tried to get win-wins, so that everybody was happy, not lose-lose. So I don’t think I’d be hiring him as a consultant.", "My third point—I’m glad the Minister of Health is here, because you know what? If this government really cared about workers, we would not have nurses from CarePartners on strike for eight months. The government would be intervening and making sure that for-profit companies that are hired by this government through the LHIN to look after patients in this province were actually back working and not on a picket line in this province of Ontario. That’s what you should be doing for the workers." ],

In return, it is up to us to ensure that they, too, are protected. Firefighters deserve and should have the rights and protections afforded by the Labour Relations Act.", "Mr. Speaker, I want to tell you that before I came to this House and before I started working with government, I was a journalist. As a beat reporter, that meant, on occasion, going out to fires, going out to accidents on highways and going out to crime scenes before anybody else really arrived. A lot of times we were there just with the first responders.", "I have seen first-hand the work, the hard, tough, courageous work that our firefighters do. I have seen them go in and out of buildings, coming back, making sure that they’re being cooled down, making sure that they’re getting on respirators to help them breathe, putting their suits back on again and going back in. I’ve seen this in warm weather, and I have seen it in minus-40-degree weather. I’ve been out there watching and having nothing but praise and confidence in these people who put their lives on the line for all of us to help keep us safe and secure in our homes, buildings and places of work.", "So I have the utmost respect for our firefighters and for the people Bill 109 would be trying to safeguard. It is trying to bring greater safeguards to all workers in the province through making changes to the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act doing four main things: ensuring that workers know that it is their right to file a WSIB claim and that it is their right to be protected. Secondly, we must do all that we can to make sure that these workers are protected by proposing an increase in maximum corporate penalties for conviction of an offence under WSIA. We also have to provide greater fairness for survivors in cases of work-related deaths.", "Those are just some of the things.

At some point, the government, most likely, based on what they’re doing on a number of other important pieces of legislation, will stand up and start saying, “X number of members have spoken to this bill.” They actually have four members speaking to this bill in one 20-minute slot in order to inflate that number and suggest that everybody has had a chance to speak.", "The fact is, there will be, I expect, a significant number of opposition members who will want to speak to this bill. I would urge the minister responsible, the Minister of Labour, to use his influence to encourage the government House leader to allow the opposition members to do their job.

It encompasses three areas that, while they each have to do with labour, are completely different in their response to a particular issue in areas of labour. When you put together three areas, as this piece of legislation does, you get the same problem: that there’s a poison pill or there is something there that you are fully supportive of but something that you’re equally concerned about. This has nothing to do with which government—governments of all stripes in the last few decades have tended to do this. But what effect it has, then, is to cast everything with the same brush, because at the end of the day, it’s only one vote. You are either for it or against it.", "I see this as a problem that is obviously to the benefit of the executive area of government, because they can move this piece of legislation and its various parts along and it makes it easier for them, but it diminishes the job of the legislator, and that is the fact that they are faced with the same dilemma in terms of their response to three separate issues that have been put together. I say this in the spirit of, as I said, governments of all stripes, but as members of the Legislature, we should remember that we owe a duty to our constituents in being able to discuss these issues.", "The areas are quite different. I certainly want to comment on the first segment of the bill, which deals with changes to the firefighters. I have stood alongside those members of the House—again, in all parties—who have recognized the value of and the past injustices to the double-hatter. Representing a constituency which I think still relies, in all cases—there’s a volunteer component to each of the firefighting stations in my riding, in my communities. It has always been an issue that I’ve felt very strongly about, that when someone is prepared to offer their volunteer professional time, the communities are the beneficiaries.", "I’ve spoken at firefighters’ appreciation evenings where I’ve been able to remind the public of the kind of training—and the hours and hours of upgrading of training—that volunteer firefighters must perform before they get on a truck. I think it’s really important that the legislation, as we see here today, recognizes the legitimacy and puts that problem, that issue, behind us. I think that that’s particularly valuable.", "However, the part of the bill that I think requires greater attention is the third part, on the WSIB. The WSIB, in the time that I’ve been in this Legislature, sort of comes and goes in terms of issues of legislation, directives or changes in policy.", "I think that there are a few principles that one has to keep in mind when you’re looking at issues around the WSIB. Obviously, it has to be just. I look at some of the members of my community who, frankly, have suffered a great deal through injury at work, through no fault of their own. In establishing those principles, obviously you want something that is fair and just for people who have received, in some cases, lifelong encumbrances and problems with the accidents that they’ve had. So, justice and balance.", "The attitude of most employers is obviously that it’s good business to have a safe place, and they work very hard at providing opportunities for training and things like that, to make sure that there is that balance on the employer side. The other area, of course, is the cost of what is being provided.", "The final point is that it has to be evidence-based. I found, when I started looking at this part of the bill, that there was an issue that seemed to be one of long standing, and that was the one of claim suppression. I know that others have spoken about it in their comments, but this is something that strikes me as very difficult, because of the fact that you have to prove that something happened. You also have to prove some kind of intent.", "There has been quite a lot of work done over the years on this issue of claim suppression. Obviously, no one with any sense of fairness wants to witness this or be involved in it; that’s not the issue. The issue is providing the research on this particular issue, so I did a bit of looking around and found that this isn’t the first time claim suppression has shown up as something of interest in legislation. There have been a number of studies that have been done to try to come to some understanding and agreement on this.", "You can’t base laws on anecdotal information. In June 2005, the report of the Institute of Work and Health, Assessing the Effects of Experience Rating in Ontario, came up with a couple of comments. The study found that “the large majority of employees stated that they are being encouraged to report accidents and incidents and are being offered suitable modified and early return to work if injured.”", "The 2005 report also found, “Our research indicates that experience rating encourages prevention and contributes to positive workplace health and safety practices.” So there are some studies, then, going back 10 years, that have looked at this kind of thing.", "In more recent times, the WSIB commissioned a Prism economic analysis and looked at some of the information there. The Prism report defines claim suppression: “For the purpose of this research, ‘claim suppression’ means actions taken by an employer to induce a worker not to report an injury or illness or alternatively to under-report the severity of an injury or illness or the amount of lost time attributable to that injury or illness. The inducement may be coercive, i.e., the inducement may involve an actual or perceived threat of sanctions. Alternatively the inducement may be accommodating, i.e., the employer may offer the worker benefits in lieu of workers’ compensation, if full WSIB benefits, especially lost time benefits, are not claimed.”", "Mr. Speaker, I believe I have the opportunity to pick up later, and I’d like to stay at this particular part of my presentation, if I might." ],

Before long, the whole community and the world took notice. Evan’s family set up a page to raise funds, called One Last Christmas. It had a target of $1,500. They raised more than $44,000. Two months before Christmas, hundreds of homes were fully decorated in the little town of St. George. Shopkeepers and residents began stringing lights, wrapping presents and unrolling fake snow on Evan’s lawn. Carollers started going door to door.", "On Friday, Evan was made an honorary officer by the Brantford police, complete with a badge and uniform. Evan had always wanted to be a police officer.", "On Saturday, about 7,000 people joined the celebrations. That’s more than double the town’s population. More than 25 floats made their way along Evan’s street, and the thousands on hand cheered and waved as he rode by on Santa’s sleigh. Batman, the Grinch and Evan’s favourite character, SpongeBob, also showed up to wish him a merry Christmas.", "Speaker, the outpouring of love and support for Evan and his family by the people of St. George represents the best of Ontario and the best of humanity.

  "text" : [ "Mr. Speaker, as you are aware, investors take incredible risks to invest their hard-earned money in shares of public and private corporations. Shareholders are the real owners of these companies. Their share ownership in these companies provides them with one key, fundamental right, and that is to elect directors to provide leadership to the companies on their behalf.", "However, Mr. Speaker, the current provisions of the Ontario Business Corporations Act are not very clear and/or are being misused as far as the nomination process and voting for the election of directors are concerned. As a result, the shareholders end up compromising the very basic and fundamental right and ability to elect directors. We need a major overhaul of our current and outdated system and relevant rules and regulations.", "Mr. Speaker, let me quote from the editorial of the July 16 edition of the Globe and Mail this year:", "“When we think of elections where voters have no choice and the winners are predetermined, we think of repressive dictatorship and not modern democratic Canada.", "“Yet directors of Canadian companies come to office after ‘elections’ that take place under rules designed to fix the results. Shareholders are given the choice to either vote in favour of candidates put forward by the company—a roster that exactly matches the number of available seats—or to ‘withhold’ their votes. There is no way to vote against a director. At the extreme, it means a director can be elected if only one shareholder—say, the director himself—votes in favour, even if everyone else withholds their votes. So much for shareholder democracy.", "“This voting process is not the product of some nefarious corporate manipulation. It is the system laid out in Canada’s federal and provincial business statutes. They are in sore need of a major overhaul.”", "Mr. Speaker, it is clear from the editorial, as well as from our own research, that there are two fundamental issues: Number one is why shareholders have no role in nominating directors, and number two is why shareholders are not given the opportunity to vote against the directors being nominated. Let me discuss each of these issues.", "Normally, the governance committee or nomination committee of the board is assigned the task of selecting candidates to be nominated at the annual general meeting of the shareholders. Shareholders are normally not represented on these committees and, as a result, have no input in nominating director candidates. The nominating committee usually recommends candidates who are either known to directors or to senior management.", "Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, under the current rules, the chair of the board normally chairs the meeting of the shareholders. This poses a significant problem when the shareholders try to propose a nominee for the director’s position or try to add a new item for consideration at the meeting. These items are generally overruled, based on technicalities, by the chair. This makes it hard for shareholders to raise their issues and concerns at their own meetings.", "Mr. Speaker, as you can see, currently the shareholders normally can only vote for directors who are being nominated by the nomination committee. It is extremely difficult, if not impossible, for the shareholders to make meaningful input to this process.", "This gets even worse. Under the current system, the shareholders are asked to vote either in favour or to withhold votes when voting on electing directors. Withholding votes are not considered votes against any particular director nominee. As a result, even when the majority of the votes being withheld are far greater than the votes cast in favour of any particular director nominee, the nominee still gets elected. In essence, the director nominee can just get elected with one vote, even if all the other shareholders withheld votes for that director.", "Mr. Speaker, let me just give you an example. Can you imagine a process where, during our provincial election, each of us gives our constituents the option that they can either vote for you or they can withhold their vote, but they have no choice given to them to vote against you? This will mean that everyone in this House will get elected every time, as long as we choose to serve. This is exactly the current situation with the election of directors in corporations.", "To counter this measure, some corporations have adopted a majority voting policy. What this really means is, that if the votes withheld for a director nominee are more than in favour of the director, the director is expected to resign. Again, the decision to accept or reject the resignation is made by the same board who recommends the director nominee in the first place. Normally, these resignations are rejected, again overriding the will of the shareholders.", "This definitely raises the question: What recourse is available to the shareholders under the current legislation, if they’re unhappy with the election, selection and/or leadership direction of the directors? This leaves the shareholder with only one option; that is, to call a special meeting of the shareholders, if they’re unhappy with the current directors. However, the threshold for calling this special meeting is currently set at 5% in the legislation, which is not normally easy to achieve in a public company.", "In addition, the current legislation also requires that the shareholder must be a registered shareholder with the corporation to be eligible to call the special meeting of the shareholders. In this day and age, when the majority of the shares are either bought through brokers or purchased online, the shares often are not registered in the name of a beneficial shareholder. This creates a serious problem and a key hindrance to calling a special meeting of the shareholders, as the shareholders’ meeting can only be requisitioned by registered shareholders.", "The amendments being proposed in this legislation will lower the current ownership threshold required, from 5% to 2%, to call a special meeting of the shareholders. This amendment will definitely provide shareholders the ability to nominate directors of their choice, rather than just accept the nominees being proposed by the directors or the corporation. The amendment will further provide greater certainty that the shareholders can nominate director nominees at the shareholders’ meeting.", "Mr. Speaker, the other amendment being proposed in this legislation will allow shareholders to elect their own chair to preside over the shareholders’ meeting. This will assist the shareholders to speak freely and raise their concerns, as well as provide needed input.", "The amendments being proposed to section 97 will ensure that the directors can only be elected if they receive a plurality of the votes cast in their favour and not just by one vote. This amendment will go a long way to respect the wishes of the shareholders.", "The proposed amendment to section 105(1) takes into account the current shares-trading practices in the industry. It will provide beneficial owners the same rights as registered owners of the shares.", "The proposed amendment to section 110 is really important, as it provides clear direction as to whether the shareholder is voting in favour or against a director nominee. The current practice of withholding votes is very confusing and serves no real purpose to express the wishes of the shareholders. The shareholders need to send a clear message by clearly indicating if they are voting for or against a director nominee.", "Mr. Speaker, the same editorial from the Globe and Mail further states that Canada’s largest shareholder coalition, the Canadian Coalition for Good Governance—normally called CCGG—has lobbied hard for voting reform, arguing Canada and the United States are outliers in a world where most major countries have allowed shareholders to vote against directors.", "This editorial further states: “The CCGG are urging regulators to consider additional changes that will allow large shareholders to propose nominees whose names would be added to the proxy ballot. The question today is not whether majority voting should be legislated—it should be—but why governments aren’t going further to strengthen shareholder democracy, and give shareholders a real vote on their board of representatives.” This says it all.", "As I said at the very outset, the shareholders are the owners of the companies in which they invest. The amendments being proposed in this legislation, if passed, will enhance shareholders’ fundamental rights.", "I want to touch on another issue. The other issue that has recently received major attention is the ability of the directors to approve unreasonable compensation packages for the senior management and directors at the expense of the shareholders. Recently, this issue has made headlines in Canadian newspapers when the CEOs have been paid huge bonuses even though the company and/or the industry was not doing well. This forced the directors to retract the approved bonuses.", "The proposed amendment to section 137 would require remuneration of the directors and officers of the corporation to be in accordance with the executive compensation policy approved by the shareholders.", "The proposed amendment to section 169.1 would allow a registered holder of shares or beneficial owners of shares who are entitled to vote to make proposals to adopt, amend or repeal an executive compensation policy. The amendment proposed will help increase the accountability, transparency and performance linkage of executive pay. This proposed change will put pressure on the boards to follow compensation policies and the better alignment of pay to company performance.", "In February 2015, the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services invited a volunteer panel of experts in corporate and commercial law to develop recommendations and reform priorities to over 20 pieces of legislation. The recommendations made by this panel included reviewing and updating the Business Corporations Act. Some of the proposed recommendations by the panel are in line with amendments being proposed in this legislation today, such as allowing shareholders to effectively determine the composition of the board of directors by eliminating certain legislative requirements, and determining how best to make available to the ultimate investors in shares of a corporation the rights and remedies available to the registered holders of these shares.", "To conclude, the proposed legislation would help create a meaningful process for receiving shareholders’ input on a regular basis regarding the nomination process, the election of directors, executive compensation, as well as making the proxy method far more transparent to enable shareholders to express their wishes and desires. These measures will assist in making boards more accountable and ultimately strengthen shareholder democracy.", "Mr. Speaker, as always, I’m open to any and all constructive suggestions from my colleagues to make this bill more effective and ensure that companies are well managed and accountable to their shareholders." ],

The directors of the companies very much operate according to whatever rules of governance are in place and have to follow their own constitution and do things properly.", "There is always room for improvement, so I’m happy to hear any specific suggestions of where improvements can be found.

First of all, I’d like to thank the Speaker for allowing me to speak.", "The bill we have before us today, the Business Corporations Amendment Act, follows the same path that too many other bills from across the aisle have been following lately. The intent of the bill is good; namely, increasing shareholder participation in board decisions. However, in dealing with this very complex issue, which absolutely—absolutely—deserves our attention, this bill is too simplistic and falls short of achieving its intent.", "I certainly agree that we need to be increasing shareholder participation and ensuring that corporate boards are accountable to their shareholders. If someone is willing to invest their money in a company, then they should have a say in how that company is run and how decisions are made.", "As it stands right now, there are numerous problems with the system that is currently in place. For example, in the current system most shareholder meetings use a single voting system. This single voting system means that each shareholder with voting rights either votes for something or withholds their vote. The result of this is that in the case of a director election—now, listen to this; I think it’s important for all the Liberals to understand this and my Conservative colleagues over here as well—one vote cast for the director would be enough to elect that individual. How many in this room would like to get elected with one vote?", "Clearly, this is not an ideal situation, and the Canadian Coalition for Good Governance, which my colleague across spoke about—the voice of shareholders in Canada—has called for a majority voting system to be put in place. Similarly, a report commissioned by the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services, titled Business Law Agenda: Priority Findings and Recommendations Report, also recommended that a majority voting system be used, which probably makes a lot of sense to all of us, although I’m not sure the Liberals got—I’ll just leave it at that.", "Unfortunately, this is one of the areas where Bill 128 falls short of achieving its goal. Bill 128 falls short in this area because it uses contradictory language when it comes to whether or not a majority voting system should be used. For example, when electing a director to a board, the bill says that majority voting should be used for proxies voting on behalf of shareholders, but for shareholders who are present, the single voting system continues to be in force. How does that make any sense? Why should a shareholder who appoints a proxy be treated differently than one who is able to attend the meeting on his own?", "I know that some of this stuff is a little complicated. That’s why I’m doing it slowly. What if the shareholder had to appoint a proxy because they are physically unable to attend the meeting? Would this bill then be discriminating against that individual because of their condition?" ],

One of those other issues that I would like to address today is some of the concessions being made to shareholders unnecessarily. Again, I absolutely believe that it is important for us to ensure that shareholders are engaged in the practices of the board. However, in an attempt to engage shareholders, Bill 128 creates a much more difficult and lengthy process for boards.", "For example: By extending the number of shareholders who are able to call a meeting, the bill creates a situation where meetings can be called, at a cost to the board, by only a very small percentage of shareholders. Again—and this is important to listen to—the Canadian Coalition for Good Governance recommends that the share percentage cut-off for calling a meeting remain at 5% for public companies with a market value of less than $1 billion. In the case of larger companies, the Coalition recommends that a 3% threshold be used, to align with US companies.", "Mr. Speaker, it surprises me that this government would go out of its way to create a more difficult process for boards than the one that currently exists in the United States. Given how often we hear that raising corporate taxes would hurt our competitiveness and how we need to compete with our neighbours to the south, you would think that we would want to make the process less difficult, rather than more. I think you would agree with that, Mr. Speaker.", "Bill 128, the Business Corporations Amendment Act, covers an important topic and has good intentions. But maybe what they are doing here is a shift for the party opposite. Maybe this shows that they now understand that raising corporate taxes to pay for infrastructure rather than selling off a public asset is the way to go. Maybe, but, Mr. Speaker, I doubt it.", "By helping boards, we will ensure more realistic compensation packages, more diversity on corporate boards and more accountability to shareholders. Unfortunately—to the member across—this bill falls short in meeting those intentions because of its contradictory language, its simplistic solutions to complex issues and problems, and its unnecessary measures that no one here seems to be asking for." ],

Our government is committed to growing the economy and helping to create good jobs now and into the future. In order to meet our commitments, we must support business and ensure Ontario has modern laws that facilitate an efficient market and a prosperous business climate.", "The governing legislation for Ontario business corporations is the Ontario Business Corporations Act. It provides, among other things, incorporation, director and officer responsibilities, shareholder rights, offences and penalties. As with all government legislation, this act should be reviewed and updated when necessary to ensure that it continues to meet the needs of business. That is what my colleague the member from Mississauga–Erindale is proposing with Bill 128.", "The first issue I will address is shareholders’ involvement in the nomination process of the board of directors. Currently, shareholders have the choice to either vote in favour of the candidates put forward by the company or to withhold their vote, which means they are not counted in the vote tally. The results of this are that a director can be elected to the board even if a majority of shareholders withhold their votes. Advocates of business investors have long been asking for legal changes which would allow shareholders to vote against candidates for seats on the board of directors or otherwise making voting truly democratic.", "Current best practices in Canada suggest that nominees for a board of directors should be chosen by an independent nominating committee of the board. The nominee slate, however, often tends to reflect the board’s or, in some instances, the CEO’s network of relationships and prospects. Even when prospective candidates are found through the services of an independent search firm, the parameters of the search firm’s mandate, as well as the production of their list of recommendations, can be determined by the members of the nominating committee or the CEO.", "Earlier this year, the Minister of Government and Consumer Services, David Orazietti, announced that a government-appointed panel of legal experts had tabled a series of reform proposals to modernize Ontario’s business legislation. One of these proposals was to allow shareholders to vote no in the election of directors, to make it easier for investors to reject unwanted members of the board. The committee’s recommendations have been available for public comment until earlier this month. Now the ministry will review the issues and decide how to proceed with legislative reforms.", "Shareholders should have the ability to effectively choose their boards and be entitled to vote against candidates for election to the board. In fact, in October 2014, a discussion paper by the UN, Principles for Responsible Investment, notes that a stronger nomination process is fundamental to board effectiveness and shareholders should have an active role in the process. In addition to encouraging boards to engage with their shareholders in regard to the composition of the board, it’s the belief that large shareholders should be allowed to propose nominees whose names would be added to the ballot, thereby eliminating a closed slate of directors suggested by the company and allowing a greater choice.", "Another change which Bill 128 proposes is one of majority voting. As I spoke of earlier, the current practice for elections to a board of directors under the Canadian legislation is based on the plurality system rather than a majority system. Again, shareholders are allowed to vote either in favour of a nominee or to withhold their vote, which means no vote, for or against. In this system, a director can technically be elected to a board with only one vote in his or her favour. Bill 128 proposes a policy that would require directors who have been nominated for re-election to submit their resignation if they receive a majority of withheld votes, creating, in effect, an indirect form of a no vote. The board can then decide whether to accept the resignation.", "Canada has already seen how this new voting process can work. Despite the absence of legislative reform, many companies in Canada have adopted the majority voting policy on their own. Last year, the Toronto Stock Exchange adopted a rule requiring all of its listed companies to adopt a majority voting policy. This ensured that a core group of major Canadian companies are now offering their shareholders a mechanism to try to vote out unpopular or unwanted directors.", "The underlying idea behind an enhanced ability for shareholders to have a meaningful say in the nomination of the board of directors is a benefit to the corporation and a fundamental belief in shareholder democracy. A slate of nominees in a non-contested election for a board of directors, where the number of nominees equals the number of openings on the board and with all nominees having been selected by the existing board, often with input from the CEO, without equal or balanced input into the composition by voting participants, is not a true shareholder democracy. Shareholders are, in fact, the owners of the company, so why shouldn’t they have the option to remove members of the board who are ineffective?", "So far, shareholders who do have the option of majority voting have used the power sparingly. I could find only one example: a director from the Quebecor Inc. board who had lost a vote. He offered his resignation, but the board did not accept it. This highlights the weakness of the current system. The director at Quebecor has very low support from shareholders, yet remains on the board. Shareholders voted, but their votes were ignored by the board, proving the majority voting policy to be too indirect a tool.", "Only legislative reform can ensure a new voting system is preserved in law.", "The third point I’d like to discuss is in regard to shareholder involvement in directors’ and management compensation. Investors are becoming much more assertive in regard to the lack of connection between executive remuneration and company performance. The current system in Canada has been criticized for having little control over the compensation structure, with concerns raised over salaries and bonuses paid annually to executives, despite falling company performance and share prices.", "Bill 128 proposes adopting a say-on-pay policy that would provide shareholders to fully understand the organization’s philosophy and policies used in regard to its approach to executive pay decisions, and to have an advisory vote on their approach. The purpose of the say-on-pay advisory vote is to provide accountability to shareholders for the board’s compensation decisions by giving shareholders an opportunity to offer their views. Companies would include an annual advisory proposal where shareholders can vote for or against the executive compensation plan proposed by the company. The advisory vote would provide shareholders an opportunity to express their satisfaction with the board’s approach to executive compensation in the years that payments have been made, as well as over a longer period of time.", "The company’s approach to compensation should reinforce the links between compensation and its strategic objectives and risk management processes, using financial and non-financial measures of the achievement of the company’s goals over a number of years.", "While shareholders will provide their collective advisory vote, the board of directors remains fully responsible for their decisions on compensation and are not relieved of their responsibilities by a positive advisory vote from the shareholders.", "Establishing a reasonable approach to conducting say-on-pay votes and continually acting on the outcome, the say-on-pay process can offer companies a unique opportunity to better connect with their shareholders and the general investment community. Offering a practical mechanism that would make the shareholders’ right to elect directors meaningful will ultimately strengthen shareholder democracy and modernize and strengthen Ontario’s position in the global marketplace.", "I support legislation that will strengthen boards and their effectiveness and, through them, strengthen the companies that they govern, and I support the changes to business laws which will make voting truly democratic. I am pleased, therefore, to support my colleague in his attempt to amend the Business Corporations Act." ],

I’ve known him personally for some time here in the Legislature. He has obviously done his homework. This is a serious bill for our contemplation. It has in it some significant structural changes to the way that shares work, the notification of shareholders, proxy votes and the employment of directors. I commend the member for bringing forward a weighty piece of legislation.", "I know, from listening to the member’s speech, a bit about his biography, too. He has been a successful businessman, which is always good to see, because that’s a sacrifice from some of the income you can make in the private sector to serve the people in the Ontario Legislature. He knows of what he speaks because he’s also a successful investor. I think that, at the core of his remarks here, he is trying to enable ordinary shareholders to have a greater say in the way that a company is run.", "I’ll make a guess here. I, too, have some investments, but I’m going to guess that they’re not as extensive as the member’s. There was a colleague—probably one of the most loved members of the assembly in my time here: Al Palladini. God rest his soul: a great man; a strong business leader; a great Canadian immigration story as well. He served as transportation and economic development minister. He, sadly, passed away. I remember, when the member for York–Simcoe and I were in office, that tragic caucus meeting when Premier Harris announced that Al had passed away while on vacation. But I used to joke with Al, saying that his suits were worth more than my entire investments and savings that I had. He earned it the good old-fashioned way.", "I appreciate what the member is saying about proxy forms as well. I certainly get them in the mail. I’m always wondering if I just randomly cross out two directors, because I want to do that—and see what happens as a result. But as he points out, that’s not allowed. I think there has to be a better way than the current process that we have.", "I know as well that, recently, the ministry brought forward a document that looked at modernizing the Business Corporations Act of Ontario, the OBCA—the Priority Findings and Recommendations Report. It’s relatively recent, too: June 2015. I know the member has read through it. Some of his items are in this bill; some are not.", "Shortly, we’ll be addressing my private member’s bill as well on the sharing economy. Just the advent of technology and communications and democratizing decisions that we make in the marketplace or in shareholder offerings I think opens up new avenues for a lot of us as shareholders to actually participate in the governance of companies, whether it’s their pay packages—a significant part of Mr. Takhar’s bill today, how that is determined—to who sits on boards of directors.", "I want to point out that recommendation 2(a)(i) talks about contemplating electronic meetings and communications. I think it’s important to read into the record for the debate, and I know my colleague will have more to say in his wrap-up comments after we’ve all had a chance to speak on the bill. Perhaps he could comment on how he sees this moving forward as well.", "But subsection (i) says that “Information technology has become a key driver of operational efficiency and an accepted means of communications in most circumstances.” I think we would all agree with that; it’s a good thing. “The OBCA currently creates barriers to efficient communications. For example, it requires consent from directors to have that meeting held by telephone or other electronic means and requires various notices to be delivered by prepaid mail.” That certainly reflects that the OBCA is dramatically out of date and will probably sideline a significant number of retail investors who want to participate in the future governance of where their investments are. I know my colleague would probably have some more experience in this, but it seems to be sensible. We want to try to clear some of those things aside to allow more electronic communication participation, even by telephone.", "I certainly remember convening meetings of some tens of thousands of Ontarians from time to time on the telephone. I know the member for St. Catharines avidly listened to those conversations and enjoyed participating when he got those calls. Look, if we could do that as a commonplace practice in our own work in politics, surely there must be means to hear directly from shareholders through electronic means.", "Sub (iii): I know the member speaks to this in his bill as well—“Allowing shareholders to effectively determine the composition of their boards of directors by eliminating certain legislative requirements.", "“Shareholders should have the ability to effectively choose their boards.” We would agree with that. We certainly have to go through a relatively arduous process to find our place here. “For example, they should be entitled to vote against candidates for election to the board”—individual candidates, not the whole slate, Speaker. “Moreover, the OBCA should no longer limit the global reach of Ontario business through outdated concepts such as Canadian residency requirements for boards of directors. Canadian residency requirements in the OBCA drive businesses away from Ontario to incorporate in other ... jurisdictions that” don’t have these stringent requirements.", "The world’s become a smaller place with a lot of talent, and talent is mobile. I think that subsection 2(a)(iii) is a very important suggestion. Hopefully, it will be adopted. I don’t think it’s in this bill, but if it goes to committee there are opportunities to expand what my colleague is trying to do. I want to see the best talent on those boards. If they don’t live in Ontario—look, that impacts another corporation setting up shop here, so let’s get on with it." ],

  "text" : [ "I want to thank all the members who participated in the discussion. I am especially very thankful to the member from Niagara West, actually, who has made some very thoughtful comments.", "Let me address some of the issues. The member from Thornhill actually said that I used strong words. If she had listened, I really quoted words from a Globe and Mail editorial. Those were not my words; those were the words that were in the newspaper. She said I used some US examples. I’m not sure where I used a US example, because there is nothing in my notes that talks about that.", "The member from Niagara Falls made some good comments. I’m very thankful to him, but I want to tell him this: This legislation is advocating majority voting. Even for proxy holders, it is majority voting.", "This legislation applies to both public companies and private companies, so that issue is being addressed.", "I am really a little bit puzzled by these comments that we are trying to reduce the threshold, which gives, actually, the shareholders more power to influence the board of directors. So why the member from the NDP would object to that, I really don’t understand. That issue is a good issue for the shareholders to have—a low threshold so they can call a meeting of the shareholders whenever they are not satisfied with the current directors. That is their prerogative; they own the companies. If they own the companies, they should be able to call a meeting of the shareholders. If that means an expense, it’s their expense because they own the companies.", "I am very thankful to my colleague from Brampton–Springdale, who made an even better presentation than I did. She has made some very, very good comments.", "And then, again, the member Parkdale–High Park: I want to say that this legislation is actually amending the Business Corporations Act, and the Business Corporations Act applies to both public companies and private companies. I think the core issue here is what powers the shareholders should have, because they made an investment; they own the companies. What kind of powers do they need to have in order to make the directors accountable so that they can manage the companies on their behalf, the way they want it? One of the main rights that they have is actually electing directors. If they cannot influence the election of directors, if they cannot choose the directors of their own choice, then their investment in this company is being handled by people who are not aligned to their issues.", "The other issue in this legislation is about controlling the pay of the directors and the senior officers. It is important that the pay of senior officers and directors should be in accordance with the policy that is approved by the shareholders. If it is not being followed, then they should be able to have the chance to retract it and change that policy.", "So, Mr. Speaker, this legislation actually makes a lot sense and addresses a lot of the issues that even the Minister of Government and Consumer Services—the panel that he appointed has made recommendations. It also addresses the issues that have been raised by various authorities with regard to giving more power to the shareholders and enforcing their rights." ],

  "text" : [ "I’ll call it the Opportunity in the Sharing Economy Act, because the other title is a bit more than a mouthful.", "Speaker, there are two commodities in life that we don’t have nearly enough of: time and money. Through the use of modern consumer technology—the simple push on the pad on your smart phone—you could have a bit more of both. It also makes life a lot more convenient. I certainly see that in our own family, and I know that my colleague from Kitchener–Conestoga sees it with his three little ones. We certainly do with Miller and Maitland as well. We’d love to have a little bit of both of those commodities: time and a bit more money. Let me tell you why that is relevant to my bill on the sharing economy.", "Right now across Ontario, so many people are struggling just to make ends meet. The Bank of Montreal’s recent Rainy Day Survey, as they called it, looked at the status of not just Ontarians but Canadians. It found that more than half of Canadians do not even have $10,000 in savings that they could access as a rainy day fund. Say, sadly due to weather, your roof caves in, or you have a major accident, more than half would be hard pressed to find the money to address that. In fact, a quarter of Canadians are living from paycheque to paycheque with no money whatsoever being put away for savings.", "We have larger debates in this assembly about the level of taxation. We have larger debates about how we can spur the economy and create jobs in general. Here’s something we can do right away, and that is to empower people to earn a little bit more money from assets they already own—in my bill, their home, their car and their parking space.", "So the Opportunity in the Sharing Economy Act has, really, four major parts that I’ll address in the time I have, and then look forward to comments from my colleagues in all three parties about this exciting new opportunity for Ontarians, and a chance for us to lead when it comes to embracing new consumer technologies to create new jobs in our province.", "Right off the top, I want to say one particular thanks, and that is to Michael Wood. Michael Wood works for all of us as a drafter—I think he’s actually employed in the Attorney General’s office. My colleagues have probably had Michael helping write their own private members’ bills. He did an outstanding job. This bill is 42 pages long. It is relatively complex for what we often consider, and I want to send a debt of gratitude to Michael for his extraordinary work in the ambition of the bill and making it a reality by going through a series of different laws. He showed incredible patience, had very good judgment and gave me some helpful advice.", "We heard from a lot of stakeholders as well, from mayors, from industry leaders, whether the Ubers, the Airbnbs or the Rovers, to the hotel industry, to the taxi industry. I spoke with mayors and civil servants from all the major cities in the province where Uber is currently present. They said, “You know what? These technology improvements are upon us, and consumers are reacting.” Unfortunately, government is not reacting. We’re having a debate, almost a guerrilla warfare, on a municipality-by-municipality-by-municipality basis. I’ll explain why that’s harmful to the bigger picture and why we need to take action.", "I think it’s time that we had this conversation. It’s time that we had the debate. It’s time that we actually took action to empower people to make more money from things that they own, to free up consumers to improve their quality of life by having more time and more money on their hands through these innovative technologies, and to send a signal that Ontario is open for business, entrepreneurship and innovation.", "I want to, as well, in the introductory part of my comments commend the member from Kitchener–Conestoga, Michael Harris. He was a trailblazer on this. He brought forward the first motion on transportation network companies back in May 2015. Good for him; he got the ball rolling. I’ll continue pushing it up that hill.", "Part one: If government wants to encourage an activity, there should probably be a customer. We’ve got all kinds of labs and incubators. I’ve certainly visited the DMZ at Ryerson—a great one; Communitech in Kitchener-Waterloo; and the MaRS Innovation centre. One thing they’ve found in other places that worked, and worked well, in New York City and London, is to make sure that there is a customer at the end of the line. You can get all the mentors in the world you want—it’s the customer that’s actually going to get you focused on selling your product and improving its quality.", "There are calls across the broader public service for equivalency; basically, that there should be no bias towards the built economy and against the new sharing economy. The sharing economy, by the way, is also called collaborative consumption, peer-to-peer, the chance to lend or borrow or purchase from peers goods or services. The biggest ones we hear about: Uber and Airbnb. I talk about Rover a lot here in Toronto. TaskRabbit—there are literally hundreds of them; thousands of them.", "What I do in the bill is I say that across government, you need to treat the two equivalently. A taxicab receipt for expenses, if you’re allowed that, would be treated the same way as an Uber receipt. A receipt at an Airbnb or a HomeAway or a VRBO location would be treated the same way as a hotel; that a parking receipt at a Green P be the same as Rover, for example. I think government can send an important signal that they’re open to the sharing economy, that they support the initiative and they support innovation by declaring that equivalency across the board.", "The other part of that, by the way, is a five-year sunset review. I think, particularly when you’re talking about technology, it’s important to have a sunset review. That’s part one.", "Part two, ride sharing: Certainly, we’ve seen a lot of debate in our major cities in the province, and I hope that it comes to Niagara because I think it would be helpful to my riding and the constituents that I represent in neighbouring areas, and that’s the issue around Uber versus the existing taxi companies. What I usually hear from people is that they actually like the service. They like the convenience. It’s more affordable. I also hear people say, “You’ve got to level the playing field. There should be some sort of consumer protection or public safety rules around it.”", "As I said: My team, we did our homework. We looked at the best jurisdictions around the world, including those here in Ontario, and came up with a plan. I won’t list them all; they’re all in the bill. But here’s the quid pro quo: You license a transportation network company and allow it to exist. They give people a chance to earn a bit more income. The average Uber driver in Ontario, by the way: about $3,000 a year in income. One gentleman I had the other day: He was driving Uber, I think it was, about four to six hours a week to help pay for tuition for his son. He’s an electrician, and his son is becoming an electrical engineer. It’s not cheap. He’s proud of his son, so he works on Uber on the side to help pay for that tuition and see his own son’s success. I want to see more of that. I want to empower that.", "What’s the quid pro quo? In return, the transportation network company would have to guarantee that there is insurance. That’s where the Ontario government comes in. We run the regulatory system, through FSCO, for insurance. There has got to be insurance: for the driver, for the passenger, for the vehicle. In the bill, we would set the level. In return for a transportation network licence, the drivers would have to have clean driving records: no more than three moving violations in the last three years—three strikes and you’re out—a zero tolerance policy for the use of drugs or alcohol when you’re behind the wheel, and criminal background checks. There would also be consumer protection mechanisms, like making sure you know what the ride is going to cost before you get in, how they calculate the fare, a chance to review the driver and—guess what?—those drivers review you, too. They told me I’m a 4.9, so I’ve got to continue behaving myself. That’s part two.", "Part three: home sharing. Look, I’m like a lot of families across the province. I have two little girls; one is a little bit past the infant stage. When you go on vacation, on a trip, Speaker, you have two choices. You can rent out two hotels rooms, one for the parents and one for the kids—that’s pretty expensive—or you can rent out one single hotel room and pack them all in and everybody is miserable and nobody gets any sleep. You’ve been there, Speaker.", "So what have we done on the last couple of trips? We actually went through HomeAway and we rented a cottage. You had a kitchen, you had a living room and you had separate rooms. There wasn’t some big government check mark that said, “You can go here.” We relied on the advice of those who had been there before, people like us: what did they say about the place, pictures. We interacted with the owner. We’ve done this seven years in a row with great success. So why not empower more of this right here in Ontario? Do you know what? Ontario, the city of Toronto, Niagara—enormous potential—Parry Sound–Muskoka, I think, for sure, too; they’re beautiful places to visit. Why not allow people to share part of their home? If they’re away, they could have people stay at their house for compensation. If you’ve got an extra room in your place, a place above the garage, why not?", "In Chicago, where this is done, the average income for a family has been about $8,500. That’s all right. I would compare ourselves in Toronto to Chicago a lot. In fact, Toronto now has about 7,000 listings alone. Canadians are adopting this technology quickly. It’s a chance for a lot of people to make a few extra dollars and then show off their neighbourhoods. In Austin, Texas, they have found that yes, although hotel revenue did decline a little bit, particularly at the lower end of the market, it also brought new tourists to Austin, Texas, those who might not have gone because they couldn’t afford it, or a new bunch of tourists—a lot of millennials. Although slightly older, I’m a pre-millennial. They would get to stay in neighbourhoods where there aren’t hotels and they have found that awfully attractive.", "So why not? Let’s get going and empower Ontarians to make a little bit more money through services like Airbnb. It also gives you more choice as a consumer. So let’s get going.", "Part number four: parking sharing. Here is where it all wraps together. Right here in Toronto, in the province of Ontario, there’s a new app called Rover. Rover will basically connect you with somebody who wants to rent out their parking spot. It may not be as much use in Beamsville or Smithville, but in Toronto and Ottawa, and maybe in downtown Kitchener, it could be of great use. Say you have a place at Yonge and Eglinton and you’ve got a driveway or a lot that you own behind it. You could actually rent out that spot by the hour, by the day, a little extra income coming in for that rainy day fund. It also helps to relieve congestion. One study recently said that up to 30% of traffic downtown can be people roving around looking for a parking spot. So let’s allow that to happen, too. It’s a great benefit on the public policy side, addressing some environmental issues through empowering this type of technology and setting rules around it.", "Here’s what I worry about: If we continue to throw up barriers, if we continue to say to new ideas, “You’ve got to fight every municipality across the province one at a time,” if we want to close our doors, put our heads in the sand, think in the past—whatever analogy you want to mash together—the signal it’s going to send is that Ontario is not open for business. If we want that next Uber or Airbnb to be an export industry from the province of Ontario, we need to open our doors. We need to say that this is a good thing for people, it’s a good thing for technology and it’s a good thing for jobs.", "I want to see Rover expand here in Ontario, create jobs and export their product. I don’t want to see them pack up in frustration and head down to San Francisco, California, where the other two are from." ],

More and more people are making these new considerations and new choices within our economy to take a different approach to what traditional methodologies would be. We’re seeing it evolving in every facet, whether it’s the grocery store and the way that we access food or our transportation system. Life, by and large, is getting more convenient due to the emerging technology. We can only expect that it’s going to get better. We hope that it will.", "Certainly, government has a role to play to ensure that those technologies are promoted and supported and advanced when they do provide a benefit to consumers. It is, however, also our responsibility to ensure that these technologies are regulated and that they offer the set protections on behalf of consumers. It is our ultimate job here to ensure public protection, even in such a subject as parking. It may seem innocuous at first blush, but there are questions that arise within a parking spot. What types of vehicles will be parking there? Are the vehicles containing hazardous materials? I know that there are lots of regulations that are imposed on businesses in terms of parking their own vehicles in their own private parking spots. Let’s ensure that we’re providing our due diligence, but let’s also realize that the times they are a-changing. We certainly have to move along with technology and support those advancements.", "We do indeed promote R&D and IT in this province to an extent in which we should and hope to be leaders.

What she emphasized, and what we do as a party is emphasize that the sharing economy also has to be a fair economy. We can share, but let’s ensure that it is fair.", "There are many in the industries that are outlined in this bill who have provided good-quality services throughout the years. They have subscribed to the rules and complied with the rules and regulations. I speak specifically around the taxicab industry. These are folks who work hard for their money. They put in tremendous hours. They ensure the safety and the welfare of riders. They comply with the regulations; they make sure that their vehicles are compliant as well, and we ask them to do that. It is quite a regulatory burden, and one that I think many taxicab drivers would like to see a little bit of a reduction on. Nevertheless, they comply. They understand that their ultimate role is to get the person from point A to point B in a safe and effective manner.", "The prominence of Uber opens up a whole new world of transportation and that modality. In full disclosure, I’ve never used Uber. I know what it is; I understand the technology, but I’ve never used it. I’ve never used Airbnb. At some point, I’ll have to check out first-hand what these services are. So it’s difficult for me to relay a personal experience, but I do know what they are. I see Uber, of course, as a matter of convenience and something that can run parallel to a traditional system, but I see it as a virtual hitchhiking type of system at this moment, where you used to stand along the road and stick your thumb up and hope that someone was kind enough to pick you up and bring you close to where your destination was. You also hoped that their vehicle was in good working order. You hoped that they weren’t under the influence. You hoped that they had insurance. You hoped that they weren’t going to veer off the road and take you somewhere you didn’t want to go and harm you. These are things that we all took into consideration when we stuck our thumb up, and I certainly did that as an adolescent.", "We have to ensure that these types of new technologies are regulated. There’s a lot of foresight that’s put into it. I think that we also have to do our due diligence in consulting with the various jurisdictions that will be affected by them, mainly municipalities. My colleague referenced that Uber exists in certain municipalities. In fact, Uber exists everywhere now. If you have a smart phone, Uber exists. It can’t be said that it only exists in large urban settings. It can exist in a town like Belle River, where I come from. If you have a cellphone and a car, Uber is there now. That dialogue with that municipality has to happen. This is a new consideration. I hope our municipal leaders are taking a look at it. I know that they would like to have a seat at the table when legislation is brought up that affects them. This piece of legislation specifically excludes them from talking about Uber, or bringing in municipal regulations around Uber. That’s a massive, glaring omission to the bill.", "Speaker, there’s another thing that I think everyone in general should be concerned about and it is the fact that in our economy and through matters of commerce, we do business transactions and there are also levies attached to those transactions which we call, in this House, taxes. Taxes, in these specific sharing economy sectors—", "Interjection." ],

I’m sure my colleague across the way would agree that Waterloo region is renowned now as the tech hub in Canada. We have seen many innovative companies. We’ve seen just an absolute explosion in the IT sector and a number of different new emerging companies that are coming out of Waterloo region. It’s an important conversation that needs to happen across the province when it comes to this emerging sector.", "The purchasing of goods and services between consumers is nothing new. When you think back to 100, 150 years ago, many new employees moving to a new city went to boarding houses and rented a room in a home where all of the space wasn’t being used, for instance. The sharing of underused assets or personal time on a rental basis is another part of it. Much like the member across the way, I have also taken part in home-sharing vacation properties. My husband was on a conference in Europe and we did actually rent an apartment so we could come and go from there, because we were there for some amount of time. It was certainly something that I have gone ahead and used myself.", "In another instance, in terms of parking, when we visited my husband’s niece in London, England, she was talking then about people who didn’t own cars but had parking spots on their property in London, and they were renting out those parking spots—for a huge amount of money, I might add. So this is nothing new.", "We also know with any opportunities there are certainly new challenges as well, Mr. Speaker. I know that our government recognizes this and also the significant opportunities in the sharing economy that need to be explored. It’s something that we first addressed in the 2015 budget. I must say I’m proud of the work that our government has been doing on this issue, so it’s timely that we’re now at a point where we can talk about it in the House.", "If this bill moves forward to committee, there will be an opportunity to further consider the questions that are raised because of this emerging technology. We know that this bill would have a significant impact on a variety of sectors, and it’s important that we work with all of our partners in order to get this right. When it comes to the sharing economy, we need to take a balanced approach. It’s important that we drive innovation, but at the same time protect both the safety and the choice of Ontario’s consumers. Consumers are at the heart of the emerging sharing economy, and our focus remains on consumer safety, consumer protection and consumer choice in the marketplace. In particular, Speaker, the sharing economy raises some questions that our government really needs to answer for those who may be precariously employed, or for those more vulnerable communities.", "We know that the right regulatory and tax environment can help innovation thrive. It’s important to recognize that aspects of the regulatory and taxation environment may need to adapt to new and previously unconsidered business models. That innovation drives competition in the marketplace, and competition ultimately benefits consumers. Our government understands this and remains committed to protecting both the safety and choice of Ontario’s consumers in a rapidly changing marketplace.", "You know, Speaker, just before I came here I’d gone to the round table that the Ministry of Transportation is putting on this afternoon regarding autonomous vehicles—self-driving vehicles. That’s another example, not of the sharing economy, but of emerging technologies that are changing the way we do business in Ontario.", "There needs to be a fair balance between existing business and new operators. Indeed, we need to ensure that issues around consumer protection, insurance, taxation and the impact on the labour market are addressed. These are all subjects that I think bear a lot more discussion, not only here in the House, but at the committee level. I would like to see this bill move forward to committee so that we can start discussing some of these issues.", "I know that our government is actively working with industry stakeholders in determining the right regulatory and tax environment so that we, as I said before, can help innovation thrive and maintain a level playing field for businesses while balancing that with protecting the public interest.", "We also understand that as part of a growing shift to a sharing economy, new technologies are disrupting existing business models. Therein lies the reason why we need to have a much larger discussion across government of how these new technologies and these new business models are going to affect what we currently have in Ontario. New, software-driven applications often involve thousands of individual operators, and those operators are often in the field fairly quickly. That’s why we need to address this.", "In closing, Mr. Speaker, I really do support seeing this bill move forward into committee. I think that these kinds of conversations and the work that we’re doing in government about the sharing economy can help vibrant, emerging sectors to thrive. We’ll be committed to continuing to work with firms and industries to help them comply with existing obligations and to consult on an ongoing basis to make sure those obligations reflect a changing economy. Again, I myself would like to see this move forward to committee and be further discussed." ],

Our laws clearly have not kept pace with technology. Unfortunately, we only get a short allotment of time to discuss this very comprehensive bill. I’m sure there are a lot of well-formed opinions in this House on the sharing economy, and it’s a discussion that has been a long time coming. Hopefully we can get this bill to committee so the discussion can continue there. It’s great to hear government members speaking in favour of getting this bill to committee as well.", "People in this province, Mr. Speaker, are using and offering these services. They deserve clarity on where the government actually stands. Many companies find themselves competing with these new technologies, and they deserve to have the rules of engagement clearly defined. The ambiguity of the current situation is detrimental to everyone involved. This act is about facilitating the innovation and progress for a modern economy that this province desperately needs.", "We need to convey to the world that Ontario is a place to turn ideas into useful new products, services and ways of doing things. The Internet has made it cheaper and easier than ever to aggregate supply and demand, and we should be capitalizing on this instead of fighting the inevitable changes we’re seeing in the marketplace.", "I would also like to point out that most of the discussion of ride-sharing and home-sharing services revolves around cities and how these services operate in an urban context, but they have the potential to fulfill a real need in rural Ontario. Outside of large cities, taxis and hotels are not always easy to find and there is very little competition. The sharing economy business model could sustain the feast-or-famine demand that occurs in towns that experience large influxes of people during a particular season, or perhaps only a few days a year during fairs, tournaments and festivals.", "Government cannot continue to stand in the way of progress or defer to a patchwork system of regulation by municipalities that creates challenges for everyone—innovators, consumers and our legal system—participating in the sharing economy. This government has to help Ontario families improve their financial situation. Personally, I applaud the entrepreneurial spirit that underpins the sharing economy, and I believe that we should be empowering people to seize these new and exciting opportunities.", "Consumer demand for sharing-economy services is undeniable. The convenience, affordability and choice they offer have made many of these services extremely popular, even in the face of legal ambiguities. Turning a blind eye and not bringing in legislation is negligent. We need the protections this act entails as much as we need the progress it allows.", "I think the member from Niagara West–Glanbrook has done an excellent job on this bill in including measures that ensure the safety and quality of service without creating a lot of red tape that overburdens companies or service providers. Embracing the progress these new technologies bring will benefit Ontario. Innovation drives economic growth. If we stifle innovation, we stifle our economic activity, the creation of wealth and growth of jobs. The economy of this province needs to recover from the loss of manufacturing, the decimation of our auto sector, the high price of electricity and other taxes.", "Ontario is struggling, and we need to change how we do things here in the province of Ontario. I’d like to see the government take action, support my colleague’s bill today and embrace the sharing economy and opportunities for people who want to earn a little extra income in the province of Ontario.", "Again, Mr. Speaker, I’m very proud of my colleague from Niagara West–Glanbrook. He has worked hard to bring forward this thoughtful and comprehensive legislation. I hope that everyone in this House will support it so we can get it to committee. Let’s send a signal to the world that we stand on the side of innovation, competition and a modern economy." ],

But simply because a sharing economy moves along doesn’t mean that we have to embrace everything that it stands for. Absolutely, Uber, Airbnb and all the sharing economy needs regulation; there’s no question about it.", "But let’s, for a minute, just talk about who we’re talking about when we talk about Uber. There are other app-based companies that also work in various jurisdictions that don’t have the record Uber has. What is Uber’s record? Uber refused, in 2014, to even pay the $300 required fee, and routinely ignores regulations that Toronto city council puts before it.", "It has been sued. A San Francisco family is suing Uber after a driver struck and killed their child. Uber says that it is not its problem; the driver wasn’t on the clock. Yet, in Toronto, licensed drivers carry commercial insurance so they’re covered when they’re cruising.", "Driver screening: It’s claimed that the San Francisco driver had prior convictions. Toronto screens criminal and driving records before issuing a taxi licence. Uber doesn’t do that.", "Also, it uses surge pricing. For example, at 3 o’clock in the morning on a winter day when the weather is awful, our licensed taxi drivers know that the price stays the same. Uber’s does not. Uber charges what the market will bear. That sometimes means leaving a 16-year-old young woman standing on corner.", "Customer safety: Because Toronto grants, and can revoke, licences, we can keep bad drivers off the streets. By using unlicensed drivers, Uber takes that public power away.", "Denial of service: We have instances where Uber drivers have denied service to people and have also exhibited some problems. You know what? This is about protecting Uber drivers, because the real issue here is about precarious employment.", "The member from Niagara West–Glanbrook talked about an individual who made an extra $3,000 a year. How many hours did he work for that $3,000? How do we regulate that? Is he taking $2 an hour driving for Uber? How do we know? Is Uber paying taxes? How do we know? How do we regulate, and how do we actually enforce those regulations?", "Not only that, there are privacy concerns. Taxicab drivers have your credit card, your phone number; they know where you live and where you travel. US Senator Al Franken recently wrote Uber asking about their privacy safeguards. Uber hasn’t yet replied. You’re giving this information to people, and you don’t know who they are.", "There have been all sorts of documented problems with Uber. CNN reported that Uber affiliates have placed thousands of fake orders with a rival taxi company. Far from improving competition, this tactic aims to break competitors and regulators alike.", "Again, let’s look at who we’re dealing with. This is a $17-billion multinational company. There should be some controls over how it operates in our jurisdictions—there’s no question about that—and there should be labour controls on how it operates in our jurisdictions as well. I wanted to point those things out.", "Three very quick things: Auto insurance—absolutely, it’s critical to have it. We don’t have it now for either homes or drivers, where the sharing economy is concerned.", "Two, there is no mechanism in place for taxation and the collection of taxes. When you have one regulated industry up against another unregulated industry, you don’t have that control.", "Three, a critical one—we already have the city of Toronto weighing in on this; they should have been consulted—municipalities need their say. We can’t impose regulations and stipulations on our municipalities unilaterally without having them at the table. That is absolutely critical, and that, again, is where I differ with the member from Niagara West–Glanbrook.", "We have an issue here. We have to deal with it. We have to deal with it in a transparent way, in a consultative way and in a way that protects both those who are employed by the industry—the taxi industry, the ride-sharing industry and the home and hotel industry—and we have to do it with our partners.", "I don’t have a lot of time. Just a few words: Again, no doubt we’re on the tipping point of a brand new technology. It doesn’t mean we have to abrogate our responsibility to look after those who are affected by it." ],

I think I’d scream and cry and have a tantrum if someone tried to take Thursday afternoon away from me, because I find that this is the time when we actually get to be members of Parliament, and I’ve always said that I think the things we debate are very deserving of our constituents.", "I actually find this an issue with huge opportunity and huge challenges and concerns, and I dare say that I am not alone in that. It has certainly been an issue for the government. For those of you who love to read budgets, page 103 of our budget, Supporting the Sharing Economy, goes on to talk about—I won’t read it all. It goes on to talk, very similarly to this bill, about the huge emerging challenge and opportunity for people to make money and improve quality of life, and also the challenges associated with it.", "Then, on page 112 of our budget, we talk about reviewing labour laws to enhance security and competitiveness, some of the issues that the member from Parkdale–High Park raised—that was very much in here.", "Then we talked about, “Dramatic technological change has become common in the workplace, affecting many routine-based jobs”—shifting to service sectors and an increase in non-standard employment and Internet-based and related employment, which this very much is. Our labour laws right now don’t really address income security for precarious people. I talked earlier today about the labour movement and how important that is. It’s very hard, in some of these cases, to ensure benefits and security.", "I will support this because I think it needs to go to committee. To actually support this legislation, I would hope that the committee would take time to fully debate it because I think there is a great deal more complexity here, and it needs a really thorough hearing.", "I want to recommend a couple of documents. One that argues very favourably for the sharing economy is the Ontario Chamber of Commerce’s piece called Harnessing the Power of the Sharing Economy. It’s a very, very thoughtful piece that they’ve done. It looks at risks. It looks at assessments. I’m sure the member is familiar with it. I think it’s something that all of us should read.", "I would also recommend to folks an article in Fortune magazine. It’s not exactly the Walrus or Mother Jones, but Fortune magazine spends a lot of time looking at the experience of Uber in the Netherlands and the tax-avoidance schemes that have gone on. For every $20 they get from the average drive in that country—for larger drives, they transfer it to a company called BV in Bermuda and then a company called CV, which has no employees. On every single $20 that they make in revenue, which is a typical fee, they pay less than one cent in taxes. No other corporate company has that kind of challenge.", "I have not used Uber. I live in a community with Beck and other folks. The three largest companies in Ontario spent $2.5 million in Toronto on HST alone. These are hard-working families, often first-generation, often highly educated and skilled and underemployed, and in somewhat precarious employment who, quite frankly—I had a private member’s bill. I didn’t get a chance to do it. It was on the taxi industry and how taxi drivers are treated. I think they work very hard for very little remuneration and are charged all kinds of things. I talked to those taxi drivers a lot about what this means to them, and I’ve heard a variety of opinions. Some of them are very upset. I’m not prepared to support a bill that doesn’t actually look also at the conditions of people, broadly, in the transportation sector. I’ve had others say that they’re very happy with Uber, even though they’re driving for Beck. I asked them why, and they say it’s because they think it’s usury fees they’re charged and licence fees—and the little bit of money they make—and the huge rental fees have actually dropped. One driver said he makes $300 or $400 more a week because the competition from Uber has forced his employer, the owner of the licence, to actually reduce it. I’ve had others tell me the opposite story. I’ve even been in a cab where the driver was actually double-timing, doing Uber calls as well as traditional dispatch calls.", "So I learned one thing about this: There is no easy narrative here, and there’s a lot at stake.", "I come from a couple of generations of working-class Canadians. My grandmother was a char and cleaned. I have huge respect for people who do service work.", "So while I think there are opportunities for many here for greater income and security, there are huge risks. As our budget said, we’re trying to balance those things. On page 103, we make the case for advancing technology. On page 113, there’s a cautionary tale that the government also has to bring forward labour legislation to do that. I think we need both. This is one piece. I will support it, but we need the second piece as well." ],

  "text" : [ "Thank you for the opportunity today to speak to this forward-thinking bill that my colleague from Niagara West–Glanbrook has introduced to address a series of societal and economic benefits resulting from a province-wide approach to the sharing economy.", "While the member’s proposal covers a wide range of opportunities related to the sharing economy, I would like to provide some thoughts specifically relating to the ride-sharing aspect of the bill.", "I’m a frequent Uber customer. I’ve had numerous opportunities and experiences to realize the long list of benefits that have accompanied the consumer-driven ride-sharing approach to getting around the city of Toronto and, recently, in the region of Waterloo, in my constituency. Whether it’s e-hailing my ride on my BlackBerry, tracking it on the Uber map, rating my driver or electronic payments, it’s easy to see how consumer demand for more efficient, affordable, reliable and enjoyable means of travel has led to the emergence of ride-sharing as a viable and oft-times preferable option.", "More than that, the whole range of Uber-related options that have accompanied the ride-sharing experience only further highlights the limitless opportunities represented by the sharing economy.", "Have you had a chance to order an Uber lunch to your door, or order an Uber puppy to share some time with? Why, just yesterday, Uber customers were given the opportunity to “Clear your calendars—the kittens are coming.” Customers were given the option to open their app between 11 and 3 today—I think we may have a few minutes left, Speaker, in fact; not quite—request the “kittens” option, and for 30 bucks, you’ll get to enjoy 15 minutes of kitten playtime. In turn, Uber would help support Annex Cat Rescue, Just Paws Cat Rescue and the Etobicoke Humane Society—all for a great cause. Now that’s innovation meeting consumer demand, Speaker. That’s why apps like Uber have become so popular here in Ontario cities, across Canada and in fact across the world.", "More to my colleague’s overall point, it’s why similar concepts like home and parking-spot sharing have taken hold in many jurisdictions. Consumers demand efficiencies, affordability, reliability and new, innovative options, and they are finding them in this new sharing economy frontier.", "It’s also why I feel we must listen to the member’s call that recognizes the fact that as technology and new economies evolve, our legislation must also evolve with them. Bottom line, government regulations and laws should reflect what’s on the market, not stifle innovative business. Further, the call for a province-wide approach would help put a stop to the piecemeal, patchwork jurisdictional regulatory schemes that have seemed to leave everyone spinning their wheels while consumer demand is simply being ignored.", "Much as I attempted to engage government in the provincial ride-sharing conversation with a motion earlier, I am encouraged to see this approach to the sharing economy continue to gain ground through the legislation we are considering here today.", "I commend my colleague for the work he has done to address the concerns of those leery of the change that the sharing economy represents. Specifically, today’s bill calls for ride-sharing regulations that would require drivers to have a clean driving record, proper insurance and no criminal record whatsoever.", "Further, the bill allows for both municipal and provincial licensing of a transportation network company, setting minimum standards around drivers, vehicles, consumer protection and safety. Drivers, of course, would be required to meet minimum standards, including proper licensing and proof of registration. It calls for a zero-tolerance policy for drugs or alcohol, and would allow municipalities stronger enforcement tools, including the use of demerit points for those with multiple offences, such as bandit cabs.", "At the same time, the member has gone a step further, including an accessible vehicle fund that encourages more fully accessible vehicles to be on the road—again, forward-thinking concepts to meet the demand of consumers, demand that has truly driven the rise of the sharing economy in the first place.", "Speaker, we’ve gotten a glimpse of the future, and it’s a future that includes the sharing economy. Jurisdictions across the world need to be, and are, getting on board, or become at risk of being left behind.", "With regard to ride sharing specifically, to date, close to half of the US states have passed legislation to govern ride-sharing. Here in Ontario, ride-sharing has been debated in almost all of our major cities, but we have yet to have that fulsome conversation at the provincial level here at Queen’s Park—that is, until today.", "I want to be clear in my call to support today’s bill underlining government support for innovation, competition and consumer choice to ensure both public safety and better service for consumers in the province of Ontario.", "Not only does this meet the emerging and evolving demands of consumers, a province-wide approach to the sharing economy gives people the opportunity to put more money in their wallets by better utilizing assets they own, like their vehicle, their home or their parking location.", "The people of Ontario should have the right to earn revenue from assets they own, and it’s the role of government to eliminate the red tape to make that possible.", "Speaker, on the front page of the Premier’s website, she states that she will continue to fight for every person across this province to make sure they have access to the opportunity they so richly deserve. I submit that ride-sharing is an obvious opportunity for people in this province, and I hope the Premier and her caucus colleagues will be true to her word and allow the access to those opportunities that, again, as the Premier puts it, they so richly deserve. It’s time for us to get on board or risk getting left behind. By passing this bill at Queen’s Park, Ontario will be the first province in our country to regulate ride-sharing, and I look forward to that opportunity." ],

But the first time out it’s not going to be perfect, and as I am certainly reminded by my wife, Debbie, and my daughters Miller and Maitland from time to time, Speaker, perfection is far from my current grasp. So let’s get it to committee. I’m glad to hear input as to whether we got it right.", "I appreciate the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change’s comment. He’s right: There are opportunities; there are concerns. So let’s get to addressing them, because the technology is upon us and being taken up by so many consumers on a daily basis—there are a million Uber rides a month happening in the province of Ontario today.", "The minister may well know too, because he follows these issues, that in Boston, they found a regulation similar to my process for Uber. In return, the city had access to data on traffic patterns that then helped them to adjust public transit and reduce emissions from automobiles to improve the environment as a result. So there are some compelling public policy benefits from this as well.", "We also consulted with a number of industry associations, and many have come forward to endorse the bill. I appreciate the Insurance Bureau of Canada’s comments. It says, “By acknowledging the importance of an effective regulatory environment, government can better ensure the protection of consumers while allowing a vibrant and emerging sector to thrive.” The Ontario Home Builders’ Association particularly likes the home-sharing aspect. As I mentioned, in the States, over $8,000 a year—that’s a big mortgage payment. They appreciate the opportunity for “homeowners to leverage their properties for additional income” to pay down that mortgage and support housing affordability and greater choice.", "The Insurance Brokers Association of Ontario similarly has given an endorsement letter talking about the importance of an effective regulatory environment: “Government can ... ensure the protection of consumers while allowing” the sector to emerge. And the Trillium Automobile Dealers Association—the auto dealers across the province—wrote a very thoughtful letter that talked about the importance of helping people afford a new automobile or upgrade one they own.", "I thank members for their support and look forward to the vote." ],

Today, this change would benefit a more modest group of people compared to the past, but passing this amendment would symbolize fairness in the eyes of many.", "Mr. Speaker, I first introduced this bill in 2011, but was not able to debate it before the provincial election that took place that same year. In 2012, it was reintroduced by MPP Mario Sergio, from the riding of York West. He also didn’t get a chance to bring it to second reading, as he was appointed minister responsible for seniors shortly after, and as we all know, ministers do not present private members’ bills. The bill was reintroduced again in 2013, I believe, by my fellow MPP Lorenzo Berardinetti, from Scarborough Southwest. It went to second reading, but then it died on the order paper.", "It is not a coincidence, in my opinion, that this piece of legislation has been championed by three MPPs of Italian-Canadian background. This community has traditionally made significant contributions to areas such as workplace safety and labour issues in Ontario. When Italian immigrants flocked to Canada after the Second World War in search of a better life, many found work in the construction industry. In the 1960s, more than 15,000 Italian men worked in Toronto alone, representing one third of all construction workers in our city.", "At that time, for these men, simply going to work every morning comported risks to life and limb. A well-known example of the dangers of working in construction in those days is the Hogg’s Hollow disaster. As you may remember, Mr. Speaker, on March 17, 1960, five young Italian immigrant construction workers were killed after becoming trapped in a tunnel while building a water main. This tragedy highlighted the need for safety regulations, and ultimately led to significant changes to workplace safety laws in Ontario. It also motivated the Italian Canadian community to take on a greater advocacy role in respect to safer working conditions and the protection of injured workers.", "Robert Storey, a professor at McMaster University, in his seminal book, Their Only Power Was Moral: The Injured Workers’ Movement in Toronto, 1970-1985, quotes Vincenzo Pietropaolo, formerly a city planner and now a respected historical photographer who has chronicled the workers’ experience in the Italian community in Toronto. In an interview included in the book, Pietropaolo states that in those days, everyone in the Italian community knew someone who had suffered a work-related injury. That is why that advocacy has continued through time and to this day.", "I would like to take a moment to pay tribute to the people who first brought to my attention the issue we are debating today. They are Orlando Buonastella, community legal worker with Injured Workers’ Consultants; Gino Cucchi, who has been president of Comites, an organization that works to identify and support the needs of the Italian community; and Antonio, or Tony, Mauro, an injured worker who has been personally affected by the lack of fairness of the current laws. We’ll speak about Antonio in a moment.", "Orlando, Gino and Antonio are here today, together with other representatives of the injured workers. We have Karl Crevar, from the Ontario Network of Injured Workers Groups and the Canadian Injured Workers Alliance, who’s here from Hamilton; Margery Wardle, from the Ontario Network of Injured Workers Groups, who’s here from Ottawa; and we also have Mario Marra and Fulvio Florio, who are long-time community advocates. Thank you for being here.", "So Orlando, Gino and Antonio were the first to bring this issue to my attention back in 2009, when I also facilitated a meeting between advocates from the Italian Canadian community and then-Minister of Labour Peter Fonseca to talk about WSIB issues, cost-of-living issues and a special case of unfairness. They explained that the root of the issue can be traced back to 1994, when the government of the day introduced a workers’ compensation reform bill, Bill 165, which went into effect in 1995.", "From that point on, injuries that occurred after the new system came into force are dealt with under the new system, but claims existing under prior systems continue to be governed by the old legislation. Under the old legislation, a worker who in the opinion of the Workers’ Compensation Board was not likely to achieve his or her pre-injury earnings was eligible for a $200 monthly supplement. The supplement was intended for older injured workers who often lacked the necessary language skills or education to benefit from job retraining, and who were not expected to return to the workforce.", "The problem arises when these older workers reach the age of 65 and Old Age Security starts being factored in with their WSIB benefits. For those injured before 1985, the sum of their pension, the supplement, any other wages and the Old Age Security cannot exceed a ceiling of 75% of their pre-injury earnings. For those injured before 1989, the sum cannot exceed a ceiling of 90% of their pre-injury earnings. The result is that these injured workers never get any increase. Any time Old Age Security is adjusted for inflation, their WSIB payments are clawed back.", "In Antonio Mauro’s case, the payment he receives cannot exceed the amount of money he made 43 years ago. Antonio’s story is well-known within his community and beyond. He has relentlessly written to ministers and MPPs, and reached out to the media. He has never given up the hope that his plight will be heard.", "Antonio Mauro is now 82 years old. He came to Canada in 1956 from a small Calabrian town, Malito, with many dreams for his future and a strong will to contribute to our society. He found work as a carpenter. In 1972, at the age of 38, he suffered a severe injury to his back that didn’t allow him to ever return to work.", "Patty Winsa, a news reporter with the Toronto Star, wrote an article featuring Antonio Mauro’s story about a year ago. Here’s how she describes his current situation:", "“Mauro is in an unusual category: an older worker who has lived long enough to be subject to a WSIB law that caps his benefits—including Old Age Security—at about 90% of his 1970s salary.", "“The cap means that quarterly cost-of-living increases in OAS are clawed back from Mauro’s monthly WSIB cheques, even though OAS is a universal benefit that most seniors who earn less than $114,815 are entitled to”—there are not too many, I believe.", "She goes on to explain, “Older workers can only rely on Old Age Security if they’ve been in the country for 10 years or more. And for people like Mauro, injured at a young age, Canada Pension Plan payouts are low because he has missed years of contributions.”", "I would also like to share with my colleagues here in the House what John McKinnon, lawyer and director of the Injured Workers Consultants community legal clinic and highly regarded as an expert in the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act, has written in this regard: “It makes absolutely no sense that workers’ compensation benefits should be reduced by Old Age Security benefits. The Old Age Security benefit is not connected to disability or earnings; it is based on how many years you have lived in Canada.”", "When this bill was previously debated in this Legislature, some MPPs raised concerns that by supporting this piece of legislation, a new entitlement would be created without a new revenue stream. So I want to be clear: The bill I am proposing applies only to workers who were injured before 1990, who received a supplement for not being able to return to work, and that is now reduced by the calculation or integration of Old Age Security. Mr. Speaker, it simply isn’t fair to punish these workers just because they were injured in the workplace before 1990. It is a question of fairness.", "Injured workers, such as Antonio Mauro, who is here with us today, and who, in 1972, was earning $2.10 an hour, should not be penalized and should not be subject to this unfair clawback.", "I therefore encourage my fellow MPPs to support this bill and to help me correct this injustice." ],

This bill was first introduced in this Legislature just two days ago, so we’ve been feverishly scrambling to get ready for this debate this afternoon.", "I do want to say to the member, I want to compliment her at the outset. The member for York South–Weston, in my view, is a thoughtful and dedicated MPP who actively participates in this House and in legislative committees. I know that she served in the Legislature for about eight years now, going back to 2007. She was re-elected in 2011 and again in 2014. I think she currently serves as the parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Finance, which is an important responsibility within this House, and I know that she had a very distinguished career in broadcast journalism before she was first elected.", "I know her as a member who is loyal to her caucus but it not blindly partisan to everything that goes on in this place. As one of the presiding officers in this House, I appreciate that. I can’t recall a single instance when she was ever called to order or was ever warned by any Speaker. She obviously respects the institutions that she’s privileged to serve. I would say that at the outset.", "The member said in her introductory remarks that this bill has been introduced now for the fourth time. She mentioned that the current minister responsible for seniors, as well as the member for Scarborough Southwest, have each introduced a bill like this. It’s the second time she, herself, has introduced it. The next comment I’m going to make is not a reflection on the member but maybe more so on the government. If the bill has been introduced four times by government members, one would wonder why hasn’t the government either introduced a bill or taken the opportunity, in other labour legislation that opens up workers’ compensation legislation, to include these provisions in government legislation such that it will actually pass? I say that recognizing that private members’ public business is an important part of the process, too.", "If indeed this bill passes the Legislature and goes to committee, I know that the member would want to actually have it dealt with at committee, with public hearings to take place at committee, such that it can be referred back to the House. I wouldn’t question her sincerity in that. I would say to her, in my experience in this House, persistence does pay off eventually over time if you keep raising an issue.", "We do have some concerns. I know that, first of all, I want to articulate on behalf of our caucus that we support fairness in compensation to injured workers. We always have. We recognize that employers pay premiums to WSIB as part of their payroll costs. We recognize that high payroll costs in Ontario today are already inhibiting new job creation, and we know that the pending Ontario Retirement Pension Plan represents an even higher payroll cost for employers and lower take-home pay for workers if, indeed, it is acted upon as the government says it wants to.", "I would also add that, as a general principle, before our caucus would want to agree on increasing any WSIB benefits, we would insist on seeing an honest accounting of what these initiatives are going to cost the employers of Ontario or what it’s going to cost in terms of a growing unfunded liability at the WSIB.", "I have some comments that were given to me by a friend of mine, Mr. Les Liversidge, who is here today. Les, I want to welcome you to the Legislature. We appreciate your advice on matters concerning workers’ compensation. He’s given me some suggestions that I think need to be put on the record here. He talks about the reason for the OAS clawback as it exists today. He says, “The reason is simple—an injured worker’s de facto post-retirement income should not increase by virtue of the effect of the OAS benefit.", "“This rationale is consistent with the wage-replacement nexus of workers’ compensation. The general $200 per month pension”—that the member referred to—“was introduced to recognize perceived systemic undercompensation for workers who were/are unable to increase earnings to pre-injury levels. The benefit, which was a nominal gesture, was never designed to represent actual loss but nonetheless is structurally linked to the wage-loss concepts by virtue of its default connection to section 147(4). It is important to note that supplements to lifelong pensions were increased by $200, not the lifelong pension itself. Workers who did in combination of post-injury earnings and pension benefits approximate pre-injury income, did not receive a section 147(14) supplement.”", "“If a worker is not eligible for OAS, there is no clawback, and the ‘net’ pension would still be comparable to the clawed-back pension (inclusive of OAS).", "“The OAS clawback,” he says, “is a reasonable proposition. The principled policy reasons behind its inception remain valid in 2015,” this year.", "“However, the effect is likely very different as the pool for section 147(14) recipients has likely decreased over time.", "“It should be noted that labour and injured-worker advocacy groups have always opposed the clawback.”", "We recognize that, but at the same time we need to put that concern on the record. I believe that it’s important advice that, if indeed the bill passes, the committee needs to consider.", "I also want to acknowledge my colleague for Lambton–Kent–Middlesex, who will be coming up shortly on behalf of our party. He was the former labour critic for our party when this bill was last introduced and he made some very valid and pertinent points. Since I am running out of time, perhaps I should just let him make those valid and pertinent points when he gets a chance in a few seconds’ time.", "Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Again, I express my appreciation to the member. We do have some concerns that I feel obligated to put on the record, but we thank the member for bringing this bill forward today." ],

I’m happy that the member from York South–Weston has brought this bill forward again in this Legislature.", "Currently, a worker’s permanent partial disability WSIB benefits for pre-1985 and pre-1989 injuries under the pre-1997 act cannot be more than the amount of a full monthly benefit, under section 3 of the Old Age Security Act. What this bill does is to ensure that any pension a worker is eligible for under the Old Age Security Act does not reduce the worker’s permanent partial disability benefits for pre-1985 and pre-1989 injuries under the pre-1997 act. While this may not affect many older injured workers, it is a positive step in removing barriers to workers in order for them to receive the full WSIB benefits they deserve.", "As our critic for seniors, I have heard of these incidents happening in the past, and I am happy that this government has a bill to address these issues. Moreover, when I speak to seniors or listen to injured workers on pensions, they describe how when their OAS amounts increase, their WSIB decreases, keeping their overall income the same. For many older people struggling to pay bills and put food on the table, this bill will help those injured to receive their full benefits.", "Seniors, especially injured workers, face a specific set of issues that other demographic groups in our province may not experience. The rising cost of drugs, our underfunded public health care system, and having family and friends to support them are just some examples of issues that these individuals may face. We as legislators should be doing everything we can to ensure the well-being of our injured workers, as well as of our aging population.", "Speaker, workers deserve their fair share and should not be subject to clawbacks of their WSIB benefits. Yet it was this government that appointed WSIB head David Marshall, who was credited with ushering in an age of austerity at WSIB for injured workers, where he received gold-plated bonuses for driving down rates. It was recently very quietly announced that David Marshall would come on board as the new consultant on the province’s ORPP, thus shortening his time at WSIB. His exit has been celebrated by injured workers, advocates and workers themselves, who don’t deserve for their benefits to be attacked because of this government’s austerity agenda with WSIB with that gentleman at the helm.", "This bill also highlights this government’s inaction on the WSIB file and failure to take action on the major Arthurs recommendations, including experience rating, which Harry Arthurs has seriously called into question. This is how experience rating works, and this is why Arthurs had real concerns about the program in his landmark WSIB study. Employers who are able to hide their serious injuries as something called “no-lost-time medical aid accidents” and reduce their compensation costs then become eligible to receive a rebate from WSIB. The other side of this perverse program provides penalties for employers who have a higher level of lost-time injury statistics and costs.", "Between the two kinds of incentives, the money at stake for many employers can add up to millions: roughly $200 million per year throughout Ontario. In fact, it has been estimated that over $2 billion in rebates have gone to companies over the past 10 years without any sign that the program has actually reduced injuries. The important point is that the two sides of the experience rating program skew the lost-time injury statistics for Ontario by providing a powerful incentive for employers to under-report. In other words, no matter how badly injured a worker is on the job, as long as he or she comes to work, employers are rewarded under the experience rating.", "Speaker, hopefully this small change to WSIB will be followed by a more substantive and detailed look at the WSIB file. I hope this government finally gives workers the rights that they deserve.", "Thank you for the time to speak on this very important bill, and I am very glad to see that there is a small step being made forward on WSIB." ],

In the context of today’s conversation in particular, we all know that accidents can happen and, sadly, they can and do happen in the workplace. Much can be done to reduce the likelihood of such occurrences. In fact, Ontario has made important strides to reduce risk in workplaces across our province. But despite our best efforts, unfortunately, accidents still do happen. Ontarians who find themselves in such situations can sometimes end up being unable to work ever again, and so they turn to WSIB to help support them.", "Sadly, as we are all aware, it can be very difficult to live on a fixed income. Every dollar counts when you have bills to pay and no ability to increase your earnings each month. This can be especially difficult for our seniors, who often incur extra expenses for things like mobility devices, medication or accessing transit. I have first-hand experience with this as, in my riding of Burlington, almost one in five residents is a senior.", "It is our responsibility as legislators to protect the most vulnerable members in our communities, and this piece of legislation will go a long way in ensuring that those who have suffered a work-related injury are able to enjoy the same quality of life as everyone else.", "Under the current rules, workers injured prior to 1985 and who have reached the age of 65 cannot have the sum of their compensation, including pensions for Old Age Security, equal more than 75% of their pre-injury earnings. Similarly, individuals injured after 1985 but prior to 1990 cannot have their compensation exceed 90% of their pre-injury earnings. In essence, this means that, as one form of compensation increases, another will decrease proportionately, resulting in a net-zero change in overall benefits.", "This important bill will allow injured workers to earn over the 75%-or-90% threshold when their Old Age Security amounts increase. We can help to avoid the heartbreaking stories of seniors who have been injured while at work and are still earning the same amount each month as they did in the 1970s and 1980s. The cost of living increases each year, and it is unfair to expect that anyone can survive with no increase in their monthly income, year after year. Allowing overall compensation amounts to increase will help many seniors who have experienced a serious workplace injury to enjoy a higher quality of life and the dignity of a higher income.", "Mr. Speaker, we need to protect injured workers, especially when they reach the age of 65. I’d like to commend my colleague from York South–Weston once again for bringing forward this important piece of legislation and engaging us in this debate. I know my constituents in Burlington will be comforted, knowing that their government is looking out for them as they get older.", "Every day in this place, we have the privilege of discussing issues that really impact the lives of all the people we serve.

He’s with the Injured Workers’ Consultants Community Legal Clinic in Toronto. The paper that I’d like to draw from is called Age-Based Discrimination in Ontario’s Workers’ Compensation Laws. I’d like to share his explanation of this specific issue. “Since many of these injured workers’ pensions are based on low wages from the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s and were not fully adjusted for inflation, they have reached the stage where their pension plus the” supplement “plus their OAS benefit has reached the ceiling based on their old wages.

There is no increase or adjustment for inflation for cost of living for these older, injured individuals. Their WSIB payments are clawed back anytime OAS is adjusted for inflation. Quite frankly, this is awful, and it is unfair. As we’ve heard today, this is the fourth time that this bill has been introduced in the Legislature. Our injured and targeted seniors and injured workers need this bill to pass—they needed this bill to pass years ago.", "We support this bill.

In 1990, the Ontario workers’ compensation system changed from a permanent disability system to a wage loss system. Since that time and that change, there have been a number of discriminatory issues that have reared their ugly heads, and they do, in fact, all revolve around age.", "A little sidestep here: My Bill 98, the Protecting Victims of Occupational Disease Act, seeks to address two separate but connected issues. Retirement and age should not preclude anyone from receiving fair compensation for occupational disease or injury. Part of my Bill 98 calls for a fair approach to determining benefits paid, specifically for an occupational disease. Someone diagnosed the day before retirement and someone diagnosed the day after should both be treated fairly. Many diseases and conditions take time to present and be diagnosed. The date of diagnosis shouldn’t disqualify someone from receiving fair compensation.", "Another issue when it comes to older workers diagnosed with occupational disease is that after their passing, unfortunately, surviving spouses are not entitled to receive a pension if someone dies of an occupational disease if they had been diagnosed post-retirement. These surviving spouses are only entitled to the Death Benefit, which is intended to cover funeral costs. They’re condemned to living in poverty without their partner. Again, we come back to the point that age and retirement penalties are not fair and are contrary to the spirit of the WSIA.", "Back to this bill specifically: I’m putting on my critic for pensions hat. I’d also like to take a look again at the unfortunate case of Mr. Mauro, who, again, I’m pleased has joined us here today. I hope you’re appreciating the debate today. I wonder if part of his story is also that he was never compensated for the loss of his CPP benefits, as well as suffering the unfairness of the benefits clawback tied to OAS increases, as, unfortunately, many older and injured workers are faced with.", "So, again, back to Mr. McKinnon: As he explains, “The Canada Pension Plan is an earnings-based social program that provides benefits when a contributor to the plan retires or becomes disabled.", "“Workers contribute a part of their gross wages to the Canada Pension Plan. In the future, they have entitlements to disability and retirement benefits based on their contributions and lifetime income. When you are unable to work due to a workplace injury or illness, all of this disappears without compensation.”", "As he further comments, “The solution will require amendments to both workers’ compensation legislation and the Canada Pension Plan.”", "Mr. Speaker, this is a government that has been talking—not just today—a lot about retirement security and dignity in retirement. Here is another chance for us to connect with this government’s new federal partners and push to amend the CPP to fix the broken bits that we are identifying as unfair and harmful.", "Seniors in vulnerable and challenging injured circumstances shouldn’t be sitting ducks or seen by employer lawyers and the government to be easy targets. They should be fairly compensated for their loss and sacrifice and injury, and they should be protected and fairly treated. For crying out loud, this isn’t news, so let’s fix this. Not just one piece at a time—let’s make it right; let’s fix it all together.", "As I said, Mr. Speaker, we support this bill. We applaud the member from York South–Weston. This bill needs to pass, but it must only be a part of the conversation about what is right, what is fair and what we can do and choose to fix, if we decide to." ],

It’s not the great Canada we see today, where everybody loves multiculturalism and respects workers. No, they were treated like indentured labourers. They worked 10 or 12 hours a day, and then they were told, “If you don’t come to work on Saturday, you don’t come to work on Monday.” That’s what the situation was. Then, when they went to get paid, in many instances there was no paycheque, over and over again. These are the people who built the country and are just looking for a little bit of fairness here. That’s what this bill represents.", "I remember this story I’ve been told that in the summertime, when they were working on road construction, there was no such thing as water for the workers. It wasn’t allowed. You weren’t allowed to have water on the construction site. Do you know where they used to get their water? They used to get their water from the cement truck that came by. That’s the only water they could get.", "This is what this bill represents. It represents those incredibly dedicated family men, mostly, and women who did the work at home and had jobs also that they got paid peanuts for. They basically severely injured themselves, and the compensation system is not fair to them.", "I know people say, “The Conservatives say we can’t do anything about this because of the unfunded liability.” Well, the unfunded liability has now gone from $24 billion down to $8 billion, so it is improved. That’s not an excuse anymore.", "Also, the impact is very small financially because, unfortunately, there are very few Mr. Mauros left, because most of them died. They died, many of them, because of the construction injuries they got no compensation from, and they suffered their whole life.", "This is not about technical, lawyers, and names of bills. This is about doing something that’s right for all these people who built this city and built this country." ],

The great work that she did on Crown Cork and Seal and the very troubled strike situation they had in that organization—she went to bat for those people, not because Crown Cork is in her riding, but because workers in her community worked in that facility, and she went to bat for them.", "What makes me very pleased to be here is that today she is fighting for a representative of my riding, Beaches–East York—Antonio Mauro. I’m absolutely delighted to see you here. You’ve come down to Queen’s Park. You’ve been an advocate. You’ve been a great media spokesperson, Mr. Mauro, for this issue. As a representative and as a constituent of Beaches–East York, I commend you for your courage to come down here, notwithstanding the fact that your mobility is limited. You’ve come down with your fellows who have been working with you over the years to try to solve this problem.", "Let’s be very, very clear: Mr. Mauro earned his disability pension. He was injured in the workplace. Why we pay premium insurance into the WSIB is that if there is a tragic situation, whether it is an injury which stops an individual from being able to work, there is a compensation program in place. That compensation program was in place to put earnings back into his family, based on the earnings of the day. Then let’s also be clear that as a senior over 65, he deserves the Old Age Security benefit. It is unconscionable that these two different funding schemes are operating in a way that is disinheriting him, disenfranchising him of what is justly due to him and his family.", "The article we’ve spoken about, in the Toronto Star, talks at length about his wonderful wife who, because of his disability situation, worked tirelessly to assist the family, to put you on as firm a financial footing as you could be for your family growing up in Beaches–East York. She, too, should be totally commended for her hard work in ensuring that the family was well looked after.", "Mr. Mauro is joined here by a number of other individuals, including Orlando Buonastella. I’ve just met Orlando for the first time today. He works on the Danforth, not far from where my constituency office is, working with the injured workers’ compensation group. His office is in Toronto–Danforth, and I’m just a little bit further east. We’ll get together and we’ll talk about some of the issues, because this is an issue, being new to this riding, I hadn’t come across. The fact that this has been in front of us four times—it’s somewhat like the tipping bill. The fourth time, we might get lucky, in order to bring a very important piece of legislation forward and get it approved.", "It’s just fantastic that the member for York South–Weston has once again shown leadership to represent the little guy, the little guy who needs government to stand up and support him and support his family and all injured workers who fall into this very narrow problem, this technicality whereby, between the provincial and the federal government schemes, they are being disenfranchised of what is justly due.", "Congratulations, sir, for being here. We hope to get this accomplished as quickly as possible." ],

So the bill applies only to workers who were injured before 1990, who received a supplement for not being able to return to work and that is now being reduced, after age 65, by the calculation of integration of Old Age Security. I hope that they will take time to understand that.", "I also want to thank the guests who are here. They are the real advocates of this bill. We have spoken about this to Antonio Mauro.

I want to thank each and every one of them for their support, guidance and constructive feedback.", "Most importantly, my very sincere thanks to my family, and especially my late parents, as none of us can do this job without the encouragement of our loved ones. Words cannot describe the pride I feel in having raised two wonderful daughters, who were born and raised in this province and have worked hard to achieve success in their professional and personal pursuits. I would also like to thank my wife for her steadfast and unwavering support. We have a new addition in our family, my adorable grandson, who I look forward to spending time with after June 7.", "To my fellow MPPs, current and former, thank you for supporting, teaching and challenging me. It has been a pleasure working alongside of you.", "Thank you, Mr. Speaker, as well, for your dedication and outstanding service to Ontario and our Legislature. I concur with a lot of the observations that you have recently made about the changing role of MPPs. Partisanship often clouds our decision-making and thinking. The best ideas, however, no matter where they come from, should be incorporated into our policies.", "Let me take this final moment to offer my very best wishes to my colleagues who are running in the upcoming election, and thank the others—and there are quite a few of them—who have chosen to step down for their years of contribution to our great province. No matter the outcome on June 7, let us keep in mind that our common goal remains the same: to continue bettering our province for all Ontarians." ],

I cannot express enough how important it is that we recognize the tremendous value that nurses bring to our health care system. That is why our government has consistently made nurses a top priority and why we continue to invest in the nursing community.", "Since 2003, our government has added over 30,000 nurses to the workforce, and the number of nurses employed in nursing in Ontario has increased for the 13th consecutive year. Our strong partnership with nurses has led to a number of innovative initiatives that are helping patients across Ontario.", "We continue to support education for nurses by committing $4.9 million towards critical care training for our nurses. This will open the door for 624 new nurses and 188 mid-career nurses to enter into critical care practice.", "Through our partnership with the RNAO, $750,000 will go towards the co-creation of a program that will offer pre- and post-natal care for indigenous women in communities affected by tobacco use.", "We are also investing $2.3 million over three years to the Project ECHO/WoundPedia initiative. This will increase coordinated interprofessional wound care capacity in Ontario, particularly in rural and underserviced communities.", "We know how critical nurses are to our health care system, which is why we expanded the scope of practice for nurses so patients have more access to services when they need it. Last spring, we amended the Nursing Act to allowed registered nurses to prescribe drugs for certain non-complex conditions and to communicate a diagnosis for the purposes of prescribing. Also, all nurse practitioners can now order ultrasounds and X-rays for patients, and we’re working towards expanding access to ordering CT scans.", "We also recognize that nurses, being on the front lines, are first responders themselves. They’re also often some of the last people to ask for help as their focus is on the care and well-being of others. It is our responsibility in government to care for those who selflessly commit their lives and safety to help millions of people across the province. That is why, last December, along with Minister Flynn, we announced the expansion of the PTSD presumption to all front-line nurses providing direct patient care.", "Nurses are also critical in our strategy to ensure that everyone in the province has access to primary care. We have created 27 new nurse practitioner-led clinics, which means faster access to family health care for more than 60,000 patients in communities across the province. We have also created 75 full-time nurse practitioner positions in long-term-care homes.", "Speaker, building on this, this year’s budget includes an investment of $300 million over three years so that every long-term-care home in the province will benefit from an additional registered nurse. This is part of our commitment to increase the provincial average to four hours of daily care per long-term-care resident by 2022.", "Our budget also includes a commitment to invest an additional $650 million in home care over the next three years. Part of this investment includes $180 million in new funding in 2018-19 that is estimated to make available 2.8 million more hours of personal support, including caregiver respite plus 284,000 more nursing visits and 58,000 more therapy visits.", "We’ve made these commitments on behalf of people across Ontario because caring for people is a core value.", "In 2007, our government created the Nursing Graduate Guarantee, providing new graduate nurses in Ontario with temporary full-time employment to support their successful transition to permanent full-time employment. Since its creation, nearly 20,500 new nurses have participated.", "We also created the Nursing Education Initiative, which supports continuing education and professional development for nurses through funding for education grants, fellowships, research projects and best-practice guideline development and implementation.", "To support the retention of nurses, our government created the Late Career Nurse Initiative. This initiative provides salary replacement dollars to organizations, allowing late-career nurses aged 55 and older to utilize their knowledge, skills and expertise to advance projects that improve patient care or the quality of work environments.", "Speaker, we know that when we invest in our hospitals, we are also investing in our nurses. Our investment of $822 million for Ontario hospitals will help our nurses to better serve patients across the province. Our government understands that nurses are the backbone of our health care system, and I’m happy to stand here to recognize the incredible contribution that they make to the people of this province." ],

This is so important, because all our kids and staff should feel welcome in our schools.", "Education Week is an important opportunity for all of us to talk about our hopes for the future, but it’s also a great opportunity for all of us to talk about the strides that we have made so far. As a result of Ontario’s Equity and Inclusive Education Strategy, launched in 2009, all publicly funded schools in Ontario now have equity and inclusion education policies and religious accommodation guidelines in place. This is something we should all be proud of.", "In 2017, we introduced the province’s first education equity action plan to remove discriminatory barriers and biases that still exist in our education system. Speaker, this was such an important step. Our equity action plan is a powerful tool, a tool that strengthens our publicly funded education system by ensuring that every student in our province—every student—has the ability to reach their full potential and that every student has the opportunity to succeed regardless of race, religion, ethnicity or individual identity.", "Speaker, the implementation of our equity action plan is already under way in Ontario schools. Twelve boards are now participating in culturally responsive and relevant pedagogy initiatives, and regionally based equity networks are in place in school boards to help identify and address local needs. Intensive, two-day professional development training programs were held for trustees on human rights, ethical leadership and good governance—and there’s more work under way.", "We’re establishing formal human rights support structures in schools and school boards. Just think about that. These offices will find local solutions to challenges on the ground.", "These are just a few of many examples of the transformation under way to enhance equity in schools and school boards all across Ontario. This gives our schools the tools and resources that they need to ensure all students have the opportunity to achieve success and well-being—so important if our young people need to learn.", "During Education Week, schools across the province will be alive with events, activities and celebrations that will bring equity to life in their hallways, classrooms and libraries. I encourage all my colleagues here to take the time to recognize the remarkable contributions of our students, parents, teachers and education workers in Ontario. Use your voices, use your networks and your social media to share the details of Education Week activities in your neighbourhoods—so important. Just use the hashtag #EdWeekON2018 to tell your local community stories.", "Speaker, the well-being and academic success of every student and child are top priorities for the Ministry of Education and our education partners. That’s why equity is one of the most important goals outlined in our vision for education, along with improving student achievements, promoting well-being, and enhancing confidence in the publicly funded school system.", "It is my honour and privilege to stand today in the House and extend my best wishes to every student, every parent, every teacher and every education worker who works tirelessly every day to do their part to support and champion equity inclusion and human rights at school. Speaker, together we are paving the way to equity in action and building a strong path forward for all of kids." ],

Their relationships give us a strong sense of what is needed to improve our health care system.", "Unfortunately, under this Liberal government, we have the lowest RN-to-population ratio in the country. The latest figures show that there are just 703 RNs for 100,000 people in Ontario, compared with 839 RNs per 100,000 in the rest of the country. Between 2011 and 2017, Ontario’s population grew 7%; however, RN employment rose by just 2%. For five years, this government froze base funding in our hospitals, which resulted in nursing job losses and over 10,000 unfilled RN positions. This has negatively affected patient care and has led to hallway medicine.", "Nurses are an invaluable resource. Our leader, Doug Ford, and the PC Party have committed to listening to nurses to fix our health care system. A PC Party will end hallway medicine and address wait times in this province. This will be accomplished working with our nurses: RNs, NPs, RPNs and nursing students.", "On behalf of Doug Ford and the PC Party, we want to thank all of the nurses for their tireless dedication in Ontario.

Gareth and I used to be very good friends when we were in our twenties. We lost track of each other for a number of years. Then I find that Gareth has involved himself with the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety while I became the Minister of Labour. So we’ve sort of come back together again, Speaker, in the same field. I just wanted to welcome Gareth Jones to the House today and thank him for the work he does, keeping people healthy and safe on the job.", "It is a real pleasure to rise today to speak to our proposed wage legislation. What we’ve done with Bill 53 is introduce legislation that’s going to ensure that people who are working in construction, in building cleaning or in security jobs, under contracts with the government of Ontario, are going to be paid a fair wage and a prevailing wage in those sectors.", "The proposed Government Contract Wages Act, 2018, would, if passed, allow Ontario to establish minimum rates of pay for workers in—as I outlined—the construction sector, the building cleaning sector, and security services work.", "What that would do is, for anybody who bid and was successful on those contracts, it would require those contractors and subcontractors to pay according to the rates that were established. How we would do this is by enabling the fair wage policy through legislation.", "If you look at the status quo, if you look at what we have today, you will find that, currently, Ontario has a fair wage policy which sets rates for government contracts in certain sectors of the construction industry as well as, as I said before, contracted building services and security. The policy is contained in an order in council—it’s not contained in legislation—and it’s aimed very, very specifically at ministries and agencies within the government.", "Those of you who have followed this issue will know that this policy has not been revised or updated since 1995. Obviously, with changes in rates of pay, inflation, technology and all of the changes that have taken place since that date, you will find that these rates that we have contained are very, very outdated.", "Just to show you how outdated the policy has become, three out of the four agencies that are in this current order in council no longer even exist, Speaker. When this policy was established, a number of ministries were directly issuing contracts for construction and for building services. We’ve changed our system of procurement since that time. We have a different system in place. To streamline and make it more effective, a significant portion of procurement is now managed by the organization called Infrastructure Ontario. It’s an agency of the Ministry of Infrastructure. To no one’s surprise, Speaker, Infrastructure Ontario is not mentioned in the current fair wage policy, simply because it didn’t exist at the time.", "We’ve changed our procurement rules and we’ve changed our procurement processes since that time, Speaker. You will find that a lot of it is outside the scope of the current policy we have; therefore, the need for changes.", "The Premier is very supportive of this legislation. I would like to echo her comments when she announced that we would be looking at this type of legislation. What she said was:", "“Every worker deserves to be paid a fair wage. And every business bidding for a government contract deserves a fair shot. We’re taking action so that employers won’t be able to win a competition by unfairly lowering workers’ wages. It’s just one of the ways we are standing up for workers in a rapidly changing economy. We know that a $15 minimum wage, compensation ranges on job postings and equal pay for equal work is the right thing to do for everyone in Ontario. All workers deserve to be compensated and treated well.”", "That was the Premier’s comment on this proposed legislation. As the Premier said, workers deserve to be treated fairly.", "The legislation we have before us today would build on historic actions we’ve already taken, intended to create more opportunity and security for workers and to help them get ahead in a rapidly changing economy. Our government has already taken action to ensure that fairness is a defining factor in all workplaces in Ontario. We’ve heard across the province people’s concerns and problems and their hopes for a better life, and we’ve responded to those concerns.", "We know that Ontario’s economy is strong, and it’s growing. We know the unemployment rate has been below the national average each month for over two years. That’s why we can’t forget those who have every right and reasonable expectation to join in this prosperity.", "Speaker, in the province of Ontario, job creation has been averaging about 500 jobs a day. So when we all lay our heads down tonight, we’ll know that 500 more Ontarians were working at the end of the day than when we all woke up this morning. That has been the pattern day after day. Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, right through every day of the week: 500 more people working at the end of a workday in Ontario than when that day began.", "We took action, Speaker, to make sure that people can join in that prosperity. We raised the minimum wage. We believe that Ontarians deserve a minimum wage they can actually live on. Before the Legislature passed the Fair Workplaces, Better Jobs Act, the median hourly wage in Ontario was about $13 an hour for part-time workers. Over the past 30 years, part-time work has grown to represent nearly 20% of total employment.", "Before Bill 148, 30% of Ontarians earned less than $15 an hour. That’s millions of people in this province. How can we expect people to support a family on such a low wage? How could they properly raise their children? How would they be able to save for a portion of their children’s education? How would they pay those ordinary bills, Speaker? These are the questions that were asked by people, and these were our responses: We raised the minimum wage to $14 an hour. Next January 1, it will go to $15 an hour. We noted that many people were forced to work part-time, so we’re ensuring that those part-time employees receive equal pay to those full-time employees they work with who do substantially the same jobs. It’s only fair, and fairness has been an approach to reforming all of Ontario’s labour laws.", "We know that a lot more companies are looking at the prospect of perhaps hiring part-time employees. Sometimes that’s just the way they conduct their business, Speaker. But using part-time employees should not create an unfair workplace in which some are paid less than others who do exactly the same job. Paying people the same rate of pay for substantially the same work is simply fair. That’s why casual, part-time and seasonal employees who do substantially the same work as full-timers are now paid the same rate of pay.", "We increased minimum vacation entitlements up to the national average. After five years with a company in Ontario, an employee is now entitled to at least—and this is the floor, Speaker—three weeks of paid vacation a year.", "We have established fairer rules for scheduling, rules that give greater certainty to workers while maintaining flexibility for employees. We know now that if a shift is cancelled with less than 48 hours’ notice, the employer is required to pay three hours’ wages. It is just about fairness. Workers deserve a degree of certainty, especially when you need those shifts in order to make it through a month.", "It is only fair that we are all able to respond to an illness or to the death of a loved one.", "We have also approached our reform of labour laws with not just fairness in mind, but we’ve approached it with compassion to those who also experience or are threatened with domestic or sexual violence: up to 10 individual days of leave and up to 15 weeks of leave without fear of job loss for employees who have been threatened with or have actually experienced domestic or sexual violence and have been employed for at least 13 weeks with a company. The first five days of leave in each calendar year are paid; the rest are unpaid.", "We modernized the rules around those people who want a fair decision to be made around organizing a union in their workplace. We extended card-based certification, for example, to vulnerable sectors: the home care and community services industry, building services and temporary help agencies.", "This is all about fairness, and it is something that I would hope would enjoy the support of all the House. Ontario’s original fair wage policy was developed in the 1930s. All parties in the House have their fingerprints on it. It was last updated in 1995. I think most members in the House would agree that it is time to update it again and to keep it updated.", "Supporting this bill will allow that to happen. I look for the support of the entire House on this bill." ],

I think I speak for all members of the Legislature when we wish them nothing but the best in whatever the future brings to them outside of this Legislature, and whatever challenges they face as well. I’m sure they will be doing some things that bring new challenges, because most members who leave here want to face something—they want to have an interesting career ahead of them yet, because we are not people who just want to put our feet up. We want to be involved and be part of our communities and be contributing members of those communities. I expect that that’s what the retiring members will be doing, and we look forward to hearing from them and perhaps having them return as visitors in the future—not only retiring members but, I mean, for each and every one of us who is not retiring, this is democracy, and we face an uncertain future as well, Speaker. We don’t know who will be coming back and who won’t be coming back, and I certainly am thankful for the time that I have been here as well.", "I think of my friend Gord Brown in Leeds–Grenville—I guess it is Leeds–Thousand Islands, the new riding. I’m not exactly sure of the name of it, but it’s the riding that has been created as a result of redistribution. I’m sure that this was not the way that he expected his political career to come to a close. But we don’t know. We don’t know the hour or the day. It could happen to any one of us, and certainly my condolences go out to his wife and children and all the family and friends that will be bidding Gord goodbye later this week, and to all his colleagues in the House of Commons, who will miss him as well.", "My father’s career came to an end in a not dissimilar way. He was elected in 1963. In 1987, although he wasn’t seeking re-election, it was, interestingly enough and almost surreal, on the day that Premier Peterson called the election, July 31, 1987—the riding that previously existed, Renfrew South, existed no more as a result of redistribution—my father was not seeking re-election but he died on the same day. You want to talk about a political career that ended in a timely fashion: politically timely; personally, probably not what he was thinking of or hoping for. But, again, as I said with respect to Gord Brown, we know not the hour nor the day.", "I want to say that I’ve cherished my own time here in this Legislature and have been honoured, on four occasions, to be elected by the people of my riding, Renfrew–Nipissing–Pembroke, as many of us have. Many here have been elected more times than four. My colleague here from Timmins–James Bay—what is it? Eight, maybe?" ],

I don’t think it is something that we should take lightly, and I don’t think members here do. But when you look at the numerical equations, when you think of how many other occupations have hundreds of thousands of representatives in the province of Ontario, and we, as elected, are only 107 of us—I know that after June when the Parliament returns, there will be 124, but it is still a very small number and a humbling honour to have bestowed on us.", "Speaker, I want to extend my thanks to my constituents in Renfrew–Nipissing–Pembroke for having sent me here on four occasions and let them know that I will be travelling the riding over the next four weeks trying to convince them that I deserve a fifth trip to the Legislature. We’ll see how that goes on June 7.", "But back to the—I guess not “back” because I haven’t even spoken about the bill. But on Bill 53: We’re here in third reading because this is part of a time allocation motion. In my 15 years here, I don’t think I’ve ever seen a situation where there has been zero committee and 30 minutes of debate—or response; it’s not even debate. I mean, 30 minutes allocated equally between the three parties, which is 10 minutes per caucus, 10 minutes per party, in the Legislature to discuss the third reading of the bill—no committee; therefore, no amendments, not even an opportunity.", "This is the kind of thing that when we go and traverse our riding and we talk about democracy and we talk about how fortunate we are to live in a country like Canada, in a province like Ontario, where this is how we do business, by our peers and our citizens at home deciding who their representative should be and, by virtue of the numerical totals, determining what party would govern in this province—and then we come here and we experience things that look like anything but democracy.", "We are expected to come here to debate legislation that, obviously, the government believes is there to improve the lives of the citizens of this province, and we can have that debate. As opposition, we are compelled to talk about the faults of legislation and to bring forth what we believe is something that the government is doing wrong. We are supposed to be the eagles that are watching the government closely, to ensure that what they’re bringing forward to the people of Ontario has been duly considered.", "Well, how can something be duly considered if you haven’t even had the opportunity to debate it? How can you say that something has been duly considered if you haven’t even allowed the public, the stakeholders—those people who will be most affected by it, those people who will be responsible for carrying it out—the opportunity to offer opinion or views as to how that legislation might be changed, altered, improved, or have some parts of it swept away altogether, because they’re not in the best interests of the people who will be most affected?", "When you have a time allocation motion such as this, that restricts the debate to a minuscule 10 minutes, you really have to ask yourself if the government is acting in the best interests of the people or it is acting in what it considers to be the best interests of itself. Because, you see, it has got itself up against the wall here, as far as timing is concerned. They feel that they need to get this piece of legislation out there because there’s a constituency out there that they want this piece of legislation passed for. They feel that it is a good piece of legislation, to go to that group and say, “Look at what we’re doing; look at what we’ve done. We need your support to get us back in there, so we can make sure that this legislation is enacted in the way that is in your best interests.”", "But if you are not considering the views of others, if you’re not considering the right of the opposition to bring a different view that might make that legislation stronger, then you are not acting in the best interests of democracy.", "Democracy will be tested on June 7. I trust the people of Ontario." ],

  "text" : [ "I’m glad to have at least 10 minutes to speak on this bill. I did have a few minutes, I think, at second reading. But, unfortunately, the government chose not to have any committee hearings and not to allow for any presentations by any of the interested parties.", "Every time that I got up and spoke in this House most recently—because everything has been time-allocated; I think 75% of the Liberals’ bills have been time-allocated—there are about 50 of us over on this side of the Legislature, who are elected by the people in our ridings to do the work of this Legislature. When we don’t have the opportunity to weigh in on bills and hear presentations from our stakeholders—and we often have different stakeholders, depending on the bill—that is not democracy in the making.", "I heard the Minister of Labour quote the Premier, when he had his 10 minutes, saying that “we are standing up for workers” in an ever-changing economy. “Workers deserve to be treated fairly.” Well, Andrea Horwath and New Democrats who are here with me today and, of course, all of our caucus, believe that all workers—every worker—should be treated fairly. Every worker should have access to the Employment Standards Act, to the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act and to the Occupational Health and Safety Act. But that isn’t the case in the province of Ontario.", "As you heard today, we had the youth justice workers here from Arrell, I believe the name of the facility is, in Hamilton. These are workers who do the same job in a youth centre that was privatized by the Tories, with continued privatization by the Liberals. They do not have access to worker safety and insurance.", "Then, in the same breath, we are unveiling a monument today for correctional workers and probation and parole workers who were killed in the line of duty—19 of them, over, I think, about 140 years. These same youth justice workers have no access to worker safety and insurance. That is really shameful. Somebody needs to be doing something about that, and I think Andrea Horwath and New Democrats will do something about that after June 7.", "The Minister of Labour talked about all of the things that they did during their time. But unfortunately, all of those things were done in the last year leading to an election. Imagine if some of those bills had been passed over the 15 years that they have been in power: equal pay, the minimum wage, the pay transparency bill, the fair wage bill, and Bill 148, which provided some improvements to employment standards and to the Ontario Labour Relations Board. People had to wait 15 years to get that tabled because the Liberals wanted to use all of that to try and woo their stakeholders to vote for them in this upcoming election.", "Most of them were just half measures, Speaker; they were not whole measures. If the Liberals really wanted to represent fairness for workers in this province, they would have put in card-check certification for every worker in this province, because we all know that the ticket to a middle-class economy is by joining a union and having a voice and having a collective agreement, with hours of work and pay and benefits that you can count on.", "Precarity of work is on the rise. Since 2000, I think there’s been a 30% increase in part-time, temporary work. Precarity can be an hourly wage. It can be that you have a high wage but you’re not getting enough hours, like we hear so often in colleges and universities.", "We even hear it sometimes in the hospital sector. Today, we heard from the Ontario Nurses’ Association and the Registered Nurses’ Association of Ontario. Here’s a place where occupational health and safety—the health sector has the second-highest injuries in this province, yet the government has done nothing about ensuring that the 10,000 vacancies in hospitals across this province are actually filled, which would greatly reduce the number of violent incidents that front-line health care workers have to endure day in and day out. That is just in the hospital sector, let alone the lack of registered staff and front-line workers in our long-term-care facilities and in our community sector as well.", "The fair wage policy—just to spend a couple of minutes on that—is only really talking about wages. For more than 15 years, there has been no update to the wage schedules. When we met with ministry staff, they told us that the last time they updated the wage schedules, it took two years to actually accomplish. So this piece of legislation is really going to do nothing immediately, unless the Liberals find some whippersnapper of a worker and get them out there reviewing those wage schedules so that they can move along with this.", "If we’d had an opportunity to talk to the stakeholders—I’ve got a couple of reports here from the Workers’ Action Centre and from the Ontario Federation of Labour, who represent more than one million workers from all regions in the province. They say that this doesn’t go anywhere far enough to address the issues that need to be addressed for workers in this province, and that it’s far too narrow in scope as to who it covers. I think the member from Windsor–Tecumseh talked about that briefly last week, that in fact it doesn’t even include food services in provincial buildings, where government agencies are contracting food service workers and they’re not included in this legislation.", "The report that went to the government was in 2008, but it took 11 years for it to actually get here, and now we have a watered-down piece of legislation. The stakeholders that I heard from—and I’m sure that the government heard from those people as well—wanted it to be expanded to include the broader public sector, the MUSH sector—municipalities, universities, schools and hospitals. It would also cover organizations receiving more than $1 million in funds.", "The policy shouldn’t just include wages; it should include hours of work, and being paid on a timely and consistent basis, because we’ve seen, in this sector, contract flipping. These workers, who they call either dependent contractors or independent contractors—it happens in both cases—many times are not even getting paid when these contracts flip.", "There should be limits on the use of temp agencies and on temporary foreign workers, as well, in these wage policies. Under Andrea Horwath and the New Democrats’ amendments to Bill 148 and in our platform, we would limit the use of temporary workers to three months and to no more than 20% of the workforce.", "The coverage of building services is limited. It should be expanded.", "Translation services used to be covered but now, today, under the Liberal government, they are not covered. So you have many people in that sector of workers who actually do not fall under the fair wage policy.", "There should also be penalties for violations. We are not seeing any of that in the legislation, unless, I guess, that will fall to regulation.", "Workers should be able to make complaints through a third party, because many times workers are very fearful of complaining for fear of losing their job. They’re already in precarious work—they’re already temporary or perhaps casual or contract—and they’re afraid to make a complaint and then find themselves without a job.", "In my last minute here, I just think that the Liberal government could have done a lot more for all workers during this period of time. They could have wasted a lot less money in their 15 years on things like Presto cards; smart meters; the provincial retirement pension plan, where they wasted $700 million; gas plant cancellations; Ornge air ambulance—to name a few. A lot of that funding actually could have been used to provide the public services that people rely on in this province.", "In my last 12 seconds—it will probably be the last time that I am on my feet, as well; I’ve already done my swan song—to those of you who are retiring or going on to other careers, or who are staying, are re-elected or are defeated, I wish you well in your future lives." ],

  "text" : [ "I’m pleased to rise today for third reading of Bill 31, the Plan for Care and Opportunity Act (Budget Measures).", "The 2018 budget lays out our plan to continue to grow the economy of Ontario and to continue to be world leaders in economic growth. We are world leaders thanks to the hard work of the people of this province. Thanks to them, Ontario’s economy has grown more than Canada’s and all of the G7 countries’ since 2014. As a result of this economic growth. Our unemployment rate is the lowest it has been in almost two decades. Last year alone, 500 net new jobs were created each and every single day in Ontario. The majority are full-time and in the private sector. Our debt-to-GDP has fallen steadily, lowering a burden that would otherwise be passed on to future generations.", "This economic growth was achieved while building up the programs and services that Ontario families rely on. We boosted investments in health care at near record levels, such as providing all children and youth under the age of 25 with free prescription medicine under our OHIP+ program. Since January 1 of this year, over one million children and youth have already filled about 4.2 million prescriptions at no cost.", "We invested in higher education. It has been critically important, because building the economy of the future means we need to be the best-prepared and highest-trained workforce.", "By revamping OSAP, we are making admittance to post-secondary education based upon your ability to learn, not just your ability to pay. This year, over 235,000 are attending universities and colleges across Ontario for free, with an additional 175,000 students receiving generous grants and loans to cover expenses, from Cambrian College in the north to the University of Windsor in the southwest, from Queen’s University in the east to Sheridan College in central Ontario.", "On top of that, we committed to making investments of $230 billion over 14 years in hospitals, schools, public transit and highways. It is the largest infrastructure investment in our province’s history. Over the next 10 years of investment, it is expected to support about 140,000 net new jobs, on average, per year, driving strong economic growth.", "We created a business climate where Ontario’s businesses can compete and win, maintaining a competitive tax rate for businesses. Our corporate income tax rate is very competitive with neighbouring US states. In fact, we cut the small business corporate income tax rate by 22%, from 4.5% to 3.5%. We provided supports to help small businesses grow, scale up and access export opportunities.", "We accomplished all of this while being disciplined in our spending. We invested in key priorities and eliminated waste and programs that no longer offered an adequate return. Ontario spends less per capita on programs than any other province in Canada. In short, we made strategic investments to create growth in our economy, which ultimately benefits the people of Ontario.", "But while we’re proud of this economic growth, we cannot rest on our laurels, because in this rapidly changing world, new challenges now face us. While our growth is strong relative to neighbouring economies, we estimate it will be around 2% next year and thereafter—being more cautious, than, in fact, independent economists, and to be reasonable in our growth assumptions, as has been reaffirmed by the auditor and the FAO.", "To continue to make strides in improving the lives of all Ontarians, we know we must do better to overcome new challenges, which include an aging population, moving more people out of work and into retirement; the prospect of rising interest rates, in light of higher household debt; and Buy American campaigns and other protectionist measures from our largest trading partner.", "Additionally, we recognize that the benefits of our province’s recent prosperity have not reached enough people. We are running on all cylinders and are at full capacity, and yet there are families still in need and, in some regions, lagging behind. We cannot afford to leave others behind. We must work to ensure opportunity reaches everyone: women, students, seniors and young people looking to establish their careers and start a family. We must ensure that the benefits of a growing economy are shared by them too.", "When I travelled throughout this province conducting pre-budget consultations, the people across Ontario were clear in what they wanted to see in the 2018 budget. They wanted our government to continue to manage government finances effectively, and they asked us to also help families manage the burden of their everyday costs so that they, too, can get ahead.", "That is what the 2018 Ontario budget is all about, Mr. Speaker. It’s about recommitting Ontario to continue to diversify our economy and grow our GDP. It is about ensuring more job opportunities, to ensure that these benefits are more widely shared across the province. It is about enabling Ontario to remain competitive, to continue to be a top destination for business investment.", "It is about protecting our environment in a way that is economically sustainable as well. It’s why we chose to join the Western Climate Initiative with Quebec and California in a cap-and-trade wholesale arrangement, as opposed to a more expensive carbon price alternative. Our program also builds on the new green economy, enabling us to have greater success.", "Let me touch upon a few of the investments we are proposing in the 2018 budget, Mr. Speaker.", "We are proposing to provide universal preschool for children aged two and a half and older until they are eligible for kindergarten. This measure would save families about $17,000, on average, for each child. More importantly, early learning has been demonstrated to improve children’s academic performance throughout their lives.", "These investments not only give our kids the best start in life, but they will also provide parents with a choice: a choice to return to work earlier, further strengthening our economy.", "Furthermore, research suggests that about one in four working-age Ontarians does not have extended health benefits. About 60% of seniors do not have a plan that covers dental services.", "That’s why, in this budget, we are proposing a new Ontario drug and dental program. This applies to those without workplace health benefits or who are not covered by other plans. This program would reimburse 80% of eligible prescription drugs and dental expenses each year, to a maximum of $400 for every single person, $600 for couples and $700 for a family of four with two children.", "Ontarians are proud of our health care, but demographics are changing rapidly. We have a growing population, and it is putting demands on our hospitals. That’s why our government is proposing an additional $822-million investment in 2018-19, as well as investing approximately $19 billion over 10 years to build new and renovate more hospitals.", "These investments would provide better access to care, reduce wait times, address capacity issues and better meet the needs of Ontario’s growing and aging population.", "One in three Ontarians over the age of 15 will struggle with mental health or substance abuse challenges. We want them to get the quality of care and supports they need as well. That’s why, in this budget, we made commitments to invest more than $17 billion in mental health and addictions services over the next four years. These investments would build a stronger mental health system by making it easier for up to 350,000 people with mild to moderate anxiety and depression to get psychotherapy; by giving every Ontario high school access to mental health support within the next two years; and by adding 525 more supportive housing units for people with complex mental health and addictions needs.", "In total, our budget commits a historic investment of an additional $2.1 billion over the next four years, creating an integrated, high-quality mental health and addictions system for people of all ages.", "The population of seniors in our province is expected to grow from 2.4 million people today to 4.5 million by 2040.", "Seniors have unique needs and, along with their families, many struggle with added costs related to maintaining appropriate health care and their well-being. That’s why this budget proposes a number of new initiatives to help Ontario seniors live healthy, independent and active lives.", "We are proposing to extend OHIP+ to make prescriptions completely free for everyone 65 and over as well. That would ensure that no senior citizen will ever need to go without those necessary drugs.", "By eliminating the Ontario Drug Benefit annual deductible and copay, this would save the average Ontario senior about $240 per year.", "The 2018 budget also proposes to establish the Seniors’ Healthy Home Program. We recognize that many seniors want to stay in their homes as long as possible. They deserve our help. We’re proposing a benefit of up to $750 annually for eligible households led by seniors who are 75 years old or over to offset the cost of maintenance in their homes.", "For those seniors requiring long-term care, we’re creating 30,000 new long-term-care beds over the next 10 years, with 5,000 new beds by 2022. These new beds will help those who can no longer live independently and provide peace of mind for families who care for them. These new beds are in addition to the 30,000 existing beds being redeveloped now.", "These are just some of the new initiatives we are taking in the 2018 Ontario budget, Mr. Speaker.", "I’ve had the privilege of preparing and delivering six budgets now—well, seven, if you count the 2014 budget, which I had the privilege of delivering twice. It has been an honour. It has been a real privilege.", "This 2018 budget is a budget that reflects the values that we share as people who live and work together in our province. It’s a budget that builds upon our province’s economic successes, a budget that provides more opportunities so that all in our province may get ahead. It’s a budget for care and opportunity.", "I would also like to add my appreciation for the participation of all members in this House. It has been an honour working alongside all of you. I wish to express, especially to those who have chosen not to run and to now retire, my personal thanks for their extraordinary contribution, not only to their communities but to the province of Ontario, for having taken the time to commit to this civic duty and, more importantly, to the public good. So few of us ever have the opportunity and the privilege to represent our communities and our great province, especially, so I thank you all for doing so.", "The decisions and the actions that we take do have a profound impact on our society and our economy. This budget, like all the others that I’ve had the privilege of being part of, does have a profound impact, and it goes far behind election cycles. The work that all of you do in this House—as do you, Mr. Speaker—has a tremendous impact for our future generations. I just want to congratulate everyone and all my colleagues for the work they do in this regard, especially my parliamentary assistant, Yvan Baker, who will also be adding his comments to this debate today. We all do our part, and you are all to be congratulated." ],

I’ve spoken on Bill 31, this budget bill: an hour the first time, an hour the second time. I’ve spoken quite a bit about this, but I’ve got to tell you, Speaker, that was quite a handful we received from the minister.", "I’m going to talk for a moment about page 103 of Focus on Finance 5, the latest book that’s out, because I speak about the minister on page 103.", "The book, by the way, Speaker, went online today at fedeli.com. You’re free to upload it or download—whatever suits you. For those who enjoy the actual hard copy, they’re here as well. You will find it in the library; all five books are in the library.", "But why I bring this one here up is because of what the Minister of Finance just had to say. I’m telling you, I was walking in and I’m spinning, shaking my head, thinking that he obviously has not actually read this budget, because it absolute refutes what he said a moment ago. It refutes, quite frankly, what he said on TVOntario.", "The night of the budget, the opposition critics meet at TVOntario. We sit and kibitz for a minute and we watch the finance minister, who is being taped across the street. This time he had a dilly. He said, right off the hopper—and I’m quoting now—that he has “slayed the deficit.” I’m going to refer to the budget in a moment. Then he said they have “balanced the books.” Then he said, “We’re projecting 140,000 new jobs every year.” Then he said, “We are the top in foreign direct investment,” the top destination, and, “Our debt-to-GDP remains the same and will be tapering down.” Speaker, I’ve got to tell you, that’s quite a speech that was given on TVOntario by the finance minister because, quite frankly, none of it is accurate whatsoever.", "I will ask you: How can the budget deficit be “slayed” when the budget reveals deficits for the next six years? The deficits that they say and the deficit that our legislative officers say are quite different, but I’ll get to that shortly. Nonetheless, he himself is forecasting a deficit for years to come, but somehow he has “slayed” the deficit. So we know that that is just wrong.", "Then he said that the books are balanced—except they’re artificially balanced by using the reserves and by using the one-time sale of assets. Again, that statement is refuted by the Financial Accountability Officer. I’m going to deal with that in a few minutes, but I just wanted to talk about his first two comments that are absolutely nonsense, Speaker.", "Let’s get into the more serious numbers that he’s talking about now. He says that the actual job creation numbers will be 140,000 per year. I just heard him. He just said, minutes ago—he doubled down. He said they are going to create 140,000 new jobs, on average, per year. Speaker, we just heard him say that here, and he said that on TVOntario.", "I will refer him to the Liberals’ budget, page 193, when it talks about the declining jobs, not the 140,000, on average, per year that the minister just claimed. We are talking here about 121,000 budgeted in 2018, down to 77,000, down to 66,000, down to 62,000. His own document refutes what he just stood in front of this Legislature and told us. Who are we to believe—the earlier version or today’s version; the version that we see in print here or the version that the minister claimed on TVOntario? Are we to believe the version that’s in the book, the minister’s, or the Auditor General and the FAO? I’ll tell you, I will always side with the Auditor General of Ontario and the Financial Accountability Officer of Ontario.", "It gets better, Speaker. It’s not just the 121,000, down to 77,000, down to 62,000 in jobs that the minister spoke incorrectly about; he also said we are the top foreign direct investment destination. Well, that’s not true; that’s simply not true. At one time, before this government took office, we may well have been—and several years ago, we were number one. No question about that. But we’ve now fallen to third. We are the third foreign direct investment destination in North America; we’re not the top like the minister just said. He just said that. How can anyone trust a word that this government says ever again when right here, just minutes ago, we heard the minister?", "Then he doubled down on another inaccuracy, because he said our debt-to-GDP remains the same and will be tapering down. On what planet? On what planet is that true? Because it’s not on planet Earth, Speaker. I can tell you, we are the highest indebted subnational on the entire planet Earth. That’s where we are. We certainly do not have a debt-to-GDP that is falling. In fact, he says it’s falling—or he says it remains the same and will be tapering down. But just today, earlier, he doubled down. He exaggerated it further. He said our debt-to-GDP was falling. Again, Speaker, here we are. In the budget document, you will read that it is not falling, as he just said; it is not the same, as he said on TVO; it’s actually increasing. So here we are. Our debt-to-GDP was up by half a per cent, from 37.1% to 37.6%, and it’s not—what were his words?—“tapering down.” It’s in fact going up. Every year, it’s expected to rise: 38.2% and 38.6% the year after. That’s if you believe the government’s numbers and the book.", "So I don’t know how the minister can stand here and just tell us with a straight face that it is falling. I wrote his words down as I was walking in—“falling.” I thought, “Wow, what the heck happened between the day that he printed this budget and the day the FAO said we’re not falling?” We’re going to hit over 40%, if you look at the Financial Accountability Officer’s number. I’ll get into that a moment.", "Then he said, “But we are not going to rest on our laurels.” Well, good gracious, I hope not. We’re a disaster, Speaker. We’re an absolute embarrassment on the world stage—the highest indebted subnational on the planet. Look at us. We used to be number one in a lot of things. We used to be number one in foreign direct investment. We’ve fallen—not what the minister said. We used to be the number one mining jurisdiction in the world. Today we’re 23rd. This is unbelievable. It’s no wonder why there is such concern in the mining sector.", "I can tell you, Speaker, that I was worried. After reading the budget, I was thinking, “Wow, is it just us? Are we this concerned with this nonsense that we’re reading in the budget?” But I will tell you that the Toronto Star agrees with us. Their editorial right after the budget was entitled, “Ontario Liberals’ Ambitious Budget May Be Too Much for Voters to Swallow. ...so much at such a ... cost will strain the credulity of voters, who may well wonder why the Liberals didn’t do more during their 15 years in office.”", "They go on to discuss the importance of the many ambitious programs. They deduced that “these aren’t announcements from a government with a clear path to turning them into reality.” What they’re trying to say is that the nonsense that the government is saying—none of that is ever going to happen. They’re not going to turn into reality. If you ever wanted to know whether that was accurate or not, just pick up the bill we’re debating today. We’re debating Bill 31.", "The Premier talked about a lot of things that end in “care”: health care, senior care and dental care. They don’t care. They don’t care, Speaker. The only thing they care about is getting re-elected, and the proof of that is in Bill 31, where none of that is actually brought in the bill. But what I can tell you is that in the bill are all the taxes; that they care about. They care about digging deeper into your pocket. They’re going to dig $2 billion more in taxes out of people’s pockets—1.8 million people in Ontario are going to pay more in personal income taxes. Tens of thousands of businesses are going to pay more in business taxes. In fact, there are 20,000 who will be paying $2,400 a year more in the employee health tax. To add it all up, we’re at $2 billion over the next three years in brand new taxes. They cared enough to put those in the budget. That’s what they cared about, Speaker.", "They also cared about their assault on small business. We’ve talked about this many times in the Legislature. There is absolute assault by the Liberal government on small business. The latest is interestingly enough called the Revenue Integrity Act. We’re going to be voting on that tomorrow. I’ll be looking at the Liberals as they vote to impugn small business even more.", "“Every person carrying on a prescribed business in Ontario shall”—and by “prescribed business,” they told us that they’re talking about matching the federal guidelines, so businesses with $30,000 in revenue or more that pay HST. The new subsection 2(1) would require these businesses to record all “sales transaction information in an electrical cash register that meets prescribed requirements” and to transmit the sales information “to the minister within the prescribed time and manner and ... form.” So what they’re saying is, “If you’re a hairdresser running a small business at home, we don’t trust you to be sending us your tax cheques. We want you to spend $3,000”—that’s the number we got from the Ontario Convenience Stores Association. “We want you to buy a $3,000 cash register that has software built in so that we can monitor your business. We want to know your traffic. We want to know your sales. We want to know your taxes.” That is what they’re doing.", "We’re going to be voting on this tomorrow. In fact, they double down and they tell you, under inspections and examinations, that if you have a small business in your home and if the Liberals suspect that you’re not using a cash register, expect them to go and get a warrant to enter your home. That’s what they say here. They say, “Entry with a warrant ... except under the authority of a warrant issued under subsection (2).” They will go get a warrant when they think Debbie the hairdresser, my hairdresser, is not using an electronic cash register that’s linked to the minister and reporting her taxes in the prescribed time, manner and form. I told Debbie about that when she cut my hair on Friday and I thought she was going to pass out. It’s unbelievable what they’re going to be doing to small business.", "If you don’t do this, Speaker, they have the right to fine you $10,000. That’s what they put here in schedule 30, the Revenue Integrity Act. That’s what they’re about to do to small business. That’s part of them impugning small business, saying, “We don’t trust you. We don’t trust any of you. We don’t believe you. We’re going to monitor your business for you and we’re going to take our fair share.” That’s what this act is about.", "As I look here, I see so many of them who have never been in small business before. They don’t understand. I can almost forgive them for not understanding because they’ve never had to write a paycheque. They’ve never had a banker phone them at 7:30 on a Friday morning and say, “Vic, how are you going to make your payroll today?” I’ve had that. I’ve been an entrepreneur all my life. I know exactly what that phone call is all about and I know exactly what this is going to do to small business—and so do they, quite frankly; so do they. You have to appreciate that they’re going to continue to put their hands in the pockets of families and small business. We saw that in this bill.", "I’ll carry on with the Toronto Star, because I know how much they enjoyed reading these passages.

They prepared a sobering budget report entitled Deficits by Choice. It’s interesting, because this ties in a lot to what the Auditor General and primarily what the Financial Accountability Office just told us. This is by choice. This government has told us that they are going to run a $6.7-billion deficit by choice. Well, that is absolutely wrong. That is absolutely not true in two aspects. Number one, the Financial Accountability Officer said, “No, that’s not true. It’s not a $6.7-billion deficit this year. First of all, it’s $12 billion, but of the $6.7 billion the Liberals are talking about, $3 billion is already a deficit.”", "This was carried over. They never did balance. They had a $3-billion deficit. The other $3.7 billion is on these shallow and hollow promises the Liberals have made. It was interesting to know that this cumulative deficit of $20.3 billion is going to take three years, but it’s eerily close to the $19.8 billion that is the actual deficit. This is all nonsense. They’re making all of this up.", "What the RBC said: “What is worrying about this plan is ... most of the measures ... are recurring entitlements.” That means we’re going to be paying for these for the rest of time. “It makes the ... choice fraught with risk.” That’s according to the Royal Bank. So while the government offers a return to balance in seven years, they also say, “There are no details on how they will achieve it. This is concerning since so much spending kicks in late in the fiscal plan.”", "That’s what the Financial Accountability Officer told us. They’ve made all of that up. There is a deficit today, right now. They made all of that up.", "They also said, “If Ontario is running large deficits when the economy is performing at capacity, what happens if a recession comes along? A pre-existing deficit and an elevated debt burden will limit the government’s ability to respond and virtually guarantee a rapidly deteriorating fiscal situation.” That’s from the Royal Bank.", "Let’s hear something from somebody just a little closer to home. We are going to hear from our Auditor General, because she had some blistering comments to make about this government and the stories that they have told the people of Ontario year after year. Right after her introduction and the niceties—hello; who I am; what I’m doing here—her first sentence: “After a thorough analysis, we have determined that the pre-election report” from the Liberals “is not a reasonable presentation of Ontario’s finances.” Boy, you don’t get clearer than that, Speaker. She said, “We say this because”—this is our Auditor; this is the Auditor General of Ontario saying this—“it dramatically understates the expense estimates for two major items.”", "She’s telling us that the budget is 75% off this year, 85% off next year, and 100% off the year after. My heavens, when you have Minister Sousa saying, “We’re not going to rest on our laurels”—we don’t want you to rest on those laurels. Being off by 75% is not something you should proud of; being off by 85% the following year is not something you should be bragging about; and certainly being 100% wrong in year 3 is nothing I want to hear them crowing about, Speaker, I can tell you that right now.", "She also said several words that I want to—actually, I’m not sure that I can read those in the Legislature. I just realized that now. Not one of them is parliamentary. I don’t think that I would actually get away with reading them. I urge people to download the Auditor General’s report and read these words, and I urge people to download the Financial Accountability Officer’s report and read the words. They, unfortunately, cannot be repeated in this Legislature. They are that unparliamentary and that damning to the government. I did read them on the day that the auditor gave us these comments, and I was ruled unparliamentary. So I won’t be taxing the Speaker today." ],

Both stretched the credulity of the numbers. She said that it appears that there’s money when there isn’t—that’s our auditor. She is offering that she may give an adverse opinion.

This is the auditor telling us that you’ve “made a payment and didn’t record the cheques.” Those are her exact words. She said, “How can they do this? They legislated that those expense payments, those cheques they wrote, are an asset.” That’s her quote. They legislated that those expense payments are an asset. So instead of going to the “paid bill” column, it goes to the “money in the bank” column. That’s how she explained that to us: Instead of being a paid bill, it’s money in the bank. “How can a bill that you’ve paid be cash?” That’s what she said. When does a debt become an asset?

It allows $366 million to be charged to the greenhouse gas reduction account for reimbursement of expenditures made between November 1, 2015, and March 31, 2017.", "I have to say that I find this a very concerning item. I don’t know what’s going to be allocated here. I don’t know whether, in fact, these funds are going to be used to fight climate change or not. My understanding, when cap-and-trade came in, was that the money that we were raising was to allow us to go forward—not to reimburse old programs; not to deal with projects that had been set up, expensed, committed to, but to actually try and get us to move forward so that we would meet our climate change targets.", "I think that people, rightly, can be very skeptical about this item. There is no itemized list anywhere. We don’t know exactly what these funds are going to be used for. If they’re not being used to meet our climate targets, then there are profound questions. Even as is, this government’s climate plans don’t show us meeting the targets for reducing emissions from Ontario—a very substantial matter.

Recently, I think it was the trial lawyers association talking about the huge amount of money that flowed into the hands of the auto insurance companies—money that could have been used to reduce rates.", "Speaker, I was here—I think it was the 2015 budget—when this government dramatically reduced the amount of money that was payable to those who had been in catastrophic accidents.

His life would be far more difficult than it was. Frankly, when you have lost most of the control of your body, that is a pretty rough life. But to condemn people to a situation where, most of their waking hours, they are bedridden doesn’t strike me as responsible.", "I think that people should be extraordinarily cautious about this Liberal budget. Their record on not delivering on promises with regard to auto insurance, and then cutting back catastrophic coverage, speaks ill of what is going to happen here.", "Many have noticed that as the polls have become poorer and poorer for the Liberals, they swing more and more to the left. In fact, the Minister of Finance was talking earlier about the wonderful things that he is doing. He talked about the pharmacare plan; as some have said, it’s not quite worth the napkin it was written on. He saw what we brought forward, making sure that there was universal pharmacare, that everyone was covered. I was very glad that there was coverage for people under 25; it’s a good thing. There just needs to be coverage for everyone.", "I was going door to door last year, Speaker, talking to people about pharmacare and the need for universal pharmacare. I talked to people who use insulin, who have diabetes. They were telling me that it was costing them about $800 a month for all their supplies and medications. The amount that the minister was talking about—what was it, $700 a year, somewhere in there?" ],

I had seen these polling numbers, with some people liking it but a lot of people having even greater negative feeling toward the Liberals, based on that budget. I hadn’t talked to many people. I was asking Tony, while he was clipping away, “So, what do you think of this budget?” He said, “Man, everything but a pony for every child.”", "It raised the cynicism to new levels: the air of, the appearance of, the reality of desperation on the part of a government trying to promise whatever it could, to save itself. We have a government at the end of its term—likely at the end of its period in this Legislature—on that side of the chamber, trying to do whatever it can to grab straws as it slips over the cliff.", "We saw similar things with rent control. In April 2017, roughly, I brought in a bill to change that old rule that said that buildings built after 1991 would be exempt from rent control. We saw huge coverage in the papers about people who were being driven out of their units, out of their homes, with giant rent increases. So I brought in a bill. I don’t think it was five or six days later that the Minister of Housing brought forward a bill replicating everything I’d brought forward. I then understood that a lot of really useful polling had taken place. Someone had determined that this was a huge vulnerability for the government, and they were acting." ],

Clearly, that was just a test balloon, to see how much they could blow to save seats.", "When you’re talking $40 billion, you’re talking serious change. You’re a talking a real, real hit to the provincial treasury, and a burden that people will be carrying for decades to come. It’s extraordinary to me that not only did they do that, but that they put the funds in an account set up as a fiction that they could call an “asset.”", "For those of you who have time late at night, when you’re trying to get to sleep and you just don’t know what to do, there is a really good documentary on YouTube called The Smartest Guys in the Room. It’s all about Enron and their adventures in accounting. I think that those who support the “fair hydro plan” would be well served to watch that documentary. I have to say to you, Speaker, that Enron grew, drew in investor dollars and was able to become extraordinarily wealthy, before they crashed and burned, by setting up exactly these kinds of special-purpose asset accounts that were not assets. We don’t have an asset here. We have a big hole in the books, and we are going to be asked to fill it.", "On top of all that, going into debt to make the bills look good for few years is bad enough, but because they’ve set up this special account, we’re having to pay higher interest rates than we otherwise would have been, just borrowing the money straight out—$4 billion wasted, just to make the books look good for the Liberals in advance of an election. It is no wonder that they’re in trouble. It is no wonder that people are cynical about them. They should be, because when you behave like that, when you throw away tens of billions of dollars and damage the province’s finances, people should be cynical about you. They should be cynical about you.", "One of the things that’s been interesting to me is that the Liberals and Tories tell the truth about each other on a regular basis. The Tories have been saying they will cut $6 billion over the next few years to make all their plans work, and the Liberals rightly say, “Those aren’t efficiencies; that’s just cost-cutting. That’s brutal stuff,” and they’re right. Strangely enough, they’re right.", "What should be said on the other side—and this came out with the Financial Accountability Officer—is that billions of dollars in austerity are buried in the projections the Liberals have in their budget, only they don’t call it austerity or cuts; it’s “efficiencies” as well. They’re both saying that one or the other would be the worst government ever, and they’re both right. It’s a tough fight, but they’re both right. I can’t help but note that.", "The Liberals are having real trouble with their finances, and part of it is that they have run out of stuff to sell—I mean, not entirely run out. They sold Hydro One; that was a chunk of cash. It helped make the books look better. For those who may have followed my question this morning, which the Minister of Economic Development avoided studiously, there was this idea that the government of Ontario’s GO regional express rail is going to be turned over for 30 years to a private company.

Over the past four years, since being elected to the Legislature, I have had the opportunity to work first as parliamentary assistant to Minister Matthews at the Treasury Board, and then to Mr. Sousa in finance. I have to say I’ve been proud to work with both of them and with many other colleagues to make sure that we are planning for the future in Ontario, that we are facilitating opportunity for people, that we are providing supports for people, that we are delivering services that people rely on and care about that make a difference every day in people’s lives.", "I’ve been proud to be able to bring my background to this work, as someone who comes from the world of business and finance, to help make sure that we’re making those expenditures wisely, that we’re getting the best bang for the buck, the best value for money for people, and that we’re also planning for our fiscal future.", "I just wanted to take this opportunity, as it will be probably the last before this term is over, for me to say what a privilege it has been to work with both of them, with Minister Sousa most recently, and with all my colleagues on this side, not just on this budget but on legislation that we have passed in this Legislature that has really made a difference for the people of Ontario and for the people in my community, in Etobicoke Centre.", "Speaker, I have some prepared remarks that I’ve pulled together and I look forward to sharing those with you, but I can’t help but take this opportunity to respond to what I just heard from the members opposite, especially the leader of the official opposition.

I think it’s important, for the record and for the people watching at home, that I clarify some of those points and refute some of those points.", "At one point he said to the members opposite here that they’ve never been in small business: “The folks over there have never been in small business.” He actually said that that’s why people on this side were reaching into the pockets of taxpayers. Aside from that characterization of my colleagues and myself, which I resent, it’s actually highly inaccurate to say that members on this side have never been in small business.

I have two business degrees. I taught at the business school at York University. I had my own consulting practice. I worked for a management consulting firm called the Boston Consulting Group. I know a lot about finance and I know a lot about these issues, so I resent the member opposite suggesting that the members on this side are not competent or qualified to be making the decisions that we are. Quite the contrary.", "The thing that I would say as well is—there were a number of points that he made. First of all, he tried to suggest on a number of occasions that the Minister of Finance wasn’t telling the truth. He said that the Minister of Finance talked about how we are number one in foreign direct investment. We are number one in Canada in foreign direct investment. Even if you compare us, we are number three in North America in foreign direct investment. The only jurisdictions that receive more foreign direct investment than the province of Ontario are the states of New York and California, both of which have much larger populations than Ontario. On a per capita basis or on a per population basis, we’re performing better than California and better than New York.", "We’re definitely number one in Canada, and we should take pride in that. We should take pride in being number three in North America, given our population base. That speaks to the fact that this is a province that is one that investors want to do business in; that we’re a jurisdiction where we have a competitive advantage over others. I think that says a lot about the people of Ontario and the opportunities ahead for people in Ontario and businesses in Ontario.", "He talked about how—and this is not just the Leader of the Opposition; this is members of the opposition. In committee the other day, I heard a member talking about—and these are the member opposite’s words—how Ontarians are now paying $2 billion more in taxes. Those were his words just now. He’s trying to suggest that this is because we have raised taxes. The reality is that as the economy grows, tax revenue increases. That’s the case under this government, it was the case under the NDP government and it was the case under the Conservative government.", "In fact, what’s interesting, Speaker, is two points: One is that this is not happening because we raised taxes; this is happening because of economic growth. But more importantly, if he wants to talk about the people of Ontario paying more taxes year over year, the Harris Tories presided over Ontario for eight years and during that time they had record economic growth. We had global record economic growth and the Tories were in power at that time. Taxes would have risen under them more than under any other government in Ontario’s history.

He himself isn’t telling the truth, and I think that’s wrong and needs to be corrected.", "Then the Leader of the Opposition went on to talk about the Auditor General, and he talked about accounting. Speaker, I would suggest to him that perhaps he thought he was talking, as he said earlier, to a group of people who don’t know very much about business and so they’re not able to see through the weakness of his arguments. But his arguments were incredibly weak. He used language that was completely unparliamentary, Speaker, around jail bars and other unparliamentary language, and I think he should be ashamed of that.

So when he is impugning the credibility of the accounting practices of this government, he is impugning the credibility of every single civil servant in the Ministry of Finance and in the Treasury Board and anybody else who worked on this budget. I think he should be ashamed, because those people are upstanding folks who do the best they can to report on the finances of the province of Ontario.", "In addition to that, he talked about how we’ve reported two issues that the Auditor General alluded to. One was the numbers on the pension—how we account for pension contributions. For years, this government has been declaring those contributions as an asset and amortizing them, as is common in accounting, year after year, as those benefits out of those pension funds are paid out. In fact, this Auditor General signed off on that approach to the accounting year after year after year after year.", "Last year, the Auditor General had a change of heart, and suddenly now the accounting practices that had been put in place are no longer, in the Auditor General’s view, the appropriate ones. But I can tell you, Speaker, that what we did was, the President of the Treasury Board at the time brought in an independent panel of the leading experts in the country on public sector accounting. It was an independent panel, and the President of the Treasury Board agreed to accept the ruling, the advice, of that independent panel. What did that independent panel say? That independent panel of leading public sector accountants and auditors said the government of Ontario had it right; the public servants who prepared the books had it right; the President of the Treasury Board and the Minister of Finance had it right. So we accepted that.", "What’s interesting is that the member opposite talks about Doug Ford, and he talks about how Doug Ford is going to bring in an independent panel to review the province’s finances, to review the accounting, and yet he won’t accept the advice of the independent panel that we brought in last year to look at how we account for the pension assets. How convenient. When you don’t agree with the independent panel, you impugn its credibility and the government’s credibility and the civil servants’ credibility. But when you need a different outcome, then you find a different independent panel to serve your interests. I think that says a lot about the Leader of the Opposition’s approach and, frankly, Doug Ford’s approach to how he would manage if he were Premier of this province.", "One of the issues on the accounting side, with reference to the Auditor General, that the member opposite spoke to was the accounting around hydro. I would like to read to you a passage from a Globe and Mail article—from today’s Globe and Mail, I believe—written by Jatin Nathwani. He’s a professor and Ontario research chair in public policy for sustainable energy at the University of Waterloo. I’m reading to you an excerpt. The author writes:", "“If we stick to a principled approach to the recovery of the costs from the users of electricity, then the criticism by the Auditor General’s office of a $3-billion to $4-billion cost differential on the regulated asset base is not germane. For example, Enbridge is a private sector regulated utility that provides gas delivery to Ontario homes and industry. As part of its business operations, Enbridge incurs maintenance and investment costs and borrows on the capital markets as necessary. These costs are recovered through delivery charges on gas consumers but approved by the Ontario Energy Board.", "“In a similar vein, when the regulated electricity sector agencies (Hydro One, OPG and IESO) borrow money on the capital markets—albeit at a higher financing cost in relation to government borrowing—to build and maintain regulated assets, where is the principled argument for assigning that cost to the broader tax base? That is precisely what the Auditor General seems to propose.", "“Ms. Lysyk’s conclusions are not convincing and fail to provide a compelling public-interest rationale for loading up the electricity system borrowing costs onto the province’s debt obligations.” And then the author goes on.", "What the writer is basically saying is, the way in which the finances are handled for hydro in this province, and have been, is that costs incurred to generate, transmit and deliver hydro to people’s homes are recovered on the rate base. In other words, rates are approved to cover those costs by the Ontario Energy Board and then consumers reimburse those costs on their hydro bills. That is how the accounting has been handled for a long time.", "What has happened with the debt related to hydro is that the way we’ve treated the fair hydro plan debt is the same way we’ve treated the debt—this is what the author is writing—for Enbridge and for other parts of the hydro system. That debt, just like the expenses, is incurred by those entities that generate or deliver that electricity or service, and then that is recovered on the rate base. It’s not put on the tax base.", "So, to me, it doesn’t make sense to have the debt incurred to provide relief to folks on their hydro bills suddenly now on the government’s general books. That hasn’t been done in the case of Enbridge; it hasn’t been done in the case of Hydro One; it hasn’t been done in the case of OPG. Why would you do it now? I disagree with the suggestion that the auditor makes: that we should put this on the government books. That’s not the way to account for this, because it’s inconsistent with how this government and previous governments have accounted for expenses and debt within these utilities.", "All this said, Speaker, what I’ve tried to do here is demonstrate that the Leader of the Opposition tried to impugn the credibility of the members of this government. He made a number of statements that were just not accurate about foreign direct investment, about raising taxes, about our debt-to-GDP, about the Auditor General, about public servants, about civil servants—impugned their credibility. I just think it’s important to get that on the record.", "What I wanted to do with the remaining time is just share with you some of the thoughts that I had prepared for this particular debate. What I wanted to say is that when Minister Sousa first presented the 2018 budget, he outlined the government’s priorities—priorities that reflect the fundamental values and aspirations of the people of Ontario, building on past achievements and forging a future that boosts care and expands opportunity for all. These two concepts—care and opportunity—are closely linked, Mr. Speaker. This connection is particularly important during this time of economic uncertainty.", "Many of us in this House have faced situations where our concern for the well-being of a loved one or the burdens of caring for a family member who is very young or very frail have impacted our jobs, our studies and our plans for the future. This is the situation that many people in Ontario face today. They feel they must sacrifice opportunity to be able to care for those closest to them. This undermines the potential of each person, and it undermines the potential of our province. Even as Ontarians want to fulfill their own hopes and dreams, they also want to care for their loved ones. The people of Ontario are caring and they are big-hearted people. Whether it’s in our dealings with our loved ones, with our neighbours, with our co-workers or our community, when times get tough, Ontarians come together to create solutions. We saw this, for example, when the blackout hit North America. We saw it when our neighbours, our jobs and our province were hit by the great recession. We saw it with the outpouring of support and compassion for the victims and families impacted by the recent tragedy in Toronto.", "Speaker, in the government of Ontario, we value equally the principles of care and opportunity and we want to help everyone reach their full potential and, at the same time, help them care for their loved ones. That spirit and those values of care and opportunity are at the heart of this budget.", "Today, what I want to do is just spend the rest of my time talking about how the objectives of this budget and this bill support those values of care and opportunity for all the people of Ontario at every stage of their lives. Whether it’s improving child care so children can have a good start in life or supporting economic growth so that job seekers have good employment opportunities or providing quality health care so seniors receive the treatment they need to live healthy and comfortable lives, at each and every stage in our lives quality care is a necessity to reaching our full potential.", "I believe that this budget and this bill reflect those values and our collective aspirations to create more caring communities, a more caring society and more opportunities for us all. Because opportunity, at the end of the day, underlies our quality of life and underlies our ability to provide the services that we are proposing in this budget.", "Let me speak a little bit about child care, Speaker. We all know that getting the best start in life is key to future success. Countless studies show that early learning improves children’s academic performance throughout their lives, making them happier, more confident in the short run and providing more and better opportunities in the long run. I’m standing next to the member for Barrie, and she constantly tells me about this and how important it is that children get the right start in life. As a former teacher, she knows a lot about this.", "Quality child care is so critical for our children. That is why our government is supporting the dedicated child care professionals who look after our children. We’re increasing their wages and investing in their hiring, retention and professional development to make sure that high-quality child care continues to be delivered by engaged and knowledgeable educators. But access to quality child care should not be based on a family’s ability to pay and that is why, beginning in 2020, we’ll implement free preschool for children aged two and a half until they’re eligible for kindergarten, saving Ontario families on average $17,000." ],

For parents, it makes child care more affordable and gives them the opportunity and choice to return to work earlier if they so choose.", "I know that in my community of Etobicoke Centre, when I knock on doors and I speak to my constituents over the phone, what I hear from them a lot is about how they’re struggling to find care, access care or afford care. This is meant to help address some of those challenges, Speaker.", "We’re also giving families with children up to age 12 better access to before- and after-school care programs by requiring that school boards provide those programs in most elementary schools. In addition, the province is moving forward with a new investment of $30 million over two years to create an Early Years and Child Care Innovation Fund. The fund will support the development of flexible and unique solutions in the not-for-profit child care sector, which could include addressing the need for irregular care hours and transportation in rural and remote communities.", "To support our commitment to quality and accessible child care for all, we need to invest in the necessary infrastructure, and so our government will invest $534 million over the next six years to build 10,000 more preschool child care spaces in schools and 4,000 in other public spaces. For First Nations communities, we will double the current on-reserve child care capacity, creating 4,500 new spaces starting in 2019. Our plan to improve child care and early learning benefits the whole community, boosting quality care for children so that they get a good start in life and expanding opportunities for parents so they have more choice in where and how they work.", "Speaker, I talked about getting an early start, how important it is that we give children an early start, the right start at an early stage in life. What I want to talk about now is education.", "A great education broadens horizons. It expands possibilities and it unleashes ingenuity that strengthens our businesses and shapes the leaders of tomorrow. That is why we’re investing almost $16 billion over 10 years for new and improved schools across the province. From Sarnia in the southwest to Cornwall in the east, from small towns in Ontario to big cities in the Golden Horseshoe, we are building and upgrading schools across the province so that all students have access to quality education and learning spaces.", "That includes $510 million, since 2013, in new construction, additions and retrofits at 62 French-language schools across Ontario. More than 600,000 francophones call Ontario home, and a strong Franco-Ontarian community means a strong Ontario.", "But a great education is about more than just buildings and classrooms. It’s about providing the best learning experiences so that all students are empowered to achieve their potential while they’re in the classroom and beyond; it’s about providing the right tools and the right curriculum so that all students have every opportunity to succeed in today’s economy; and it’s about preparing students for the jobs of today and the opportunities of tomorrow.", "One example of our efforts is the enhancement of the grade 10 career studies course. This is something that I’m particularly passionate about because it will provide students with the financial literacy to help them with budgeting and financial management. In fact, I think the folks across the aisle could use a lesson or two. It will provide students with digital literacy and engagement, essential skills in today’s digital world, and it will provide students with hands-on learning opportunities in partnership with local entrepreneurs so that students will be better prepared to respond to a rapidly changing economy. The course will enable Ontario’s youth to develop basic skills and resources to help them transition into the workforce.", "As somebody who spent a large amount of their time over the last four years since being elected here advocating for and working on issues of financial literacy, I’m incredibly proud that we’ve taken this step. Financial literacy and the other skills that I mentioned are fundamental life skills that are important for young people to have. They help to position them to achieve their potential in whatever it is that they want to pursue in the years that follow their time in school.", "You’ll hear from the members of the opposition a lot of talk—in fact, the member opposite, the Leader of the Opposition, was doing this just a few moments ago. He was talking about how Ontario is no longer a desirable destination to do business in. They really like to talk Ontario down over there. As I said earlier, in correcting the member, I spoke about the fact that we’re number one in foreign direct investment in Canada and number three in North America. On a per capita basis, that puts us ahead of New York and California, so we’re doing quite well.", "One of the reasons that Ontario is a destination for foreign direct investment and talent is because we offer something that very few jurisdictions offer—at least to the same degree that we do—and that’s a skilled and diverse workforce. As someone who comes from business, as someone who advised businesses on where to make investments and how to make investments, I can tell you, Speaker, that the one way for an economy, for a jurisdiction, be it a province or a country, to develop what’s called a sustainable competitive advantage—a competitive advantage that you can sustain, defend and protect for a generation, for decades or for a sustainable period of time—is a talented workforce. That is key to our prosperity in the future.", "That is why child care is so important. That is why education at the elementary and high school levels is so important. That’s why post-secondary education, apprenticeships and other forms of post-secondary education are so important. In making sure that people have the training and education that they need, we are preparing them for the jobs of tomorrow. And by doing that, we have been and will continue to set Ontario up to be a jurisdiction that continues to be number one in Canada for foreign direct investment, and one of the top jurisdictions around the world.", "In this budget, we are preparing students for good jobs by providing $132 million over three years to develop post-secondary education programs that respond to the changing needs of students and employers. But access to quality education should not be based on a student’s or a family’s ability to pay. That’s why, beginning in the fall of 2017, we are providing more timely and targeted financial assistance to students with the greatest need, assistance benefiting students from low-income families and benefiting students with dependents, benefiting mature students and many others—assistance that is making college and university tuition free for about 235,000 students of all ages, because income should not be a barrier to learning.", "We have to remember the fact, Speaker, that in today’s world, in today’s labour market, the young people who are sitting as pages in front of you as we speak—that generation of young people especially, more than any other—will need to continue to pursue education after high school. That is, 70% of jobs in Ontario today require some sort of post-secondary education, so we can only imagine how high that number will be when those young people graduate. Making sure that they are able to achieve their potential is by investing in education, making it stronger and making sure that they can access it. That’s what this is all about.", "In addition to what I said before, the province will provide more than $3 billion in capital grants to post-secondary institutions over the next 10 years so that they are equipped with the right space but also the right technology to deliver quality education.", "As someone who taught at York University, at the Schulich school, for four years, I know how important not just the right facilities are but the right technology is, to make sure that you can facilitate a learning environment that allows young people to go to the workforce and succeed.", "This act includes $500 million, starting in 2021, to help renew and modernize Ontario’s university and college campuses, to update classrooms and labs, and to undertake facility retrofits to enhance the student learning experience. We are moving forward with the commitment to create a new French-language university in the province.", "For some, higher learning may mean pursuing a skilled trade, which offers a pathway to a good job and a secure career. Ontario’s apprenticeship system has already trained over 68,000 people and has certified 9,800 trade professionals annually over the past three years—9,800 every single year, Speaker. We’re investing another $170 million over three years to provide opportunities for on-the-job training in skilled trades. This investment will help them earn while they learn, supporting our young people to make the leap from high school to the workforce, and helping them to find high-quality jobs upon completing their apprenticeship journey.", "Ontario has one of the most highly skilled workforces in North America. To maintain the strength of our workforce, it is critical that employers have access to the talent they need, to grow and compete in today’s global economy. It’s critical that workers and job seekers have the opportunity to upgrade their skills, to start a new career or to advance to a new or better job in their chosen field.", "That is why we are also making the commitment in the 2018 budget to establish the first Ontario Training Bank. This $63-million additional investment will bring employers, employees and training institutions together to develop skills and programs that are tailored to the needs of the local economy.", "Speaker, you can see, in what I’ve spoken about, that we’re talking about giving young people the right start in life, and that we’re providing them with the right skills and allowing them to adapt their skills when they’re further along in their careers. That’s what this collective set of investments and initiatives attempts to do. It’s ultimately to ensure that every single person can pursue their dream, and ultimately allowing Ontario to continue to be one of the number one destinations in the world for foreign direct investment and one of the best places in the world to do business.", "Investing in a world-class post-secondary education and a modern and robust apprenticeship system, and a system that works with employers to train workers and job seekers with skills—that’s how we’re taking care of students, and that’s how we’re creating opportunities, or supporting the creation of opportunities, so that young people—people of all ages—can be successful in their studies, in their careers and in life. These steps will also help parents by reducing the costs of financing their children’s education, and instilling confidence in a brighter future for their children.", "These are some of the steps that we’re taking in this budget to support a strong education system, and position Ontarians and our province for success, not just today but in the years to come.", "Speaker, just as we are helping people shoulder the costs of caring for their loved ones, we’re also helping create opportunity for them. Thanks to the talent and hard work of our people, our economy is growing. Our economy has outperformed those of all G7 nations since 2014.", "It’s interesting, Speaker, that somehow the member opposite, the Leader of the Opposition, forgot to mention that when he was talking Ontario down and talking down our economy. I’ll repeat that: Our economy has outperformed those of all G7 nations since 2014.", "We’ve created over 800,000 jobs since the recession, most of them full-time and most in the private sector, and most in industries paying above-average wages. Our unemployment rate is the lowest it has been in 17 years.", "I don’t know what the member opposite is talking about, but these are facts, Speaker. These are facts. Facts actually matter. I would urge the member opposite to learn about what’s happening in Ontario’s economy before he talks it down. I think that if he read about this, then he’d realize that Ontario’s economy is performing quite strongly and quite well, and that there’s a lot that we have to be proud of. When he speaks the way he speaks, then he just diminishes his own credibility, because he really isn’t providing a fair, accurate characterization of what’s happening out there, of the reality around us.", "Interjection." ],

We’re directly helping young people find jobs and supporting employers by providing businesses with financial incentives to hire young workers aged 15 to 29. The Employing Young Talent Incentive offers small businesses with less than a hundred employees a $1,000 incentive upon hiring a young worker and another $1,000 retention incentive after six months.", "The member opposite spent time talking about how we’re not doing anything to support small business. Well, what is this that I just spoke about? This is helping small business and it’s helping young people at the same time. Business owners of any size will receive additional incentives for hiring and retaining youth who face barriers to employment.", "We’re supporting small businesses by creating a competitive tax environment, cutting the corporate income tax rate from 4.5% to 3.5%. We’re reducing red tape to develop a more effective and efficient regulatory system, so that companies can focus more on their business and less on the regulatory hurdles. Thanks to these efforts and the efforts of people across Ontario, the plan to create good jobs and foster economic growth is delivering results, and we want to continue to build on these successes and gains.", "The 2018 budget features a new investment of $935 million over three years in the Good Jobs and Growth Plan. Through the Good Jobs and Growth Plan, Ontario will build on and strengthen its economic foundations by investing in local talent and entrepreneurs, by encouraging the growth of businesses with the goal of creating and retaining over 70,000 jobs—through the Jobs and Prosperity Fund—by attracting and retaining foreign investments and by supporting innovative start-ups and scale-ups.", "Even as the economy is growing and Ontario’s strategic investments in jobs is working, we also know that the benefits of the economy are not being shared by all. Notwithstanding the fact that our economy is performing well—notwithstanding that fact—there is much more work to be done. There is much more work to be done, and it is clear that part of the challenge we need to address is that the benefits of that economic growth are not being shared by all.", "We see people in Ontario struggling to get ahead, even though the economy continues to grow. We see the struggle in the rise of precarious work, even as good, well-paying jobs are also increasing in Ontario. We have to find ways for more people to participate in and benefit from our growing economy. Whether it’s people in the gig economy, or people who sacrifice to look after their loved ones, often while balancing their own jobs and family responsibilities, or working parents trying to carve out extra room in their budgets for their kids to join a Little League team or for other costs, barriers in participation in economies are barriers to economic success for our province as a whole.", "I think it’s very important to note we’re trying to address that. I’ve spoken extensively about how we’re trying to do that in a number of ways. Whether it be through investments in our education system, strengthening the curriculum, investments in our post-secondary system, the continuous evolvement of our post-secondary education system to respond to the needs of the labour market, helping provide incentives to small businesses to hire young people, reducing the small business corporate tax rate—these are all initiatives that I’ve spoken about that help to ensure that not only businesses are successful, but that people are successful and can prosper and participate in a growing economy.", "I have a number of members who surround me who are here from northern Ontario.

We know that some companies, like Sears Canada, have entered an insolvency process with underfunded pension plans. What that means is, it’s resulting in people receiving reduced pension plans—less than what they were told they would get, less than what they were eligible for. Many people today are understandably concerned about whether they will have enough savings to maintain their standard of living in retirement.", "That’s why we’re increasing the maximum monthly guarantee from the Pension Benefits Guarantee Fund—the only fund of its kind in Canada—by 50%, to $1,500 per month. This increase would help many employees affected by employer insolvency, with the legislation before us today proposing to make this amendment retroactive to May 19, 2017, to ensure that former Sears Canada employees in Ontario could benefit from receiving this additional support.", "Providing income security for workers and retirees is yet another way we are trying to make sure that the people of Ontario can prosper, share in the growth of that economy, but also, in this particular case, get the pension benefits that they deserve, that they were promised.", "As I get lower on time, I want to talk about a few brief items. One is health care. My community in Etobicoke Centre has one of the highest percentages of seniors of any riding in the country, so health care is something that I spend a lot of time on, and advocating on, to make sure that people in my community, and communities across Ontario, frankly, get the care they deserve. It’s fine to build a strong economy, but that means little. A good economy and strong incomes mean little when you don’t have your basic health. Being healthy allows living a full life. That’s why this budget reflects such extensive commitments to our health care system. We know that having access to needed medication, services and facilities is so important. This access provides peace of mind to people as they build their future.", "Universal health care is a reflection of our society’s values—how we care for each other collectively. For families that are concerned about a loved one who is sick, nothing is more important than getting their family member the care that they need. That is why we have committed to not only maintaining but to expanding our investments in health care.", "In the fall of 2017, we announced an additional $618 million for health care to improve access to key hospital services and reduce wait times. That was last year. In this budget, we’re investing an additional $822 million in 2018-19.", "Long-term care is one of our foundational values as well, and that is why our government is also creating 30,000 new long-term-care beds over the next 10 years, adding 5,000 beds by 2022 to help people who can no longer live independently and to provide peace of mind for the people who care for them. These new beds are in addition to the 30,000 existing beds that we are redeveloping.", "It’s important to note that the best care is often provided in comfortable and familiar surroundings. For most people, that means being able to be cared for in their home. That is why we have increased the investment in home and community care by about $250 million per year since 2013. These increases address rising demographic pressures from a growing and aging population and help more people get the care they need close to home.", "In this budget, we are providing more access to home and community health care services, including 2.8 million more hours of personal support, 284,000 more visits by nurses and 58,000 more therapy visits. With these supports, seniors and people of all ages with complex medical conditions can often stay in their own homes or be cared for in the community longer.", "We all know that an illness or medical condition impacts not only the person with the ailment, but also the caregivers—caregivers who are often unpaid family members, friends or neighbours. The burden of caring for an unwell family member impacts people’s jobs, their family life, their studies, their plans for the future, adding to the physical, emotional and financial distress that caregivers experience. That is why, in 2017, we introduced the Ontario Caregiver Tax Credit, to provide tax relief for people caring for infirm relatives, therefore easing the financial burden often felt by those who take care of loved ones.", "Ontario is taking further steps to make it easier for people to care for unwell loved ones by launching a new organization this spring, a single access point for information and resources to help and support caregivers across the province.", "We’re also improving the coordination of care between primary specialists and community care providers to make it easier for caregivers to navigate multiple services in multiple settings.", "If an unwell person is receiving care at home, in a long-term-care home or in a hospital, they have likely received care involving a personal support worker. PSWs are critical to the health and well-being of Ontarians. That is why it is so vital that we support them. Over the next three years, our government will invest an additional $23 million to add an estimated 5,500 PSWs to the workforce to ensure that home care clients get the care they need, including in underserved areas such as rural, northern and remote communities. As part of this plan, we’ll invest an additional $38 million in education and training for new or experienced PSWs so that they have the tools they need to provide quality care to our most vulnerable Ontarians, wherever they may live.", "We are continuing to improve and transform health care, from hospital care to home care, from shorter wait times for procedures to more long-term beds, so that people have access to high-quality care when they need it and where they need it, and so that their caregivers have the support and resources that they need to reduce the time and stress in caring for their loved ones.", "As you know, Speaker, we made prescription drugs free for young people through OHIP+, making Ontario the first province to provide drug coverage at no cost to children and youth under the age of 25, regardless of family income. With this budget, we’re proposing to expand that coverage to everyone 65 and over. Starting in August 2019, seniors will be covered as well. With this expansion, prescription medications now will be free for about 6.4 million people—6.4 million people, Speaker.", "With this budget, we’re also introducing a new Ontario drug and dental program for individuals and their families who do not have coverage from an extended health plan, starting this summer. This program would reimburse participants for up to 80% of eligible prescription drugs and dental expenses. It would reimburse up to an annual maximum of $400 for a single person, $600 for couples and $700 for a family of four with two children.", "From increased investments in hospitals, helping to reduce wait times and helping to expand access to life-changing procedures, to expanding prescription drug coverage to almost 50% of Ontario’s population, to increasing the number and improving the quality of long-term-care beds for people unable to live independently, this government is investing in and boosting health care in Ontario.", "As a society, though, we’ve come to understand that there is no health without mental health. We know that mental health challenges affect one in three people in this province at some point in their lives. In this budget, the government is making an unprecedented investment in a more integrated, high-quality mental health and addictions system for people of all ages. In addition to the $3.8 billion per year we provide in ongoing support, we’re investing an additional $2.1 billion over the next four years to treat mental health and addictions and to help people recover and live more healthy and meaningful lives. This brings our total investment in mental health and addictions services to more than $17 billion over four years.", "We’re providing more community-based services to more young people, such as counselling, therapy and walk-in clinics, making sure kids get off to a good start in life. We’re strengthening mental health for all students by investing $175 million over four years to expand school-based supports for mental health and addictions services, supporting a healthy transition into adulthood. And we are helping up to 350,000 more people with anxiety and depression by increasing access to publicly funded psychotherapy, helping to build happy and healthy lives at every stage.", "Speaker, I’ve spoken about the things we’re doing to provide, to support the growth of opportunity in this province, and what we’ve done to make sure that our economy is growing and prospering. I’ve provided facts that demonstrate that our economy is performing well, but I’ve also said that there is more for us to do so that everyone can participate in that growing economy. We’re taking steps to do all of that.", "I’ve spoken about health care. I’ve spoken about the different investments that we have made and continue to make—and propose in this budget—to make sure that we improve the quality of care and access to care in our communities across Ontario.", "We’re tabling this bill, the Plan for Care and Opportunity Act (Budget Measures), because we believe that our plan reflects the fundamental values and aspirations of the people of Ontario. These values and aspirations, I believe, are reflected in this budget. They’re reflected in our education policies. They’re reflected in policies that provide more access to high-quality education, which ultimately leads to access to more high-quality jobs. And they’re reflected in our economic initiatives.", "I’ll just end by saying that as we enter the ending of this phase of the debate around the budget, and as we enter in the debate that the people of Ontario will have to engage in in the next election, I hope that we can celebrate what we’ve accomplished together, but also look ahead with determination to resolve those challenges that remain, whether that be in our economy, in creating jobs, whether that be in health care or whether that be in education. I think there’s a lot of work that’s been done that we can be proud of, and yet there is a lot more to do. I think that all those members who are running for re-election, at least on this side of the House, are proud of so much of what’s been accomplished, but are also running again because they believe that there is more to be done and that they can make a difference in doing that.", "I think we can say that Ontario’s economy is strong, that we continue to be one of the leading jurisdictions for foreign direct investment, that we continue to create an attractive business climate, and that we have a province that we can all be very, very proud of.", "I want to just end by saying that it has been a privilege, over the past four years, to be the MPP for Etobicoke Centre, to work with all my caucus colleagues, and to be the parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Finance. I look forward to spending the next four years doing the same thing with my caucus colleagues and those on the other side of the House.", "With that said, I hope that everyone can support this budget.

So I wouldn’t say it was an aspiration; I would say it was a broken promise.", "They suggested, aspirationally, that the gas plants that they cancelled in Oakville were going to cost the taxpayer of Ontario $40 million. I would suggest it was $1.1 billion: another broken promise.", "The Minister of Finance suggested in his presentation that he was going to have balanced budgets for years coming forward in the future, and he said the actual deficit was only going to be $6.7 billion. We now know through the Auditor General and the Financial Accountability Officer that those are closer to $12 billion, so perhaps aspirational; I would suggest a broken promise and something that is not the reality for what Ontarians are going to face.", "The Minister of Finance, again, in some of his remarks—my colleague the member from Nipissing quoted that the Minister of Finance had said he was a slayer of the deficit. Yet we know that unless you move numbers into someone else’s budget, like OPG, it truly isn’t a balanced budget, because at the end of the day the taxpayer of Ontario still owes all of that money. In my definition, that is not a balanced budget. That is moving money off so it doesn’t show up on your books. But at the end of the day, we have to pay for it.", "As I said earlier, he promised balanced budgets for a number of years, yet we know through these two independent officers of the Legislature that we’re going to actually have a number of years of sustained deficits—some would suggest a structural deficit.", "He promised 140,000 new jobs every year, and I believe that number, from the documents that we’ve been provided by our two legislative officers, is going to be closer to 60,000 to 80,000 at best: again, aspirational perhaps; I would suggest a broken promise.", "The net debt-to-GDP maintenance is going to, at some point, from these documents—and I’m using most of my stats from the economic and budget outlook from the Financial Accountability Officer—is going to potentially hit 42% of our gross domestic product. Again, aspirational—not. Those are numbers that are getting close to things like what happened to Greece many years ago.", "The member from Etobicoke Centre made a comment that long-term care was a foundational priority. I find that very interesting, as the critic for the last two and a half years. They actually spent more money on food for people in prisons than they did our long-term-care people and our seniors.", "He didn’t acknowledge that the wait-list is actually going to double to 50,000 people. They made a promise and a commitment a number of years ago that they were going to redevelop 30,000 beds. If I’m generous to them, they’ve actually accomplished 30,000, so perhaps aspirational was the number they used. I think the people of Ontario want practical, pragmatic numbers that they’re actually going to deliver. They don’t want more broken promises. I’m not certain, because I’ve asked for two and a half years, where that list is of where they were going to redevelop the 30,000 beds and where they are at. I still haven’t got the list and they are about a third of the way through after 15 years.", "Interestingly, again, there were no new beds even thought of in the last number of budgets that I’ve been here for. This year, in an election year, they actually decided to come up with money for new beds. Mr. Speaker, I don’t mean to sound negative or pessimistic, but at the end of the day those are the facts I’m putting on the table, and I challenge any of them, if they want to dispute those as facts, that I’m happy to do that.", "Bill 31, the budget measures, promised balanced budgets for years to come; actually, six more years of deficits, while tripling the debt. We know through the Auditor General and the Financial Accountability Officer—they both sounded concerns that the deficit was projected to be $6.7 billion, and it’s actually going to be in the neighbourhood of $11.2 billion. The debt is going to reach $400 billion.", "Again, I’m going to go back to the Etobicoke Centre member, because he said that young people have to have “the right start in life.” Mr. Speaker, this government has burdened our next generation with $26,000 per person the day they start their life. I’m not certain that that’s the definition, for me, of the right start in life. Why wouldn’t we bring that down to no debt? Why wouldn’t we bring that down to a number that’s actually manageable?", "They also are adding to record levels of debt. We are projecting between $374 billion and $400 billion in debt, and every cent that has to be paid back of that is not going to our youth, to those pages that I’m looking at, to my nephews and nieces, to my—hopefully, someday—children’s children. We cannot accept that they are actually doing that and in good conscience saying comments like, “We want to make sure we start young people off and give them the right start in life.”", "Mr. Speaker, the budget numbers are creating uncertainty. They’re actually forcing Ontario’s credit outlook to be downgraded to negative, and we all know that when a credit rating does get downgraded, it leads to more interest on that debt, more money going out every day, paying more money on debt and not to front-line services: not to people with mental health issues, not to seniors on fixed incomes, not to people in long-term care or those with special needs out there across our province, just to name a few. We know that that is unequivocal. Nobody can argue that point, that if you take on more debt, the credit rating goes down, you’re going to pay more in interest payments, and that’s less money helping the people that we’re given the privilege to serve here in Queen’s Park.", "Mr. Speaker, their budget numbers have been challenged by both the Auditor General and the Financial Accountability Officer. This is about trust. These are independent officers. There’s no partisan anything involved with these people that have stepped up and given their qualified—", "Interjections." ],

On page 24, and I’m going to just read: “This baseline deficit averages $6.0 billion from 2021-22 to 2025-26, despite steady ongoing economic growth. This permanent imbalance between Ontario’s revenues and expenditures suggests a structural deficit existed prior to the introduction of the 2018 budget.” It leads you to wonder how the Minister of Finance and all of his colleagues can stand here and say, “We’re in good shape; everything’s wonderful.” When you have a structural deficit, that means you know that you’re adding more and more and more debt, and the more money you borrow, the worse that economic outlook is going to get.", "We know that my colleague suggested—he used words that were actually shared by the Auditor General, like “scheme.” When they’re talking about Enron and accounting schemes, and when we know that they are moving money around just to be able to make balance sheets look the way they want when they come out and present a document, that is unacceptable.", "I’m going to give you two examples, Mr. Speaker. They did move money from their budget onto OPG’s books. That’s a shell game. We as Ontario taxpayers all own that debt. It doesn’t matter whether you want to call it ratepayer or whether you want to call it tax base or whether you want to call it government or OPG. There is only one taxpayer, and we all know that, Mr. Speaker, and that’s every single individual here in Ontario.", "By moving that money onto OPG’s books—they knew this consciously and still made the decision—it’s going to cost the people of Ontario $4 billion. The reason for that is because they cannot, through OPG, borrow money at the same level as the province of Ontario does. With the stroke of a pen, and an ideological thought process by a government trying to cling to power, they moved money over to another set of books, and it’s going to cost every single one of us $4 billion. It’s simply unacceptable.", "Mr. Speaker, that is that structural deficit. They’re adding to it, and the hole just keeps getting deeper.", "Sadly, I don’t believe that the Liberals have any strategy other than to continue to grow the debt so big that no one will lend us money anymore. I believe, although I was quite young, that that happened back in the days of the NDP government and Bob Rae, when it finally came to a line that said, “You cannot borrow anymore.” Look at the actions that happened there. There are people who still talk about that and are still suffering as a result." ],

All of us were taught to put a little off, as I was saying about those rainy days. At the end of the day, they know that there’s going to be a storm coming, and you’re going to need some more of that money. Right now, we’re leveraging the bank.

Obviously, that should have signalled to somebody that, “Oh, maybe we should be taking a different tack here.

For 15 years, they’ve run our province into the ground. They’ve actually tripled the debt, almost. They continue to add debt every single day. Not many people are saying that they’re getting better services, in most cases. So what would they do? And what would they sell?

We got to elect who would be our caucus chair, and Cindy was elected as our caucus chair—I would say, if not unanimously, it certainly was by a groundswell. She is a very good leader. She is a very good chair.", "As I said, she has been a nurse for a huge part of her life, and I want to thank her specifically. Some of you will remember that in the fall of 2014, I broke my leg. I had the pleasure of being in a cast and all this for three months. Coming to Queen’s Park was really hard. Doing my duties and travelling back and forth from Nickel Belt to Queen’s Park was difficult. I was not always able to attend to everything that I was supposed to. Cindy helped me. She stepped up, and whatever I needed, she was always there and always helpful. When I was stuck at home—because at the beginning, I had to have surgery and all that jazz—she was the one who would call me and ask how I was doing and what she could do to help me. That was greatly appreciated.", "It also shows that she is a nurse. It doesn’t matter if she is the mayor, she is the chair of council or she is an MPP; she will always be a helpful person. It is in her to care; it is in her to help. We were really fortunate to have her with us.", "As an MPP, you can see those characteristics through what she has done. As I said when I opened, she was a nurse for close to 20 years at the Welland General Hospital. When she became an MPP, she was part of this group that made sure that the hospital in Welland would stay open. I can tell you, as the health critic, it was one of the ones where I had serious doubts that we would ever be able to keep it open, but Cindy would have no part of this. She could not fathom that a community of 100,000 people could not have a hospital. How could that be?", "She brought more and more people in to the tent. I don’t know how many demonstrations we had on the front lawn of Queen’s Park or how many petitions she read or how many times she brought this issue forward, until finally Dr. Hoskins, when he was the Minister of Health, saw it her way and saw that a community of 100,000 people cannot be without a hospital. Welland, thanks to her effort, the effort of the city council and many, many more who put their shoulder to the wheel, made it happen. Now, Welland hospital will be a full-fledged hospital with emergency and all of the services that the people of Welland were expecting out of a hospital.", "Another, I would say, characteristic of hers is that when she sees that something is wrong, she speaks up." ],

I, like most of the people who are seeking re-election, have started knocking on doors. From people in Sudbury, we hear over and over about the overcrowding in our hospitals. More and more people have experienced it. When you knock on the door, they just have to share that with us: “I couldn’t believe it, France, when you brought it forward that your friend Leo was in the bathroom for 13 days.” Well, this bathroom is still being used as a room as we speak. Compared to some of the other accommodations—in the TV room, and in the patient lounge—it’s a more desirable room than the other rooms or if you’re stuck in the hallways.", "But at the end of the day, it does not meet their expectations. They are very surprised and disappointed, and some of them are angry, that our health care system has gotten to that point. It is clear that six years ago, when the Liberal government made the decision to flat-line the operating budgets of our hospitals, that had a direct impact as to what we see now, the overcrowding that we see.", "As I’ve mentioned, today is the beginning of Nursing Week. Happy Nursing Week to all of the tens of thousands—I think we have close to 100,000 nurses in Ontario. Happy Nursing Week to them all. We also found at a press conference this morning organized by the Registered Nurses’ Association of Ontario as well as the Ontario Nurses’ Association that what has been happening in the course of the last four or five years is that hospitals have a harder and harder time balancing their budgets. What they do is that whenever a nurse leaves, they keep the position vacant. So although our hospitals have not been handing out pink slips and going through the process of laying nurses off, what they have done is that they have not replaced nurses. It was revealed this morning that a total of 10,000 registered nurse positions that have become vacant were never replaced, which means that in an ordinary hospital ward, they’re working, in general, 17% short.", "But it gets even worse, because in that ward, you will have a whole lot of extra patients in the hallways, in the bathrooms, in the lounges, in the TV rooms, and everywhere else. Just think of what it looks like. So not only do you not have a full staff—in general, every unit is about 17% understaffed; you have more patients.

Going by memory now, I think we have 1,200 beds and about 900 people on the wait-list, which is a little bit worse than province-wide, where we have 78,000 beds and 34,000 people waiting. The wait times are really hard on families—families who reach out to all of us, I’m sure. We’ve all had some family who just can’t cope anymore, whose family member is on the wait-list for a long-term-care home and they can’t get in.", "In this budget, we see a little bit of money for new long-term-care beds, but I can’t help but think that when the baby boomers were born, we knew that 70 years later, they would be 70 years old. How come we did not plan for this any better? How come we find ourselves in a position where there are 34,000 people waiting for a long-term-care bed? How come we did not bring forward other models of care that allow people to stay in the community?", "I had the pleasure of going to Luxembourg, where I visited a dementia village, and other Western European communities where they have different models of care. They have the same issues as we do with cognitive impairment, bladder and bowel control, and everything else that comes with needing 24/7 care, but they provide care in a much different way than we do. They don’t have the problems that we have.", "The people who come and see us who cannot cope: Most of the time they are receiving home care. Our home care system is broken. It fails more people than it helps. It’s funny, because if you look to the east or the west of us, Quebec has a home care system and Manitoba has a home care system, and both of theirs work pretty good. Why is it that I have more complaints against home care than every other part of the health care system put together? Because, every day, there are missed visits. Every day there is, basically, a hard time finding PSWs.", "Why is it that we have a system that has not figured out that if you want to recruit and retain a stable workforce, you need to make home care jobs good jobs? As long as those jobs don’t pay the bills, don’t offer you full-time hours, full-time work, a little bit of benefits and a pension, we will continue to have recruitment and retention problems. What does it mean that you cannot recruit and retain? That means missed visits. That means that you have different home care workers coming into your home all the time.", "People don’t like this. They want to be able to trust that they will have home care. They are discharged from hospitals and are supposed to be picked up by the home care system, who phones them and tells them that they have no workers; therefore, they expect an eight-to-nine-week wait. What is this? You’ve been discharged from hospital. You need your bandages changed and the care that you were promised, but you are put on a wait-list that is weeks long.", "None of that is addressed in this budget. All of those issues that I’ve talked about—whether overcrowding in our hospitals, the poor levels of care in our long-term-care homes, or the problem recruiting and retaining a stable workforce in the home care system—all of this stays in place with the budget that they have put forward.", "I think we can do better.

Bracebridge mayor Graydon Smith appeared at the pre-budget consultations to speak about this issue. So when the government announced increased funding for hospitals, I was hopeful. I was hopeful that medium-sized hospitals like West Parry Sound Health Centre and Muskoka Algonquin Healthcare would receive significant increases, and that this government would change the way in which hospital funding is allocated.", "That did not happen. When the funding was announced, West Parry Sound Health Centre got a 1% increase and Muskoka Algonquin Healthcare, which manages the Huntsville District Memorial Hospital and South Muskoka Memorial Hospital, got a 1.4% increase—1% and 1.4%, when the hospital sector as a whole is getting 4.6%. Those meagre increases don’t even cover the increased costs of hydro and provincially negotiated collective agreements.", "After years of frozen base funding, the hospitals in my riding are still struggling to make ends meet. Muskoka Algonquin Healthcare is considering the future of the two hospitals, the one in Huntsville and the one in Bracebridge. Both communities are very clear: They want to maintain two fully functioning hospitals. This impacts people from as far north as Sundridge, South River, Magnetawan, Burk’s Falls, Kearney, and down south to south of Gravenhurst to Severn Bridge. Over the past month, I’ve introduced hundreds of petitions asking this government to save these two hospitals. These petitions have been signed by about 6,000 people, and there are more coming in every day. I do want to thank our leader, Doug Ford, for clearly stating that he supports the two hospitals.", "To get back to the budget, I was hoping to hear that the government was going to change or at least review the funding formula for medium-sized hospitals. They didn’t do that.", "This budget continued the government’s attack on small business—in this case, by stealth—by following on the coattails of the federal Liberals’ tax changes that will hurt so many small businesses.", "Mr. Speaker, there is one sector the government has helped with this budget, and I do want to recognize that. They changed the cap on the Small Beer Manufacturers’ Tax Credit, and I know that the breweries in my riding appreciate that change, so I wanted to thank the government for doing that.

That’s a measure of whether you can afford how much debt you’re carrying. When the government was first elected, I remember the debt-to-GDP was 27%.

But 15 years is nothing to sneeze at.", "In their quest for another term, they prorogued the Legislature for one day, delivered a throne speech and then brought down the budget we are discussing today. Now, not all of the reviews for the budget were positive. Some saw it as a Hail Mary pass to try and rescue a victory out of the jaws of certain defeat. As you know, Speaker, in football terms, a Hail Mary pass is made in desperation with only a small chance of success and time running out on the clock.", "Others said it was a last-ditch attempt to hold onto power. The descriptive phrase “last ditch” is said to have originated with England’s King William III. He used it in a speech in the late 17th century, calling on his subjects to fight and die in the last ditch to defend England. I’m not sure how appropriate it is in the context of this budget. I certainly hope none of my Liberal friends actually die while on the hustings defending this budget, their platform and the decisions taken over the past 15 years.", "However, it is not unfair to say, from what I’ve gathered from what has been said about the budget in most political circles, that there was a certain amount of desperation that led to some of the goodies contained in the budget. The electorate was fed a lot of promises—too many to swallow all at once, it seems. Even the editorial writers at the Toronto Star—and, dare I say, the normally Liberal-friendly and supportive Toronto Star?—had their doubts. They wrote, “These aren’t announcements from a government with a clear path to turning them into reality.”", "So many promises, Speaker, and so many flashy ideas—stolen from the New Democrats. Not that there’s anything terribly wrong with that; voters know who came up with the ideas first. But when you promise everything, it turns into too much of a good thing, or, as the Toronto Star editorial writers saw it, “offering too much of a good thing at a moment when their credibility is stretched very thin.” Where were these progressive measures for the past 15 years?", "Time and time again, we’ve heard from people and pundits claiming it was nothing but a glittering clump of baubles aimed at attracting the attention of the electorate on the eve of an election. Speaker, as you know, a bauble is but a small, showy trinket or decoration.", "Many of the attention-grabbing aspects of this budget didn’t quite attain the credibility for the Liberals that they were hoping for when the brewmasters of this budget concoction slapped it together. “Concoction” is an interesting word.

  "text" : [ "They’re giving me a hard time, Speaker—by the Financial Accountability Officer.", "Sure, there are elements of the budget that ring loud with the electorate: more money for mental health, more money for children with health challenges. After 15 years in office, these files suddenly got dusted off and highlighted. I met last Friday with representatives from the John McGivney centre in Windsor, one of the 21 CTCs, or children’s treatment centres, in the province. They do it all at John McGivney: physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech and language services, social work, behaviour consultation and recreation therapy. They also have a cleft lip, palate and cranial-facial program. They host a seating and mobility clinic and offer autism services. They are committed to enriching the lives of children and youth with special needs by helping them reach their full potential.", "The John McGivney centre services 3,000 clients annually. They’ll be celebrating their 40th anniversary just days after the election. When they started, they had 150 clients. Now it’s 3,000. They’re extremely efficient, and the wait-list for their services can run as little as just a few days all the way up to 18 months for certain specialty services. Other CTCs don’t do as well. Across the province at these 21 CTCs, there’s a waiting list that stretches to more than 27,000 families. When the 21 CTCs look at this budget, they’d like to see $40 million a year for the next three years in order to reduce the intolerable wait times and increase the quality and frequency of rehab therapy.", "Struggling families need the proper supports to manage their children with special needs on a day-to-day basis. It’s tougher still in our rural areas, where these specialized services are not as available.", "More than 80,000 children and youth with special needs and their families are served by these 21 children’s treatment centres. The people who work there are the good angels, the dedicated ones assisting very vulnerable children. These kids deserve a good start. Unfortunately, provincial funding for the John McGivney centre hasn’t been increased in nearly five years—four years ago, they got a very tiny increase. You can see why critics have labelled this budget a Hail Mary budget and a last-ditch attempt at currying favour with the voters.", "Despite the need, despite the lengthy waiting list, no increase for four years and then just a little tiny one—actually, if you think about it, as incredible as it may sound, four or five years without an increase isn’t all that bad when you look at other facilities, such as Maryvale in Windsor. They handle children and teenagers with issues of mental health, thousands of them, some suicidal, and they have very long waiting lists. They do an extremely good job, but when it comes to their base funding from this Liberal government, Maryvale has not had an increase—not a penny, not a nickel, not a dime—in 15 years.", "Across this great province today, we have 12,000 children and youth standing in line, children and youth with mental health issues waiting for professional help, waiting for someone to give them a hand in dealing with the demons upsetting their mental stability—12,000 young people. If we don’t give them the help they need in the early stages, we know these issues will get worse.", "Speaker, if a kid breaks an arm or a leg, we take her to the emergency ward and she gets it fixed right away. If that same child attempts suicide, we take them to the emergency ward and they’re turned away and have to wait six months or longer to get counselling. There is something very, very wrong with this picture, and it’s the same story playing out across the province. The only difference is the wait times: six months here, 12 months over there and 18 months someplace else.", "Speaker, I’m wearing a pin—it’s not a prop; we were given these today. This is Children’s Mental Health Week in Ontario. Child and youth mental health matters, is what the pin signifies.", "Just before he left Ontario politics to go to Ottawa and tackle the pharmacare program, the former Minister of Health, Mr. Hoskins, was saying, “There’s no health without mental health.” Speaker, I don’t know if you’re aware, but children’s mental health in Ontario is not a mandated service. It’s discretionary. The Liberals should be ashamed of that. It’s a discretionary program, not a mandated program. The Liberals are failing our children and youth.", "If, indeed, there is no health without mental health, then where have they been for the past 15 years? Why are young people in Thunder Bay waiting 208 days—more than half a year—for life-saving mental health treatment? Why are they waiting a year in the Barrie area and, for goodness’ sake, why in the affluent area of Ottawa do young people with mental health problems have to wait 575 days—a year and a half—for counselling and treatment?", "What is wrong with that picture, Speaker? What is wrong with the Liberal agenda on mental health? Why does it take six months or more after someone attempts suicide to get to the hospital for them to get their first appointment with a psychiatrist?", "There is extra money in this proposed budget for mental health, but it can’t make up for the lack of enough money to meet the need over the past many years. That’s why we have a mental health crisis. That’s why the wait times are so long. Yet, the Liberals wonder why people are cynical about the promises tossed into this budget concoction.", "I just gave you two local Windsor examples. I could spend much more time listing other funding deficiencies over the past 15 years.", "No matter which party wins this election on the 7th of June, all politics aside, you are all invited: The John McGivney centre is inviting all of you to spend time with their young people two days later on June 9. Come out and see their wonderful facility, meet their dedicated staff and volunteers, and spend time with some of the warmest, most wonderful children you will ever meet, with smiles a mile wide. They’re holding a superhero day on June 9—you all would be welcome guests—at 3945 Matchette Road in Windsor.", "For some of us, this budget measures act and indeed this election will all come down to trust and credibility. It has been said that the most expensive thing in the world is trust. It takes years to earn, and it can be lost in a matter of seconds. Credibility is lost when there are big discrepancies between what our political leaders and parties say and what they do. Trust is built on credibility, and credibility comes from acting in the interest of others before your own. I don’t mean acting on behalf of the biggest developers in Canada, as opposed to the people you should be representing. A hidden agenda destroys trust in a heartbeat.", "Credibility matters to some of us, Mr. Speaker. Without character, there is no credibility. Without credibility, there is no trust.", "This budget is the epitome of a stretch goal, as the Premier likes to speak about when certain promises remain unfulfilled. Another stretch goal, the so-called fair hydro plan, will, according to the Auditor General, cost us an extra $28 billion.", "Speaker, there is new money in the budget for the health care system, but some of us say that system is not healthy; it’s not caring; it’s not a system that functions well. It is now and has been for a long time a system in crisis. For years, hospital budgets were frozen or just given enough to keep up with inflation. Mental health was given short shrift.", "Just recently, the two NDP members from London told us about Dawn Warren. She was in crisis. Her husband, David, tried to have her admitted. She was kept on a stretcher in a hallway, in mental distress, for five days and nights before a bed opened up for her on the mental health ward. No one with any credibility can justify that; that’s for certain.", "Time and time again in this House, we have heard, from all corners of the province, horrifying stories of hallway medicine: people on stretchers for days, and not just in the hallways, but in closets, TV rooms, washrooms, linen closets, broom closets. Why? Because there aren’t enough beds. Some of the people in hospital beds should be in beds in long-term-care homes, but we don’t have enough of them.", "The Liberals have been in power for 15 years in Ontario. They have bungled some very important files during their time in office. They’ve created crisis after crisis, and all the promises in this budget, all the King’s horses, all the King’s men won’t be able to put their credibility back together again, Speaker. They’ve lost the trust of most of the people in Ontario. Trust and credibility—that’s what this election will come down to. And the chickens have come home to roost.", "I look forward to hearing other people say more about this budget this afternoon—a budget that certainly cannot be supported." ],

I just want to raise a couple of them that I think most members in this House would at least be aware of.", "Has anybody gone to gas up their car or truck lately? Oh, my God. We’re paying $1.40 a litre. It’s about $1.35 here in Toronto. It’s not often that the Timmins gas prices are close to Toronto’s. We’re at $1.40. It is absolutely ridiculous. If you take a look at the price of a barrel today—I just looked online; it’s about $70 a barrel. Do you remember, Speaker, not that long ago when the price of oil was hovering around $120 to $130 a barrel, maybe five or six years ago? We were paying these prices. We were paying $1.40 a litre when the price of a barrel was up that high. The price of a barrel is half of what it used to be back then, and we’re paying the same price for gas at the pump that we used to pay when the price of a barrel was twice the price it is today. It makes no sense. Clearly, there’s some profit-taking going on in the industry. And in the end, who is getting it stuck to them? The people of this province and the people of this country are being stuck with gas prices that are way out of whack.", "What makes everybody even more upset—you drive and you say, “Do you know what? I’m looking at the price of gas. It’s $1.40 today.” Let’s say it’s on a Wednesday. You say, “Well, I might wait to gas up my car until the gas gauge goes a little bit lower.” You wait until the weekend, and the darn thing jumps up 10 cents, and you say, “My God, I should have bought it at $1.40. That was a deal.”", "It is really getting to be crazy. The price of gas is fluctuating everywhere, and it’s not even relating in the remotest way to what the price of a barrel is at.", "I would have hoped that the government, seeing these particular sky-high gas prices that we pay at the pump, would have said, “We’re going to do something in order to offset the price of gas.”", "The Conservatives talk about, “Well, we’ll give you back the gas tax once we scrap cap-and-trade—four and a half cents a litre.” Most people will say, “Hurrah.” But you know what the gas companies are going to do? They’re going to jump it up four and a half cents. Do you think for one second that if the Conservatives, Liberals or New Democrats were to lower the gas price tax those oil companies wouldn’t take the difference and put it back up on the price that we pay at the pump? We’d get gouged.", "The only way to fix this, quite frankly—and this is where we separate the New Democrats from the other two parties—is to come in with a form of gas price regulation and say, “Listen: In the end, if these large companies, a couple of big refineries that control most of the market in Canada, can’t get their act under control, and if they’re gouging the market, then we need to regulate it.”", "As I was telling a good friend of mine the other day—I was talking to a friend of mine, John, and his dad. They’re very strong Conservatives. In fact, I know my friend over here, Mr. Miller, would know who I’m talking about if I was to use the name. We had this very conversation. I said, “John, if you had competition, you probably would have a lower price.” If you think back to the day when we had a lot of independents that were operating in the system, those independents were dropping the price at the pump, and it was forcing the large Petrocans and Essos to drop their price to compete with the small independents. But what has happened? The large companies—the Petrocans and Essos of this world and others—have bought out the independents and driven them out of business. So now we’ve got the worst of both worlds: We’ve got a free market system with no competition. That’s what used to happen at the turn of the last century with railroads and a whole bunch of other things. Governments of the day—right-wing governments, people like Roosevelt; and I’m not talking about Franklin, I’m talking about his uncle Theodore—those guys started understanding that if there was no competition in a private market, you needed to find a way to set the playing field so that the public didn’t get gouged. They started to regulate certain industries in order to make sure that the right thing was done when it came to the consumer. There’s nothing about this in the budget.", "I just say I’m glad and I’m proud to be a New Democrat who is at least willing to take this issue on. I’m not promising for a second that the price of gas is going to drop down to 70 cents a litre; not at all. What will happen is the price will come down and become stable, and you will not see the types of swings we have today.", "The other thing that’s not in the budget, especially for us guys in the northern part of Ontario—that’s like north of Finch—" ],

What they would do is they would augment the service by hiring local contractors to come in to do some of the extra work that needed to be done if there were snowstorms etc. So you had kind of a competition, a system where you had private plow operators that would bid for work within MTO, and it kept the prices pretty reasonable.", "The Tories came in. They decided to start the privatization by increasing the amount of private plows, although they did keep the management of the system in place. But what you did is you outsourced and privatized the MTO plows. And here’s the irony: The Liberals, who were in opposition at the time, railed against the government of the day and said, “Oh, my God, you can’t have that happen. If you privatize the system, the price will go up and the quality will go down.” They got the power and what did they do? They completed the privatization by privatizing all of the plows, the management, the dispatching, the circuit times and everything. Now, we’ve got this crazy system that is privatized, where contractors sign contracts with the government and they’re supposedly penalized if they don’t follow what the contract says when it comes to winter road maintenance, but there are about 60% to 70% of the fines that aren’t even collected. So the government itself is admitting that the system they designed doesn’t work.", "Again, I’m proud of Andrea Horwath and the New Democrats, who are saying, in this upcoming election, that we can take that back. We first of all take back the management of the system, the patrolling of the system, deciding what the circuit times are, and as contracts with contractors come due, we decide which ones we don’t renew and how we deal with the plows by way of maybe a mix of MTO and private contractors. That’s yet to be seen, but that will be a system that will unfold with time.", "What that will do is bring us back to the day where we used to get on the highway when it would snow and not have to worry. I look at my good friend the member from Thunder Bay–Superior North. He drives highways the same way that I do and my other colleagues do. You never used to worry about driving on a northern highway unless there was a snow storm. If you had a bad snow storm and it was one of those really, really bad days, you didn’t take the road. You understood. But you know what? The highway was open. You didn’t hear of highway closures the way that you do now.", "Now you take a highway with a little bit of dusting and you’re lucky if you see a sand truck come by the next day, or a salt truck the day after. How many times has Highway 144 between Timmins and Sudbury been closed down as the result of winter road maintenance? How many times have we seen Highway 11 and Highway 655 closed down as a result of the privatization of highway maintenance?", "I’m just saying the government didn’t have to do this. It had a choice. Instead, what it did, unfortunately, was try to sort of say, “Hey, my friends in the private sector, how can I give you more access to public funds, and maybe we get something in return?” Who knows? I don’t know. I’ve got to believe something happened." ],

  "text" : [ "Mr. Speaker, I just want to take this occasion during this throne speech to outline a couple of things that I think the government needs to reflect on in light of this particular throne speech.", "This government is trying to put itself forward as a progressive government, a government that is doing the right things for all people all of the time. I don’t doubt that there is some goodwill on the part of government members and the government generally to do some of these things, but I think for them to try to portray themselves as being this hugely progressive government that’s always doing the right thing for all of the people all of the time leaves a little bit to be desired. I just want to go through two or three things that are happening where I live that I think exemplify what this government is not doing, and what they continue to fail to do even after this particular election.", "The first one is that the government says, “We’re the progressives. We’re the ones who are going to do what’s right for the people of Ontario and we’re going to stand to make sure that government is there for people when they need it.” Yet, when you look at northern Ontario, who is it that’s privatizing the ONTC? Who’s selling off Ontera? It’s the Liberal government across the way that’s decided that they’re going to take a mantra out of the Conservative books and themselves act like a bunch of Conservatives when they get to government and actually sell off Ontera, which is one of the profitable arms of the ONTC, the Ontario Northland Transportation Commission. They’re going to sell it off. Supposedly, Kathleen Wynne and the Liberals are trying to say, “Oh, we’re the progressives. We’re the ones who stand for making sure that we shore up services that people need across this province and make the investments that allow us to be able to function as a province.”", "I, for one, and I think a lot of members of my caucus, the NDP caucus, would agree that those investments are necessary. But why is it right for the government to have cancelled the only train that we have in northeastern Ontario, the only means to transport people all the way from Moosonee down to Toronto by rail—at the same time say it’s okay to cancel that but it’s also right to make an investment in transportation infrastructure—namely transit, subways and others—in the city of Toronto and other great cities of this province?", "Now, I want to say up front that I think the investments in the city of Toronto are needed. I think it’s yet to be determined, by the end of this particular four-and-a-half-year mandate, if the government actually would have moved on those issues. I think they portray this as an issue that they’re interested in, certainly, but when it comes to actually delivering for the people of the city of Toronto, I’m not convinced that, in fact, they’re going to do so. All I know, sitting as a northerner, is that I look at what is immediately affected by the people that I represent, and we have lost our only transportation train connection in northeastern Ontario.", "It is a Liberal government under Kathleen Wynne that has decided cancel the train. It was Dalton McGuinty’s government that started it, but certainly Kathleen Wynne could have reversed it. She had a year in government to do so before this election. Not only has she agreed to continue Dalton McGuinty’s legacy of cancelling the train, she has also said that she’s going to accelerate the sell-off of Ontera, the profitable telecommunications wing of Ontario Northland.", "So how can a government on the one hand, or, I say, a political party on the one hand portray itself as being this progressive movement that’s going to do all that is good for the people of Ontario and ensure to preserve public services, when they’re prepared to sell off Ontario Northland, an agency of the crown that has been there for over 100 years, something that even Mike Harris didn’t do, quite frankly, when he was in power? He had looked at the possibility of selling off the train to CN and decided to back off. Here we have the Liberals outdoing the Conservatives when it comes to a move to the right on privatization. So I say, in that particular example, job not well done.", "I look at another one, and this is somewhat related but very important to the economy of northern Ontario, and that’s in the case of forestry. We have mills across northern Ontario that have shut their doors partly because of, yes, what happened to the North American economy and what’s happened with the market when it comes to the sale of wood. But where you have people who are prepared to invest in their mills and to be able to keep their mills open and create the wealth and create the jobs in northern Ontario, there’s been little in the way of support from the government.", "I look at Little John Enterprises in the city of Timmins as a good example of that. Little John made an investment of quite a lot of money, over $1 million, in order to do an expansion to that mill, in order to be able to produce more and higher-quality wood that he can sell into the market. What he’s lacking is a commitment from the government on the part of wood allocation for that particular mill. When they did the expansion to the mill, there was an understanding that the government would make sure that there would be an allocation of timber that would go to that mill so that they can be guaranteed a supply of wood, as mills need to be able to operate. Here we are, a number of years after that mill is open, and Little John is still having to deal with the open market trying to get wood.", "Now, in a time where there are a lot of sawmills that are down as a result of the shutdown we’ve seen in northern Ontario, he’s able to get some wood. But he’s able to get wood at a much higher price, which means to say that his operating cost is higher and he is not secured should the market turn around, and it will turn around. In time, there will be a huge demand for wood, and what does an operator like Little John Enterprises do when trying to compete with the large multinationals that operate mills in northeastern Ontario? He will be at a disadvantage when it comes to the price of wood because he will have to compete on the open market, and that’s not how the wood allocation system should have worked in the first place.", "The wood allocation system was always that you allot wood to a mill so that they’re guaranteed a supply so that they can finance themselves and they can operate knowing what the price of the wood is going to be. What this government has done is taken the wood allocation system and turned it entirely on its ear. I just say to the government across the way, that is not what a progressive government does. What a progressive government does is it finds a way to balance the interests of large and small when it comes to operators in the forest industry and makes sure that the public will and the public good is reflected in the policies that come forward.", "Put on top of that what you’ve done with the price of hydro. You have managed to put places likes Xstrata Copper—where I represent—in the city of Timmins out of business as a result of the high price of power, but those that still stand, like Little John, like Tembec which operates a paper mill up in Kapuskasing, and a number of operators in my riding and across northern Ontario—you’ve really put those people in a hard position.", "Where was the government speaking about how they’re going to make hydro affordable for homeowners and how they’re going to make hydro affordable for industry in this province as a progressive move? Somehow or other they tried to say that we, as New Democrats, because we said that it’s important that people have affordable power when it comes to being able to power up their homes and not having to pay hydro bills that are going through the roof—they were trying to say that somehow or other that wasn’t a progressive thing to do. Well, I’m sorry. If mum and dad, if Jane and Joe Ontario, are not able to pay their hydro bills, I don’t see that, quite frankly, as a progressive thing. I see that as regressive.", "What politics should be about is about making sure that people are able to live in this province, able to prosper in this province and able to afford to purchase the services that they need. So I just say to the government across the way, you can, as much as you want, try to position yourself as being progressive, but for those people back home who are trying to pay their hydro bills, to those industries back home that are trying to pay their hydro bills, I don’t think being progressive is doing nothing about the price of electricity. In fact, your own Minister of Energy, prior to the last election, said that hydro rates would be going up yet another 44% over the next number of years—that on top of increases that we’ve had in hydro alone already that have put electricity prices through the roof.", "So this government can try to pretend as much as they want that in fact they are a progressive government. I believe that this government is essentially a Conservative government in action, one that campaigns like New Democrats in order to sound good during the campaign, but when they get to government continues doing the same kinds of things and the old kind of politics that we’ve seen around this place for far too long." ],

It’s hard to believe that the member from James Bay would accuse the Liberal Party or the government of being Conservative. If anybody took part in the last election, which I’m sure he did, and I did—I mean, they had no platform. They kind of borrowed from Conservatives, from us. We talked about an Ontario pension plan, which was their idea, frankly, Speaker, and they turned their backs on seniors in Ontario when the time came.", "They talk a lot about the cost of energy, and he’s right: The energy costs are high. But it would be nice to see a suggestion from them or the official opposition about what they would do. It’s fine to complain. Yes, gasoline is expensive. I drive about 3,000 or 4,000 kilometres a month and I know how expensive gasoline is. But they never make any concrete suggestions—I’m not even saying concrete that one could apply, but even to suggest something that would alleviate some of those costs.", "Speaker, they are in opposition, and I respect their role to hold the government accountable, but it would also be very nice to partner with us as a government to find the proper solution, not just throwing windows in the air.", "I look forward to the rest of the debate on the throne speech.

We have a government that is promising a tremendous amount on one side, and a tremendous amount of expectations on the other side. Speaker, you simply can’t have both. We’ve got a $12.5-billion deficit forecast for this year, up from $11.3 billion last year, up from $9.2 billion the year before. Obviously, the deficits are going the wrong way: They’re getting larger instead of smaller. Yet the promises are also growing. So you’ve got a growing deficit that the government promises to bring to balance in 2017-18, and you’ve got a growing list of expenses. This budget that they’re bringing next week offers $5.7 billion in new spending, yet somehow they are magically going to balance the deficit, which is at $12.5 billion this year. So as a result, we’ve seen Moody’s, we’ve seen BlackRock, we’ve seen other credit agencies and financial institutions offer downgrades, offer outlook downgrades, offer warnings, offer credit warnings; we see the cost of our money and borrowing going up. We’re seeing a tremendous amount of pressure because we have a deteriorating balance sheet, yet the government continues to go on a spending spree." ],

In case you didn’t know, I’m a late bloomer, so to speak. In fact, I did not become a Liberal candidate in Barrie until almost one week into the writ. I was moved to act when the former Leader of the Opposition announced his plan to eliminate 100,000 public sector jobs. Quite ironically, the announcement was made at the Barrie Country Club.", "As a teacher in Barrie, I lived through the turmoil caused by reckless cuts in the 1990s.

It’s part of this government’s uploading of costs, an approach that benefited Barrie taxpayers by $11 million last year alone. The annual benefit will be over $17 million by the time the uploading is completed in 2018. Other capital projects included one third of the cost of returning GO Transit to Barrie, a new fire station and the expansion of the Lake Simcoe airport.", "Investments to local education included lower class sizes, higher graduation rates, full-day kindergarten and additions at three Barrie secondary schools and funding two new buildings at Georgian College.", "As a kindergarten teacher at Terry Fox Elementary School in Barrie, I have personally witnessed the benefits of the programs currently in place because of government funding. Students who may come from homes without having eaten because of their hectic schedule in the mornings or because there is no money to have food in the house for breakfast, or just because they are growing quickly and need more food than was in their lunch boxes that day, are able to get nutritious food whenever they need it throughout the day, no questions asked. Students who have full stomachs are much more able to learn than those who are hungry.", "I have also been fortunate to be part of implementing full-day kindergarten, and I wasn’t too much of a believer at first. I truly am a believer now. This program will be implemented in all schools across the province this fall. It not only saves young families thousands of dollars in daycare costs and allows both parents to be part of the workforce, it better prepares our young children for their future academic life. They learn more quickly. Little Peyton was three and a half when she entered my JK class last September. She had not yet learned to read or write. As a result of this new program, she will be heading into senior kindergarten socially and academically ahead of where she would have been in the old program. Peyton and her classmates have progressed much more quickly than they would have before, where there were times that I didn’t see them for a whole week. They are well prepared. They are almost ready for grade 1, and still have senior kindergarten to go. They are all reading and writing already.", "I was also thrilled to see little people with very problematic teeth issues get them fixed because of government funding. A member yesterday said that that promise had not been implemented. Very clearly, for the last three years I have seen evidence of it in all the kindergarten classes in our school and in all areas.", "After many years of uncertainty, Barrie’s boundary issue with the town of Innisfil was resolved, and the city of Barrie is able to move forward with their expansion.", "Job creation is a big part of the growth plan for the Simcoe area, aided by a continued increase in GO train service. The number of trains and the number of cars for weekday service have continually increased and we have seen the introduction of weekend and summer GO train service. We hope that eventually people from Toronto will come to Barrie, step off at the station at Allandale, walk across the street to the beach and enjoy Barrie’s facilities.", "Not to be forgotten from the list are the cleanup of Lake Simcoe, capital and operating funds for local non-profit agencies, social housing, affordable housing, literacy, theatre and other cultural events.", "In addition to increases in funding for the rent bank and other housing initiatives, in March 2011, former MPP Carroll announced the official opening of 125 Bayfield Street in Barrie, a 43-unit building which received more than $3 million from the Canada-Ontario affordable housing program for the construction of new housing units for seniors and people with disabilities. Almost $4 million was provided through the same program for the construction of 31 new housing units at Stanley Heights, another affordable housing project for seniors in Barrie. It’s right beside my school, and those seniors come over and volunteer every day. It’s wonderful.", "Unprecedented investments were made to local health care, too, with well over $300 million to RVH for the construction of the new cancer centre and renovations. Millions more were given to reduce wait times and for other projects at our hospital, like a portable radiation unit and $2.5 million in start-up funding for the family medicine teaching unit. RVH has received over 40% in increased base funding since 2003, and that was a Liberal government.", "Other health initiatives included a new long-term-care home for Barrie, the introduction of nurse-practitioner-led clinics and the Aging at Home program. We now have more nurses, and more people have access to front-of-the-line health care services. Former MPP Aileen Carroll worked very hard on securing funds for a hospice in Barrie and she was pleased to announce almost $3 million, half the cost in capital funding, to build Hospice Simcoe. Doors opened in 2009, and since then, well over 1,000 residents have received care and comfort from our dedicated health care professionals in a home-like setting. This is what we want for our seniors. In their final days at our 10-bed residence, they were very comfortable when they passed away.", "Our community programs like Visiting Hospice and grief and bereavement support reach hundreds more each year. Although Barrie already has a hospice, the present government, our government, should work towards increasing the number of hospices in Ontario. Hospice palliative care is a good thing to do. Many more ridings want and need it. It’s something we should all work towards, and it lessens the burden and the costs on hospital facilities.", "In 2007, $2.5 million was announced for start-up of the family medicine teaching unit, which is located at Rotary House in the RVH site. In partnership with RVH and the U of T, the Barrie teaching unit is where residents manage their own practice of up to 300 patients each. The number of resident doctors has increased each year. There were 18 in 2012. Fortunately, many of these doctors love it in Barrie, and on leaving the residency program have stayed in Barrie as family physicians, alleviating the doctor shortage for families.", "My personal experiences with the health care system in 2000, during another government, were not that unusual at the time. I got a diagnosis that no family wants to get. I had breast cancer. At that time, patients could get their chemotherapy at Royal Victoria hospital in Barrie, but most patients had to travel far away to get radiation therapy, to North Bay or maybe Buffalo. This type of diagnosis is frightening enough without being told that you have to leave the support and comfort of your family to be treated for your illness in another location, maybe even another country.", "One young woman I met had no support system to look after her young toddler, so she made the tough decision to have a double mastectomy so she could stay in Barrie. What a terrible choice she had to make. That no longer has to happen because of the Liberal government.", "Now, because of the Liberal government, funding for all treatment can be done in Barrie in the Royal Victoria Regional Health Centre and the cancer care clinic. No question, Barrie is absolutely better off as a result of having a Liberal government at Queen’s Park.", "As a partner with this government, Barrie will continue to grow and thrive as we take the next steps in building our community and expanding opportunity for all.", "This is how Barrie has grown: Ours is a history of building up this province. Barrie’s beginnings can be traced back to the First Nations people, using the western shores of Kempenfelt Bay as a place of rest before travelling the portage that ran between Lake Simcoe and the Nottawasaga River to Lake Huron.", "The War of 1812 resulted in increased use, allowing the British troops and supplies to bypass the American forces at Detroit. At the war’s end, settlers arrived and took up residence at the end of the portage, beginning the traces of modern-day Barrie. The British military presence is reflected in many street names and even in the name of our city itself, in honour of British admiral Sir Robert Barrie.", "As our city grew, it began to export local resources. Trees nearly 200 feet tall were logged and shipped out, serving as masts for British ships and railroad ties. In the winter months, huge blocks of ice were cut from the frozen waters of Kempenfelt Bay and shipped down to Toronto, Buffalo and New York for refrigeration purposes. Three large storage houses enabled the blocks to be effectively stored for shipment during the summer months.", "Between the late 1800s and the early 20th century, Barrie underwent a number of changes that contributed to its rapid growth. The long-anticipated railroad connection in 1865 joined Barrie to the city of York, its resources and industry, a connection that is maintained now. But it was the building of Highway 400 in 1950, providing tourists easy access and exposure to our beautiful city by the bay, that made Barrie the favourite for family fun in central Ontario.", "Today Barrie’s population stands at more than 140,000 and continues to be one of Canada’s fastest growing cities. Remembering our heritage and what led to our city’s success is the focus of some of our key attractions.", "This is what the plan laid out in this throne speech will do, not just for Barrie but for all of Ontario’s communities, and that is why I will vote in support of it.", "Finally, I would like to congratulate every one of the 107 members of this House on their recent election. Politics is a blood sport and it’s a very difficult time, and we all worked hard. Congratulations to those who are here and those who did not make it. I look forward to working with all of you to build Ontario up." ],

You as a new member and me, there are different ways that we can change things in here, and that’s through our decorum and how we are addressing each other. I’m hopeful.

I can’t comment specifically on her speech, because it was very personal and very directed at the riding, but I do want to talk about the throne speech itself and how this government has put itself into quite a box.

They’re saying, “Oh, there will be tough decisions.” Well, it’s about time we started to talk about those tough decisions, because their hand-picked adviser, Don Drummond, has said that they can’t get to balance without making some serious changes. They’ve got to tell us what services they plan to cut here in the province of Ontario. They’ve got to tell us who’s going to get laid off in the province of Ontario, as far as public servants are concerned. We talked about that during the campaign, recognizing that in order to get to balance those tough decisions would have to be made, and we were prepared to make them, but this government wants to dance all around the issue and hope that the tooth fairy shows up sometime before 2017-18—or the fairy godmother—with a bag of money to pay off the deficit. But that’s not going to happen. We live in the real world here, and you people have to start managing the government like you’re in the real world, not in Walt Disney’s Fantasia." ],

We do find ourselves back at Queen’s Park with a newly formed Liberal majority government, so congratulations to those who won their elections, and we look forward to working together with you.", "Speaker, I do want to get to the point of the matter, and that’s about Ontario’s fiscal reality. At this time in Ontario’s history, it’s a very difficult and frightening truth that we have to confront. Unfortunately, this Liberal government, through the past 10 years and now, currently avoids looking at this reality. But a problem doesn’t go away just because you ignore it. Just like a pile of dust and dirt starts to form when you continue to sweep it under the rug, Ontario’s debt continues to pile up when you neglect to restrain spending. The biggest problem in this government is that it continues to sweep bigger and bigger piles of dirt under the rug. The projected deficit, according to their spring budget, will be $12.5 billion for 2014-15. That’s an increase of $1.2 billion over their projected deficit of $11.3 billion for 2012-13. Our debt level as a percentage of GDP is also set to rise to 40.8% by 2015-16.", "To keep things in perspective, when the PCs left office in 2003 the debt level had been reduced to about 28% of GDP. Tough decisions were made by the PC government during the 1990s, but that government left Ontario’s fiscal house and capacity to invest in the best shape it has ever been. Unfortunately, for the past 11 years, this government has squandered billions of dollars and has put us in the deepest hole in Ontario’s history.", "While we tried to bring this message to the voters this spring, it was overshadowed not only by a myriad of cheap promises from the Liberals but also an avalanche of third party ads produced by groups that had vested interests in the Liberals being re-elected.", "Just as a side note for all Ontarians watching here today who may have become sick and tired with the ubiquity of negative ads during the election, please don’t forget that it was the PC Party that put forward a bill in the last session to reduce third party advertising. As was expected, the Liberals voted against this legislation, despite the fact that every other province in the country has some form of third party advertising legislation. Nevertheless, I was disappointed by the results of the election on our party. The establishment of a majority government, regardless of whichever party, does present a number of valuable opportunities going forward.", "As I mentioned, our province is facing a severe debt and deficit crisis. However, if the Liberals wanted to, they could, as a majority government, decide to unilaterally bring down spending—put spending controls in place. It’s not a very easy process and requires political will and fortitude, but with a majority government, at least the Liberals would not have to worry about having their major initiatives voted down.", "In the days after June 12, I tried to assure myself that there would be a possibility—a little possibility—that firm action would be taken to bring our province back from the fiscal brink. Without the constraints of a minority government, it was my hope that even this Liberal government couldn’t deny how bad Ontario’s fiscal reality truly is. They couldn’t deny that Ontario resembles Greece 15 years ago. They couldn’t deny that our debt burden is worse than California’s. By acknowledging this reality, I had hoped that even the Liberal government would step up and make the tough decisions to rein in spending to eliminate our deficit and start to reduce our debt.", "However, last week’s throne speech dashed all of my hopes. It set forward an agenda that is virtually the same as the old one, and that’s to say that it’s the same agenda that in 10 years doubled a debt level that had taken 100 years to accrue. There’s really no surprise from the throne speech that this government will now be eager to reintroduce its spring budget. The throne speech was certainly written with that in mind. And so Ontario will get to again see a budget that hikes taxes, increases spending and creates more job-killing policies while future generations get saddled with more and more debt. It may be interesting to note that the hour we spent in the chamber during the throne speech cost the people of Ontario an additional $1.34 million in debt. That’s how much our debt increases each hour, $1.34 million. I truly can’t believe how blind this government is to face the reality. Even when news articles after news articles from publications ranging from the Toronto Star to the Huffington Post warn this government of the perils of continuing to overspend, Premier Wynne and her team remain steadfastly committed to building a bigger debt pile. While pundits and investors cower in fear at the house of cards that is Ontario, this government continues to operate without a care in the world. Perhaps they don’t understand the consequences.", "So as a member of this Legislature, it is my duty to take the time that I have here today to outline the looming negative consequences that face Ontario under the vision outlined in the throne speech. It would be my hope that these Liberals finally start to take more seriously the fiscal situation of this province—" ],

  "text" : [ "But I’m getting the impression, and I’m hearing it now, too many promises were made during the election to too many special interests. Certainly, if the government is serious about making the decisions necessary to eliminate our deficit, they will no doubt alienate some of their biggest special interest supporters.", "Perhaps the biggest sign of Ontario’s financial distress came on the same day the Lieutenant Governor delivered the Liberals’ throne speech. As we all know Moody’s Investors Service has lowered the outlook for Ontario’s debt from stable to negative. While this isn’t actually a downgrade, it is an indication that Moody’s is prepared to downgrade Ontario’s debt unless significant action is taken to balance the budget.", "It’s great that some of the Liberals came out and said that they’re committed to balancing the budget by 2017-18. However, it’s the job of the analysts at Moody’s to dig deeper and look below the surface to verify whether in fact the actions and directions set out by this government credibly support their deficit reduction target. I tell you right now, I’m not a financial expert and it’s not that difficult to see why Moody’s affirmed what the PC Party has been saying all along. By referring to the Liberal budget as a credit-negative budget, Moody’s is telling the Ontario people that the budget that triggered the election, the same budget that will be introduced next week, does not contain the measures necessary to instill confidence in Ontario’s debt.", "While the Liberals say that they will balance the budget by 2017-18, Moody’s has noticed that most of the heavy lifting in terms of spending restraint will occur in the back end of the plan. In other words, the Liberals are saying, “Let’s not worry about doing any heavy lifting today. Let’s worry about it tomorrow.”", "But what concerns us in the PC caucus and what concerns the analysts at Moody’s is that the approach is fundamentally risky. Circumstances can change, and to be honest the Liberals have not been good at sticking to their plan. Their most recent budget revised the projected deficits of 2014-15 and 2015-16 upward by about $1.5 billion and $2.5 billion respectively. That is to say, last year’s plan, which also committed to balancing the budget by 2017-18, projected deficits of $10.8 billion and $5.1 billion in 2014-15 and 2015-16 respectively. However, this year those projected deficits are now $12.5 billion and $7.6 billion.", "So it’s great for the Liberals to say that they will have balanced the budget by 2017-18, but if every year they keep revising their deficit projections up and up, it becomes mathematically impossible to balance the budget.", "Another concern we share with Moody’s is that the road to balance as laid out by the Liberals relies heavily on a surge in Ontario’s economy. I’ve always been of the opinion that most prudent plans attempt to take action on things you can control. Doing so reduces the risk other factors have that may derail your plan. Unfortunately, Liberals are heavily relying on the health of Ontario’s economy to achieve balance. Again, circumstances can change.", "Everyone predicted that Ontario would rebound faster than it has. However, as we’ve all seen in the past few years, the economy can be fickle and it’s been particularly slow to rebound following 2008. Therefore to pin Ontario’s fiscal strategy primarily on this factor is imprudent, particularly when we so clearly have a spending problem. Maybe that’s part of the problem.", "The government has conditioned itself to think that spending is not the issue. I hear them say it in every press conference where they get asked about spending restraint. I also hear them blame the recession for Ontario’s fiscal woes. All of these tactics amount to abdication of responsibility by the government for the mess that it is in and the mess that it alone created. I’ll go on and prove that as I continue.", "If we consider the last budget of the Ernie Eves government, we can note that Ontario’s revenues were $66.5 billion and expenditures were $54.3 billion. In the most recent Wynne budget, revenues are $118.9 billion and expenditures are $130.4 billion. For those sitting across the aisle who still think revenue is an issue, just consider the fact that over that 11-year period, revenues have increased by 79%. On an average, compounded-yearly basis, this is about 7% a year—7%. That has been consistently higher than inflation. It has been consistently higher than the real GDP growth, and has been consistently higher than most other provinces.", "The only thing that the growth rate hasn’t been higher than is the growth rate in expenditures. Over the same period of time, expenditures have increased by 140%, or roughly 13% on an annualized basis. Expenditure growth in Ontario has nearly doubled that of revenues on a yearly basis. Just once I’d like to see a member of the government stand here and tell me that they’ve spent too much, because quite simply they have.", "One more thing to reinforce the fact that our problem is a spending problem and not a shortfall of revenues is that our personal tax rate is the third-highest in the country. Only Nova Scotia and Quebec have marginal tax rates that are higher than Ontario’s. Why does this matter? It matters because once people, investors, companies and countries lose confidence in Ontario’s debt, our interest rates will rise. Interest already costs the taxpayers $11 billion per year. That’s almost 10 cents of every dollar the Ontario people pay in taxes to the government goes to paying the interest on our outstanding debt. That’s $11 billion that is not going to our schools, our hospitals or improving our roads. And the frightening thing is interest rates will become a larger portion of the budget going forward.", "According to the budget plan, the Liberals intend to restrain spending. They anticipate total expenditures will increase by 1% less than GDP over the next few years. This means that according to the Ministry of Finance’s own numbers, the justice budget will increase an average of 1% each year; children’s and social services will increase at just under 4% each year; post-secondary and training will increase at 1% each year; and both education and health care will increase an average of 2% each year. The total we pay in interest on our debt will increase at a staggering 8% each year—8%.", "In order to balance all these increases, there is a big “other” section in the Ontario budget that calls for yearly decreases of about 6%. But what falls under that category? I don’t know, which is the problem, because it makes the entire spending restraint part of the Liberal plan uncertain and abstract. It’s no wonder Moody’s has revised its outlook on our debt.", "What was interesting to note was that while Wynne supporters rallied in support around her on the evening of June 12, investors and traders were also responding to Wynne’s victory. The Friday morning after the election, investors responded to the news of Kathleen Wynne’s election as Premier and that the Ontario budget would go forward as a result. Their message was loud and clear: By 10:20 a.m., the yield on Ontario’s long-term bonds jumped two basis points, the biggest one-day jump since January. What does that mean exactly? Well, interest rates and bond prices are inversely related. When the price of a bond goes down, the interest rates go up. The reason is prices go down because people don’t want the bonds and therefore the interest that’s offered on these bonds has to rise to entice more buyers. In short, the morning after Premier Wynne won the election, investors from all over the world were trying to get rid of bonds like they were infected. With more people selling than buying, the interest rate yield went up.", "The head of the Canadian fixed-income division at BlackRock, the world’s biggest money manager, says: “We’re on high alert that S&P will downgrade Ontario.... She’s front-loading the deficit or the total debt in anticipation future years will benefit from stronger growth.” The S&P is “just looking at the raw numbers and they’re seeing a deteriorating financial balance sheet.”", "Translation: S&P could downgrade Ontario’s debt very soon. This will mean Ontarians will have more of their hard-earned tax dollars going to pay interest rates that will get higher and higher every year. This will mean less money every year that can be invested in health care, education, infrastructure, the environment and agriculture. And let’s not forget that this Liberal government has brought us to this point, and it’s the Liberal government that, with their throne speech, is refusing to get us out.", "I’d like to talk a little bit now about job creation. As I’ve discussed, the Liberal budget relies heavily on strengthening Ontario’s economy to achieve a balance. However, the throne speech offered nothing in the ways of credible job creation policies. In fact, one of the pillars of the plan is the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan, which is not only not a job creator, it is a flat-out job killer. Regardless of how Wynne dresses it up, we all know this pension amounts to a payroll tax. Every business in Ontario will be required to contribute 1.9% of earnings for every employee who makes less than $90,000.", "Let’s assume you have a factory or business that employs 100 people at about $50,000 per person, and that’s about the size of any mid-size factory. That means that under the Ontario pension plan, the business will have to pay an additional $100,000 in expenses—$100,000 extra. I don’t know about the rest of you, but I think that’s a lot of money.", "What scares me about this is that, in my riding, I have seen 6,300 good manufacturing jobs erased since 2008. While the recession certainly played a factor, many of these companies like Ford are still making cars; it’s just that they’ve determined it’s not worth making cars in our part of Ontario. Now you’re telling the businesses that stuck it out through the depths of the recession and had faith enough to keep their factories in Ontario that their reward is a $100,000 yearly expense, courtesy of the Ontario government. I can’t think of anything more asinine or detrimental to job creation than that.", "What really troubles me was when I read comments delivered by the CEO of Magna during their annual general meeting. First of all, we have to appreciate that Magna has a storied history in Ontario. Its culture and roots are embedded here. That makes it different from other foreign-owned companies that have less of a vested interest in Ontario. Foreign companies may come and go on occasion, but Magna derives much of its identity from being in Ontario.", "And I can understand why: There’s a Magna plant in my riding. It does advanced manufacturing, employs my neighbours and provides a decent living for hundreds of people in St. Thomas. So it troubles me when I heard the Magna CEO state that Magna would no longer be investing in Ontario. It’s not closing any plants at this point, but any benefits of expanding in Ontario are outweighed by the costs. The reason the costs outweigh the benefits, according to Magna, are high energy rates and the proposed Ontario Retirement Pension Plan, which would cost Magna $35 million a year.", "This decision by the company is not rooted in broader economic malaise; it’s directly related to policies enacted by this government. Their own bureaucrats warned them that the Ontario pension plan would drive over 100,000 jobs out of the province.", "Obviously, it’s too early to have lost that many jobs already, but Magna’s position is certainly an indictment of the plan and a dark omen of the future that awaits Ontario. When I look at how consistently misguided this Liberal government is when it comes to fiscal and economic policy, sometimes I think they will not be happy until all the manufacturing jobs in Ontario are eliminated.", "The bottom line is that the Liberals have a four-year mandate. We in the PC caucus will continue to sound the alarm, and hopefully this government will take the decisive action that’s needed to avert a full fiscal disaster. We in the PC Party believe in the services that this government provides, but we also need, at the same time, to be fiscally prudent so that these services may continue: to provide the health care for our seniors, to provide protection in the environment and to ensure that we have infrastructure. All of these are on the line when this government continues to spend and spend, and our debt levels continue to rise.", "It’s like running a household, Mr. Speaker: You can only run the credit card so far before things start having to be cut away. This government has run that far. It’s time to take a look at their policies. It’s time to bring forth the policy in this upcoming budget—there’s still time to change it—to ensure that fiscal restraint is in order and that we can protect future generations like my daughter, our kids, our grandkids down the road, so that they are not saddled with this debt, so that they can have a health care and an education system much like we were allowed to have during the Bill Davis years when we were growing up.", "So I’m hoping this government steps forward, starts listening to the PC Party caucus and implements some of these restraints so that, going forward, we’ll have a stronger and more prosperous Ontario." ],

Bev herself says, “The volunteers would not rest until each school was on board and offering food to children in need.”", "Mr. Speaker, I’m encouraged by their resolve and passion. It is evident that no child can learn while hungry and that the breakfast program is critical to our children and youth’s well-being and is critical to starting their day ready to learn.", "Grey Bruce Eat and Learn has enjoyed tremendous support from the local community as well as the Ministry of Children and Youth Services, but we can’t stop here. I encourage all members in this House to donate to it so we can serve more schools and students who have long bus rides, who don’t eat breakfast at home or who may not get food anywhere else. With the cost of a healthy breakfast being about $1 per child, your donation could help to ensure that healthy food choices—bagels with cream cheese and jam; egg and cheese sandwiches; fruit; yogourt; chocolate milk; the list is endless—continue to be available on a daily basis to all students in need. Your donation can and does mean a lot." ],

As I see so far, you have definitely earned my respect in terms of the work you do.", "I’d like to take a moment and really congratulate everybody who put their name on a ballot, regardless of which party. It takes a lot to put your name on the ballot—a hard campaign. To the new MPPs in the House and to those aged—those who have come back—congratulations. Sorry, Paul.", "I am going to take quite a bit of time to talk about my predecessor, Rick Bartolucci. I think that Rick, when you take into account the fact that he gave up about two decades in this House, close to 20 years, and then city council previous to that—he has shown his commitment to Sudbury. He has shown that he was willing and able to sacrifice, especially for those of us who come outside the GTA, family time to serve the public. He should be congratulated and commended for the time he has given to the public sector.", "During the election campaign, he was very cordial; always a gentleman. I spoke to him a couple of days ago—three or four days ago—and again, very friendly, and I always appreciated his friendship. In terms of his legacy, I think when we think of Highway 69, him working in a minority government situation to bring forward the importance of twinning or four-laning Highway 69, doing it—and I remember very well his postcard petitions. I’m sure he’s still watching to make sure Highway 69 gets done, and I’ll speak to that later on.", "I’d like to also thank our leader, the New Democrat leader from Hamilton Centre. She campaigned vigorously during the campaign, whether it was zigzagging the province via automobile, via bus or airplane, selling our platform, speaking to a lot of people. During the campaign, she came to Sudbury two times, and we did a town hall phone meeting as well. Her time in Sudbury is very much appreciated. The fact that we received or earned over a million votes, I think, is testament to the fact—and that’s the highest amount since 1990—that people want us here, the New Democrats, to keep the government to account.", "I knocked on many doors—probably 6,000 or 7,000 doors—and the themes that I heard very clearly were affordability, accountability, jobs, senior support, and the need for infrastructure money to deal with the pothole situation we have in Sudbury. People are talking about affordability, especially when you talk about hydro rates and price of gas for automobiles, which in Sudbury for some reason is 10, 12 or 14 cents, sometimes even higher, compared to municipalities not too far down the road, as well as keeping the home heating gas, natural gas, the lowest rates possible. Insurance rates also came up at the door as being too high in Ontario.", "The issue with affordability is that people want more money left in their pockets at the end of each month. People want to be able to save for the education of their children. Seniors want to stay home as long as possible. People want to have money left over to do other things like, as we heard in Sudbury, taking their children on a trip, for example.", "Accountability: People are quite clear in their belief that we can’t talk about cutting services and yet have money wasted by government. The tax dollar and the taxpayer in Ontario need to be respected.", "When we talk about jobs in Sudbury, we went through a phase of many of our youth leaving Sudbury for other municipalities, other cities, and even out of the country for jobs. We want our youth and our young adults to stay in Sudbury and to find work. That’s why the Ring of Fire is so extremely important, not only for all of northern Ontario, but obviously for Sudbury in the smelting that would happen north of Capreol." ],

The people of Sudbury have been very generous. I received over 14,000 votes and won about 70% of the polls. I can tell you that I represented ward 1 at city council.

We are a city of lakes, 330 lakes, actually, in our borders, and fantastic people. Maclean’s, a few years ago, declared that Sudbury had some of the friendliest people in Canada because of the volunteer hours that they put forward.", "We are a community of communities; the city of Sudbury was amalgamated in 1999-2000. Fourteen years later, we are a better city for it, I believe, or a greater Sudbury, and yet we’ve preserved the differences within each community. I think that is a wonderful aspect of greater Sudbury—a strong francophone community which we’re very proud of, anglophones, a multicultural community and a community of First Nations, which is growing. The multiculturalism can be seen through the festivals I listed earlier today, traditional gatherings and different events throughout the riding.", "Sudbury is known for being a mining community. We have a rich history in mining, and we will have a long future in mining. One of the other industries that came out of mining is the mining supply and services industry, which provides employment for thousands of people. The mining supply and services sector sells supplies, services, talents and technologies around the world. We are very fortunate to have them in our community.", "We are a health referral centre of northeastern Ontario, with a lot of research happening in health, science, ecology and mining.", "We are a retail hub of the north, with commercial outlets seemingly opening every year.", "We can boast of three post-secondary educational institutions. We have Laurentian University, Cambrian College and Collège Boréal. Laurentian University, which I am an alumnus of, is bilingual. I can tell you that since I graduated in 1991, we can now boast of a faculty of education, a northern medical school and, last year, a northern school of architecture, which is changing the landscape of downtown Sudbury.", "Cambrian College, which my wife graduated from, has wonderful programs. I can tell you her education is serving her well. It’s also a bilingual institution.", "Collège Boréal, which is one of two French colleges in Ontario—the only one in northern Ontario—has fantastic programs like trades for women.", "If you’re into summer and winter activities, Sudbury—Greater Sudbury, the Sudbury riding and Nickel Belt—is the place to be. In the summer, enjoy our lakes, the fishing, motorized and non-motorized trails and a lot of campgrounds. There’s just so much to do. In the winter, a fantastic amount—a plethora—of winter activities: skating on Ramsey Lake, which is in the centre of our city; skating in the skating oval at Queen’s Athletic Field; snowshoeing; snowmobiling; cross-country skiing; downhill skiing—there’s just so much to do. I welcome everyone to join us in Sudbury.", "Sudbury has 160,000 people, approximately, and here’s the challenge that we face as a community and as a city council: We have approximately 60,000 ratepayers and about 40,000 waste water ratepayers. That number is lower because some draw water from private wells, some draw water from lakes and some have private septic systems.", "That might sound like a nice, cozy city, and it is. However, here’s the challenge that city council faces in Sudbury: the fact that our area is huge—3,200 square kilometres. Just to put that in context, 15 southern Ontario cities fit within our border. Toronto, Mississauga, Newmarket, Orangeville, Richmond Hill, Ajax, Oakville, Oshawa, Aurora, Burlington, Vaughan, Pickering, Grimsby and Whitchurch all fit within our border. We have a small amount of ratepayers, relatively speaking, to other communities, paying for a large geographic area.", "What does that mean? Approximately 3,600 lane kilometres of roads; 873 kilometres of water main; 793 kilometres of sewage pipe; 14 arenas; 13 libraries; 68 sanitary lift stations; 25 fire stations; 620 municipal buildings; 21 deep wells; two water treatment plants; 10 waste water treatment plants; 11 ambulance stations; seven community service centres, because some people live quite a distance from the downtown; and approximately 406—I’m sure that number’s small now; I’m sure it’s grown—fields, playgrounds and other parks.", "So again, that’s the challenge that we face in Sudbury as a community: a small amount of ratepayers paying for this entire geography. When it comes to, for example, Maley Drive—which I’m glad the Liberal government has said numerous times during radio ads during the election that it would support—the Maley Drive extension is a road that city councils have been looking to build for over 20 years. It’s a road that’s parallel to Lasalle Boulevard, which would take the slurry trucks off of a commercial route which is used by residents. These slurry trucks are beating up our roads. It would take them to another route, which would make life safer and have less effect on our current roads.", "Some 3,600 lane kilometres of roads means we need a lot of money to maintain them. There are a lot of potholes in Sudbury and, again, a small amount of taxpayers to pay to support the road system that exists. The taxpayers are tapped-out in Sudbury. That’s why, when I hear that monies will be spread across northern Ontario, hopefully Sudbury and Nickel Belt will not be forgotten. The city council has put forth an unprecedented $35 million towards road repairs; it should be $70 million. There’s a shortfall we have—and we’re not even going to talk about the infrastructure, the sewer and water underneath the road.", "I look forward to my critic portfolio in transportation. As a city councillor, I think I have some background and insight in the area. We do need new, better and safer highways. We do need to keep reviewing winter maintenance and making sure that our roads are as safe as possible in the winter. In Sudbury, we undertook that review with front-line workers, union members, management and councillors. Again, it’s always under review to ensure the safety of our residents. Public transportation and active transportation are vital.", "Highway 69: I’ll speak about that for a while. I think Highway 69 was also in the media during the election campaign. I can tell you, it needs to be completed for the safety of our residents. Too many lives have been lost, with too many injuries on that highway. The four-laning has to be done. I can tell you, I will be pushing that issue with my colleague from Nickel Belt, I’m sure. It has been “on the radar” of the government and it needs to be completed sooner rather than later.", "And of course, bridges need repair, not just in municipalities but across the province.", "In terms of the throne speech, Liberals make big promises, but we need to remember some facts and some information. Unemployment rates in Ontario are still higher than the national rate, since 2006. Over 300,000 manufacturing jobs have still not come back. Hydro rates have increased 300% since the Liberals have taken government and are expected to increase another 42% in the next five years.", "Again, hydro rates are a big burden. They’re a burden on our citizens, they’re a burden on our families, and they’re a burden on seniors who want to remain home as long as possible. They’re a burden on businesses that would rather spend their money on expansion. In Sudbury, they’re even a burden on facilities like curling clubs, for example, that can’t meet their annual expenses because of the high rate of hydro.", "Child care: Sudbury is one of the 18 communities that has seen cuts in affordable daycare funding from the province. As a result, Junior Citizens Day Care, a municipally owned daycare in Sudbury, is now being looked at in terms of having to close. This is a facility that has workers who have worked there for a long time and created rapport with families, and do a fantastic job in assessing and identifying the needs of students prior to them entering the school system. That is a shame. It is a model that should be mimicked and not one that should be cut.", "We also need to support our horse racing industry. Again, I met with horsewomen and horsemen at the stables and observed one lady crying because her family has been in the business for many generations. We have farmers who are affected. We have stable owners and trainers who are affected. The horse racing industry, Sudbury Downs, has to be up and running. We need that industry. We talk about creating industry; well, here’s one that we want to remain and not disappear.", "ER wait times: Again, it’s very important to get those ER wait times down. The New Democrats have put forth a good plan in terms of hiring nurse practitioners and 24-hour family health teams. The member from London–Fanshawe and I heard, when she visited me in Sudbury and met with stakeholders, that it’s easy to call 911 and get brought to the ER and get treated and then discharged. The problem is that there’s no home care at home. What’s happening is that people are calling 911 again to go back to the ER. Home care is essential.", "Again, we heard over and over in the last week or so the plans for the LCBO, Ontario Power Generation and Hydro One. I’m really not sure what the plans are, but if it’s divesting, we have some concerns that we need to be watching that portfolio very closely.", "Priorities: We need to keep our seniors at home. Once they need support, we need some long-term-care beds and some quality spaces for them.", "We need to keep our youth from moving away.", "We need infrastructure money to improve our roads, and like the member from Windsor–Tecumseh and I heard when he visited Sudbury and we visited some bridges, we need some infrastructure money across the province.", "We need more family doctors, nurse practitioners, nurses and personal care workers. We need to reverse the reduction of monies to affordable daycare. We want people to work, but I heard that if they are paying $1,000 a month for daycare, it makes it very difficult for parents, single dads or single moms to go to work. We need those home care demands met. We need cities to be consulted. And in Sudbury, we need a PET scanner. We need a positron emission tomography machine.", "I knew Sam Bruno personally. I can tell you, I met with him and I passed a motion at council which we wrote together. He is no longer with us. He lost his battle with the disease. But I can tell you that his family still, five years later—last year was the fourth year that they had a gala, fundraising hundreds of thousands of dollars to purchase a PET scanner for Sudbury, the only region in the province that does not have one, and I think that’s a shame. I think we owe it to Sam Bruno to have that come to Sudbury. I know the member for Nickel Belt has put forth several petitions, many petitions, in terms of a PET scanner, and we need that in Sudbury.", "As an educator for almost 20 years, I’ll finish my points by saying that how we serve our children best is by providing as much one-on-one support as possible. That means EAs in the regular classroom. That means other child care workers. In special education, which I have worked at in the last seven or eight years, we need more money for assessments and more money for programs for our special education and special-needs children.", "I’ll end with that. These are the priorities I think should be on the agenda of the government." ],

I have no doubt, if we look back, you will see that he will act on each and every one of those.", "A note of caution, though: If you see him and say hello and he doesn’t say anything back to you, it’s because it’s his twin brother.

He is the father of three young sons, and he indicated recently that on this past Father’s Day he was very happy to spend an uninterrupted Father’s Day with his family.", "Acknowledging the people who have helped me in my election campaign is almost daunting as there are not enough ways to say thank you. Allow me to recognize the incredible efforts and the belief by the members of the Cambridge riding association that it really was possible to elect the first Liberal in Cambridge in 71 years. The mood at our victory party on June 12 was absolutely electric.

The polling clerks apparently sang her Happy Birthday. It was very memorable for her, and I thank Kayla.", "It is my supporters’ hope and unwavering friendship and effort that continue to inspire me each and every day to become the best representative of the Cambridge riding that I can be. My supporters will ensure that I will serve all of our communities, recognizing that those who hold differing viewpoints are our friends and neighbours. Indeed, having open debate in this legislative chamber is a privilege that I hold dear and a responsibility that I readily assume to serve all of the citizens of this great and diverse province.", "Thank you to all of my family, and in particular to my husband, Fred McGarry, whose undying support gives me the strength and ability to serve our constituents each and every day; and to my children, whose patience, selflessness and fierce loyalty make me continuously proud. You inspire me, support me and you willingly share my time and energy with all the others in our community.

I was quite taken aback by the signs held aloft by the period-costumed actors in the scene, which read “Votes for Women.” It made me realize what a long way we have come as a society since that time about 100 years ago. My mother-in-law passed away last year, three months shy of her 100th birthday. When she was born, women in Canada did not have the right to vote; before she passed away, Ontario had its first female Premier in history—all within her one lifetime. What a difference a few strong women leaders made at that time in striving to achieve equality for all women. How inspiring. I am proud and humbled to be the first elected female MPP in the riding of Cambridge; and I am honoured to serve under the first elected female Premier of Ontario. Premier Wynne’s leadership inspires me and women of all ages.", "Interestingly, in 2011 the set location scouts of this series, Murdoch Mysteries, chose Cambridge as a frequent filming location. These scouts were no doubt as captivated as I was, when I moved to Cambridge in 1988 by the natural beauty of Cambridge and in particular the Speed and Grand rivers, which flow through the city’s core. The confluence of the Speed and Grand rivers is near the village of Blair, the oldest inland settlement in Ontario, founded in 1800 by the Pennsylvania Dutch settlers. These lands were once the summer home of the First Nations aboriginal peoples, the Neutrals.", "The Grand River was designated as a national heritage river in 1994 and it’s one of the very few heritage rivers in this system that runs through an urban area. Bald eagles and rare species now inhabit the shores of these rivers, delighting passersby.", "Cambridge also boasts a rich architectural heritage, with many early stone and brick buildings along the riverbanks, downtown cores and tree-lined residential streets. The large number of heritage buildings has also been an important element in Cambridge’s economic history. The beauty of the heritage buildings draws many to its downtown cores, boosting tourism and the local economy of shop and restaurant owners. The city gains revenues from the filming of many movies, due to the historic settings.", "Now, little did I know, when I joined a heritage organization 20 years ago to advocate for and lobby Cambridge city council frequently to preserve our heritage buildings, that I was embarking upon my political career. Someone asked me to consider running after one such city council meeting, and here I am today.", "The city of Cambridge was amalgamated in 1973 and is comprised of the original towns of Hespeler, Preston and Galt. These towns were founded along the rivers to take advantage of the water power to run the many grain and textile mills that were the driving force of the early economic engine.", "Cambridge and North Dumfries make up the riding of Cambridge. Speaker, we are part of the two-tiered municipal government of the region of Waterloo. Today, Cambridge is one of the fastest-growing areas in the country. Ideally located astride Highway 401, it is part of Canada’s technology triangle. Advanced manufacturing, auto manufacturing and space manufacturing companies such as ATS, Toyota and COM DEV employ our highly skilled workforce in Cambridge. IT companies within the region also make up part of our workforce. This government invested in expanding Conestoga College into Cambridge. This and the University of Waterloo’s School of Architecture within our borders ensure that our young people have great opportunities to choose a quality post-secondary education close to home.", "Cambridge is also home to a growing multicultural mix of families, a very vibrant arts and culture scene and an incredible system of walking and cycling trails, many along our rivers. The Liberal government partnered with our federal and municipal government to build the recently opened Dunfield Theatre, part of the Drayton theatre group, and it has surpassed its expected ticket sales in its very first year. Over 60% of our guests are from out of town, and the local businesses are really enjoying the increase in customers and their revenues.", "Speaker, North Dumfries township is home to about 10,000 residents. It’s distinctly rural, and it also includes the largest town of Ayr and smaller towns of Roseville, Branchton and Clyde. Agriculture and gravel extraction contributes to the local economy. Several areas are designated as environmentally sensitive policy areas. Remnants of the threatened Carolinian forest remain in North Dumfries, and several rare species of reptiles, birds and plants are found here. I live in one such area. I reside in the rural countryside of North Dumfries and really delight in and enjoy seeing the rare sandhill cranes and osprey, and I love being serenaded by the spring peeper frogs in the pond every spring.", "With a strong foundation of support services, a diverse economic base, the beautiful riding of Cambridge is an ideal place to live, work, play and raise a family.", "Speaker, in the throne speech we heard about this government’s commitment to health care, education and improving transportation for Ontario, among other things. The Liberals’ shared values that government should be a force for good in people’s lives—and continued investment in our core public services—motivated me to seek public office, and I believe it’s these values that really set apart this government.", "Helping patients and their families while working as a registered nurse under all three political parties in the last 30 years stirred the need in me to become politically active at a time when hospitals and health care services were being cut. It made sense to me to spend less to provide home services to keep people in their own homes rather than in costly long-term hospital admissions.", "Speaker, in the early 1990s, our oldest son had a chronic lung illness that became life-threatening. At age 10, he was admitted to hospital for most of the next four years. He narrowly avoided a double lung transplant at a time when only 11 had been performed in Canada. In the 1990s, home care was not a priority for the Ministry of Health or well-resourced. Our son was not eligible at that time for home services. Since 2003, this government has invested significantly in community care, increasing services, home supports and care for increasingly complex health conditions at home. Today, if our son was assessed for home services, given the same medical condition, he could receive enough home care that he could have avoided spending much of those four years in hospital. The impact on our family would have been a much more normal life between the acute phases of his lung disease. Fortunately, our son’s health improved so that he is leading a more healthy life. Rory could have lived his life with a “poor me” attitude but chose to strive for excellence in his education and again in his work, and he is now an industrial designer in Ireland. He is my hero and my inspiration.", "Speaker, the benefit to our health care system would have been the saving of hundreds of thousands on the hospital bills incurred from his prolonged hospital stays. The realization of the importance of smart strategic investments in health care heightened my political awareness. To ensure continued improvement and expansion of health care and home care, I ultimately decided to run as a candidate for the Liberal Party.", "The throne speech has served only to strengthen my commitment to public service and the Liberal Party, as this government is committed to transforming health care, placing the patient at the centre and making strategic investments in community care to keep people where they want to be: in their home rather than in a hospital. Until elected, I was a care coordinator for the community care access centre, and I strived to provide the right care in the right place at the right time and was able to help more of my clients to achieve this goal because of these direct investments.", "The throne speech, Mr. Speaker, describes a plan that builds on our world-renowned education system by planning to continue improving learning so that our children have the best possible start in life and our young people are prepared to lead in the global economy. The youth jobs strategy helps connect young people to promising careers and a robust apprenticeship program. Many college-age students really depend on the 30%-off tuition grant that helps many pay for post-secondary education.", "I share this government’s vision for my own children. We have a fairly unique situation in our own family, as there’s a wide gap in our children’s ages. I often laugh when I say we’ve had children in school for decades and under all three provincial governments. From this comparative perspective, I recognize the importance of the Liberals’ continued investment in our education system, which cemented my resolve to run for this office.", "Moreover, Mr. Speaker, I am pleased about this government’s planned investments in order to move Ontario forward. This is an important cornerstone in Ontario’s plan for economic growth. Its plan to invest $29 billion in transportation and transit projects over the next decade will support economic growth across the province. Transportation has been a front-of-mind issue for Cambridge and Waterloo region for some time. GO trains, light rail transit, improvements to the 401 and widening of Highway 7 are all important issues that many constituents and municipal politicians are eager to discuss in order to have Cambridge included in future plans. I am fully committed to making this a priority for Cambridge, and indeed I’ve already had two meetings with the mayor of Cambridge and various city councillors to discuss these plans.", "Speaker, the Liberal government has improved infrastructure in Cambridge with new schools, school expansions, roads, bridges, the theatre and Conestoga College. But the main priority for the citizens of Cambridge and North Dumfries has been getting an expanded and redeveloped hospital. Our facility is one of the oldest in Ontario, and it has been an ongoing issue for very many years, with several false starts. I’m extremely proud to say the reality of this dream is only a few weeks away from the actual groundbreaking. The detailed design has been done over the last few years. The consortia that will build it has been chosen and should be announced shortly. We heard during the annual community meeting that the plans to start are actually as close as this September. That is an awesome occasion for the citizens of Cambridge. This Liberal government has delivered on its commitment to expand Cambridge Memorial Hospital to the people of Cambridge, and we could not be more pleased. I wish to thank the previous Minister of Health, Deb Matthews, for all her support to get this to a reality.", "Helping people is at the heart of what motivated me to become a nurse. Being a nurse taught me how to earn people’s trust, care for our most vulnerable citizens and advocate for the things that make a difference in people’s lives. Over many years, I have been committed to helping in my community in many different sectors: planning; arts and culture; transportation; health care; social services; the environment; tourism; and community safety. Noting the lack of palliative care resources for families facing life-threatening illness, I became a founding member of the Hospice of Waterloo Region. I endeavour to be an effective communicator, and I am known as an engaged community builder. I will use all of these skills to be the MPP for Cambridge.", "Speaker, the voters of Cambridge have shown their trust in me by electing me to Queen’s Park to continue my lifelong work of public service. The trust of my constituents must be earned, and I commit to establishing that trust with respectful, thoughtful service to the constituents of Cambridge; and, knowing that trust is hard-earned, I accept this responsibility.", "I asked a political leader once what motivated him to continue on in the face of strong opposition. He said, “You know what it’s like to help one family. Imagine what it’s like to help all the families in Ontario.” This resonated with me. I will endeavour to do my very best for the people of Cambridge and the province. It is indeed an honour to serve Ontarians with all my esteemed colleagues in this 41st Parliament." ],

They’ll enjoy that.", "As the member from a rural and urban area, I will endeavour to bring together some of the transportation issues and also some of the rural and agricultural issues that we do hear about.", "So I thank you, everybody, for your kind attention and your kind words on this, my first time to rise in the House.

  "text" : [ "Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. It’s normal tradition for someone to deliver their maiden speech in their first term, but due to all the challenges and issues that we had, I never got to that. I got right to work and just never got there. But I want to pay homage to those people that I believe are very important in my life and the reason I’m standing here today.", "I’m extremely delighted that my aunt Lillian Currie is here—she’s the last remaining sibling of my late father’s family, so it’s a real delight to have her here—my cousin Betty Perkins, my good friend Jim McCain, and one of my great team members, Ana Sajfert. It’s a pleasure to have them.", "Wow! I still pinch myself every day that I’m the member of provincial Parliament for the wonderful riding of Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound. It is a pleasure and a privilege to serve my constituents and, by extension, the people of the great province of Ontario.", "I am humbled that I join those who have served as MPPs before me, those who have worked or volunteered in any capacity at this revered institution, and of course my colleagues that I serve with from all parties and the staff, past and present, of this great Legislature. It is my commitment to honour your service by working my hardest and making the best decisions I can, both on behalf of my constituents of Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound, who are my first priority, and also in the broader context of what is best for the citizens, the taxpayers, the people of Ontario.", "Many people ask, “Why did you become a politician?” It is not an easy or a short answer. For those of you who know me, that is a bit of a standard reply, and at times an understatement, Mr. Speaker. The reality is, there are a number of reasons. The most fundamental is that I care. To borrow the term, I want my dash on my tombstone to have meant something. I care about people and I want to know that I have used my life to make a positive difference in the lives of others.", "In my senior year of high school, I served as head boy, now referred to generally as co-president, along with my dear friend Cathy Cook, who served as head girl. It was a fantastic leadership opportunity, and it was then that I would suggest I was bitten by the political bug.", "After graduating from the recreation leadership program at Fanshawe College, I was given the privilege of being employed as the parks and recreation director and the organizer of the world-renowned, without a shadow of a doubt, Wiarton Willie Festival. I had the pleasure of attending a local Rotary meeting in Wiarton, and the guest speaker was a fellow by the name of Murray Elston, the MPP for Bruce-Grey at the time. Mr. Elston was a friend of my mentor, Mr. Thomas G. Norris, and was very well respected in our area. I honestly did not pay attention to his political stripe at the time. Murray was simply someone who, as I remember, spoke eloquently and inspired me. His speech stirred emotion in me and compelled me to get involved and make a difference in my community. I recall saying to myself, as I departed for home after his speech, “I want to be like Mr. Elston someday.” I’m truly not sure how much reality I gave to it at that time, and it certainly wasn’t an “I must absolutely do this” career decision. However, it is a case of a seed being planted, and it is one of those situations whereby you just never know where life’s journey will take you if you’re willing to step through the door of opportunity.", "Lesson 1: Be prepared to take a risk and live life to the fullest every day.", "I had always been involved in community development and tried to do what I could to make the community a little bit better. I’m a believer in the adage that it is a noble endeavour to offer yourself to public service, and I take great pride in telling people I am a public servant, a politician. It pains me, in fact, when I hear derogatory comments about politicians. Sure, there may be the odd one who paints the rest of us with a negative brush. However, I stand firm that most people who enter this vocation are doing it for the right reason: to make a difference, to make the community, the province, the country, and, yes, in some small way, the world a better place.", "For me, public service has always played a key role in my life. Whether it was as parks and recreation director for the town of Wiarton, now known as the South Bruce Peninsula, the area manager for Heart and Stroke Grey-Bruce, the executive director of the Bruce Peninsula Health Services Foundation, the captain or coach of a sports team, or the manager of a festival or volunteer for a special event, I always seem to strive for roles where I could be in a leadership position and develop and motivate a team of caring and talented individuals.", "A key lesson I fortunately learned very early is there is no “I” in team, and to be successful, you need to surround yourself and work collaboratively with other people with their own respective skills and talents.", "Interestingly, just prior to writing this speech, I read the book Orr: My Story by Bobby Orr. He is, in many people’s opinion, the greatest hockey player to have ever laced up the blades, and yet the main message I took from his book is how it takes a great team to accomplish any goal. Lesson number 2: Teamwork is the key to success. Surround yourself with equally committed people.", "Somewhere along the line—and I’m not sure exactly the date or the timeline of my life journey—I remember watching a clip of John Fitzgerald Kennedy, JFK, and his famous quotation, “Ask not what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for your country,” from his inaugural address on January 20, 1961. It is strange, as he had been assassinated prior to me being born, and yet he is one of those figures who made, and continues to have, an impact on me. He was youthful and vibrant and provided hope to a nation that needed hope. He was a leader who made a difference, and his quotation is one that has always inspired me to action. While I’m not suggesting in any way that I’m anywhere even remotely close to his league, I do believe each of us can make a difference if we are committed and willing to make the effort.", "More close to home, the Honourable William Grenville Davis, Premier from 1971 to 1985, and a member of the Ontario Legislature from 1959 to 1985, was a huge inspiration. During his tenure, Mr. Davis built much of our current education system as well as our nuclear fleet, and utilizing a balance of fiscal fortitude and social conscience, led our great province through some of the most progressive and successful times we have ever witnessed. Mr. Davis attended one of my fundraisers during my first election, and I will remember this auspicious occasion for the rest of my life. Thank you, Mr. Davis, for all that you did to make our great province the best that it could be.", "At home, my cousin Howard Greig served his community on municipal council for 28 years. He retired last term as mayor of the municipality of Chatsworth after many years prior serving as a councillor and then reeve of the former Sullivan township. He also served in leadership capacities on a number of provincial boards and ensured rural Ontario, and specifically Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound, had a voice heard at the table—a shining example of someone who remained grounded to his roots and who dedicated much time and effort to benefit his community.", "Also, my friend and current member of Parliament for Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound, Larry Miller—Larry recently celebrated his 10th year of service as a federal politician and served 13 years before that as a municipal councillor and then reeve of Georgian Bluffs, formerly Keppel township, including a term as warden of Grey county. Larry has recently had Bill C-383, An Act to amend the International Boundary Waters Treaty Act and the International River Improvements Act, his private member’s bill, or PMB, receive royal assent and be passed into law. This is a significant accomplishment, as very few PMBs ever become legislation. Congratulations, Larry, and keep up the great work.", "And, of course, my hero: Terry Fox inspired with his selfless act of pure determination, positive spirit and enduring hope. He was a person who truly epitomized that we can all make a difference regardless of our lot in life. His quotations, “I just wish people would realize that anything’s possible if you try; dreams are made possible if you try,” “It took cancer to realize that being self-centered is not the way to live. The answer is to try and help others,” and “Even if I don’t finish, we need others to continue. It’s got to keep going without me,” are all examples that show that with a positive attitude, we can all make a difference. Lesson number 3: Make a difference. Every single person can make a contribution if they take action.", "Mostly, however, it was my life goal and ambition to make my mom, Sarah Ethel Jean Walker, proud. People would often comment, “Are you a politician?” or “You would make a good politician.” My predecessor, Bill Murdoch, a 20-year veteran MPP who served in this very hallowed House, approached me and suggested, “Have you ever thought of being a politician? I think you should try.” After much thought, the idea of serving others at the provincial or federal level and the opportunity to be able to give something back to the community was something I thought would make my mother proud.", "Mom was a special lady who had a challenging life. My dad passed away when I was 10 years old, leaving Mom solely responsible for me and my five siblings—no easy situation. However, Mom just picked up the pieces, moved forward and raised all of us to the best of her ability. Not once did I hear her complain.", "She ended up with significant back problems and 15 years ago was diagnosed with breast cancer: again, no self-pity, no complaining. She merely accepted the challenge and made the most of her days. Instead of looking for pity, she volunteered at the local hospital foundation, the Legion Ladies’ Auxiliary and the Women’s Institute. She focused on family and having fun and living on her terms. She was always smiling and looked for the positive in every situation, right up until October 26, 2013, the day she passed away at the wonderful age of 86 years young. It is with some sadness, obviously, and regret that she did not get to see or hear me deliver this speech. However, I take some comfort in knowing that the day I was elected, I had in some small way made her proud. I dedicate this speech to her.", "Lesson 4: Attitude is key. Be positive and make the most of every second of every day.", "Per my previous comments related to Bobby Orr, I am so thankful and grateful for the many people who have helped me, shaped me and mentored me over the years, and who continue to do so. There are too many to mention, and I will not attempt to do so for fear of missing and offending someone. The reality is, there have been many: some who in significant ways have helped to counsel me on one of my many significant life decisions, some who have said nothing but were there when I needed them most, some who have motivated me to take a chance, some who have derided me for making a decision that to them did not make sense.", "I would be remiss if I did not thank all of those people who helped me with my nomination, my two election campaigns and my riding association. To everyone who contributed to Team Walker, whether by giving of your time and talents, financial support and/or moral support, please know I appreciate your generosity and extend a heartfelt thank you.", "To my staff, Ana Sajfert, Sandra Breedon, Karen MacInnis, Susan McMillan and Lisa LaPierre, thank you. You are each a treasure in your own way and offer so much to the success we achieve as a team. You truly embody the character of teammates who are there when I need you every single day, and I hope you are proud of the work you perform to help and assist others. Thank you for all that you do, and know I truly do appreciate you and your families for the sacrifices you make for my benefit.", "At the end of the day, we all need family and friends. To my mom, Jean Walker, my wife, Michaela, my sons, Zach and Ben, my mother-in-law, Dorothy, and father-in-law, Brian Eastwood, you are my foundation. You always will be, and even when my responsibilities take me away from home—and I apologize that that happens way too often—please know you are never far from my thoughts. I can’t thank my family enough for supporting me to get here and for all the sacrifices they have had to make over the past few years. I appreciate your understanding and your immense support. I am so proud to have such an amazing family.", "To my siblings, Marie, Gord, Norm, the late Marjorie, and my sister Bonnie and extended family, I cannot say enough for all you have done and continue to do.", "To my friends, and you know who you are and the role you have played, thank you for being you. Thanks for your support and encouragement. Each of you has played a key role in allowing me the privilege to follow my dream, and for that I am eternally grateful. Thank you, thank you, thank you.", "I would also like to extend appreciation to all of my colleagues—and, yes, I consider you all to be friends and consider that we are a special fraternity. There are only 107 of us who are given the rare privilege to serve the greater good—107 people out of 13.5 million people. That is absolutely staggering to me. What a privilege.", "We live a life that no one, not even our spouses, really understands. We live a life that some would suggest is one where we cannot win, as there is always someone taking a shot at you. We live a life that sees us away from our family and friends almost all the time. We live a life that requires us to always be on, especially in today’s world of social media. We live a life that requires us to be jacks of all trades and yet masters of none as we are hit with wave after wave of information and requests from all areas. We live a life that requires us to be decisive, bold and compassionate, knowing full well that most decisions will be criticized and/or heckled. We live a life that challenges us to make decisions that will impact the lives of millions, people we will never meet. We live a life that is like nothing else I could ever imagine. We live a life that is a once-in-a-lifetime experience and one that I am truly privileged to live. I take my hat off to those who have served before me, to those who serve in other levels of government or who have served in the past. Mostly, I extend my hand in friendship to those I have the pleasure to serve with from all parties in this hallowed Legislature. I commit to working with you to make a difference.", "A special thank you and oath of allegiance to those people in my PC caucus, my colleagues, my friends. You are truly special people, and I am honoured and humbled to serve alongside you and to learn from you.", "As a call to action, a “walking the walk,” if you will, I challenge everyone to step up and be part of the solution, if you were to criticize; to be positive and help others—do at least one good deed every day of your life; be proud of your community, province and country; and vote as your way of saying thank you to those who made the ultimate sacrifice so we could enjoy the rights, freedoms, liberties, and the privilege of democracy and right to vote and speak freely in this wonderful province of Ontario and the country of Canada.", "In closing, it is my hope that I have been able to communicate that I am truly privileged and honoured to be an elected member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, the greatest province in the greatest country in the world. I love my job, and I will continue to pursue it with the most integrity, energy and passion that I can. It is certainly a job that is learned on the fly, and I will continue to put my best foot forward and perform my role with class and dignity. It is my hope that the wonderful people of Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound will be proud of the effort I am making on their behalf, are proud to call me their MPP, and that in some small way I am making a positive difference in their lives.", "Mr. Speaker, that concludes my maiden speech. However, I will take a few moments to also address the speech from the throne, if I may.", "One of the concerns, I believe, of the caucus when the election started was where this government, the Liberal government, has taken us. They’ve doubled the debt in eight years; the deficit is $13.5 billion more than we take in in a year. Every single dollar that we spend on interest payments because of that debt, that overspending continually, is not a dollar that goes to our front-line health care. It doesn’t go to our schools. It does not go to the needy and the homeless. It does not go to people with special-needs children. Almost every day in my office, someone comes in with a heart-wrenching story of their child, their sibling, their family member, and all of my colleagues share the same experience. It’s saddening to say that there’s not a whole lot of hope on the way, because right now our third-largest expenditure in government is our interest payment on the debt. Mr. Speaker, $10.5 billion a year goes to spending money on interest payments.", "This throne speech continues down the same path. It continues down the same overspending ways that we’ve watched here for my two and a half years and, sadly, for the 11 years they were here. Spending continues to go up, even though economist Don Drummond, their own specialist, their own economist who they hired to report to them two years ago, is telling them that they have to change their ways.", "I didn’t hear anything in there, although it says more money for hospitals. Today in the House, I offered once again to the Minister of Health to step up and put a commitment to the Markdale hospital. Some 11 years ago they committed to building that hospital, and they have still not come through on that commitment. The great people of Markdale have raised $13.2 million, and it’s sitting there in a bank doing absolutely nothing. It’s not helping the great people of our community. It’s not providing the health care that they deserve and were committed to. I hope the minister was very frank in his thought process to me, in his remarks and in his rebuttal, and that he will work with me and he will meet with me to find a way to move this forward.", "I also have a program in my riding: the Georgian College marine emergency duty training facility. As the colleague from Cambridge mentioned, in Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound we live in one of the most beautiful parts of our wonderful province, surrounded by the Great Lakes. We have Georgian College, with one of the most state-of-the-art simulators in the country. They’re divesting this program at the federal level, and it only makes common sense to bring that to Owen Sound, where we are the Marine Centre of Excellence. This would ensure that jobs remain in Ontario. This will ensure that the marine industry is served well in Ontario. There are similar programs on the east coast and the west coast, but my concern is that if they start going there for the training, they’ll eventually start to move all of their business there, and this is a huge industry for Ontario.", "They talk about education. The Liberals want to be known as the education party. Well, here’s an educational institution that certainly can be the sustainability and vibrancy of this whole marine sector. Again, I reached out to Minister Duguid today. He agreed to meet with me and have his staff meet with me to try to move this forward. Those are the types of things I want to see in the budget, but what I saw more was overspending. I saw a lot of discussion about where they want to take us. They said all the buzz words that are wonderful—“hope” and “opportunity”—but what we need is some social sense. Like the Bill Davis years, we need to have fiscal responsibility. We need to not spend more than we currently bring in in revenue. Those pages sitting in front of you, my children and, hopefully someday, grandchildren, are who we’re borrowing from today to make promises today to get elected today and to remain in office today. That’s not the way we need to be going. It’s not why the 107 people, I believe, came to this hallowed House, Mr. Speaker.", "We need to show that progressive fiscal responsibility, along with a social conscience, obviously. But when we’re spending almost $11 billion on interest payments which is not going, as I mentioned earlier, to help front-line health care, front-line education, then we’re not helping the disabled, and we’re not helping those who are without, Mr. Speaker. I didn’t see a lot of that in the budget, and I think we really need to focus on that third-biggest expenditure being debt and interest payments. It needs to be broken; it needs to be changed. They’re going in the wrong direction, and they need to step forward with a better plan. They’re going to introduce the exact same budget.", "I don’t even have time to get into the pension that small businesses are telling me is probably going to put them out of business if they truly fully go forward and implement this. We’ve heard it from the economists. We heard it at the front door when I was campaigning. This is just another added burden of tax that is going to decimate not only the employee but the employer.", "The throne speech has some merit. There were some things in there, but I think, at the end of the day, we need a big change, and the government needs to address its overspending ways." ],

Anyway, congratulations on having made it. It’s wonderful. It’s always good to hear about a member’s family, about their roots and about their motivations. I think often we don’t see ourselves here in this House as full human beings, and it’s wonderful to hear members get up and talk about themselves a little bit.", "Congratulations to all of the new members who have been elected. It’s a wonderful privilege to be here. I’m no maiden; it’s my fourth time elected in eight years of service. But I have to say, every time one stands in this House, one is aware of the huge number of people who sent us here, those who voted for us and those who didn’t vote for us but who we still represent, those who exercised their franchise. It’s really important to acknowledge them, and I think the member from Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound did exactly that.", "It’s also important to recognize our family. I want to give a shout-out to my family too, to Gil, my husband; to Damien and Francesca, my children—all of whom worked on my campaign night and day. I’m sure I’m not alone in this. Our families turned up. They did the phones, and they knocked on doors. We had family canvass on Sundays in my household. Particularly to my husband, and I know he’s watching, I just want to say, I love you, and thank you for all your support. Thank you for your love, and thank you for your hard work and belief in me.", "That’s what we also heard from the member from Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound, because none of us would be here without family support. That’s the core of who we are. Bringing their voices and names forward is so important, just to acknowledge their role in our lives, because really, when we’re elected, they’re elected too." ],

I’m of the same belief as you are: I truly believe that all 107 of us who are here are here for the right reasons. We might have some different philosophies, but that’s what makes it interesting, and I think it’s fantastic.", "Your part about families: I spoke yesterday for some half hour or so, and family is very important. They sacrifice a lot to allow us to serve Ontario, so it’s real teamwork.", "I think that’s a message that sometimes, frankly, the public doesn’t quite understand. They think that we come here, we sit here and then we collect a big fat pension at the end of the day. But having said that, we made that choice to be here. We know what the conditions were. We accept it, and I think we’re all honoured to be here. So to you, Bill, your family and your riding, congratulations. I’m sure they’ll enjoy you being here.", "I must say one thing; I’m going to comment on the last four or five minutes of your speech. You talk about needing some issues addressed in your riding. I think everybody in this House needs that. You say you need it; it’s got to happen. But on the other hand, you talk about austerity, and I’m not sure things mesh. You can’t talk from both sides of one’s mouth, so although we all need those services and those needs—but at the end of the day, congratulations. I enjoy being here with you." ],

I’m sure some of the Clerks that have to record me all the time may feel that way as well. I think last year my record was 86,000 words spoken in the chamber, so it does probably seem a little strange, Mr. Speaker, that I would be doing this maiden speech now.", "But I do truly believe that it is important to do it, and it’s to pay homage to those who have made my life, who have allowed me the opportunity and privilege to be here today.", "It’s important to say thank you to the constituents who have shown faith in me and continued, in my second election, to have shown faith and trust in me.", "I think it’s important especially—and all of my colleagues have talked about family. I believe in sharing—I think you might have been the person who said it—that when we get elected, the family gets elected. This isn’t a one-person show in regards to any of us. If I didn’t have my wife, Michaela, and the support of my sons, Zach and Ben, and my family, my extended family, my siblings, certainly I couldn’t do this. This is all-encompassing, and it’s a privilege to do this job. I thoroughly enjoy every single moment that I’m out in my job, that I’m doing my job, but it truly is sacrificial from the point of family, as all of us in this House know.", "I think it’s important to put on record why we are here and to remind ourselves. John, again, has a very special situation, to follow his father into this hallowed hall. I can only imagine what his speech would have been back in the day. I will go back through Hansard and read that, because I think it will be entertaining, as all of his speeches are.", "But I think that at the end of the day it’s important for us to take time and to put our mark on this House, as this House puts its mark on all of us. We all truly are here with different thought processes, different views of the world, but that’s the democracy that we have a right and a privilege to enjoy.", "Thank you to everyone. It’s my pleasure to serve, and hopefully for many years to come. Thank you." ],

Good to see you again.", "To my staff, Bhutila, Carly, Susan and Ram—phenomenal staff—I couldn’t do it without them.", "And to our leaders—I don’t think they’ve been acknowledged—to the member from Simcoe–Grey, to our own Andrea Horwath, to the Premier: Again, congratulations on your election and to your leadership positions. I have the privilege of being the first LGBTQ critic for any party at Queen’s Park, and so I just have to acknowledge, as we’ve just come out of World Pride in Toronto, the first openly gay Premier as well. I have to acknowledge that; that is a moment in history.", "And now to the throne speech; now to the throne speech. What I’m going to say is absolutely, utterly inspired by my members from Parkdale–High Park: what I heard at the door, what I spoke to people about. Really, I’m tasked with bringing their voices forward. That’s who elected me—and, of course, others in Ontario who feel the same way.", "Let me say first and foremost that there’s a problem. We have a problem in this province, and that problem has many faces.", "It first of all has the faces of those who are marginalized, those who live in poverty. My friends opposite and next to us should know that food bank usage is way up, and that is a pretty good measure, Mr. Speaker, of poverty. We have over a million people using food banks now. Back in 2003, when this government was first elected, we had around 700,000. That’s a significant increase. That is an increase in poverty rates. And those people who live in poverty have real faces. I met them; I met them at the door.", "A problem they also have is housing. We have over 150,000 families—not just individuals—waiting for affordable housing in this province, over 70,000 families in the GTA alone. I met those people. They had a hard time even exercising their franchise because many of them lacked sufficient identification. We have a problem there, and it’s a problem that has solutions, that could have been solved in the last 11 years. One of those solutions, we put forward several times. It’s called inclusionary zoning, and I tabled that bill again, Mr. Speaker. It’s a very simple little bill. All it does is make a small change to the Planning Act so that municipalities who have overwhelmingly told me they want this ability can then require of their developers and developments that they set aside a certain amount of units for affordable housing. It could be rent-to-own. It could look differently in different municipalities.", "I have to give kudos to Olivia Chow who is running for the mayoral position in Toronto right now for talking about using section 37. But she has also acknowledged, and others, that they need more tools in the tool box in cities and municipalities to be able to address this.", "I see my new minister, for whom I am a new critic on the housing file, and I look forward to speaking to him about this very issue and seeing if we can move this forward, because we need to move this forward.", "Mr. Speaker, it doesn’t cost one tax dollar and yet we calculate, looking at the incredible development that has happened across Ontario in the last 11 years, that would provide about 12,000 to 13,000 new units of affordable housing every single day. But, of course, that’s not enough. We also need new builds. Again, by their own reckoning, by their own standards, this government said they wanted to and were going to build 20,000 new units—not close, Mr. Speaker, not even close.", "I see those faces. I see the faces of the homeless, and I see, more frequently, the faces of the under-housed, not to mention our children. Where will they live in the GTA, with the average price in the GTA now approaching $600,000, $700,000 or more? This is a situation that is leading to calamity unless it’s addressed. Again, to the new Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing, I hope that he and I can work on this together and make some changes, because we need to make those changes.", "The other thing that we need to change where municipalities are concerned, certainly in Toronto—and this I heard at the door from many of my folk in ward 13 who are extremely concerned about rampant development where citizens have no say. Here’s what happens: A citizens’ group gets together; they oppose a new development for all sorts of good reasons—certainly sometimes there are good reasons. The developers often now bypass them completely, do not even hold meetings with citizens, go right to the Ontario Municipal Board and win there.", "My friend Rosario Marchese who served in this House for 24 years—24 years Rosie was in the House—and made this one of the key pieces of his work here, to get the OMB out of Toronto planning. We do not need the OMB in Toronto planning. We have our own appeal process. We have our own planning process. I know other municipalities feel the same, but certainly Toronto feels dramatically that way.", "You will see across my riding “Save Our Village” signs on people’s lawns. Why do they put them there? Because of the development that’s happening eerily close, frighteningly close, to one of our greatest natural resources in Parkdale–High Park, and that is High Park itself. People are concerned. They’re concerned about the height. They’re concerned about where the children in those buildings will go to school, because we do not have the infrastructure—schools—to accommodate those children.", "Let’s talk about education for a minute. We have the highest student debt per capita of any province in all of Canada. We have the highest student debt per capita of any province across Canada and we have among the highest tuition fees ever. This is again a nightmare for young people, particularly young people, who then go into the job market where there are no jobs, carrying massive debts the size of mortgages, many of them. We need to address that fact and the fact that we are 10 out of 10 in terms of our record on education.", "But to get back to the development issue: The young children who are being raised in apartments now in downtown Toronto, because that’s all most people can afford, don’t have a place to go to school in my riding. They have to be bused out of my riding half the time just to find a place in a classroom. I’ll tell you, when I first ran eight years ago, one of the issues was that this government was going to close Warren Park school and King George school in my riding, because they were under-enrolled—this takes us back to the funding formula, which really has not changed since the Mike Harris days. So they were going to close these two schools. Mr. Speaker, those schools are overflowing now with students. In fact, every single school in my riding now is packed. Kids are taking classes in gyms. We have to bus students out of my riding to be able find a spot. This is a problem, and it’s particularly a problem when you look at the throne speech and the budget it’s based on and see that the government’s answer, if there is one in there, is to sell schools—schools that are under-enrolled. Well, I say to those communities where schools are on the chopping block—because it’s one of the resources they’re looking at in this budget: Stand up. Fight back. Because if you do and if you win, you will be glad.", "We all know there are demographic blips and troughs. There are changes. Many of us are from the baby boom era, but then there was the baby bust era. We cannot sell off our precious public resources, like schools and, of course, like you heard in question period today, potentially the LCBO, OPG, Hydro One. But let’s focus on schools for a minute. Had those schools in my riding been shut, I don’t know what we would be doing, because already we have a problem. That’s education.", "Let’s talk about child care. We are bordered by two provinces: Quebec, which has $7-a-day child care, and Manitoba, which has $17-a-day child care. Here we are in Ontario, where only one in 8 to 10 children has a space, and those spaces cost upwards of $1,000 or more a month. I can tell you, I heard that voice at the door during this last election, and they said, “We need a child care program.” It’s desperately needed. In fact, I would say it’s the critical feminist issue of this province, because you can’t have full equality of women if you don’t have good, high-quality, affordable child care, available to every woman who needs it. That’s essential, and we don’t have that. But we’re bordered by neighbours who really do have that, so we can do way better—and that’s after 11 years.", "What about transportation? One of the huge issues I heard in Parkdale–High Park was transportation. First and foremost, I heard about the air-rail link. This is nothing new. Members have heard me speak about this ad infinitum, over years and years. Jonah Schein, the member who served for Davenport, introduced a bill which I re-tabled just now, that that line connecting Pearson and Union Station has to be electric. Why? Because it’s a health risk to all of those who live near the tracks it runs on.", "We know this. Studies have been done. The environmental assessment is there for all to read. It has to be electric. It is literally running past the backyards of many of our citizens, and the citizens of Davenport, and the citizens of Trinity–Spadina, and the citizens of York South–Weston. For all of these ridings, this is a huge issue. Again, I look forward to meeting with the new transportation minister—I’ve already asked for a meeting—to talk about electrification. We need more than a promise. We don’t even have that, but we need more than that. We need a plan. We need a budget. We heard from the last transportation minister that, “Oh, this will be done in 2017.” But even then, we haven’t seen a plan. We haven’t seen a budget. We haven’t seen anything tabled. We need that plan. We need that budget. We need action on that file. We need it soon, because in 2015 those trains start to roll for the Pan Am Games. I was sent here to say on behalf of all of my residents that a two-week sporting event is not enough reason to destroy their quality of life and their health. We’ve heard about asthma rates in schools—something like 20% now. Well, I can tell you that those asthma rates will go up when those diesel trains start to run.", "Again, that’s the biggest transportation issue in my riding, but there are others. If you wait for the streetcar on Queen Street, you will be waiting quite a while if you wait in rush hour, Mr. Speaker. You will see sometimes one or two cars go past; they’re packed. If you try to get on the subway, you’ll have the same experience; it’s packed too.", "I tabled a question for the transportation minister. I want to know where that so-called $29 billion they’re putting in transportation is going, how it’s being spent, when it’s being spent and on what, because I can tell you that we need a relief line in downtown Toronto. It’s critical.", "We need more buses on the road, too—again, something that Olivia has talked about. We need both. We need a full package and a full focus on how to move people. It is costing us billions not to move those people in downtown Toronto and in Parkdale–High Park. These are critical issues for us—absolutely critical.", "One issue I haven’t heard talked about yet but is also something I heard at the door from our activist folk in Parkdale–High Park—and we are activists—was, “Whatever happened to the move to get rid of that regulation that caused all the problems with the G20?” Remember the G20? Remember the nightmare of that? Remember the absolutely undemocratic move of this government, Mr. Speaker, when, behind closed doors when the House was in full session, in cabinet, they invoked a secret regulation nobody knew about, dusted it off from the Second World War to put it in place, that had disastrous results for civil liberties in our city? It had disastrous results for civil liberties in Parkdale–High Park. It’s sad to say that I had to say to those people who raised that issue with me, “Nothing has been done. Nothing has changed.” Now, that’s sad because that’s just a regulation. Nothing has been done. That was a while back, Mr. Speaker. Nothing has been done.", "Long-term care: You’ve already heard members speak about long-term care, the huge wait-lists, the problem with getting a bed in long-term care. But more to the point, Donna Cansfield, who was here, introduced a bill—I co-sponsored it with her, so did Christine Elliott—calling for at least a strategy to look at those who are aging and who have dementia and Alzheimer’s. We need to confront this issue. We need to do something. We need a strategy; we need policies in place. Otherwise this, too, is a calamity waiting to happen. I heard about it when I met those faces at the door, and I heard about it during this election campaign.", "Again, we need to talk about the amount of service people in long-term-care homes get and the amount of funding that goes per bed in those homes. I also heard that we have overworked staff who just can’t get around to provide the services needed. When I was first elected eight years ago, I was speaking about this. We were speaking about the fact that we need at least 3 hours—3.5 hours I think was the amount asked for—per long-term-care resident per day, and instead, we still have less than three. Again eight years later, still no action on that; this is a problem.", "Labour: Our labour critic has introduced some excellent bills. We have, over the eight years, bills that have not seen the light of day here: anti-scab legislation, card-check certification legislation. Again, there’s nothing to address those core concerns of those in organized labour. Let’s be frank: If it weren’t for those in organized labour working hard, we wouldn’t have the civil liberties that we have, going back to that G20 moment. They have always been at the forefront of the changes that we have needed. We need to look at how we can unionize more—not as my friends to the right want, to unionize less, but to unionize more. That’s what we should be looking at. That’s critical.", "We saw again, in the history of this government, Bill 115, which took away the collective bargaining rights of teachers. We saw the EllisDon bill, which took away the collective bargaining rights of trades. Again, there’s nothing progressive about that. We need to see action on those files as well.", "I only have a few minutes left and a lot to say. But let’s just sum up by saying this: There are very different ways of looking at an economy. There’s a way that we used to call the trickle-down theory, where you put lots of money into big corporations and multinationals, and you hope that somehow that trickles down and results in jobs on the front line—somehow. Or you can look at investing where people need it, and that’s what I’ve been speaking about, Mr. Speaker: investing to combat those who live on the margins, to find jobs, to provide housing, to have education and to provide health care—by the way, shout-outs to the Ontario Health Coalition, who came here and talked about the increasing spate of privatization and the delisting that has happened under the government: for eye care, for ambulances, for physio. I could go on, but anyway.", "That’s where we need to put our money: health care, education, housing, poverty elimination, child care, long-term care. That’s where we need to put our focus.", "We need to look at those multinationals and those large corporations that do not pay their fair share. There’s nothing progressive about not looking at the corporate tax rate—nothing progressive about that at all.", "Finally, one of the most frustrating bits of messaging I’ve heard out of the Liberal Party and this government, of all of them, is this proud crowing—I’ve heard it now also from the Progressive Conservatives, who have debunked it in other ways—that we spend less per capita on all social programming for our citizens than any other province. I think that’s cause for shame. I think it’s cause for shame that we spend less on education, on poverty elimination, on housing, on child care, on long-term care and on transportation. That we spend less for each one of our citizens than anyone else in Canada I don’t think is something to be proud about, Mr. Speaker. I think it’s something to be ashamed about, particularly when we live in one of the richest jurisdictions in the world and when people need support and when those infrastructure investments actually produce wealth—because that’s the other way of looking at the economy.", "Again, I’m proud to stand here. It’s great to be back. Welcome, everybody. We’ve got some serious work to do." ],

I remember getting my picture taken with it.", "You’ll remember that we have raises for PSWs, people who care for the people we care for most.

There are few members who speak with such strength about social issues as the member from Parkdale–High Park. However, on some of those issues, that’s where she and I part, because I have a social conscience, but I’m very fiscally conservative, and I just don’t understand how we can possibly spend, spend, spend and still solve the big problem, and that is, if we don’t solve the fiscal problems in Ontario, we won’t have any money to spend someday. Not just the spending that some people may want us to do today on this particular issue or that particular issue, but we’re not going to have any money, Speaker, because the province is going to be broke. And therein lies the challenge that faces the government.", "I can’t believe two minutes goes by so quick.", "They’ve got a tiger by the tail here right now, because they talk about—the member from Northumberland–Quinte West talked about having it both ways.

It’s because she is so poignant that I think we in this House listen to her explicitly. She not only offers a clear perspective on the problems that we face in the province, specifically in her riding, but also remedies that we should all listen to and heed, and things that I don’t see as wasteful spending or potentially expensive measures; they are value-added measures. When you do invest in child care, you aid productivity in the province of Ontario. When you invest in a publicly funded health care system, that is good value for dollars. When you invest in transit to move people around the wonderful city and the GTA, again those are good dollars spent.", "We question, I think, the priorities of the government and she nailed it at the end as she concluded. She hit the nail on the head when she said that it boggles our minds, on this side of the House, that the government boasts of being the lowest per capita spenders in the country when it comes to delivery of public services. Those are incredible metrics, because you would anticipate that they would have money in the bank and not such a massive deficit. So those two equations don’t make sense to myself. It certainly doesn’t make sense to the general public. All the more reason to ask the hard questions of this government, how they intend to continue to provide the public services that we all are passionate about. Certainly the member from Parkdale–High Park exudes that passion." ],

An excellent speech—and as the member from Northumberland–Quinte West said, the speech was okay until we got to the Tory talking points, which baffled me a bit.

I do share one thing with her: I belong to a food bank and I agree that there are too many of them and it’s something that we need to tackle: poverty, poverty among young children.

  "speaker" : "Mr. Peter Z. Milczyn",
  "text" : [ "Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise for the first time in this chamber, this beautiful place, as the Speaker has described it, and I congratulate you on your election to your position, which you will distinguish yourself in, I’m sure.", "I want to congratulate all of my colleagues on all sides of the House for their election, and those hundreds of our fellow citizens who also put their names on the ballot this past June. It is truly a humbling experience to be standing in this chamber, knowing you’ve been selected by your neighbours, your fellow citizens, to represent them.", "Mr. Speaker, before I speak about how we’re going to be building Ontario up, I do want to take this opportunity to first of all thank the great people of Etobicoke–Lakeshore for putting their trust in me to be their MPP. Over close to 20 years in different capacities, those very same people elected me to be their representative on city council, first in the city of Etobicoke and subsequently in the city of Toronto. So I’m very grateful to them that I have exercised my duty to them relatively well, that they felt confident that they could give me this additional trust and this additional opportunity to represent them.", "I also want to mention my two immediate predecessors from Etobicoke–Lakeshore. First, Laurel Broten, who was an extremely kind and compassionate member who represented Etobicoke–Lakeshore with great distinction in this House. I also want to thank my immediate predecessor, Doug Holyday. Though Doug and I may have often sparred on different things, back in November 1994 when I was first elected to Etobicoke council, Doug Holyday was elected mayor. He had already been an elected official before; it was my first time as an elected official. Even though we sometimes disagreed back then too, I did learn a great deal from him, certainly when it comes to looking after taxpayers’ money, which is something that I’ve always done in my role as a city councillor. I’m proud to be part of a government that will continue looking after taxpayers’ money carefully.", "I also want to speak about the wonderful volunteers who assisted me, not in one election, but in two, because unlike many of you, perhaps, to get to this place, my campaign was two campaigns in less than one year. I was blessed last summer with many hundreds of volunteers and this past June with somewhat fewer volunteers but no less enthusiastic.", "I did want to mention some of the names of those who were the most supportive and came out the most often with me: Bob Stewart; Jean-Luc Marcheseau; Phillis Steren; Nik Bulatovich; Andrew Misiak; John O’Sullivan; Paul Capranos; Dean Walker, my riding association president who is the first deaf person who is a riding association president in the Liberal Party of Ontario; Adam Feldman; Glen Howell; Cassandra Steele; George Takach; Barbara Anderson; Susan Watt; Ken Mangat; Susan Kuzman; and Tanya Kuzman. There were, of course, many hundreds of others. I can’t thank them all, but I am forever in your gratitude.", "Of course I do want to thank my family: my beautiful wife, Rose, who has an incredibly challenging career of her own, but she always makes the time to help me and to support our family; and my darling daughter, Ariana, who just turned five not long ago. In her lifetime, she’s had to experience her father running in three elections: one municipal and now two provincial. She is the apple of my eye, the light of my life, and I try my best to explain to her that when daddy is not around very much, it’s because I’m trying to make this place better for her, and I will try to do that for her and for all the other children in Ontario and all the other citizens of Ontario.", "Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank my parents, Maria and Wes Milczyn, who were immigrants from Communist Poland to this country. When they first arrived here, they settled in Montreal. After a few years, they saw that the place of opportunity was in Ontario, and they moved here with their unborn son. I have to think that with that singular decision they could never have imagined that today I would be standing here.", "I was first elected when I was 29, so of course my parents were very big parts of those campaigns. This past summer, I was knocking on doors in Mimico, where I grew up, which is part of my riding, and people were saying, “I remember when your mom knocked on our doors 20 years ago.” My grandmother also knocked on some of their doors, but perhaps they didn’t remember that.", "So, Mr. Speaker, I stand here having lived my entire life in Etobicoke–Lakeshore, growing up in the town of Mimico, living in the village of Islington and now in the beautiful, leafy neighbourhood of Sunnylea. These places are in my marrow. I am so grateful to be representing my neighbours from Etobicoke–Lakeshore, and I will always strive to ensure that the trust you’ve placed in me—that I will come through for you.", "In my political career, as in my professional career—I studied architecture—I like to conceive things. I like to then see them implemented and see them through to completion. When I was five years old growing up in Mimico, the debate about the development of the motel strip began. I wondered, “What’s taking so long? That’s really cool. I think I’d like to be an architect.” Lo and behold, I graduated from U of T with my architecture degree.", "As a city councillor for ward 2, Mimico and New Toronto, I spearheaded the beginning of the redevelopment of that area, also known as Humber Bay Shores now. Later on, as an Etobicoke councillor, we had the derelict Ontario hospital at the foot of Kipling in the ward, which we transformed into the great Humber College campus, but there was one building, the Assembly Hall, that was sitting vacant. My thesis at university for architecture was an arts centre on those grounds. Just five years later, as a city councillor, I led Etobicoke council in ensuring that that Assembly Hall was renovated and expanded, and a community arts facility was built there.", "In my latest incarnation in politics, on Toronto council, the project that I worked on for the entire 14 years that I was there was the redevelopment of the Etobicoke City Centre, 16 acres of vacant land marked in the middle by a highway interchange but where no highways were, just regular city streets. That was 1950s planning. After 14 years of consultation, planning, studies, and begging and pleading council to allocate money, construction on that will begin this year, Mr. Speaker.", "I’ve been proud to be a city builder in my first political career, and now I’m proud to be part of a government that will be building Ontario up and that will be province builders, Mr. Speaker.", "Of course, in the speech from the throne there are many issues that have been raised that are extremely important to the future of this province. I want to start with one, though: education. Over the past year of campaigning, I often heard that full-day kindergarten is not a good way to spend money. I sometimes heard that it was a waste of money. “Wasting money” on my daughter’s education and the education of every other young child in this province—that is not a waste of money, Mr. Speaker. Ensuring that our children have the best education system that they can have and that, as they move through the school system leading into post-secondary education, we give them the education, the tools and the opportunities that they so richly deserve, is never a waste of money, Mr. Speaker. This government is committed to ensuring that that education, from early childhood education through to post-secondary education, will be of the highest quality and will also be affordable for young people with post-secondary education, but also in terms of creating employment opportunities for their families so that young families can afford to get back into the workforce earlier. That is a very important part of this throne speech and this government’s mandate that we will follow through on.", "Of course, the aspects of the throne speech that people might logically assume I’m going to speak more about are issues like transit and infrastructure. I’m very grateful to the Premier for appointing me as the parliamentary assistant to the Honourable Brad Duguid, the Minister of Infrastructure, because that is a role in which I think I can contribute a great deal to this government and to this province.", "Le gouvernement affectera une nouvelle somme de 29 milliards de dollars à la stratégie sur 10 ans relative au transport et au transport en commun Faire progresser l’Ontario qui créera des emplois et stimulera notre économie dès maintenant et dans l’avenir. Dans le cadre de cette stratégie, un montant pouvant aller jusqu’à 15 milliards de dollars sera alloué de façon transparente à des projets de la région du grand Toronto et de Hamilton, et près de 14 milliards de dollars seront consacrés à des projets menés à d’autres endroits de la province où la croissance repose sur la circulation garantie des gens et des marchandises.", "Mr. Speaker, in this throne speech, our government is committing to the most significant investment in infrastructure in several generations in this province, the infrastructure that, as I was growing up, made this province a place of opportunity that my parents chose to move to. This infrastructure has been ignored to a degree that’s unconscionable, and this government is committed to building it up once again.", "For the residents of Etobicoke–Lakeshore, transit and infrastructure is one of the key issues that I heard about: the need to improve local transit services, regional transit services, highways, roads, bridges, water quality systems—all those elements that make a modern economy thrive.", "In my community, Mr. Speaker, this government is investing in a Kipling mobility hub to ensure that there’s a seamless transition between Mississauga Transit, TTC and GO Transit in the heart of our Etobicoke city centre, which it is about to do. We are making improvements to the Mimico GO train station. We are committed to expanding GO rail service to 15 minutes all day long along the Lakeshore line and other lines throughout the GTA. In my community, we’re also very concerned about creating new regional rail stations, particularly in the Park Lawn-Humber Bay Shores area, to allow a thriving and growing community to have access to great transit. This government’s plans to electrify the GO rail system will make that a possibility. I look forward to working with my municipal counterparts now on making sure that the development in that area allows those types of projects to proceed.", "Mr. Speaker, this throne speech also talks a great deal about creating a better business climate and allowing the private sector to create the jobs that Ontarians need. In my riding of Etobicoke–Lakeshore, we have a number of sectors which are really crucial to the economy. One is the film and TV production sector. Mr. Paul Bronfman, the owner of William F. White, which is the largest Canadian, and one of the largest international, film and TV equipment rental companies, is a great supporter of the initiatives of this government to promote the film and TV production industry in this city. The year 2012 was the banner year for that industry in the city of Toronto and in Ontario, 2013 was a close second and 2014 also looks very auspicious. That’s because of the investments and partnerships that this government has created for that sector.", "Another key sector in my riding, which many members might find unusual, perhaps, is actually the agri-food sector. Yes, Etobicoke–Lakeshore is in the middle of Toronto and the GTA, but we are home to the Ontario Food Terminal and we are home to dozens upon dozens of food warehousing and food processing and food product manufacturing companies. Our support and investments in that sector are crucial to the Toronto economy and to the provincial economy, and the partnerships that this government creates in the agri-food sector are crucial to moving us forward and will continue to move us forward so we have a sustainable province.", "In terms of sustainability, Mr. Speaker, I’m very proud that this government has acknowledged climate change to the extent that we have a Minister of the Environment and Climate Change. For the residents of Etobicoke–Lakeshore, this is not an abstract point. During last summer’s by-election, on July 8, there was a massive storm that literally hovered above Etobicoke–Lakeshore on that day, flooding some parts of my riding to the same extent as they were flooded by the infamous Hurricane Hazel in the 1950s. I observed people being carried out of their homes by brave firefighters on that night because of the flooding and the overflowing creeks and rivers in the community. While it’s easy to say that was a freak storm, in December of last year we had an ice storm. Again, large parts of Toronto and large parts of Etobicoke–Lakeshore were profoundly affected by it. It is no longer a matter of scientific debate whether climate change exists, it’s a reality; and this government is making investments to create a more sustainable energy sector and to provide support to municipalities to build the kind of infrastructure that will help us withstand the challenges of the decades ahead.", "This government is also a very compassionate government that cares about improving health care, improving long-term care and providing more support for seniors to stay in their homes. This is a government that is also focused on making sure that those who provide essential services to the most vulnerable people in our province can make a living wage. I was shocked, as a citizen, that our party was the only party that came out strongly in favour of increases to the minimum wage when this government brought that forward. This government brought forward increases in pay for personal support workers—also very important. I know, from when my mother required that kind of service, how difficult it was to get and how caring those people were. They deserve to be treated well, and this government is going to make sure that they are.", "It’s also very important that this government is thinking in the long term, not just in a four-year election cycle. It’s thinking about the retirement maybe not of me but of my daughter, by creating a pension fund that, really, our federal counterparts should assist us with—they have the CPP—but they choose not to. Under the leadership of Kathleen Wynne, which is real leadership—she is saying that Ontario will do the right thing for our citizens in generations to come. That is why we’ll be implementing the Ontario pension plan, something that I’m very proud of, Mr. Speaker.", "So this throne speech represents a vision of this province that is not abstract. It will impact the daily lives of residents across the province and of my neighbours in Etobicoke–Lakeshore immediately, by making those investments in infrastructure that are so badly needed; by helping to support job creation, and everybody agrees we need to do more to sustain that by doing it in a smart way through partnerships with the private sector; by supporting a strong education system; good health care; and supports for the most vulnerable people in our society.", "Mr. Speaker, I feel that Etobicoke–Lakeshore is a microcosm of the province in many ways, and the way that this government’s throne speech impacts Etobicoke–Lakeshore so positively, I am convinced it will impact every riding in this province positively. I look forward to getting to know parts of this province better as an MPP and to working with my colleagues from all parts of the province, finding out more about their problems and the solutions they want to come up with, whichever side of the aisle they come from.", "Mr. Speaker, thank you, and I’m so proud to be a member of this House." ],

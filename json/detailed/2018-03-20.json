I want to thank the Premier for this opportunity.", "In Ontario, we are fortunate to have access to the highest-quality health care. Every day we hear of the caring, compassionate and dedicated staff who are focused on helping patients get the best possible care. Our government has been increasing investments in health care at near-record levels, and Ontario’s health care system is something to be proud of.", "Mr. Speaker, we also know that Ontario’s economy has been performing strongly. In fact, it has outperformed nearly every other major economy, thanks to the hard work of the people of this province. But despite increased investments and a strong economy, many families are still facing challenges. Every day our government hears from people who share their stories, and they are a reflection of so many others who share similar experiences. These stories are particularly important because they have informed the steps our government must take moving forward.", "Mr. Speaker, we need to make investments that will better enable people to care for their loved ones, and the throne speech reflected that. It’s about making deliberate choices to invest in the care and the services that the people of this province rely on. It’s about laying out a plan of care and opportunity for the people of Ontario.", "This throne speech is about investing in areas that will make life easier for Ontarians. It’s about doing more for people. It’s about demonstrating that our government is not going to pull back at a time when many Ontarians are in need of support.", "Our government has always worked hard to provide better care for Ontarians. As Minister of Health and Long-Term Care, I know that our government has worked to transform the health care system into one that puts patients first. We recognize that, as our population ages, home and community care is becoming even more important, and we value all of our hard-working health care professionals in Ontario. We know that personal support workers, or PSWs, are incredibly dedicated to their clients, and we value the services they provide for families. To strengthen this critical workforce and address the challenges of recruitment and retention, our government increased the hourly wage for all PSWs in the publicly funded home and community care sector. This important investment reflects just one of the ways that Ontario is helping to provide much-needed care to Ontarians.", "At the start of the year, we saw the biggest expansion to medicare in a generation with the introduction of OHIP+, children and youth pharmacare. As of January 1 of this year, we began providing free prescription drugs for children and youth aged 24 and under. Four million children and youth now have access to over 4,400 drugs, including antibiotics to treat infections, inhalers for asthma, various insulins, oral diabetic medications and diabetes test strips. OHIP+ covers drugs to treat arthritis, epilepsy and other chronic conditions; medications also to treat mental health conditions, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder drugs. It includes drugs to treat some childhood cancers and other rare conditions. These drugs are provided at no cost, with no fees and no copayment.", "Over one million young people aged 24 and under have had their prescriptions filled at no cost under OHIP+, and the numbers continue to grow. OHIP+ is a critical way that Ontario is helping to provide children and youth to get a better start in life. We want everyone in Ontario to feel this kind of freedom so they can make better choices and increase the quality of life for themselves and their families. This is a significant first step toward our vision of universal pharmacare that will help bring free drug coverage to everyone and ultimately will result in a healthier, more productive province.", "All of these investments speak to our government’s commitment to transform our health care system into one that puts the needs of patients at its centre. We recognize how important it is for patients to have access to high-quality health care when and where they need it. We believe that a healthier Ontario, where no one is left behind, is a stronger Ontario.", "Through the Patients First: Action Plan for Health Care, Ontario has been working to deliver care that is easy to access and more equitable for all Ontarians. Ontario’s health care system is something we should be incredibly proud of. Across the board, from the leadership to the doctors and nurses and the support staff on the front lines, we have built a health care system that is doing an incredible job of taking care of the people we love. Yet for all that we have accomplished, we recognize that there is more work to do. We know how important high-quality health care is to Ontario families, and we will continue to make investing in high-quality care a priority.", "As outlined in the throne speech, we are proposing to make significant investments in the operation of our hospitals as part of the 2018 budget. Our government is focused on investments that will provide families across the province with faster access to care, to meet the needs of growing and aging populations.", "We are committed to a strong, stable, publicly funded hospital system that delivers quality patient services efficiently, and we are working diligently to reduce the wait times for patients. In February, our government announced $187 million in ongoing support to make more hospital beds available for patients. The investments we are proposing in the budget will support each hospital in Ontario to continue to deliver high-quality care that meets the unique needs and priorities of their communities.", "Those investments will also help to expand essential services and procedures that patients and their families need. Yet our government also recognizes that hospitals are not always a patient’s first choice for care, nor is it necessarily the most appropriate option. We understand that patients want to be able to get the care they need as close to home as possible. Our government is committed to expanding community support services to ensure that people receive care to meet that goal.", "Through the Patients First Act, our government provided the foundation for a patient-centred home and community care sector that is fully integrated with other health care providers, and that is responsive to and respectful of patients’ needs. As well, Aging with Confidence: Ontario’s Action Plan for Seniors, lays out a plan to meet the needs of seniors as they grow older.", "We all have a collective responsibility to care for our seniors. For that reason, we will focus on major investments in home care to provide more services for people aging at home and provide financial relief for families caring for aging loved ones. The investments we are proposing will help to improve home and community care services today while investing for tomorrow. They will also provide patients and their caregivers with greater choice and control over their home care. Expanding home and community care will ensure the ongoing sustainability of our health care system and will address the needs of our growing seniors population.", "Our government has been working hard to provide integrated care to all Ontarians, and that includes all health care, both physical and mental health. We know that one in five Ontarians will experience a mental health illness in their lifetime and we have been clear on this side of the House that there is no health without mental health.", "We commend all of the brave individuals who have been speaking out across the province to reduce the stigma around mental health. We understand that for many people with mental health and addiction issues, seeking support through publicly funded services is a critical first step towards recovery.", "Every Ontarian deserves access to mental health services to support them in living fulfilled and healthy lives. That is why we will continue to prioritize the growing need for mental health and addictions care in Ontario: to help people get the mental health and addictions services they need quickly and close to home.", "We recognize that we need to support not only those who are experiencing mental health challenges but those who care for them as well. The investments we are proposing will help to streamline access to care so that Ontarians will know where and how to access mental health and addictions information anywhere in the province. Again, it’s about providing Ontarians with the support they need to care for their families and loved ones.", "I spoke earlier about the success of OHIP+ since it was first launched back in January. The introduction of OHIP+ was an important step forward in the history of medicare in Ontario and across the country. It represents the first step in achieving the goal of universal pharmacare for all, but it is only the first step.", "Speaker, as outlined in the throne speech, our government is proposing to expand OHIP+. That means more people without a drug or dental benefits plan would have access to more affordable prescription drugs and dental care. It represents another step forward toward the goal of truly universal health care for the people of Ontario.", "Mr. Speaker, our government is working to strengthen our health care system today and for the future. We want to ensure that everyone in Ontario can access the publicly funded health care they require, when they need it the most. A high-quality health care system is about more than helping patients find the care they need. A healthy population is also critical to helping Ontario thrive and grow toward a brighter future. Helping more people to access the prescription drugs and mental health supports they need to be well also helps them to participate fully in their community.", "For those caring for aging parents at home, having access to the professional support and financial relief they need helps them to go to work each day with more energy and confidence. It means they are able to put more money away for their own future.", "All of these investments in health care represent just one part of our government’s overall investment in Ontarians, and in a brighter future for our province.", "It gives me great pleasure now to turn you over to my colleague the Minister of Seniors Affairs, who will share with you further details of our plan for care and opportunity." ],

Our vision honours how far we have come, yet remains squarely focused on where we are heading. From child care to education, health care to the economy, our government has shown true compassion and a deep understanding for the challenges Ontarians face in their homes, workplaces and wider community. Our government has shown that we will not take a narrow view in response to the change each sector is facing, nor will we look solely at the opportunities these changes present for benefits in the short term.", "We have shown that Ontarians come from diverse backgrounds and perspectives. Of course, the tools each of us needs to live life to our full potential will also be diverse. This is, of course, also true of seniors. Seniors are an example of a demographic where the needs vary extensively.", "There is a common perception, often perpetuated by certain members of this Legislature, that Ontarians over the age of 65 can be addressed as one collective group. The opposition seems content to view seniors solely through the lens of health care, a view that, when you turn 65, your abilities diminish and your aspirations are a thing of the past. As Minister of Seniors Affairs, I can tell you that this unified view of seniors is far from true. The dynamism I see on a daily basis is strong and widespread, and it has informed our government’s approach to caring for seniors. We view them holistically. We recognize that the supports you require at 65 will be different from the supports you require at 85.", "Ontario is home to more than two million seniors, a number that is expected to double in the next 25 years. As individuals, they have made extraordinary contributions to our province, a province I think we can all agree would be unrecognizable had it not been for their talent, ingenuity and commitment to bettering the world around them. As they age, seniors deserve to participate and achieve as they have always done: In different fields, in different ways, they want to continue to build our province.", "The one thing that I have heard from seniors across this province is quite simple: They say, “We want to continue to lead lives of purpose. We want society to continue to give us the opportunities to fulfill our new dreams and new aspirations.” This is the fundamental thing that seniors are telling us. My ministry conducted an opinion poll, a survey of seniors. An astonishing 80% of Ontario seniors told us they want to learn something new. That is at the base of our strategy for seniors: to recognize their dynamism, their continuing desire to continue to—", "Interjections." ],

I went there thinking I was going to help put drywall in place, but as it turned out they said that first I have to learn how to drive a nail through a two-by-four the right way. In the time that I had, that was all I could do: learn how to drive a nail through a two-by-four the right way. But I also learned something more powerful. I learned that 75% of Habitat for Humanity’s crew leaders are seniors—75%. It’s a powerful reminder of how seniors continue to build up Ontario. I often hear people say seniors have helped build Ontario, and I’m here to tell you that Ontario seniors are continuing to build up Ontario, and as the Minister of Seniors Affairs, I’m committed to giving them that opportunity.", "That is why, Mr. Speaker, last November I was proud to join the Premier in Hamilton to introduce Aging with Confidence: Ontario’s Action Plan for Seniors. Aging with Confidence lays out our government’s plan to help seniors live their best life at every age. It captures the hope and optimism seniors across this province feel while also addressing any apprehension they may have, notably about receiving the right supports to help them age with dignity. It lays out our government’s plan to support seniors living independently, those requiring enhanced supports at home and in their community, and those requiring intensive supports.", "Our government recognizes there are a number of challenges that accompany aging, and whether seniors require a little bit of care or a lot of care, the services should be there for them. Aging with Confidence includes more than $155 million in new investment for initiatives that keep seniors independent, healthy, active, safe and socially connected.", "I recently was visiting a retirement community in Mississauga. In one-on-one conversations, I asked a number of them, “What is the secret to living a long and happy life?” The answers were almost unanimous: Stay active, never stop learning and go out and meet people. I met an 86-year-old woman who still goes skating. She still goes ice-skating. In fact, she doesn’t just skate in Ontario; she tours the United States. That is the human potential: Never stop learning, never stop being active. In that light, our government has committed to funding initiatives that allow seniors to be active and engage with their peers.", "We are expanding our Seniors Community Grant Program by committing $11 million over three years to support more recreational, educational and social opportunities for seniors. We received tremendous interest this year, vindicating our decision to grow the program and have it benefit more seniors. This innovative program has supported activities that have benefitted more than 435,000 seniors since its inception.

This will expand the seniors active living centres network to over 300, allowing Ontarians to benefit from the programming these centres provide, including exercise classes, transportation services and communal dining experiences.", "From Ancaster to Ottawa, Cobourg to London, I have toured many of the seniors active living centres our province has to offer. These facilities are led by outstanding teams of staff dedicated to providing seniors with a wide range of programming and engagement opportunities. These centres are an essential component of our government’s commitment to addressing social isolation.", "We are supporting shared learning experiences between seniors and youth. There will be an investment of $600,000 over two years to support the existing ChangeTheWorld program that links youth volunteers with seniors to help enable their use of technology.", "There will also be an investment of over $4 million over two years to establish a senior-youth mentorship program. This program will build relationships and encourage knowledge sharing between generations. We want to harness the opportunity for seniors to share with youth their wealth of lived experiences, on everything from career management to life skills.", "We are also set to expand the successful age-friendly community grant program—a program whose success will be on display at next week’s Age-Friendly Communities Symposium. This symposium, the first of its kind in Canada, will highlight Ontario’s progress on developing age-friendly communities in small, urban and rural settings, including multicultural and indigenous communities. The goal is to showcase communities that have made tremendous progress building a physical and social environment that is accessible to people of all ages.", "During the symposium, I will be presenting 40 municipalities with the brand new Ontario Age-Friendly Community Recognition Award. I would ask all members of provincial Parliament in this Legislature that if your municipality is getting an age-friendly recognition award—there are 40 municipalities that we are awarding—please be at hand to support your municipality and your constituencies by attending this awards ceremony. This award will honour communities that have led the way in making their communities more age-friendly and will inspire others to follow their example.", "Keeping seniors safe is another fundamental pillar of Aging with Confidence. No senior should live fearing they will be taken advantage of by a family member or a salesperson at the door. Our government is taking a holistic approach by investing in efforts to prevent these incidents from occurring and then providing the right supports in the event this abuse does take place.", "Over one third of seniors have not designated a trusted power of attorney. A public awareness campaign will raise awareness among seniors of how important and how easy it is to set up a power of attorney and to encourage them to choose who can make personal care and financial decisions on their behalf if necessary. Easy-to-use resources, including information on how to prevent POA misuse, will be readily available online.", "Hearing stories of seniors being victimized by consumer scams is both disturbing and disheartening. Recognizing that seniors are increasingly being targeted, manipulated and, in some cases, even forced to hand over their financial information to individuals wishing to inflict harm, our government has taken action. We have committed to launching a consumer protection program aimed at protecting seniors’ hard-earned money through education and awareness, as well as through enhanced assistance for seniors who have fallen victim to these threats or scams.", "Ontario’s Office of the Public Guardian and Trustee is the public guardian for over 13,000 mentally incapable adults, an office that touches the lives of more than 50,000 of Ontario’s most vulnerable citizens. We are committed to strengthening this office with an investment of $10 million over two years. This will go towards the creation of a contact centre, improving information management and modernizing service delivery—all designed to support anticipated increases in volume and complexity.", "Seniors have made it exceptionally clear that they want to live in their own homes and in their community for as long as possible. They have told us that few things are more important than maintaining their independence. But at the same time, they have said that independence should not come at the cost of social isolation.", "These are the three threads that we have married in our seniors strategy, because Ontario seniors have told us three things: “We want to continue to lead lives of purpose. We want to live in our own homes for as long as possible and as independently as possible, but not become socially isolated.” We’ve taken these three threads and married them together, and that is the essence of Ontario’s Seniors Strategy.", "As my colleague the Minister of Health and Long-Term Care outlined earlier, our government has taken a holistic approach to supporting seniors’ health care.

For generations, human life expectancy has been increasing, and this has allowed all of us to live longer and has allowed us to view 65 as the start of a new adventure rather than the end of a road well travelled. Part of a good retirement is, of course, financial security.

People need help making ends meet, people need help finding jobs and people need help with supports for their families. For working families with young children, these stresses and strains can be particularly difficult and challenging. Families need a government that cares, a government that puts supports in place and will make life easier so they can succeed.", "One of the most vital supports young families need right now to succeed is access to quality, affordable child care. Child care allows parents to head to work with peace of mind so they can participate in our economy and provide for their families. Child care allows mothers to head back to work when they choose so they can support their families knowing their children are being well looked after. And child care allows our kids to grow up in happy, healthy, safe learning environments so they can get the best possible start in life.", "Mr. Speaker, when our government held consultations on the gender wage gap, the number one recommendation that was made was to increase access to affordable, high-quality licensed child care. Think about that: Access to quality, affordable child care was the number one and number two recommendation given to us to close the gender wage gap and create a fair and just society for all. So we decided to do just that: create a strong system of quality, affordable child care to support families so they can flourish and thrive and lay the foundation for a stronger Ontario for all of us.", "In fact, research shows that child care sets our kids on an early path to long-term success. It promotes women’s participation in the workforce, reduces the gender wage gap, strengthens our overall economy and gives our kids a strong start in life. Think about that: A strong child care system builds a stronger Ontario.", "By transforming the way we deliver child care, we not only create a strong future for children and families, but we also create a strong future for Ontario workers. By creating 100,000 new licensed child care spaces over the next five years, we will also be creating thousands of valuable jobs for Ontarians. This is good for kids, good for families and good for the economy. That’s why we delivered a speech from the throne that commits to building a quality, affordable child care system for Ontario families.", "We will be making deliberate, strong choices to invest in the care and services the people of this province need and rely on, services that include public education, early years programming and child care. Speaker, Ontario is a leader in these areas and our publicly funded education system is recognized internationally as one of the best when it comes to excellence. Our early years and child care system is preparing our children for the future by giving them the best possible start in life. Our vision for education and the early years is a system that’s inclusive, equitable and accessible, a system that puts our children on a seamless continuum of learning from birth, to kindergarten, to grade 12 and beyond.", "Speaker, the bottom line is that this makes for a stronger and more prosperous Ontario for everyone who calls this great province home. It’s about equity, it’s about fairness and it’s about creating a solid future for everyone. This success is a direct result of key priorities we’ve made over the last 15 years. This includes our publicly funded education system—that’s 72 school boards, nearly 5,000 schools and two million students. It’s about supporting those students so they can flourish, thrive and reach their full potential. That’s why our government has made historic investments in education through the Grants for Student Needs, which is projected to be $23.9 billion for the 2017-18 school year. That’s a 66% increase since 2003 and more than $4,900 more per student.", "Just think about that. We have supported our children, invested in our education system and worked tirelessly to create an environment that supports and cares for our children. And, Mr. Speaker, because of these investments, student achievement is up, graduation rates are up and public confidence in our publicly funded schools is up. Parents know their children are getting the education they need to succeed, and students know they are getting the opportunity to fulfill their potential and become engaged, productive citizens.", "The same thing can be said for our youngest learners. We are giving our children the best possible start in life, so we can put them on a path to lifelong success. That’s why we are transforming our early years and child care system.", "It began with an ambitious modernization plan, where we replaced the Day Nurseries Act with new legislation and developed How Does Learning Happen, a resource that strengthens the quality of early years services across Ontario. We continued with new regulations to transform our early years system and to protect our youngest and most vulnerable learners. We eliminated unfair child care wait-list fees. We committed to transform the way we deliver child care in this province by creating more quality, affordable, licensed spaces.", "Since we took office, Mr. Speaker, our investments in child care have increased by 182%, to $1.58 billion. Furthermore, our government has committed to $1.6 billion over five years to help 100,000 more children aged zero to four access licensed child care over five years. And starting this past year, this commitment includes capital funding to support the creation of 45,000 licensed spaces in schools and communities.", "This groundbreaking commitment is part of our Renewed Early Years and Child Care Policy Framework. This is our blueprint for the future. It’s a plan to transform Ontario’s early years and child care system to support families right across this province. This seven-point plan supports our government’s vision for the early years, to ensure that Ontario’s children and families are well supported by a system of responsive, high-quality, accessible and increasingly integrated early years programs and services, a system that contributes to healthy child development today and a stronger future tomorrow.", "That’s why, Mr. Speaker, I’m proud to say that our upcoming budget will continue to support child care access in Ontario. We will directly address the cost of child care and make it more affordable for families in Ontario. Affordability is a big priority for our government and will bring welcome relief to those who rely on child care.", "Strong support in the early years is just the first piece. When children in Ontario turn four, they now have access to full-day kindergarten. FDK provides early, high-quality education to four- and five-year-olds, and it’s a huge savings for families. When we implemented FDK, it was recognized as the most significant transformation in our education system in a generation. It’s unique because it includes a play-based learning approach and a nimble and flexible staffing team of a teacher and an early childhood educator. It’s groundbreaking. It’s forward-thinking.", "Our innovative approach to education continues through the elementary level. Again, it’s about that seamless continuum of learning for all.", "We’ve focused on better ways of teaching students the basics of literacy and numeracy, and we’ve worked hard to develop their higher-order skills. We want creativity, citizenship and critical-thinking skills to be embedded in all aspects of our education system. This means that rather than just teaching students to remember information, we’re teaching them how to use and synthesize that information practically and beyond the classroom.", "The results speak for themselves. In 2016-17, overall results show that 71% of grade 3 and grade 6 students are achieving at or above the standard in reading, math and writing. At the secondary level, Ontario has been a trailblazer in offering students opportunities to gain real-life, hands-on experience in the workplace. Our co-op program allows students to combine classroom and workplace learning while earning credits toward their high school diploma. We’ve heard from employers that they are looking for students who have this experience, students who know how to think creatively and critically about problems.", "The groundbreaking Specialist High Skills Major program—SHSM—allows students to choose from 19 different sectors, including agriculture, health and wellness, and transportation, to help them prepare for apprenticeship training, college, university or the workplace.", "In September, more than 50,000 students were enrolled in almost 1,900 SHSM programs. That’s an amazing number of students. These programs allow them to focus on a career path that matches their skills and their interests while meeting the requirements of the Ontario secondary school diploma.", "Mr. Speaker, I can tell you, these innovative secondary programs are absolutely having a positive impact on our students, they are having a positive impact on our schools, and they are having a positive impact on our communities. We know this is having a positive impact on our students because today more students are graduating from high school than ever before, with 86.5% of students graduating in 2016. This is a jump from 68% in 2003-04. That increase in the grad rate means that approximately 217,500 more Ontario students have graduated than would have if the graduation rate had remained at the 2004 level. Think about that. Our work is paying off. Our young people are moving forward.", "Our government has also made significant investments to renew and build new schools across the province, to ensure that students have modern, safe and healthy environments in which to learn. Since 2003, we have provided more than $18 billion in capital funding for school boards to build or rebuild one in six schools in Ontario.", "We are proud of what we have accomplished to improve the education experience for Ontario students, but we also know that we need to go beyond the fundamentals if our students are to succeed in their future. It’s not enough just to get good grades; the public education system also needs to support the emotional, social and physical development of our students. Promoting and supporting well-being and equity is of fundamental importance to Ontario students and in helping them to reach their full potential. This includes supports for student mental health.", "There is no question that young people today are facing some of the most serious mental health challenges. In fact, not a day goes by without us hearing about a young person who is having trouble dealing with stress, suffering from depression or is perhaps contemplating suicide. It’s troubling, it’s heartbreaking, and it’s unacceptable. We have to do everything we can to give our kids the help they need and the support they deserve.", "They don’t need cuts, they need care—a government that cares, helps and supports them. Our kids can’t learn, thrive or be successful if they aren’t happy, healthy and well. And we can’t build a solid foundation for our children and their future if we don’t give our children peace of mind. There is a call for action, and all we have to do is listen and act. The time to act is now.", "Mr. Speaker, we are strengthening well-being supports for all students, educators and staff in order to make schools across the province more inclusive, safe and welcoming environments. The plan was informed by feedback from thousands of Ontarians through province-wide engagements over the past year. And we are investing $49 million over three years to support it. But we aren’t stopping there.", "Our upcoming budget will continue to support student mental health and well-being. In the 2018 budget, you will see major investments in mental health services Ontarians need. This will expand access to mental health care and ensure people can get the support they need in our schools and in our communities. Mr. Speaker, it’s the right thing to do.", "It’s clear that our government has made our education and early years and child care systems a top priority. Along with our key partners, we are committed to delivering responsive, high-quality and accessible services and programs—a full continuum that is integrated and seamless from early learning and child care right through to adult education. That’s because education is one of the most valued public services in Ontario. It’s one of the ways in which we can level the playing field for all our children in this province, for all students and families, and give everyone the opportunity to succeed.", "That’s why, in the upcoming 2018 budget and the years to come, we will continue to focus on equity, achievement and well-being in our publicly funded education system; and access and affordability in our early years and child care system. Mr. Speaker, the reason we are doing this is because we want to make life easier for Ontarians and address the uncertainty that many families are feeling.", "I’m confident that if we remain committed to these priorities, we will begin to reach for even greater heights and build a better province for everyone in Ontario, young and old." ],

I know the Lieutenant Governor reads the speech, but it’s this Premier’s speech. It’s just the tradition. She talked about how people are struggling in Ontario. Yes, you’re right. They are struggling in Ontario. Let me just check my records here. Oh, in October 2003 the Liberals were elected government and they’ve been running this province into the ground ever since.", "So if the people are struggling in Ontario, who do you think is to blame? Is it the opposition, which passes no legislation? Is it the opposition, which makes no appointments to agencies, boards or commissions? Is it the opposition that appoints the deputy ministers and the assistant deputy ministers? No. So if it’s not us, who is it? I suspect it must be those folks over there, Speaker, who have been running this province into the ground for 15 years.", "And now they’re talking about how people are struggling and, “On the eve of our exit, we have found a conscience. We have found a soul. We have loved you all this time but we’ve only begun to realize how deeply. And now we’re going to fix everything. That’s why we needed, in the greatest urgency in the history of mankind, to prorogue the Parliament and have a throne speech.

First of all, they’re going to fix health care. Here we are, probably in the greatest crisis time in Ontario’s health care history, with more people in hallways than ever before. Beds have been closed and people are in hallways, but now they are going to spend the money that’s needed to fix it.", "We’ve got 34,000 people on the waiting list for long-term care. Just a few scant years ago, the Liberals, in their new caring strategy, announced that they were going to build zero new long-term-care beds—zero. Deb Matthews was the Minister of Health at the time, and they were going to build no new beds because they had an aging strategy that did not require them to build new long-term-care beds. We were wondering, “What in the name of Sam Hill are they thinking?” We’ve got an aging population and the numbers of people who are entering their senior years is growing every year, and the level of acuity in our long-term-care homes is getting higher and worse every year, and they’re not going to build long-term-care beds. Their strategy then was, “By the time we build them, the baby boomers will have filtered their way through the system and we’re actually going to need fewer beds.” That’s small consolation to the people who actually need the beds now. “Well, if we just wait until you die off, we’re not going to need the beds.” That was their thinking. I won’t need a bed after I’m dead either. I won’t need this seat. I won’t even need a bed at home; I won’t need one anywhere. But if you’re just waiting for me to die, you could be waiting a while—I hope.", "Then, all of a sudden, the Liberals realized, “Holy moly, we’ve got an election in 2018. We’ve got to come up with a new plan.” So now, last year, “We’re building new beds. Hallelujah. Let the bells ring out and let the banners fly. We’re going to build new beds.” Some 30,000 beds over 10 years, I think it is now. The promises just have no limit. First you’re not building any beds, and now you’re going to build 30,000 beds.", "After 15 years, I suspect that the people of Ontario are on to you. They’re not buying what you’re selling. They have been fooled too many times by these Liberals. The promises that they continue to make are not resonating anymore, because for the people, it’s just hollow talk; it’s empty rhetoric. They don’t view it as being credible anymore. They don’t believe you. They do not believe this government, and that is something, Speaker.", "When you’ve been in power for so long—we’re all raised to believe that the government is there, regardless of its political stripe, regardless of which political party holds the levers of power in any jurisdiction in our western democracies—we are conditioned to believe that they are there for us, the people—we, the people. We are conditioned to believe that government is there for us. They don’t believe that about this government anymore. They don’t believe that about this party. They believe that this party now exists to serve itself, to serve themselves, to serve their agenda, and whatever it takes, whatever message they have to disseminate to the people in order to get elected is the one that they will spread.", "You have to ask yourself if this is where the people have landed, that they no longer believe in the government that is running the show in Ontario. It really is a sad day for democracy. But how did we get there? We didn’t get there with 15 years of good government. Things do go wrong from time to time, and it’s not always the government’s fault. But if the people would be able to sit back and say, “You know, a lot of things happened that were beyond the control of the people in power. We believe that they had our best interests at heart, but sometimes events are bigger than any government”—but that’s not where we are in Ontario. We’ve actually reached a point where political cynicism is at the highest level ever, and it is governments that run for the purpose of re-electing themselves that drive that cynicism to these new record levels. It’s at new record levels, the cynicism that exists in politics today. You have to ask yourself—if only this government was actually acting in the best interests of the people as opposed to their own re-election plans.", "All you have to do, Speaker, is look at the last couple of years. Every bill that has been brought forward by this government, every initiative that they have taken to the people of Ontario, every single thing—the acid test of whether it gets approved in the corner office on the second floor is one thing: “Does this improve our chances on being elected or reduce our chances on being elected? If it passes the test and it says it improves our chances on being elected, that’s the bill we’ll debate in the House.” That is the initiative that will be put forward.", "But how is it possible—and I say this from the point of view of any political party—that the people’s interest and the political party’s interest are always aligned? It just doesn’t work that way. It doesn’t matter if you’re Liberal, Conservative or NDP. That’s the basis on which this government has worked from in the past couple of years: There’s only one test that must be passed and that is, “Does it further our chance for re-election?” Not, “Will it have a detrimental long-term effect on the people of Ontario?” Not, “Will it put us in a financial position that hamstrings future generations for decades to come?” That is not the concern that they have ever asked themselves. They do not care what happens in Ontario over the next generation; they only care what happens in Ontario on June 7. And that is regrettable.", "As people who are elected to this assembly, we have to believe that acting in the best interest of the people we serve will ultimately be in our best interest as well, but the priority has to be the best interest of the people—the people first. If you put the people first I don’t think you’ll ever go wrong.", "It’s not just the big things. I have a list here that, oh, my God, it even pains me to read. The waste and the scandals of this government’s 15 years in office is just—$8 billion on eHealth and we still don’t have it." ],

  "text" : [ "It’s an honour for me to pay tribute today to Norm Jamison, an individual I had the advantage of knowing, having been a member back at the same time and recalling the avalanche of 1990, which led to the New Democratic Party. It was a surprise to many at the beginning of that campaign but not by the end of the campaign. Norm was one of the individuals who were fortunate enough to be elected on that occasion.", "What was interesting was—and the member for Norfolk would know this—that the Haldimand-Norfolk area was not what you would call the heartland of the NDP, by any means. So when Norm started out the campaign—remembering that in the polls in those days, the Liberal government was well ahead at the beginning of that campaign, and by the end was not ahead; I can assure you of that. People who took on the position of candidate in those days in the New Democratic Party were, I think, rather courageous people. I know that there was a scramble sometimes near the end, as there is, to get candidates, and it was good of people to come forward. Many of the people who came forward were from the labour movement, and Norm was one of those.", "He was born in Ireland, I think, as many people would have known, and had an interesting time back in Ireland itself, which had encountered some conflict over the years. He was pleased to come to Canada and to the city of Hamilton, where he would become a worker at Stelco’s Hilton Works plant, and a proud worker at that.", "In 1979, Norm moved to Stelco’s Lake Erie Works in Nanticoke, where he served as the vice-president of United Steelworkers Local 8782. People in the labour movement would know this better than others, but if you think politics is tough in the political scene in which we’re involved, you should be in labour politics; then you would know what tough politics are. My friends who served there would tell me that. But he took that on.", "He became a provincial candidate, actually, in 1987, and a municipal councillor in 1988. He was elected to the House by winning Norfolk for the NDP in that fateful time of 1990.", "Despite having his own doubts about his ability to win, Mr. Jamison went on to advocate for the best interests of his community and steelworkers across Ontario. While he was a member of the steelworkers union—and obviously there were a number of people who worked at the steel works, whether in Hamilton or Nanticoke—he also recognized that he represented a broader community at that time.", "He was appointed parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Industry, Trade and Technology with responsibility for small business, to help local businesses reach new global markets. I found a quote that I thought was rather interesting, because it’s interesting not only in the day that he said it but even relevant today. I’ll mention that a little later on.", "He became parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Economic Development and Trade in 1993. He continued to be what the Hamilton Spectator referred to as a “no-nonsense, straight forward” guy, which meant he could be a pain in the neck to the Premier of the day. There are people like that, I’m told, in various caucuses. He certainly was not afraid to speak up when the NDP caucus got together. That is a particular attribute which I can say I admire in people. I try to actually follow in his footsteps.", "He endlessly did what was right for his constituents, and he was a fierce defender of their interests, even if it meant standing up to his own government in its decision to close Selkirk Provincial Park. That’s tough, again, to be openly critical of your own government for those reasons.", "Following his departure from Queen’s Park in 1995, he returned to Stelco, where he would continue to remain engaged in community relations.", "In his personal life, Norm showed an endless commitment to his community as the United Way representative for Norfolk county and a member of the Lions Club.", "Norm’s efforts in advocating for his constituents and standing up for citizens across Ontario serve as an example of the role of member of provincial Parliament. As a result, it’s my pleasure, as I say, to pay tribute.", "I found a quote that he made that I thought was rather interesting. I may not be able to quote it exactly, but he talked about the fact that in competition, you don’t go to the bottom. There was a lot of pressure in those days. Remember, they were in the midst of a very deep recession, and the pressure was to make concessions on the part of labour and for governments to make concessions to everybody else because they wanted to keep business.", "He said, “We will not succeed in meeting our competitive challenge by developing a business environment which features low wages, little security for workers and little protection for the natural environment. I believe we cannot go back to the time of a dollar-an-hour wage. Our future prosperity will depend on sustained innovation, the ability to adapt to quickly changing circumstances in our community and our ability to deliver these high-value products and services that are not vulnerable to low-cost competitors.”", "That is almost throughout time that that pressure is there. He resisted that particular pressure, and his constituents, particularly those who were involved in industry, were very thankful for that.", "We thank the members of the family who are here today for sharing Norm with us for five years, and actually for sharing him with the community in the other capacities in which he served. I certainly pay tribute to him and to his colleagues in the New Democratic Party who happened to know him. Perhaps they didn’t serve with him—one member did; the member for Timmins–James Bay would have served with him—but he was certainly an individual who will be remembered within the caucus and within the constituency in which he was so active." ],

He was quiet, thoughtful, courteous. He was a listener and an engaging conversationalist. Norm had respect. And why wouldn’t he have respect? He was a steelworker, loyal to his union, and a devoted family man.", "Norm was handsome, northern Irish, with the kind of stature you don’t mess with. I will quote Ian Nichols, an area NDP candidate: “One of the things that sticks in my mind is that he was from Ireland ... if you wanted to go toe to toe with someone, he wasn’t the guy to do that with. Everyone who knew him, understood this.”", "Norm was born in Magherafelt, Northern Ireland. His family immigrated to Canada in 1952 to escape sectarian strife between Protestants and Roman Catholics. Norm returned to Ireland in 1970 and joined the Ulster defence unit. He tired of the violence and the occasional chance meetings with Irish republican toughs.", "Upon his return, Norm renewed his acquaintance with Sharon. The pair had met at a dance in Hamilton in the weeks just before he left for Europe. They married and went on to have four daughters.", "I recall Eileen, the youngest, speaking at the funeral, describing herself as “my dad’s favourite,” saying her dad would drive his daughters anywhere, just to be with them, shopping for things they didn’t need. Then Shannon came forward saying—and I took notes—“I’m pretty sure I was his favourite,” describing her dad as so physically and emotionally strong. Then from Andrea and Carrie—also their dad’s favourites, by the way—we heard that Norm taught his daughters how to throw a punch. With four daughters, Norm must have got up at about 4 in the morning to have a shower. I don’t know how he accommodated that.", "Four sons-in-law, of course: Matt Sankar, Dave Spoelstra, Chad Husted and Tim Makins. And the grandchildren: Christian, Ava, Noah, Lucas, Zachary, Caitlin and Brooklyn.", "As Norm’s health faltered, he received a call from Bob Rae. Sharon put the call on speakerphone, and Norm’s eyes opened and a smile crossed his face once he heard his leader’s voice.", "To quote the former Premier, Bob Rae: “He was an outstandingly hard-working, decent, engaging man, and was the source of good advice, counsel and support to me as Premier. I thought the world of him then and now. He thoroughly enjoyed his elected service and was an outstanding MPP. He was one of those politicians who generated respect and affection from people in all parties.”", "Prior to my being elected in 1995, I was fortunate to build up a working relationship with Norm. I was doing joint union-management work with industry, including steelworkers and Stelco management. Every year I would sit in Norm’s office to get his commitment to do the opening keynote address for our annual symposium. I know Sharon got dragged to that on at least one occasion.", "We also worked together during the 1995 election to ensure that the all-candidates’ nights were fair, respectful and well organized. I was the rookie and Norm would mentor me, offering me good advice throughout the election. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is just one measure of the kind of man that was Norm Jamison. I’ve said this many, many times: Norm Jamison was a true gentleman, a true representative of his family and our local area.", "Sharon, just the other day, told us that the day Norm was elected was a dream come true, and throughout his service, his priority was to do a good job for his constituents and to contribute to the area. And that he did—I can attest to that—all the while looking after and making time for his family.", "“Norm was honoured to serve,” Sharon said. “He was very proud of it and he’d be thrilled with the tribute today.”" ],

We both are history buffs, strong defenders of our ridings’ interests—and I have three daughters; Norm beat me by one. I think we might have been long-lost twins; it’s quite possible.", "I have to admit, reading about some of his work, I was quite impressed. There was one quote of his that especially struck me as a good idea. During a point of order on December 6, 1994, he said that all MPPs needed to shorten their statements and questions to let more people talk; I can relate to that. I’m sure we would all agree the statement makes him a true visionary. In honour of Norm Jamison, I think some of us should start cutting our speeches in half.", "From everything I’ve learned, researching Norm, I got the sense that it would have been an incredible privilege to know him personally. I also recognize that he had a wonderful impact on the people he knew.", "I’m proud also to introduce a large group of Norm’s family today. That includes his wife of 45 years, Sharon; children Carrie, Andrea, Shannon and Eileen; their spouses Tim, Chad, David and Matt; as well as Norm’s grandchildren Caitlin, Brooklyn, Lucas, Zachary, Noah, Christian and Ava. It’s certainly no small group, Speaker.", "Norm had many people who loved him and looked up to him. So, to all of you who are here today, thank you so much for sharing Norm. From all of us, thank you for sharing Norm with us, as we are all aware that there’s a great deal of dedication required for both an MPP and their family. Long days spent on the campaign trail, unexpected difficulties that arise regularly—everything is amplified a million times. I’m sure we would all like to say this to our loved ones. Thank you for all the love and support you gave to Norm.", "After reading a bit about Norm, it made me want to learn more. With that in mind, I thought it would be most appropriate to reach out to some of the many Norm was close with, to get a better understanding of who Norm was. Today, I’m going to read out just a few of the many statements from his colleagues in the Legislature.", "To give you a sense of Norm’s dedication to his riding, I will start with a quote from someone who worked with Norm, current senator and former minister Frances Lankin:", "“Norm Jamison was a large man with a large personality and a large heart. Norm invited me down to his riding a number of times, and I could see the relationship he had with his constituents. He was always there for them and you could see the high regard in which they held Norm as their MPP.", "“I first worked more closely with Norm when I was Minister of Health. We were taking strong policy steps with respect to the negative health effect of smoking. Norm represented Norfolk”—big tobacco country—and the farmers. “He was the parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Industry and he took a very active role advocating for the farmers in his home community.", "“Sometime not too long after, there was a cabinet shuffle and I was moved to the new Ministry of Economic Development and Trade. Norm was the PA and the first day in my new portfolio, Norm showed up in my office, sat down”—calmly—“and said, ‘Okay, so you are no longer Minister of Health. You are responsible for economic development.’ A pause—’Now, let’s talk about tobacco farming.’", "“He was tough, tenacious, a lot of fun to work with and always put his community first. He left us much, much too early.”", "Former MPP and minister Rosario Marchese was also eager to pay his respects to Norm. He had wanted to be here at the event but, unfortunately, is travelling at the moment. However, he was somehow able to send a message, using some pretty shaky WiFi, all the way from Chile. Here’s part of that message:", "“Norm always struck me as a sincere, humble man committed to his district. A union guy through and through. I was so sorry to hear of his passing and my heart goes out to his family.”", "The final quote I want to leave with you is one from Norm’s wife. She wrote to me about Norm’s incredible dedication to his family:", "“Norm was always interested in politics and had a very strong social conscience. His political activity started when he campaigned for the NDP candidate Ian Deans in Hamilton”—my area. “When he moved out to Norfolk in 1981, he joined the NDP riding association and became the provincial candidate in that area. In 1990 he was elected as a New Democrat. His dedication to his constituents and the communities he represented was evident everywhere in his riding and appreciated by all who knew him. He was well liked and made a very positive and significant difference in the Norfolk riding.", "“Family was everything to him, and no matter how busy he was, we”—the family—“always came first. He instilled a strong belief that family is the most important thing,” and it was everything to him. “We would describe him as someone who wore his heart on his sleeve and gave of himself unconditionally. He loved people, loved hearing their stories, learning from them and helping them. He was genuine in all that he did and taught his girls to treat everyone with love and respect and to fight for what you believe in. Norm was a fighter until the very end, when he lost his courageous battle with liver cancer.”", "“A few of Norm’s favourite pieces of advice were as follows: ‘Life is about choices,’ and ‘Every day you are miserable is a day wasted.’ I think I may have wasted a few.”" ],

The owner basically told him to leave it alone.

There is no reset on 15 years of Liberal waste, mismanagement and scandals. Every election year, since 2003, to be exact, Premiers have made their commitments on billions of dollars in new spending. However, these pre-election—or in their case, re-election—ploys are a desperate attempt to try to save their government. I’m going to give some examples a bit later on, Speaker, but I have to tell you, when I did question period this morning, I talked about who do they think they’re fooling, because the people of Ontario are smarter than that.

When I say that yesterday we heard a laundry list for the Liberal insiders, they were the ones who were really listening carefully: “What’s in it for me?” That’s what we heard loudly and clearly yesterday.", "The other aspect of it, Speaker, is that the Liberals are trying—and it’s a desperate attempt—to spend their way to votes instead of trying to fix our province for all the people of Ontario. I’ve said this one sentence in this Legislature many times: The economy is not going to take off by the government taking our money. That just doesn’t work.

This is an Ontario where people cannot depend on their government to care for them and their families.", "Let me give you another example from my riding, Speaker. I’ve told this story a couple of times in the Legislature, but it bears repeating because it is such a poignant story and it encapsulates the Ontario that this Liberal government has created. There was a gentleman who came into our office in the riding of Nipissing. He was looking for help because his power had been cut off, and as a result of that, his pipes froze and burst and put water everywhere—pretty much ruined the house, by the way. He told us that every single night, he shovelled snow into his bathtub so that he could have water in the morning in which to bathe. That is the Ontario that this government created. Can you imagine that this is what has happened to people as a result of these Liberal policies?", "This house is nine doors from the house I grew up in in North Bay, basically in the centre of the city. It’s on a very busy street. This is a real story of a real constituent who came in with real issues—a very tragic and very sad story.", "This is an Ontario where our seniors are neglected and left in hallways in hospitals without proper care. First I want to congratulate our front-line health care workers. They’re doing amazing with the resources that this government has left them. They have left them next to nothing, but they’re surviving.", "A couple of weeks ago, I was door-knocking. I had one of the television networks with me to follow me. We met for coffee, and I said, “You pick the area we’re going to go. You pick the house you want me to knock on.” They picked a subdivision. We drove there together, and they picked the houses that I was to go and knock on. The cameras came up, and the first door I knocked on was a nurse. We told her, “Do you mind that the network is going to follow us in? Do you want to talk to them?” “Yes, I’m fine with that.” She has got her nurse’s scrubs on. She said, “I’m going to tell you a story about what happened last night.” She was determined, let me say, Speaker. She said, “We knew we had to bring a patient into a room, but our hospital”—which is not that old. I remember, as mayor of the city of North Bay, the ribbon cutting, and I was mayor up until 2010, so this is not an old hospital.", "In fact, they closed 60 beds in this hospital. There are 60 beds closed. If you go into one of the twin rooms, the double rooms, the bed is actually gone. Everything is removed. They’re down in storage. So when they say that they closed 60 beds, it’s not sort of a nudge and wink; this is an empty facility now—nothing there. The phone—everything is gone; the television—everything is out of the room.", "They desperately needed a place for this one particular patient. I know that there are patients in the hallway. My mother was one of those patients who spent 12 hours in the hallway. She was 83 at the time that it happened. This is the Ontario that they’ve created.", "So the nurse told us that they cleaned out a closet. You’ve heard of a story from the third party, a story in Sudbury where they cleaned out a bathroom and had a patient live in that bathroom. Well, they cleaned out a closet at this hospital. This was the nurse telling us—myself and the CBC—the story. They cleaned out the closet, and that became the patient’s room.", "This is the Ontario that this Liberal government has created.

That’s the contempt that the Liberals have for our society’s most vulnerable.", "The one thing that we heard in the pre-budget hearings—it’s one thing to hear these very shameful stats, but it’s another thing entirely to look someone in the eye who is suffering and hear their personal story. That’s what happened in this year’s pre-budget consultations, in two different—actually, three. I’ll tell you about the third one in a moment.", "The poor handling of mental health issues by this government was a common theme at almost every pre-budget hearing in January. We heard that this government is not doing enough for those who are suffering issues of mental health.", "The words of a 17-year-old student in Sudbury who decided to share his story left a lasting impression on everyone in attendance. He said: “I attempted suicide. I’m extremely fortunate to be here today. I felt utterly alone.” He went on to explain that “most youth are unsure of what to do and where to go” when they need help; that, too often, they don’t know the resources, if any, that are available to them, and sometimes they simply cannot access those resources.", "Another presenter told us how his battle with depression led him to also attempt suicide. He described our mental health system as “a broken system that has ... and will continue to take more lives if we don’t start acting now.”", "Speaker, we cannot and we must not let these words ring hollow.", "However, the most tragic story was about an individual who could not be there to share their own story. A London health care worker explained how a lack of resources meant turning away people at the doors of their hospital’s urgent care department: “One of those poor souls committed suicide in the parking lot” of the hospital.", "Mr. Speaker, when you hear stories such as the three I refer to, it simply breaks your heart. We absolutely must do more than this government is doing.", "Canadians are proud of our health care system, as they should be. As I said earlier, we have some of the most highly trained and compassionate health care providers in the country. But a system can always be improved, and in hearing those three stories especially, it’s clear more than a little improvement is needed when it comes to mental health.", "One of the expressions we heard so often was: If you break a leg, you go and you get treated; you present yourself at the hospital with mental health issues, and you have a tendency to be on a list that could be six months, could be more. We heard of an example of 18 months. We need to be treating mental health the same way that we treat other physical health, but it does not seem that this Liberal government believes that.", "Let me explain what I mean by that, Speaker. I’ll give you some examples of the health care cuts: There’s over a billion dollars in cuts, including $815 million cut from physician services in 2015 alone—stunning; 50 medical residency positions eliminated; $20 million slashed from the Assistive Devices Program; and $50 million cut from physiotherapy services for seniors.", "I recall that one of the seniors told me—this is anecdotal—that they used to be able to go in after a hip or a knee surgery and have therapy, and it would be up to so many sessions. I think they said that it was 50 or 100 sessions. Now it’s cut to four, whether they’re healed or not. That is the $50 million that was cut from physiotherapy services for seniors; again, 1,600 nurses cut since the beginning of 2015; and nine consecutive years of hospital funding cuts, including four years of frozen hospital budgets. Speaker, that’s the reality.", "Let me talk a little bit about why that happened. If I had to put a title on this one, I would call it “15 Years of Liberal Waste, Mismanagement and Scandals,” because all three of those contributed to the problem that the Liberal government has created, not only for themselves, but for the people of Ontario, who bear the real burden in all of this.", "For 15 years now, the Premier and the Liberals have made life harder for Ontario families. Think about this, Speaker: When you and I were younger, Ontario was once the economic engine of Canada. We were the economic engine of Canada, but after years of what I’ll be outlining in a moment—the waste, mismanagement and scandals—we’re now a have-not province, and have been for some time. So while life is good for the insider friends of the Liberals, it’s not so good for middle class families throughout Ontario.", "I said to you earlier, Speaker, “Don’t believe a word they’re saying; we’ve seen this movie before.” Well, to keep that movie theme going, we’ll have a look at the Liberal highlight reel, because that is a true example of the breadth and depth of their waste, their mismanagement and their scandals.", "At the top of the pile is the eHealth boondoggle. Remember years ago, when it was announced at first? It was a billion-dollar boondoggle. Well, in the Auditor General’s report—not this last one, the one before—she said that eHealth has now hit $8 billion, with no end in sight and nothing to show for it.

That’s our lost decade. The report finds that Ontario suffered through a decade of poor economic performance in comparison to the rest of the country. Speaker, you have to appreciate that in the recession of 2008, everybody suffered. There’s no question about that. But the other provinces, in how they reacted, all bounced back quickly. This government doubled down on waste, mismanagement and scandal. We saw them plunge our hydro rates into amongst the highest back in 2009. When others were looking at what we could do to kick-start our economy—I recall at the pre-budget consultation two years ago, Mr. Frank Dottori told us that other provinces use energy as an economic development incentive; here in Ontario, energy is what’s killing businesses. That’s what Frank told us at the all-party pre-budget consultations. So whereas other provinces bounced back because they were attentive to the needs of families and businesses, Ontario went the other way. Ontario ended up dead last among provinces in median household income between the years 2005 and 2015. That is because we lost so many hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs. That is why our median household income tumbled. We were dead last. We were at the bottom.", "I understand that this government enjoys these record-setting numbers.

That’s why we talk about the fact that we are the most indebted subnational—as we call it; that’s a province or a state—on the planet. That is where we are. When this government took office, Ontario’s debt, which took about 137 years to get there, was $139 billion. Today, it is $312 billion and, according to both the Financial Accountability Officer and the Auditor General, on its way to around $372 billion. That’s where we are. Can you imagine, the only indicator that we’re number one in is the growth in government debt? Not only the growth in debt, but in debt—we’re number one in debt worldwide. No other state or province has the debt that we have. That’s this government’s legacy. Never mind more than doubling; it’s on its way to tripling.

Again, this is something they didn’t tell you, and what happened is that it has ended up raising our hydro rates.

It’s a built-in deficit. It’s baked in now.

We have an $8-billion deficit.” Big surprise—and they, again, are the only people who are surprised, because for 15 years they’ve put insiders and political self-interest first while making life harder for Ontario families.

We now know why life is more expensive under this Liberal government. If you’ve ever felt that you just can’t seem to get ahead, we’re now told by the Financial Accountability Officer why that happened. We now know what the deal is.", "This Liberal government has nickeled and dimed the people of Ontario every chance they get. That’s what they do, Speaker. The Financial Accountability Officer just recently highlighted a great example. The province forecasts that it will collect $2.9 billion in service fees in 2017-18. That is 45% more revenue from fees since 2011. So that’s why. When you wonder, “Why does it feel like I cannot get ahead?”—that is why.", "Fees and revenues, 45%: There’s not a fee on the books that this government won’t raise to make life more expensive. In fact, this year, the Liberals introduced five brand new fees in addition to the 90 existing fees that they raised—five new ones on top of the other ones.", "When I think about drivers and licences and vehicle registration, I remember standing in this Legislature two years ago announcing that it’s gone up—just gone up, not how much they’ve collected—the increase in four years was $503 million from drivers’ licences and vehicle registration. Everything from hunting and fishing licences to driver and registration fees has gone up in the province of Ontario, period. On the whole, the rate increases were significantly above the rate of inflation—again, 45% more revenue since 2011. That’s unbelievable. Simply put, life continues to get more expensive under this Liberal government.", "This government continues to rob Peter to pay Paul, but Paul is usually a Liberal insider. That’s what has happened in the province of Ontario. The Liberals will continue this spending addiction. They’re going to continue to feed this spending addiction on the backs of Ontario families.", "Again, they’ve already broken a key election promise and are planning to run an $8-billion deficit. That in itself is more proof that this government cannot be trusted to keep their word. Anything that’s promised in this budget will be nothing more than another expensive re-election promise that the Liberals have no intention of keeping—absolutely no intention. They will do and say anything to cling to power.", "Now, this is interesting, Speaker. While we were in question period this morning, the Premier had a release. The first line of her release said, “[T]his period of economic change and uncertainty.” Oh, well, hang on a second. I thought they told us that everything was great. But now, in her release at 11 o’clock this morning, there’s economic uncertainty. We’re scratching our heads here, going, “Uh-oh.” They’re obviously trying now to change the narrative to match their $8-billion deficit. In one breath, they tell these tales about leading in the G7, which is not accurate either, and today it’s economic change and uncertainty. That’s one of the few things that we’ve heard that’s accurate from this Premier.", "I’d certainly like to know, which one are we getting tomorrow? Is it going to be that things are great or that there’s economic uncertainty? You can’t have it both ways. Only one of those is accurate. You cannot have it both ways. So you have to wonder, are they now fearmongering because the facts, the $8-billion deficit, doesn’t fit in with their election narrative or re-election narrative or their pre-election narrative, for that matter? Something went off the rails here for the Premier to completely do a 180 and now talk about economic change and uncertainty. Something doesn’t add up here, Speaker. So if they’re not using taxpayer money for votes, then they are now trying to scare everyone into voting for them somehow. Either way, Speaker, either of those are both appalling and pathetic.", "We talk about the fact that we lost 51,000 jobs in January, we talk about the fact that there are 300,000 fewer manufacturing jobs, and this government continues to say, “Well, we’ve created so many jobs since the recession.” But in their own words—I’m reading from one of their own reports—they say here that “there are fewer jobs today relative to the population than before the recession.” In other words, employment growth has not kept up with the growth of the working-age population. That, Speaker, explains everything. Yes, jobs are created. That happens. Businesses create jobs. But the economic climate that this government has created means that it didn’t keep up with the growth in the population, never mind the 51,000 people that lost their jobs in January alone.", "Think of Sergio Marchionne from Fiat Chrysler sitting down with the Premier—I think it’s two years ago now—and saying to her, “You’ve created one of the most expensive jurisdictions in North America in which to do business.” And what was their answer to that? Well, hike fees, make Ontario even more expensive for families, put in a cap-and-trade tax so everything—it’s a tax on everything—is now more expensive in the province of Ontario. Have hydro rates that continue to skyrocket. All of these issues are deterrents to business. They have chased businesses away from the province of Ontario.", "Speaker, I’ve used this example as well. Not only have they chased businesses away; it’s businesses that aren’t coming to Ontario. Google and Amazon both opened their first-ever Canadian data centres: heavy, heavy users of energy, electricity. They opened their first-ever data centres, both of these world-leading companies. Where did they go? The province of Quebec. Read why, and they both state it: because of the high cost of energy in the province of Ontario. That’s why they did not come here. We’re chasing companies away. Other companies are not coming. It’s no surprise, Speaker.", "In closing, I would conclude by saying, it used to be that if you worked hard, played by the rules, spent wisely and saved diligently, you could get ahead. But that is no longer the truth in Ontario. It’s no longer true under this government. The Premier has betrayed the trust of Ontario families. After 15 years, life is now harder under the Liberals.", "A PC government will lower hydro rates, end hallway health care, ensure students are ready for the current workforce, bring back good-paying jobs to Ontario and bring back accountability to Queen’s Park.", "Speaker, it’s time for change that works for the people, not the Liberal insiders, and only the Ontario PC Party and our leader, Doug Ford, will represent the change for the better.", "Interjections." ],

  "text" : [ "I’m very pleased to have the opportunity today to be able to comment on the throne speech that was delivered yesterday.", "I have to say that I was quite shocked by what I heard in yesterday’s throne speech. We heard this government admit that, “For many of our friends and neighbours, life is getting harder.” The Lieutenant Governor said to us, “The cost of living is rising, and at the same time, stable long-term jobs—jobs that pay a decent wage—are proving harder to find ... People are struggling to take care of themselves, and their loved ones.”", "Now, my NDP caucus colleagues and I were shocked to hear the government actually admit to this. We all know the Liberal government has been in power in this province for 15 years. At the end of these 15 years, what is the legacy that this Liberal government has left? In their own words, “life is getting harder,” good jobs are “harder to find,” and “people are struggling.”", "It is absolutely shocking to me that this Liberal government, after 15 years, has the gall to stand up and pretend as though all of this is not their doing. And now, they’re asking Ontarians to put their trust in them again: to clean up the mess that they have created. That is absolutely absurd, and Ontarians see right through it.", "They know that the reason they can’t afford their medication is because of this Liberal government. They know that they can’t find a stable job because of this Liberal government. They know that their hydro bills are sky-high because of this Liberal government. They know that their family members and loved ones had to wait for health care and mental health supports because of this Liberal government. They know their parents and grandparents have suffered in long-term-care homes because of this Liberal government. It’s shameful that this Liberal government thinks that Ontarians will forgive them for that.", "I think the clearest example of this can be found in the examples that we heard in the throne speech of Ontarians who are struggling. We heard about a man in Peterborough, a minimum wage earner who spoke about the shame of using a food bank just to get by. No matter how much this government pats themselves on the back for raising the minimum wage in Ontario—which, really, they should be thanking the labour movement for, not themselves—the reality is that after 15 years in power, they are fully responsible for allowing wages to stagnate for so long, not to mention that under their watch, food bank use has gone up exponentially.", "In Windsor, our downtown mission reported last year that it now serves 700 people per day, every day. Just a few years ago, they were averaging 100 people per day. In Toronto, the Daily Bread Food Bank has reported their highest annual client visit numbers since 2010, when the effects of the 2008 recession hit Torontonians with full force. The reality is that the reason that our brother in Peterborough is barely getting by is because of this Liberal government. When your hydro bill rises 300%, when your housing and food costs more and more each year, but your wages don’t rise, when you can’t afford to take your medications as prescribed or get a checkup and restorative treatment like fillings at the dentist, your quality of life suffers, and we have this Liberal government to thank for that.", "As much as the Liberals have continued to make life harder for everyday Ontarians, I think it’s very important to consider how a Conservative government might tackle this situation. I think, by all accounts, it simply wouldn’t. The Conservatives have boasted about their promise to cut $6.1 billion in social spending. They will lose this province billions more when they cancel cap-and-trade, another approximately $2 billion a year. Their new leader has promised to “leave no stone unturned” when it comes to privatizing the public services that we depend on. The Conservatives haven’t told us whether it is our overcrowded hospitals, our crumbling schools or our backlogged transit that’s getting cut back even further. It was the Conservatives who said, “Let the auto industry die.” They were happy to sit idly by and see over 100,000 people on the unemployment line. Auto workers contributed $6.1 billion to the Ontario economy in 2014. It’s ironic that it’s $6.1 billion, the same number that auto workers put into our economy, that the Conservatives now want to take out of it—they’ve promised to cut.", "If you think it’s too early to predict the future, then let’s look to the past. Conservative Premier Mike Harris closed 28 hospitals. He fired 6,000 nurses. He slashed social assistance rates by 21%. The last Conservative government told low-income families they could just buy dented cans of tuna and eat baloney sandwiches to save money. In eight years, they not once raised the minimum wage from $6.85 an hour. The Conservatives, under Harris, set us back decades and did long-lasting damage to this province that is still felt to this day. The last thing our brother from Peterborough needs is a Conservative government.", "Next, we heard about a mother who lives in Thunder Bay, a teacher whose daughter lives with a developmental disability. Speaker, this is one of my favourite topics to discuss. Since taking over as the Ontario NDP’s critic for community and social services, I have developed strong relationships with parents and families in the developmental services community, and many of these parents and caregivers have similar stories to the mother in Thunder Bay. Many of them are caring for adult children, who lost the vast majority of their government support when their children aged out at 18. For those who are not aware, there is a huge gap in supports between when a child with a developmental disability is 17 and when they turn 18.", "Right now, we have 11,000 people on the wait-list for Passport funding, which is supposed to be available as soon as an individual turns 18. This is such an enormous source of stress and anxiety for my friends in the developmental services community, who are increasingly worried about how their children will be cared for as they age.", "Again, we have 15 years of Liberal government to thank for this situation. Under this government, the wait-list for those with developmental disabilities to get supportive housing has risen to 15,000 people. Again, for those in the House who may not be aware, this is not a stagnant list. Individuals on the list can be bumped up and down depending on need or whether an individual is deemed to be in crisis. In practice, this means many people with developmental disabilities are waiting upwards of 20 years for supportive housing.", "I want to take a moment to thank my friend Mary Beth and the parents and caregivers who make up Parents of Adult Children with Disabilities Windsor/Essex Group for their incredible advocacy and their Nowhere to Turn campaign.", "As a result of the unacceptable wait-list for funding and housing, those with developmental difficulties in their families are sometimes forced to turn to other means. Last parliamentary session, I asked the Liberal government why it has failed to address the influx in illegal group homes. We have heard story after story about unregulated and unlicensed group homes with inhumane and unsafe conditions, where landlords exploit seniors, low-income earners and those with developmental disabilities. Individuals are forced to live in these homes because of sky-high housing costs, a lack of affordable, safe housing, and a years-long wait-list for supportive housing. People have died in these homes, Speaker—either died in the home or trying to escape them because of the horrendous conditions. When I asked this Liberal government who was responsible, they kept passing the buck from ministry to ministry. It turns out that no one in this Liberal government actually has a handle on this problem.", "My colleague from Welland had a private member’s bill that would tackle this very issue, but it died on the order paper after this government’s campaign stunt to prorogue the Legislature.", "For almost a decade, this Liberal government has also refused to increase the base funding for agencies that work with those with developmental disabilities, like Community Living and OASIS. Without fulsome funding, these organizations are struggling to provide complete care, pay their skyrocketing hydro bills, as well as meet their pay equity obligations.", "Since I know Ontarians are completely fed up with this Liberal government and are looking for an alternative, I think we should talk about how the Conservatives might respond to this pressing issue. I think it’s safe to say that I speak on behalf of thousands of families and individuals in the developmental disabilities community when I say that the new Conservative leader, Doug Ford, has made some absolutely despicable and heartless comments about individuals with disabilities. How could we possibly entrust the Conservative Party to tackle supportive housing wait-lists when their leader claimed a group home for teenage boys with autism was ruining the community and suggested that they were criminals? After the father of one of the boys issued a formal complaint, Doug Ford, the new Conservative leader, told the man to go to hell.", "New Democrats, parents and caregivers find this attitude disgusting. In fact, I think the vast majority of Ontarians would find it disgusting, and it’s not the kind of leadership that we need to solve these problems once and for all.", "We need a government that is compassionate, supportive and willing to make the investments needed to ensure good quality of life for all Ontarians; not a Liberal government that has left families with nowhere to turn, or a Conservative government that sees people with developmental disabilities as a blight on their communities.", "The third individual who was mentioned in the throne speech was a man in Toronto whose family is relying on a sole income while he cares for his mother, who has late-stage Alzheimer’s. The Liberal government’s neglect of our long-term-care system is contemptible, which is why I find it highly ironic that this was such a large part of yesterday’s throne speech, made extremely evident by the fact that the speech was titled “A Time for Care”—clearly, a play on words relating to my colleague the member from Nickel Belt’s bill, the Time to Care Act. I think the Liberals wanted to take this name and try to make it their own because the Time to Care Act had such incredible widespread support from Ontarians—families and workers alike.", "Tens of thousands of people have experienced first-hand the crisis in our long-term-care facilities. Under this Liberal government, the quality of hands-on care has diminished, thanks to a lack of funding and support. There have been increasing instances of violence towards long-term-care residents and workers. Support workers are run off their feet, only able to provide a mere six minutes of care to help residents get ready in the morning, a problem that was brought to light thanks to incredible advocacy from CUPE Ontario and Unifor.", "The entire system is in crisis, and now the Liberals want to make it seem as though they are part of the solution, and that now is the time for care.", "Mr. Speaker, I want to know why the Liberals did not think that the time for care was last year, or the year before that, or the year before that, because the reality is that the Liberals have had 15 years to make life better for people in Ontario, and that’s a long time for them to prove that they actually care.", "Ontario used to have a legislated standard guaranteeing a minimum level of hands-on care per day for every resident in long-term care. The Wynne Liberals abolished it and haven’t replaced it. There is no law at all right now that guarantees that our parents and grandparents in long-term care get the care that they need.", "With the recent prorogation stunt, the Liberals killed the Time to Care Act, which was a great opportunity for positive change. The Time to Care Act mandated that each resident in long-term care would be guaranteed a minimum of four hours of care every day, a much-needed change that residents and support workers alike would benefit from.", "We in the NDP will not give up on that vision. We will continue to fight for drastic improvements to the long-term-care system. We will fight for a proper, system-wide, find-and-fix public inquiry into long-term care. We will continue to fight for mandated minimum hours of care. I sincerely doubt that the Conservatives can promise the same.", "Conservatives know how to do two things: They cut, and they privatize. Ontarians saw what happened to our health care system when the Conservative Harris government closed 28 hospitals and fired 6,000 nurses. They know that when Harris privatized the 407 and started the privatization of Hydro One—and Kathleen Wynne continued it—it has been disastrous for our hydro bills.", "Speaker, I’m going to also draw attention to the fact that in Walkerton—many people will be familiar with Walkerton. Walkerton happened under the last Conservative government. Two individuals who were involved in the inquiry have stated that it was because of the Conservative government privatizing the system that half of that community fell ill because of E. coli contamination in their water, and seven people died.", "The Conservatives’ platform promised $6.1 billion in cuts, and their new leader sees no limit to what can be privatized and cut. This means long-term care will suffer, without a doubt, as will our hospital wait times and the disrepair in our schools. Speaker, I could go on and on.", "Saying that Conservatives will fix long-term care is a pipe dream, or, in Liberal words, a “stretch goal.”", "I want to spend some time talking about the implications of this government’s prorogation stunt last week. It was an incredibly selfish and politically motivated decision, a way for the government to gain some airtime and talk about all of their shiny new promises, things they could have actually done during a campaign. But they also killed a lot of important opposition legislation with that prorogation. I’ve already talked about the Time to Care Act, Bill 33, and my colleague from Welland’s bill on illegal group homes.", "They also killed Dan’s Law. This was my private member’s bill that I introduced back in 2016. It had all-party support. With the invaluable support and hard work of Dr. Darren Cargill from Windsor, I put forward this bill in an effort to remove the three-month wait-list for access to OHIP-funded palliative care and home care for Canadian residents who move to or return to Ontario.", "The bill was named after Dan Duma, a Windsor resident who, when the GM plant in Windsor closed, moved to Alberta for work, where he was diagnosed with cancer. When Dan moved back to Ontario to be with his family during the end of his life, he was not able to access home care, which was vital to his final wish to die at home, surrounded by family.", "Since Dan’s Law was introduced in 2016, there have been countless other Dans who have suffered because the government refused to make the simple fix. The Liberals had 16 months to call that bill to committee and then move it back into this House for final debate to become law. Instead of doing that, they prorogued to start their re-election bid.", "I’m not giving up on Dan’s Law, and neither is Dr. Cargill or many other partners that have long supported this legislation.", "New Democrats are not giving up or giving in on establishing better labour laws for workers. We are committed to guaranteeing fair and equitable sick days and emergency leave time, even for the autoworkers, who the Liberals don’t think should have it. We are the only party standing up for our brothers and sisters in the auto sector, whose leave days are getting cut back because this Liberal government puts profit over people.", "We’re not giving up on our plan for universal pharmacare and universal dental care. We’re committed to ending the decades of cuts and privatization in health care and ending hallway medicine—all started under the Conservatives and continued under the Liberals.", "We’re not giving up on our plan to put Hydro One back into public hands, where it rightfully belongs.", "We’re not giving up on improving conditions in First Nations communities, on establishing a dedicated ministry of mental health and addictions, and on making child care more affordable.", "We’re not giving up on making housing more affordable and protecting our climate and green space.", "We are not giving up on improving access to healthy and affordable food and actually fixing social assistance, rather than cutting it and making it worse.", "We’re not giving up on repairing our classrooms and turning all post-secondary loans into non-repayable grants.", "We’re not giving up on supporting children and adults with developmental disabilities, and we’re committed to ending all forms of violence and discrimination based on gender, ethnicity, age, ability or sexuality.", "You see, seniors, low-income people, health care and education workers, businesses, families and caregivers of those with developmental disabilities, first responders and correction workers, community service agencies and workers in all areas and industries, including autoworkers, have been surviving and growing in Ontario in spite of this Liberal government, not because of this Liberal government.", "We can do so much better than these past 15 years. We don’t have to settle between bad and worse. We can get good things done, and we can have real change for the better." ],

He believes in free market forces—let them go—which is why the PC Party, even way before Doug Ford was elected leader, didn’t want to intervene when the auto sector was very close to shutting down.", "This new, invigorated free market force that the Leader of the Opposition is talking about includes things like selling cannabis in the corner store. That’s an idea that we think is a very bad one. It’s not safe for our kids. The other thing he’s already pontificated about is eliminating rent controls, sending rents skyrocketing across this province.

What I’m going to say to the Liberals is this: You’ve had 15 years to show your care, and your opportunity is over. It isn’t just time for change, Speaker, because if you just vote for change, you’re going to get the slash, cut and privatize Conservatives. It is actually time for change for the better." ],

  "text" : [ "I will be sharing my time this afternoon with the member from Guelph and the Minister of Energy.", "Speaker, I have, I think, about 10 minutes this afternoon. I thought one of the first things I would chat a little bit about is this continued effort on the part of the Progressive Conservatives to create a narrative in the public perception that, when it comes to fiscal responsibility and fiscal prudence, they are the party that is best able to achieve that on behalf of the people of the province of Ontario. I guess, given the recent goings-on with the leadership, that we can remove, perhaps, the “progressive” from the name and just simply refer to them as the Conservatives.", "There is a little bit of information that I think bears repeating when it comes to their record. In their most recent time in government, from 1995 to 2003—people will remember, and I’ve said this before in this Legislature, that from 1995 to 2003, an eight- or nine-year period of power for the PCs, on the North American continent, economic times were very, very good, unlike the times that we found ourselves in between 2005 and 2008, when the greatest recession since the Great Depression hit and we lost 30 million to 40 million jobs worldwide—they had a lovely time to be in government. You would think and expect that during that period of time, they would be able to show and leave the books in good order for the next government that succeeded them in the election in 2003. Unfortunately, Speaker, nothing like that occurred. Remember: very strong economic times in the entire North American continent—very strong times.", "When we came to government in 2003, we were told that there was a balanced budget. We were absolutely told; it was committed to, a number of times, by their party. When we got to government, Speaker, we found very clearly—a headline in the Toronto Star said they lied—a $5.5-billion deficit left by a party 15 years ago, when there were very strong economic times. I don’t know how you explain that away when the economy of the province was very robust.", "But Speaker, that’s not the whole story. It’s $5.5 billion, but it’s not the whole story. There were two other significant pieces that, in my mind, would say that the deficit that was left to us, as an incoming government, structurally was much more significant than $5.5 billion. In fact, I would put it at the order of magnitude of $10 billion to $12 billion, because two other significant things occurred in the years before we formed government.", "Number one was selling and privatizing Highway 407, something valued at $11 billion or $12 billion, to a Spanish consortium, privatized through a lease for 100 years at a value of $3 billion. Without the $3 billion, the $5.5 billion is now $8.5 billion. Remember, the $5.5 billion was confirmed by the auditor and the Toronto Star—$3 billion in one-time money, and now we have an $8.5-billion number.", "The other significant thing that occurred, which affected every single residential, property and business taxpayer in the province of Ontario, was, as we like to refer to it on this side of the House, the “who got done in” committee. They called it the Who Does What committee. That was the exercise that led to a very significant downloading of provincial services into and onto the backs of residential and business taxpayers in every municipality across the province of Ontario.", "Now, I’m not sure what the total number or the quantum of that downloading exercise was. Some put it at around $3 billion a year. I’m not sure. Let’s call it $2 billion. Without a doubt, they left us a structural deficit of over $10 billion a year. It took us two or three years to balance that. As the member from Mississauga–Streetsville just said, then we ran three consecutive balanced budgets, until we found ourselves in the midst of the greatest recession since the Great Depression, as I mentioned just a moment ago.", "Speaker, the narrative that is attempted to be carved out by the Progressive Conservative Party—that they can manage dollars well for you—is just simply not the case. The experience, I would say, both provincially and under the last federal Conservative government—the information, the history, the narrative just does not bear out the story and the narrative that they try to create.", "One of our members spoke a little bit earlier about the idea—as they move forward with the idea that the free market can do everything better.", "I remember very well that during the 2008 recession I was here, and I remember the remarks that came from the federal Conservative Prime Minister, and I remember very well the position that was taken by the PC Party here in Ontario: “Leave it alone; it will take care of itself.” When people’s pension plans were nosediving and disappearing in the market, the Prime Minister said, “Don’t worry; it’s a good buying opportunity,” or the Minister of Finance said, “It’s a good buying opportunity.” They were going to abandon the auto sector.", "Speaker, I can tell you that during that time we brought to a northern Ontario industry, the forestry industry, over $1 billion, or in the neighbourhood of $1 billion, in supports for that industry. Given the position that seems to be resurfacing within that party about the approach they will take should they have the honour of forming government, I would suggest to you that should we find ourselves in that situation again, industries like forestry, auto and others would be abandoned, because it was their position that should the government bring some sort of support to those industries and others, we would be picking winners and losers. That was the language verbatim. They didn’t think we should be picking winners and losers, when we saw it as supporting tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of workers across the province of Ontario.", "When we go back to the narrative of debt and deficit, of course, the federal Conservative government, maybe as right-wing a Conservative government as we’ve ever had in the history of Canada at the federal level, found themselves with significant deficit and debt as well. Finally they came along, kicking and screaming, after their first attempt at trying to manage this recession: “Don’t worry about it. The market will take care of it. Don’t worry about it. Your pension plan is disappearing. Don’t worry about it. It’s good buying opportunities.” They finally came around, albeit kicking and screaming, and found it necessary for them to invest as well. That’s what they did, and that’s why they ended up with significant debt on their books as well, as we did.", "Speaker, governing is not easy. You make choices, and when you make choices, there will always be somebody who’s angry and upset about it. On balance, when they speak about the fiscal position of the province, I would point people back to their record of not that long ago and remind people of the positions that they took from 1995 to 2003. How it was possible to leave with us a $10-billion deficit, I have no idea, when you had strong economic times. That’s point one.", "My time is running out quickly. The member for the PCs who spoke earlier also talked and filtered in and sprinkled in through his speech a narrative on energy prices. Of course, through all the time he’s talked about it, not just today but ever, he forgot to mention the significant relief that we have brought to the sector. What they never talk about is what they would have done to suppress the increase that has come in energy prices. What would they have done?", "I remind people that in 2003, all three political parties and all three political leaders committed to closing coal in the province of Ontario. Everybody said they were going to do it. We won government. We fulfilled our promise. We met it. Coal represented about 6,000 megawatts of energy in the province of Ontario. Some 20% or 25% of the generated capacity in the province of Ontario came from coal. We promised to close it. We kept that promise. But keeping that promise cost money. We kept our promise but it cost money.", "I ask my friends on the other side, when you complain about energy prices, tell me how you would have met your promise on closing coal. If, in fact, you would have kept your promise, how would you have avoided the cost that was associated with replacing 20% of the province’s generated capacity? What would you have done? And by the way, would you have kept the false cap on energy prices that you had in place when we came to government. when the price per kilowatt hour on a bill showed about four and a half cents a click but it was really five and a half cents, about 20% higher? They didn’t want to deal with it. They knew that energy pricing was radioactive. They didn’t want to do it.", "Speaker, there are other significant pieces about why energy prices rose, but the folks on the other side never talk about it because they know, to a large degree, much of what has affected the price of energy could not have been avoided no matter who in fact had the reins and the honour of being government in the province of Ontario. It could not have been avoided.", "Speaker, my time is almost up. I had lots to say on health care. The member tried to filter and sprinkle some of that—I was going to say—well, I won’t use the word I was going to use. But I can tell you only this, Speaker: In my riding of Thunder Bay–Atikokan, I can point to example after example of significant improvements in health care in my riding, and I would expect that every member on our side of the House can do exactly the same thing.", "There are still challenges in my riding when it comes to health care, especially when it comes to long-term care. But anybody who tries the position that we have not done enough and moves the yardsticks forward—I would argue vehemently with them, Speaker. I would remind people, and the numbers are never challenged: 28,000 nurses hired, 7,000 more doctors working in the province of Ontario, nurse practitioner clinics for the first time, and the list goes on and on, in my riding as well as in the ridings across the province.", "Speaker, my time is up.

I am quite suspicious that the reason he never mentioned anything about policy from the speech from the throne is because the party opposite, at the moment, doesn’t really seem to have any policy going forward into the next election, other than that they’ve cancelled their previous platform.", "Depending on who you listen to, they have to cut $6 billion, they have to cut $10 billion, they have to cut $25 billion over the next three years—but they are going to have to make huge cuts to the programs and services that Ontarians expect. I think what we should be talking about is, what are the programs and services that Ontarians expect?", "One of the things that I know my constituents in Guelph particularly appreciate is the OHIP+ program that we introduced in January. As I think most people know now, that is extending pharmacare—free prescription drugs—to every child, youth and young adult under the age of 25. In fact, in less than three months, the Ontario government has paid for free prescriptions for over one million people. What that means is that there are a million families or parents or young adults out there who needed a prescription drug and who were able to get it filled.", "What we heard before was that if you were a parent and you didn’t have a job that paid you benefits—that parents were often having to choose between getting drugs for their children when they were ill and paying the rent. We said, “That’s not right.” We think that any child—it doesn’t matter whether you’re from a poor family, a middle-class family or a wealthy family. If that child is ill and they need drugs, the government should pay for the drugs, and that’s what we’ve done.", "And it’s not just a few select drugs; it’s all 4,400 drugs that are on the provincial formulary for drugs that are available in Ontario. If your doctor writes a prescription and says your child needs it, you can walk into any pharmacy in Ontario, and you can get that drug for free.", "The other thing that we discovered is that a lot of young adults these days, when they get their first job, don’t get their first job with benefits. So we included the under-25s in that, the kids who are in post-secondary, the young people who have gone on to their first job, because they rarely include benefits. That means that if you’re a young person in post-secondary, or if you’re getting your first job, again, if you need a prescription, you can walk into the pharmacy, and you can get all 4,400 drugs on the provincial formulary for free.", "What I did hear in my constituency office was from a lot of seniors, and the seniors said, “You know, we actually do get access to the same 4,400 drugs, but we have to pay a copay and we have to pay a deductible.” That can be a real struggle for a senior who is on a fixed income.", "What we have done with the speech from the throne and what we will provide funding for when we table the budget next week is, we’ve said we are going to have the same deal for seniors. Remember, seniors are our biggest-growing group of citizens in Ontario. We are going to extend that program and we are going to make sure that seniors can get drugs with no copay, with no deductible, absolutely free.", "I think those are the issues that we should be talking about, Speaker—and not talking about how you’re going to cut, cut, cut, cut, cut.", "I am now going to turn it over to my colleague the Minister of Energy." ],

I want to thank my colleagues the MPP from Guelph and the Minister of Municipal Affairs for sharing their time with me, because there are many, many important points that I would like to be able to put on the record as part of this debate.", "One of them that I think is key: If we’re looking at the title of the speech from the throne, it talks about care and opportunity. We, as MPPs, have the important role of being stewards to look after our citizens, to be part of that common good, to make sure that we can all work together to find ways to make a difference in the lives of individuals. I know that sometimes we will have banter back and forth on what we think is a better policy idea, or even policy in general.", "But the one thing that I would like to start off with, which will lead into some others in my small amount of time, Mr. Speaker, is climate change. I think we all can agree that climate change exists. I think we can all agree on that.", "For those who don’t, I say, “Just look at the weather.” You can even come up to northern Ontario, go past Sudbury and look at some of our First Nation communities that are up there. They used to have ice roads, where they could get their goods brought up to their communities—many of them are fly-in in the summer and spring. They used to have 77 days of ice roads. We’re now seeing, in most instances, that every year they’re getting less and less, and they’re down to about 23. That is serious for many of our First Nation communities in the north, because the cost of having to fly in many of their supplies is actually detrimental to these communities.", "Of course, Mr. Speaker, if you think about having to fly that in, bringing in diesel fuel, all of those types of other fuels that we want to get off of to actually help us address climate change—again, it is an important issue that we need to be able to discuss and talk about, and put a price on carbon.", "What’s concerning for me is—now that there is no more People’s Guarantee or a platform coming from our friends in the opposition—that they are no longer talking about climate change. They are no longer talking about putting a price on carbon, which is concerning, Mr. Speaker, because we need to ensure that we continue to find ways to address climate change. We need to continue to find ways to reduce our GHGs.", "I know that my colleague the Minister of Municipal Affairs talked about shutting down coal and that, in 2003, all parties agreed that we need to eliminate coal from our electricity supply, and we did that. This government did this. We now have an electricity grid that is 96% GHG-free. That’s 96%. We no longer have—for example, Matthew, a 10-year-old boy who has asthma, would not be able to go to school and was in the hospital weekly because of his asthma, because of the smog that we had in the air. He no longer has to do that because we’ve shut down coal and we haven’t had a smog day advisory in this province since 2014. That’s something we should all be proud of.", "But you know what, Mr. Speaker? Now, if he still has to go get that puffer, he can actually go to the pharmacy and get that puffer for free because of OHIP+. It’s because of our government’s care in recognizing the opportunities that we have had and that we’re making for the people of Ontario.", "Now, when we’ve all been going door to door over the last little bit, I know we’ve been hearing some concerns from seniors as well, and we’ve addressed that. That’s why I’m so proud to be able to say, as I conclude, that we’re going to be bringing forward OHIP+ for individuals over the age of 65, and I look forward to having that further discussion in the future." ],

Well, obviously, putting them in the same building, rather than trying to stretch resources and have duplication through the three of them. Once they were up, everybody thought, “Well, that was a good idea.” It’s only politicians who still talk about closing hospitals, because everybody else has gotten used to the kind of transformation that many of them had.", "The other problem that people seem to have is understanding the Ontario Works program and other programs that were put forward at the time.

They’re putting in more automated equipment so that we can do processing right in Guelph instead of in the US.", "I think when the opposition talks about doom and gloom—the member kept talking about how we’re losing jobs—that is not what I see in my community. What I see in my community is a thriving community.", "Do you know what? We need to make sure everybody moves forward together. That’s what we’re doing with this throne speech: making sure every citizen of Ontario can participate in that." ],

I’m pleased to be able to provide a few comments regarding the speech from the throne.", "Kathleen Wynne and the Liberals—here’s what they want you to think: Their talking points are that this throne speech was a reset. You can’t reset 15 years of scandal, waste and mismanagement. You can’t do that.", "Yesterday, we were here, and the entire order paper was cleared off. When you look at the votes and proceedings, we started yesterday at 12 noon, and right here, in black and white, in the votes and proceedings: The House adjourned at 12:30—half an hour. For half an hour we sat yesterday to have the speech from the throne and one bill introduced. That’s it; that’s all. All they wanted was this opportunity to set the reset button.", "Do you know what we did last night, Speaker? It was a tremendous night. Ontario Progressive Conservatives and our new leader, Doug Ford—we had a rally. We had a rally in Etobicoke like no other rally I’ve ever been to. It was unbelievable. It was amazing.", "I know the Liberals don’t like it, but Doug Ford is right: They’re scared. They’re scared of what the people of Ontario are going to do on June 7, when they get to hit the reset button. I’ll tell you, in the next 79 days, you’re going to see a lot of things talked about.", "We had so much enthusiasm in the room last night, Speaker. It was amazing. The energy was great. From a caucus and a candidate perspective, change is in the air. Speaker, I’m telling you, change is in the air.", "If you look at what I had to do yesterday, Speaker—I wasn’t going to let this government’s throne speech stop the work that I do in Leeds–Grenville. Even though my private member’s bill was taken off the order paper, my private member’s motions were taken off the order paper, and my order paper questions were taken off the order paper, I made sure, on behalf of the people of the people of Leeds–Grenville, that they’re all back on. I made sure that the second we walked in here for the throne speech, I went to the table to see the Clerks and handed them all of those back, because the people of my riding and the people of Ontario deserve an answer.", "I’m just going to run through some of the things I put back on the order paper. This afternoon, as you know, Speaker, I got to re-table my bill, Bill 3. I think it’s probably going to be Bill 2 now on the order paper. It allows the government the opportunity to have a designated number of automotive dealers be able to provide licensing services, so if I want to go in and buy a new car in a dealership, I don’t have to wait another day or couple of days to get it plated and get the registration changed over, or have somebody stand in line at a ServiceOntario. It would allow the government to make that happen, and allow something in terms of customer service. People expect that when they’re going to make this major purchase of a new vehicle, they’re going to be able to get it when they need it, so I’ve re-tabled that bill today, Speaker. It’ll appear on the order paper tomorrow.", "My order paper motion would recognize the sacrifice made by Ontario veterans and have the Lieutenant Governor consider establishing a military service pin. Members of Canada’s Armed Forces could wear the pin on their civilian clothes and designate them as a veteran. It’s done in other provinces, and I think it’s high time that our province consider the same.", "The other issue that has been discussed on a couple of occasions—I see the member for Glengarry–Prescott–Russell here, and I know that he supports the initiative—would call on the government to remove the cost of mandatory water testing from non-profit organizations like Legions, local churches and local community halls. It would remove that cost of mandatory water testing for organizations operating under the small drinking water system. It’s something that churches, Legions, municipal community halls and not-for-profits are very happy with. It has been on the order paper several times.", "I have called on the government, through some of my order paper questions, to support my county; for example, the united counties of Leeds and Grenville and their request for 132 new beds for Maple View Lodge, and capital funding for another 192 class-A beds under Aging with Confidence: Ontario’s Action Plan for Seniors. I had to re-table that motion and again call on the government to support my county.", "I’m asking if the Attorney General will explain why the Brockville Courthouse remains one of just two courthouses in eastern Ontario that aren’t equipped for witnesses and accused persons to appear by video. I want him to provide the technology. I’ve mentioned this, Speaker. The reason I’m going to bring this up again—I’ve mentioned this twice: once last October and once a few weeks ago. I want the Attorney General to right this wrong. I’ve called on him to ensure the safety of those police officers from the Brockville city police service.", "My worst fears were realized last week, when one of those officers, while they were transporting a prisoner to court, was injured in that transfer for a remand. That injury of that police officer would not have happened had this government not played postal code politics and put that video remand system in Brockville. As my order paper question and my questions to the Attorney General have said time and time again, this is an issue of public safety. It’s an issue of public safety for those front-line men and women who are members of the Brockville Police Service.", "There’s no reason that we should upgrade one jail near the minister’s riding—upgrade a courthouse, sorry, for $7 million—when a courthouse like Brockville is one of only two that don’t have this service. It’s terrible, and it should never happen that an officer be put in harm’s way because of this government’s neglect of our courthouses, so again, I’m going to call on them.", "The other questions are just planning. For example, we had an accident a year ago on the 401, a chemical spill. It was a major accident on the 401. A number of first responders were injured, because there was an acid spill. We’ve had a number of meetings with my local mayors; I think one is going on right now up near the airport. What we were shocked to find, Speaker, is that the planning for Highway 401 in eastern Ontario has not been done, and the government has not prioritized it. I don’t even believe they’ve done a study to look at the costing of having the 401 be six lanes in eastern Ontario. It’s ridiculous that the government has not done their due diligence to at least do a study to plan for six-laning the 401 in eastern Ontario. I’ve asked that it be included in their ministry’s southern highways program.", "People on this side of the House have stood up for families with children with autism, and we’re going to continue to do that. I’ve asked the government about the wait-list and wait times for families in Leeds–Grenville to access services under the Ontario Autism Program. I want the ministry to provide the number of children who are on that wait-list. I think it’s important for openness, honesty and transparency that the government provide that information.", "As well, I’m going to talk about the Brockville General Hospital in some of the time I have left. I’m asking about the current wait times of 263 days for cataract surgery at the BGH, the Brockville General. I’d like to know what the government is doing to reduce those.", "I’d like to know why Highway 15, which, by the way, was identified in 1999 as needing upgrades, has now been placed on an upgrade list for 2045. Here’s a highway, Highway 15, that was identified in 1999, yet this government has now changed that priority to be 2045. Speaker, I’m going to be 85 years old in 2045, and I just think it is absolutely ridiculous that this government has changed that priority where there’s been a significant amount of concern for public safety.", "I’ve stood up in this house for Victim Services Leeds and Grenville, which now has a base caseload of 849 new victims and they are on pace for 2,000, yet their funding formula for victim services in Leeds–Grenville hasn’t been increased. It’s terrible that those front-line workers have to go through that stress when the government knows full well that they’re serving over double than they are being given dollars for.", "As well, I’ve put a new order paper question on regarding a meeting I had in my riding on break week. Habitat for Humanity and its affiliates are asking the government to consider $25 million in funding over four years so that they can build up to 500 homes and help more families realize their dream of home ownership. My hope is that the government will support it.", "Speaker, in the couple of minutes left, I’d like to ask for unanimous consent to use a couple of props to identify government waste. I tried to use some pictures this morning and the Speaker shot me down, so I’d like approval to do it today." ],

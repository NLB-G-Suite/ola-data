I also want to acknowledge my colleague the member for Kingston and the Islands, with whom I will be splitting my time this morning and whom I would like to thank for diligently shepherding this bill through the committee process. Thank you so much. I would also like to warmly thank all the members of the committee who worked so very hard in closely considering Bill 45.", "It would be remiss of me, Mr. Speaker, not to, at this point, acknowledge the leadership shown by the former Minister of Health, Minister Deb Matthews, as well as the leadership shown by yourself, the Speaker, and the MPP France Gélinas, for their work on laying the groundwork for many parts and many elements of this bill.", "This comprehensive legislative package, if passed, would protect youth from the dangers of tobacco and the potential harms of electronic cigarettes, also known as e-cigarettes. Also included in the proposed legislation are measures to help families make healthier choices by giving them caloric information when eating out or purchasing take-away meals. The Making Healthier Choices Act, if passed, will play an important role in empowering Ontarians to make the decisions that help them lead healthier lives and move us even closer to a truly smoke-free Ontario.", "The fact is that we’ve done very well here in Ontario. Between 2000 and 2013, Ontario’s smoking rate dropped from 24.5% to 18.1%, which equals approximately 332,000 fewer smokers in Ontario. Since 2005, Ontario has become an international leader in tobacco control because of our Smoke-Free Ontario Act. Our government has taken a strong stand in protecting people from second-hand smoke in enclosed public places and enclosed workplaces.", "But the fact is that there is more to do; the fact is that even today too many people die tobacco-related deaths.", "Since 2005, Ontario has become an international leader in tobacco control because of our Smoke-Free Ontario Act. Further amendments to the act included protecting children from exposure to second-hand smoke in motor vehicles, as of 2009, and prohibiting the sale of flavoured cigarillos, as of 2010.", "On January 1 of this year, new regulations came into effect that:", "—make it more difficult for young people to purchase tobacco by prohibiting tobacco sales on post-secondary education campuses;", "—prohibit smoking on all bar and restaurant outdoor patios, with an exemption for uncovered patios that were established by a branch of the Royal Canadian Legion prior to November 18, 2013; and", "—prohibit smoking on playgrounds, publicly owned sporting areas, spectator areas adjacent to sporting areas and the 20 metres surrounding these areas.", "Our government continues to take active steps to protect young people from the health risks and impacts of smoking.", "This act has three schedules, the first of which, if passed, would ban all flavoured tobacco. The reason we are doing this is very clear. If we are to truly push down smoking rates in Ontario, we have to do two things: First, we have to help those who want to quit, quit; secondly, we have to do everything we can to ensure that that next generation of smokers does not start smoking.", "The evidence is clear that the tobacco industry adds flavours to tobacco to attract new smokers, particularly youth. It is in this context that we have moved forward to ban all flavoured tobacco, including menthol. We believe that this legislation, if passed, will truly move us that much closer to a smoke-free Ontario.", "But there is a new player in town, and I vividly remember the first time I came across it. I was on the GO train with my daughter when I thought I saw somebody smoking on the GO train. I was shocked, because it’s not something we usually see. We don’t see somebody smoking in enclosed spaces anymore.", "I recall telling my daughter, “Look at that. Somebody is flouting whatever rule it is. How is it that this person is so blatantly smoking inside the car of a GO train?” My daughter, of course, is a teenager who knows a lot more about these things, turned to me and said, “Mom, that’s not a cigarette; it’s an electronic cigarette.”", "I recall that moment particularly for what it was, because it was so jarring for me to see what looked like somebody smoking inside the GO train. I think it speaks to the fact that an entire generation of Ontarians has never seen anybody smoke inside a subway, inside a movie theatre, inside the workplace or inside a GO train. It speaks to the success of our anti-smoking legislation and the hard-fought gains—really hard-fought gains—that we must continue to protect.", "The fact is that electronic cigarettes are both an opportunity and a risk. This is new technology that, quite frankly, might have the potential for harm reduction. But at the same time, we also recognize that in the absence of longitudinal studies, in the absence of longitudinal evidence, we still don’t know what all the risks of this new technology might be. So we’ve tried to negotiate a careful path between recognizing the potential for harm reduction that electronic cigarettes bring and, at the same time, recognizing that there could be risks and harms associated with this new technology that we are not fully aware of. That is why we are moving to regulate electronic cigarettes.", "If the Electronic Cigarettes Act is passed, it would call for:", "—a ban the sale and supply of e-cigarettes to anyone under the age of 19;", "—a prohibition on the use of e-cigarettes in certain places, such as enclosed work spaces and enclosed public places;", "—a ban on the sale of e-cigarettes in certain places such as vending machines or grocery stores that contain pharmacies;", "—a prohibition on the display and promotion of e-cigarettes in places where e-cigarettes or tobacco products are sold or offered for sale.", "We have listened to the concerns expressed by stakeholders, including specialty e-cigarette retailers, and any exemptions will be considered during the regulation-making process.", "These changes would ban the sale of e-cigarettes to minors, making it harder for youth to obtain e-cigarettes. It would also make tobacco products less tempting by banning the sale of flavored tobacco, which I already spoke to.", "In addition to banning menthol and regulating electronic cigarettes, this act would also, if passed, make it mandatory for any restaurant or food service premise in Ontario with over 20 locations to post calories on their menus and menu boards. More specifically, if passed, the act would require calories for standard food and beverage items, including alcohol, to be posted on menus and menu boards in restaurants, convenience stores, grocery stores and other food service premises with 20 or more locations in Ontario. It would require food service premises to post contextual information that would help to educate patrons about their daily caloric requirements and authorize inspectors to enforce menu-labelling requirements.", "Currently, over 60% of large chain restaurants already provide nutritional information voluntarily upon demand, on websites or in-store. The proposed menu-labelling legislation is also a key component of our Healthy Kids Strategy, which responds to the Healthy Kids Panel’s recommendations for reducing childhood obesity.", "We have heard from many partners and individuals regarding the importance of what we’re proposing, and should this legislation pass we will continue these discussions in the form of consultations with key stakeholders to ensure successful implementation.", "It is interesting that the proposed menu-labelling legislation has widespread support in Ontario, and I’m one of those who supports this legislation. I’m going to share a story: Back in 2011 when I first ran for office, I remember somebody saying to me, just in passing, “You’re going to campaign, and you’re going to lose some weight.” I said, “That’s good. Win or lose, at least I’ll lose some weight.” I recall very clearly that at the end of the campaign I had actually gained weight. I was a little surprised, but I didn’t think much of it; there was just too much to do as a brand new MPP. As it happened, the penny dropped for me—", "Interjections." ],

  "text" : [ "That’s why we’re going to go ahead with this legislation and you’re going to support us.", "As I was saying, the penny dropped one day when, quite accidentally and inadvertently, I was browsing the website of Tim Hortons and found out that a medium Iced Capp can pack as much as 600 or 700 calories. That’s when the penny dropped for me. All of you who may remember the 2014 election will recall that it was a summer election, a very hot election. I remember that at the end of every canvass I would treat my volunteers to a cold drink. Usually we’d go to Tim’s, and people would have a coffee and I would usually get myself an Iced Capp. The trouble was that I would canvass about three times a day. So while my volunteers might be drinking one Iced Capp, there were days I was drinking three Iced Capps a day, packing in 1,800 calories. Meanwhile, it appears that the maximum calories for an adult woman is somewhere in the 1,500 to 1,800 range, and here I was, taking in 1,500 calories just through my Iced Capps. Then, of course, add the doughnuts and samosas and all the stuff that goes with a campaign, and no wonder I gained some weight. The point I’m making is: When I walked into the Tim Hortons, had I been able to see, next to the Iced Capp, 600 calories—might I only have bought myself one a day instead of three a day? I think that is the power of this legislation. It really is about empowering Ontarians; helping them make the decisions they need to make. I, personally, am truly looking forward to this legislation as well.", "In all, the goal, the leitmotif, of all these three pieces of legislation is quite simple: It is about making Ontario the best place in North America—the healthiest place in North America—to grow up and grow old.", "We have consulted extensively, in making this legislation, but I also want to say to the House that the consultation process doesn’t stop with the passing of the bill. Should this bill pass and we go to regulation-making, I have committed to once again consult broadly with our stakeholders because, as we all know, it is at the regulation stage of a bill that the rubber actually hits the road. So I have committed—and we have committed—to talking to all of our stakeholders to make sure that we get this bill right, with just one goal; that is, to make Ontario the lowest-smoking jurisdiction and to make Ontario the healthiest place in North America to grow up and grow old.", "I hope that all of you will find the bill worthy of support." ],

As Minister Damerla has so clearly laid out, passage of the legislation under debate today would ban the sale of e-cigarettes to minors, making it harder for youth to obtain e-cigarettes.", "It would also make tobacco products less tempting by banning the sale of flavoured tobacco, including menthol, and permit the government to further limit exposure to second-hand smoke in public areas.", "It would also require large, chain food-service premises like fast-food restaurants to post calories on menus, providing key support to helping Ontarians make well-informed choices about what they eat and what they feed their children when dining out. I’d say it’s hard to argue with that.", "If passed, schedule 1 of the Making Healthier Choices Act will take effect on January 1, 2017. Following the passage, key stakeholders will be consulted on the development of regulations to support the legislation, including:", "—calorie posting, in order to determine the size, format and prominence of calorie information to be posted on menus, and how calorie information will be determined;", "—standard food items, in order to provide further clarity and/or set out requirements for standard food items captured by the legislation;", "—contextual statement, in order to determine the size, format and content of the contextual statement, such as that the average adult requires 2,000 calories a day;", "—exemptions, in order to determine if any of the exemptions from the calorie posting requirements are needed, such as seasonal items on the menu for a limited number of days.", "Let me now speak to the ban on the sale of flavored tobacco. In the 2014 budget, our government committed to prohibiting the sale of tobacco products that contain flavours and additives that appeal to youth. These products are often packaged in brightly coloured wrappers and smell strongly of candy and fruit flavours—precisely what appeals to youth.", "Additional evidence emerged indicating that young people in significant numbers are using menthol-flavoured tobacco products. During committee hearings, we heard from a representative of the Canadian Cancer Society, Ontario division, which has been advocating for a ban on youth-friendly flavoured tobacco for a long time. According to the society, flavoured tobacco products are no longer so-called niche products. Instead, they are widely used by the majority of youth who use tobacco products. In Ontario, more than 57,000 youth in grades 6 to 12 have reported using a flavoured tobacco product in the last 30 days. Almost 19,000 Ontario youth, or one in four who reported smoking, say that they are smoking menthol cigarettes. I started with a menthol cigarette.", "The society believes that the inclusion of menthol in Bill 45 is both progressive and necessary. Dr. David McKeown, Toronto’s Medical Officer of Health, cited a recent University of Waterloo research study which found that more than half of youth tobacco users in grades 9 to 12 used flavoured tobacco products; a quarter of youth smokers smoked menthol cigarettes. This demonstrates youth’s preference for flavours and the strong appeal of menthol cigarettes in particular.", "We have a responsibility to act on flavoured tobacco, and we are going to do that by banning all flavours, be it bubble gum or mint. I want to assure you, Mr. Speaker, and the members of this House that key stakeholders will be consulted on the following proposed amendments to Ontario regulation 48/06 through the Ontario regulatory registry. With respect to flavoured tobacco, we will consult on how to define the term “flavouring agent” for the purposes of describing what types of flavoured tobacco are prohibited for sale and what exemptions might apply, such as flavoured tobacco products primarily used by adults, that is, those that contain additives but still predominantly taste like tobacco and no other flavour.", "In December 2013, consultations were conducted through the Ontario registry on the following proposed amendments:", "Hospital grounds: Prohibit smoking on outdoor grounds of hospitals; and", "Provincial government properties: Prohibit smoking on the grounds of specified provincial government properties and prohibit the sale of tobacco on specified provincial government properties.", "The government is planning to move forward with these proposed initiatives. They will help to ensure that the gains made under the Smoke-Free Ontario Strategy are maintained.", "Interjections." ],

Banning the sale of flavoured tobacco products will help us to achieve our goal of having the lowest smoking rate in Canada.", "The dangers of smoking and tobacco use are well known and documented. However, the risks that come with the use of e-cigarettes may be less familiar to some of you. During the committee hearings on the bill, presentations were made that pointed to the possible risks associated with e-cigarettes. Further, a study from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, published in Nicotine and Tobacco Research in August 2014, found that in a nationally representative sample of middle- and high-school students who had never smoked cigarettes, youth who had used e-cigarettes were nearly two times more likely to have intentions to smoke conventional cigarettes than youth who had never used e-cigarettes.", "I want to make it clear that it is not our government’s intention to remove e-cigarettes from the Ontario marketplace at this time. The proposed approach focuses on taking action to protect Ontario’s children and youth from accessing and using a product that may pose potential harm to their health.", "I believe all members will agree that this proposed legislation is a measured and precautionary response to a new and emerging product that may have harmful effects.", "If the legislation is passed, our government intends to consult with key stakeholders on the development of regulations to support the legislation. The consultations will focus on two parts. During the first part, the ministry will consult to facilitate the implementation of age-based sales restrictions, which are proposed to come into effect on January 1, 2016. The subject of these consultations will include a number of areas.", "Through the regulatory registry, the ministry will consult around signage in order to clarify that all signs required by the act and the regulations must be posted in a clearly visible area.", "The ministry will also consult on the types of identification that would be acceptable as proof of age to ensure that persons who have access to e-cigarettes are at least 19 years of age.", "We will be asking for opinions about details regarding the signage to be posted at all retail outlets selling electronic cigarettes. The signage would indicate that electronic cigarette sales are restricted to those 19 years of age and older.", "Finally, through the regulatory registry, we will discuss the details regarding the signage that is to be posted at all retail outlets selling electronic cigarettes. The signage would indicate that ID is requested for anyone who appears to be under the age of 25.", "The second phase will focus on the implementation of the other provisions of the bill, which are proposed to come into effect January 1, 2017. These provisions include display and promotion, and use and sales restrictions in certain places.", "In order to facilitate implementation, the ministry will consult on: details regarding required signage showing e-cigarettes are prohibited for use in specified places; details regarding additional areas where the use of e-cigarettes is prohibited; and details on the display and promotion ban.", "The ministry will also consult on procedures for employees who complain of being retaliated against by an employer. We will also look at procedures for home health care workers who leave a client’s home, which will mirror the procedure in the regulation made under the Smoke-Free Ontario Act; and finally, procedures for seizing funds in vending machines in the form of credit card and debit transactions.", "The measures we are proposing under this legislation are part of our commitment under Patients First, Ontario’s Action Plan for Health Care, to provide Ontarians with the information they need to play an active role in their own health. The importance of this legislation cannot be underestimated. Responsible government does not, and will not, leave its citizens’ best possible health to chance.", "One of the reasons why this legislation is so important to me personally is because my brother is a former smoker. He has dreadful asthma, and he has been taking prednisone for many, many years, which has deteriorated his bone health. He’s only two years older than me and has had hip-replacement surgery.", "I cannot underestimate the importance of this legislation, and I truly hope that we have the support of this House on this very important bill.", "I’m proud to say that our government is taking action to help our young people stay healthy and get the best possible start in life.

We, in the Progressive Conservatives, will, in fact, be supporting this bill.", "There are three key elements of this bill that I do want to talk very briefly about, since my time is limited. One is, first of all, of course, the banning of marketing of tobacco products to children. We all know the impact—that once they catch children at a young age and they start smoking, the addiction aspect of that. And, of course, it leads to other things, not just smoking cigarettes or pipes or cigars, but it also leads to perhaps illegal drugs as well. There are statistics to prove that.", "The other thing is that we want to crack down on illegal smoke shacks, where people can, in fact, purchase these cigarettes at a very cheap price.", "The other thing that is of interest to me is not only just the childhood obesity—because we look at it, and we’re saying, “Well, what are we doing in our school systems these days to encourage more physical activity?” In the younger grades, the elementary grades, they’re fairly busy. Then they get into high school, and my concern there is that they only have to take one credit for phys. ed. in their four years of high school. Of course, to me, that just adds, again, to the need for them to get on a weight-control program, because they’re not as physically active.", "The other thing, in the few moments that I have left, is to talk about the calorie count. I find that calorie count—I count calories, and I keep a close eye on it. Since January 1, I have dropped over 40 pounds by keeping a close eye on things. Again, I think that that’s really, really important, that people start to take count of their calories to enhance their lifestyles." ],

The NDP moved 17 amendments in committee and the Liberals voted against 16 of those changes, such as immediately banning menthol tobacco products.

It would make sense to continue to allow them to have the power to go beyond provincial statute.", "We put forward an amendment the Liberals didn’t support mandating the minister to establish a committee to review whether sodium information should be displayed.", "We support this bill, but it could have been much stronger if the Liberals had supported the NDP amendments." ],

If we teach them to eat healthy now, when they’re adults they will eat healthy. And for ourselves as well, we need to eat healthy.", "I know from many years of consumer advocacy that it really boils down to: Do consumers have the information they need to make informed choices? All too often, when we go into restaurants, we don’t have the information we need to make informed choices. We’ve all heard the stories about buying a healthy bran muffin over the chocolate doughnut, only to find out years later with some horror that that doughnut had less fat in it, had less sugar in it, than the healthy bran muffin—alleged healthy bran muffin.", "I know from my work on processed food labelling that’s going through the federal process right now—I was shocked to learn from food scientists and merchandisers that we have what the food scientists would call the taste triumvirate: fat, sugar and salt. What shocked me, working with consumer advocates, is that all too often, when a product that we see on the shelf with the label “low salt”—it in fact has lower salt than the regular brand, but what they do when they drop one of those—salt, fat or sugar—is to boost up the other. So “low fat” might mean an increase in sugar or salt; “low salt” usually means an increase in fat. It’s very confusing for consumers when they think they’re buying healthy and in fact they’re not.", "I think Bill 45 goes a long way to making sure that we can take care of our children and we as consumers can make an informed choice." ],

If they really care about what’s going into their bodies, they’ve already done that research.", "I’ll tell you, one of the biggest threats we have in our society is obesity and what we’re seeing with our children, and that is because healthy choices are not being made. The parents have to spend more time thinking about how much time their children are spending in front of a TV screen or a computer and how much time they’re spending doing physical activities that burn calories. As this becomes more prevalent, the strain on our health care system is going to become more and more evident. It’s a big strain on our health care system already—illnesses associated with obesity—and we need to do a whole lot better than we’re doing today or we’re going to have a real tsunami of disastrous and catastrophic health care issues as we head into the future.", "This is a start, but just putting numbers on a menu is not the issue. There has to be some real education for people that they understand. It’s a question most times of input and output. We live in a sedentary society today. Very few people do hard, physical work anymore, so we have to find ways of burning off those calories.", "We live in a high-stress world, as well, which is a challenge.

The posting of calories is not the only solution; he’s right.

I want to thank everybody who has been there to support us, and I truly look forward to the passage of this bill." ],

  "text" : [ "I am happy to rise and speak to third reading of Bill 45. It’s a bill that I spoke to at second reading and that I also sat in on for a number of hours on amendments. Typical, I guess, of all the bills I’ve sat in on for amendments, essentially all the amendments were voted down by this government. It’s a practice I’ve seen since I got here, where it doesn’t matter what the amendments are. They talk about sending bills off for reasonable and needed changes, but when we get there, there’s certainly no consideration given to really improving the bills.", "We do support this bill. We did want to see some changes. There’s a lot of good in it and there are a lot of things that we need in our system. The calories on menus is one part. I think a lot of us, especially a lot of people here, struggle with their weight. It was funny to hear the story about electioneering, when you’re on the road and you’re always typically jumping in to grab something, fast food, and sometimes some of this food will surprise you.", "I remember working as a fundraiser at Tim Hortons and being involved with the makeup of some of their foods and seeing just how much cream is actually used in some of their drinks. I remember the Iced Capp is essentially a glass full of 19% cream, so it’s got a lot of calories in it. I was somewhat surprised. Certainly you can ask for it to be made with milk, which you can imagine takes down the calorie level an extreme amount. I don’t know what the calorie rating would be, although I know they provide it, but it’s just an indication of how you’re taking something—and really, I don’t find a big difference in taste between the standard one that you’d get if you normally ask for an Iced Capp or one made with milk. But you can see the numbers are significant and something that this calorie information would certainly be a big help with.", "In the same light, I remember before coming up here my wife, Margie, and I went on a bike trip from Niagara Falls to the Quebec border. It’s something they do every year, and it’s something I got to know because they used to end up in our township at the Quebec border. We used to have a little bit of a party for them to celebrate the accomplishment. As we started out, I one year tried to make it from Cornwall to the border and had quite a bit of trouble but finally made it. They were looking for somebody to do the whole track. They wanted a municipal politician, so I ended up doing it the next year. There was a lady who was on that trip, and you know how you hear people talking. She was talking about getting on the trip to lose weight. At the end, she said she was upset because she hadn’t lost any weight. She said, “You know, those energy bars.” Everywhere you stopped, there were energy bars. Of course you’re exercising and you think, well, you need the energy. But when you look at the calories on those energy bars, they add up. In fact, I think she said she put on 10 pounds. So it’s just something that can happen. Intentions are well worth it sometimes, but in the end what comes out of it is quite different.", "So when I went on the trip a year later, I’d go up and every place you stop—probably 10 times a day—for a water break, there would be a pile of those energy bars on the table. I’d go to grab one, and I’d think, “Well, really, I don’t think I really need those,” and I’d grab one of the bananas or oranges they had out.", "So calories on menus are really an important part of this legislation. We tried, through the amendments, to put some things in order. We thought we were right. One of the amendments—I think it came from the NDP—was all about where you have foods that are similar. I’m thinking of a Dairy Queen, where you go in and they have a sundae and there are 35 flavours: strawberry, raspberry, the normal flavours you see. Then they have a milkshake, and it’s the same, and then they have a Blizzard. The amendment would allow, where foods are similar or flavours and calories are similar, that they would be able to put up an average when it was within 15%. Of course this government turned that down.", "There was no consideration for the logistics. You can imagine now going through a menu lineup where you might have 400 or 500 items because you have to break down every group that has 35 or so flavours. Really, what’s the point? What are we trying to do? We’re trying to give people an indication of what reasonably is available in calories when you’re buying a food. Whether something is 100 or 105 calories—what you really want to know is, is it 100 or is it 1,000, or is it 200 or 300?", "This amendment was turned down—as almost all the amendments were, because they came from the other side. Fast foods are generally set up as drive-throughs, or you run through. How are people realistically going to interpret the information? So, in some ways, you’ve made this bill probably useless when it comes to certain franchisees, because it’s just not practical to do. It’s unfortunate and, again, an example of amendments not in place.", "I go back to one in the previous session, where you talk about the logic of our amendments and the refusal, I think, to accept them. We had a communication bill where we were talking about the day a contract ran out, the contract was cancelled. The phone number was taken away. We put in an amendment. I use a cellphone, like many people. Everybody here essentially does, except for the member opposite with his white book. But you can imagine. I have friends who have had phones for many years, and the contract’s up, but they keep on going. If you’re going to lose your number and the phone is being deactivated—it really didn’t make any sense.", "When we went through amendments, the government talked against that. It didn’t make sense. They moved ahead with it. Of course, we went through the days of the McGuinty prorogation in the House, so the bill died on the floor. The bill was resurrected in a new form and, lo and behold, that change was incorporated. To me, that just indicated that the government would not accept—they talk about sending things for amendment, they talk about trying to improve things, but really there’s no intention. So you wonder why we spend the hours and hours if they really are not interested, even when, I think, in a case like that, they believed it was a good amendment—but they refused to allow it to be used.", "So the calories and the food side—it’s a good initiative. Certainly, we’re battling with an issue, especially with our youth. But we have to put through meaningful legislation. I look back at one of the previous legislations put in place around healthy foods in cafeterias. Sometimes you have to look beyond the legislation. It’s all well-meaning; it’s all good news. But when you look through what’s happening in our high schools now, children are just leaving the high schools to eat lunch across the road at the local fast-food place, because the food that’s now on the menus is no longer something that they’ll eat. It’s fine to have healthy food around, but you have to have it in a format that people enjoy.", "I know in our local high school, if there’s some type of trip, they actually close down the cafeteria because they don’t have enough people going to the cafeteria to make it worthwhile. A school has 300 or 400 children in it, but you can imagine that there are so many people who travel off the property down to a local spot to eat that that means there’s no place to eat. There’s the legislation put in place, but it means that actually there’s nothing.", "I think that there’s an important message like that. You have to look at what you’re doing with the legislation and what the impact will be. I’m sure that in a lot of cases, it’s an unintended consequence, but it would be worthwhile to review and follow up, and say, “Well, there’s something that’s not working; let’s fix that.” I think that there’s what you call a missed opportunity.", "One of the amendments we tried—we received information from some of the franchise establishments, where the legislation really blamed not only the franchisee but the franchiser. I think the legislation was really about trying to ensure that the person who was operating, the owner of the premises, was responsible under the legislation. We tried a number of times to clarify that and to make sure that the legislation—you’ve got an A&W or you’ve got a Dairy Queen. We have many of those franchises. If the local operator is doing something that’s not standard, how do you go back and charge the person that owns the name? That’s what we’re talking about. We think that it really should fall down to the operator, and we thought it just made sense.", "When I talk now, moving over to the tobacco side—I come from a family of smokers. My mother and father both smoked, and, I’d say, more than half of my brothers and sisters. We had a fairly large family. So I saw the effects of cigarettes.", "I also saw how hard it was—I don’t think there was anybody who didn’t try to quit smoking. I look back now—after many years, I’ve had a number of brothers and sisters who have quit—and I remember my dad often trying to quit smoking. At the time, it was probably more of a money issue back in the 1960s, when we were growing up. There wasn’t a lot of money in the farm, and cigarettes were something that I think he looked at and knew that it just wasn’t worth the money. He would constantly try to quit, but it was just something he couldn’t do.", "I think you have to somewhat appreciate a generation of people who grew up when there was nothing really wrong with cigarettes. They were promoted; they were a great tax revenue for the government. Really, it only came up in the 1970s and the 1980s, when people started to realize there were other issues. So I feel sometimes that we’re beating these people up.", "I go by the local hospital, and I see we’re outlawing these cigarettes on provincial properties. I think, again, you have to look at what you’re doing. You see patients now, sitting on the sidewalk, smoking. These are people, I’m sure, who would love to quit smoking. There’s generally a grass area that’s a few hundred feet. What are we accomplishing? What are we trying to do here? Can we not force them outside the building, and allow them to smoke with some privacy, away from people? I guess they’re a group that can be beat up, and I think that’s just why we’re doing it.", "On the alternative side, we go by schools and we allow our children, who are under 19, to actually smoke in public. We give them the place; we give them a nice little area where nobody can bother them. Teachers and principals can’t watch who is there. I’ve talked to principals who say they know very well that that’s the centre where students are buying contraband and where they’re buying other drugs, and there’s an unintended consequence that could easily be changed. If we’re really trying so hard to stop smoking, let’s just make it illegal for children under 19 to smoke. We do it with alcohol, and we’re quite successful. All we’ve done now is we’ve given the cool place to be, and in a lot of cases, we’ve actually increased smoking at that level, because we’ve given them a place to go.", "Further with this idea of the nanny state, you can’t smoke in parks now. So you get parents—I don’t smoke, myself, but I know people who smoke, and they would love to quit. So here is an opportunity for them to take their children out to a park, but now they can’t smoke in the park. I guess you can close your eyes, but all that really means is there will be less opportunities for the children to get out. It was something that served people; you got fresh air for the children. The idea is novel, but you’ve got to look at—we’ve got a nanny state here that’s really watching over everybody’s shoulder. Just what are you trying to do?", "On the other hand, you’ve got the contraband problem that really is a more serious issue. In our area, they’ve done some testing: The vast majority of cigarettes that our young people are smoking are contraband, yet there’s nothing being done here. If you really wanted to take some action, go after these illegal cigarettes. Get rid of the location where you’re allowing the contraband dealers to come in and sell their wares. Take some action.", "We’re looking at more than a billion dollars of lost revenue a year, due to contraband. We’ve got legislation here that, in many ways, will only increase the amount of contraband that’s being sold in this province.", "Menthol is a good example. A majority of people in this province smoke menthol cigarettes. Studies have shown that if we just eliminate that—and they’re not doing it on day one; they’re going to allow that to be done through regulation, so we really don’t know what that means, because we don’t see regulation. It just happens under the government. They’ve said that they’ll seek the menthol from contraband sources. Stats show that there are more varieties of menthol in contraband than there are in the regular types of cigarettes that you can buy legally. So there’s an example where the market bears out what people know: The ban on menthol will only lead to problems.", "Some $1.1 billion is lost to contraband. You wonder what that would do. It would hire 18,000 nurses in a year. It would pay for almost 24,000 long-term-care beds or provide home care to almost 72,000 patients.", "This is a time when we could use this money. We have people in my riding of Stormont–Dundas–South Glengarry who can’t find long-term-care beds. We’re sending them outside the region, yet this government tries to tell people—for those who will believe them—that we have more beds than we need. And yet, every day we’re trying to help people out, sending them more than an hour away from their home to find a place where they could actually be given long-term-bed service.", "We’d like to allow the menthol a little bit of time, and just really wonder about the benefits of that when so many people smoke. Again, these people are smoking legally. We know that all we’re going to do is drive them to an area where we don’t want them to go.", "I think it’s time that we start working and looking at the unintended consequences. We’ve seen time and time again a government that puts through regulation, walks away and doesn’t look in the rear-view mirror to see just what they’ve done. Smoking numbers have gone to lower levels, but now they’ve started to bounce back up, and they’re bouncing back up with our youth, so what we’re doing is not working. We can make it tougher to buy them legally, but they’re not buying them legally in the first place. Why we think that’s going to make a difference, I’m not sure, because these are an illegal product to be sold to children under 19.", "When you look at the stats—they can easily pick up the butts; they know whether they’re legal cigarettes or contraband—in my area it’s something over 70% of the cigarettes are actually contraband. You can do all you want, but if you’re not attacking the source, you’re not really going to have any issues.", "E-cigarettes are also something that concern us. This is a product that, for people who are trying to reduce their smoking, has been proven successful. Studies or science so far show that there are no negative effects from e-cigarettes. I think all we’re doing is taking away a tool from the people who are really trying to stop; it’s a nasty habit. I think it’s time we really work with them and give them the options.", "I have a letter from a consumer: “As a consumer of menthol cigarettes, I’m urging you to reverse the government’s decision to ban menthol in Ontario. We’ve been purchasing these products for many years and don’t understand the reason to ban them now. I don’t expect the ban to change my smoking habits, and I’m sure people will simply find these products elsewhere. I agree that young people should not be smoking, but banning menthol will not help achieve this goal.” This is a menthol issue.", "“Hello, sir. I’ve recently established a retail outlet selling PV products in Cornwall. I would like to address the proposed Bill 45 regarding e-cigarettes and the effects on the industry, human health and our facility. Our studies and many others worldwide show that electronic cigarettes are the most effective stop-smoking aid available. Treating e-cigarettes as tobacco is dangerous to the industry and people’s health and freedoms, and just plain scientifically inaccurate. I would like to request a short discussion.”", "These are people who have come forth and talked about e-cigarettes. I have another one here questioning the logic of this government; I know sometimes it’s hard to figure out the logic. But I think we have a great tool here with e-cigarettes.", "I think the words of the minister were that we know there’s no science to suggest they are dangerous, but we’re going to ban them and then we’ll review in the future. That’s the first time I’ve heard that logic used, but I think it’s very telling of this government that doesn’t like to use the science. It has hurt us in many areas, including the energy sector. I think it’s time to review the science and look at what’s really good for the province." ],

The average Canadian visited restaurants 184 times in 2007. On average, Canadians prepare and eat at home only two of every three meals. Many restaurant foods contain high levels of calories and sodium. There’s also a wide variation among similar dishes at different restaurants.", "The other piece here is another interesting fact: 35% of the sugar that Canadians consume comes from added sugars, such as soft drinks and candy, as opposed to naturally occurring sugars in fruits, vegetables and milk. For kids, almost half of their daily sugar intake, which is 44%, is now coming from beverages, and soft drinks are the primary source of sugar in beverages for children aged nine to 18.", "The other important thing to know is that income inequality is growing in Ontario, making it harder for families to afford healthy food. Eating healthy food is expensive for Ontario families and not always available. It is often more convenient and more affordable for families to eat fast food or high-calorie processed food, which is readily available in any corner store and in vending machines.", "Speaker, the facts speak for themselves. People are accessing takeout foods, eating prepackaged foods, going to restaurants much more frequently. There is a need for this bill, and I think it’s important that we recognize that. I’m glad to see that it is coming to the Legislature for third reading. It’s a shame that our critic France Gélinas’s 17 amendments—16 of those were voted down. I know France is very passionate about this bill, and she made some really good suggestions.", "Despite that, I’m glad to see it’s here and going to be passed." ],

It’s better for our health care system as well. That’s why Bill 45 would make it easier for families to make healthy and informed choices by making Ontario the first province to require chain restaurants to post calories. More and more, people with their busy lifestyles tend to turn to going to restaurants or takeout food for their evening meals, and quite often lunch as well.", "We are proposing that only calories be posted on the menus as this more closely aligns with a commitment under the Healthy Kids Strategy to reduce obesity in children, since calorie consumption is a major determinant of weight.", "No other jurisdiction has ever required that sodium be displayed on menus. While other jurisdictions provide strong evidence that calorie postings alter consumers’ behaviour, there is no such evidence for posting sodium. Providing too much information on the menu can be counterproductive, as research has shown, and it can be confusing to the consumer.", "I believe that Bill 45 is the right way for us to go and will keep our future generations healthier." ],

After all, for many of us, nurses represent our first point of contact with the health care system and serve vital acute-care roles in our hospitals.", "More and more, patients that require some form of continuing or extended care can tell you the important roles our nurses play outside of the hospital setting.", "With an aging population and growing demand for services, our health care system is expected to be put under increased pressure over the foreseeable future. For this reason, we in the PC caucus have been consistent in our calls for a health care system that is more patient-centric. Health care that is centred on the patient and can be delivered outside of the hospital is not only good for patients, it is more economical.", "It is our province’s nurses that have consistently demonstrated that they are a valuable and necessary resource to building such a system. There are numerous patients receiving care in their communities that rely on their nurse to not only provide quality care but also valuable guidance and advice on how to navigate what is often a very complex health care system.", "Nurses have a wide range of skills and knowledge, and represent a versatile resource which we must engage further if we’re to meet the health care challenges of the future.", "The idea of nurses being with you every step of the way is not just an abstract ideal. It’s a very practical principle that needs to guide the decisions of this government as it determines how best to structure Ontario’s health care system. Nurses are a vital resource in building a system that is very cost-effective—yet still able to handle the increased demand in services that we certainly anticipate seeing.", "To me, that means working with our nurses to expand the breadth of services they provide. I know that when I met with many of the CCAC nurses, they were saying, “Less bureaucracy. Let us make the decisions. We are the ones with the knowledge base.” It’s much more time-efficient for them to say, “Yes, this person needs this type of care in their home and now”—so empowering those nurses to lead community-based health care initiatives.", "We should be investing more in our nurses. I know that we learned in the news just last month that there would be 250 fewer nurses working. We learned just yesterday that there are not enough nurses in the northern areas of our provinces, leaving communities dangerously underserved. I know that when we travelled up there, as part of the sexual harassment and violence committee, we certainly heard that nurses could use some more tools and deliver more of the health care that is so desperately needed up there. I think we could all work together to make those changes.", "This being National Nursing Week, I think it’s a time for the government to expand its creativity and give nurses some more abilities to provide front-line care, both in northern Ontario, as I mentioned, but certainly in our communities. It’s critical to building our modern health care system. I am hopeful, and I am sure, that the government will continue to recognize the vital role that nurses play in our health system." ],

ONA knows that another consecutive year of funding freezes will mean that even more registered nurses will be cut, which will, in their words, leave hospital patients in Ontario “at an increased risk of complications and even death.”", "According to the Registered Practical Nurses Association of Ontario, health care is “approaching a crisis situation ... and nurses are telling us that much more needs to be done in order to provide patients with the care they truly need.”", "Speaker, I was in a round-table discussion prior to the picket line going up in Welland and was shocked to hear nurses describe their experience at work as being “epic” in terms of the stress level—epic stress levels.

They are suffering from increased workloads, stress burnout, and, according to the RPNAO, “the moral distress associated with watching in frustration as their patients fail to get the level and quality of care they deserve....”", "We don’t honour our nurses by making it harder for them to do their jobs. We don’t honour our nurses by firing RNs and reducing hours of care. We don’t honour our nurses by privatizing their positions and denying fair compensation.", "We owe our nurses more than empty words.

It’s very important for the long-term economic health of our province and it’s important to the people of this province. The motion reflects a message that I have frankly been hearing loudly and clearly from all corners of our province, from seniors, from businesses, from industry, from agriculture, from moms, from dads, from youth, from people of every walk of life and every part of this province: This Premier and her Liberal government must abandon their plan to privatize Hydro One.", "Hydro One is a public asset and it belongs in public hands. The decision to sell Ontario’s electricity system is a short-sighted decision. It has no public support and it is the wrong thing to do for this province. You know, Ontarians don’t want to pay the price for yet another bad decision by this Liberal government. They want the Premier to stop her privatization scheme before it’s too late.", "People in Nova Scotia know the impacts of privatizing an electricity system. They know what privatized power means. Their bills, in fact, rival Ontario’s bills for being the highest bills in the country.", "Meanwhile, people in provinces like Manitoba and Quebec with their public systems are actually paying half the price or less than what we are paying here in Ontario. Between taxes, hydro dividends and investment, Quebec and Manitoba receive a substantial yearly return from their public hydro systems, as does Ontario. Ontario reaps benefits from having a public hydro system.", "In fact, a report that was just recently released—it was commissioned by CUPE—was the Peters report. It shows that selling a 60% stake will cause a net annual loss of $338.8 million. An annual loss of almost half a billion dollars, really, is what it comes down to. And for what? A misguided, one-time cash grab for Kathleen Wynne.", "Tens of thousands of people across this province are calling on the Premier to address the unaffordable cost of hydro.

They are ramming this through the Legislature. They’re shutting down debate. They’re avoiding consultation. They’re ignoring the people of Ontario who actually own Hydro One. And all the while, they’re spinning false rhetoric.", "The Premier talks about leveraging our assets. What utter nonsense. Leveraging a public asset doesn’t mean selling it off to the private sector so that we can no longer control it. It means being able to use our hydro system in the public’s interest. Leveraging an asset was using Ontario Hydro, for example, to save the town of Kapuskasing from the closure of their largest mill. Leveraging an asset is how we are going to electrify First Nations communities that are currently on diesel generation, even though it’s very, very costly to do so. You don’t leverage an asset by selling it off for a pittance.", "Hydro One’s annual report says clearly that its business interests, as an organization, are often in conflict with the public interest. Well, which interest do you think is going to prevail when Hydro One becomes a private corporation? It’s not going to be the public interest that’s going to prevail. It’s going to be the private interest that’s going to prevail.", "The only way we maintain an electricity system that actually serves the public interest, that serves Ontarians’ interest, is by keeping Hydro One public.", "While wages are stagnating for most people in this province, and seniors and people on fixed incomes have seen their take-home pay decline, what’s happening with hydro?

At that event, there was a bakery owner, a woman named Laura, who owns her own business. She was telling us that she has to struggle already to be able to afford to pay the bills. Let’s face it, hydro is necessary for a bakery. There are hot ovens going day in and day out in a bakery. As well, air conditioning has to be utilized in the summer to try to give her staff some semblance of an ability to survive through a hot summer in a bakery. She told us clearly at that meeting that if the hydro rates continue to go out of control the way the Liberals have been allowing so far, and the way they’re going to increase significantly with the privatization, she’s going to have to start laying off staff. She’s not going to be able to keep people working at her bakery because she can’t pay the utility costs.", "There was a woman named Kim at that town hall meeting. Kim was literally in tears—not tears of self-pity. She and her husband are having a very difficult time. He’s severely disabled. He’s on ODSP. He’s having a tough time. They are living on a very low income. She was in tears—not out of pity, though; out of anger and frustration against a government that refuses to listen to the struggles that the people of Ontario are facing. Kim knows that if the government goes ahead with their wrong-headed plan, she and her husband will likely be living on the streets in the future.", "Speaker, unfortunately, no matter how many of these stories I hear, the Premier refuses to listen. She refuses to listen to any of them. Instead, she’s restricting the number of hearings that the Liberals are allowing for this misguided budget.", "People outside of Toronto won’t get to provide any input into the privatization of hydro and how it’s going to hurt them. In fact, the sign-up list for the people to be able to participate in those public hearings just opened a couple of hours ago. Two or three hours ago, the list was opened. Already, 286 people have signed up to tell the Liberals what they think, and that’s just here in Toronto over the last couple of hours. They have until 4:30 tomorrow afternoon to sign up for the hearings. That’s how open and transparent the government of Ontario under Kathleen Wynne’s Liberals is here in Ontario.", "They are so dead set on ramming through this legislation that they wouldn’t even let MPPs debate this process here in the Legislature yesterday. The Liberals rang bells on the opposition, to shut down opposition voices in the process of ramming this bill through. Do you know what? The Liberal government would rather play cynical political games than actually hear the concerns of the people of this province. This government will do anything to avoid any real public accountability and real public scrutiny of this privatization scheme. This arrogant government is showing a complete and utter lack of respect not just for the parliamentary process and the MPPs who sit in this chamber, but for all Ontarians. Once again, it proves just how out of touch the Liberals are with the people of this province.", "This Premier doesn’t want to hear what Ontarians have to say, but New Democrats do. New Democrats want to hear what the people of Ontario have to say, so let’s hear from some of the people. Here’s just a sample of some of the messages that I have received. Michael from Toronto says, “I’m writing to express my strong disapproval for (the government’s) plan to sell Hydro One.”", "Lily, a mother of two, wrote, “I am against selling off something that is a necessity for generations to come.”", "Randy from Matheson says, “I must voice my utter and complete objection to any potential sell-off of Hydro One.”", "Victor from Hamilton rightly points out that “these sell-offs ... leave Ontarians poorer in the short and long run!”", "Julia from Nestleton Station says, “I am appalled that Premier Wynne threatens to sell Hydro One.”", "Jan worries that privatization “will kill ... small businesses like mine.”", "Jim from Milton says, “It is a sad day for Ontario, and we will be paying the price.”", "Lloyd from Hamilton says, “Please don’t off-load this essential service.”", "Dale from Brampton points out that “we all know that it will end in disaster.”", "Leanne from Belle River thinks that this is “the biggest short-sighted decision I’ve ever heard.”", "Ishwar from Toronto believes, as we do, that “hydro should be owned and operated by the ‘people’ of Ontario.”", "And on and on and on.", "People are worried, they are scared and they are angry. But not just families; I’ve heard from representatives from the auto sector, who have talked about how concerned manufacturers are about this scheme. Rate increases will even further reduce our competitiveness as a province. And we know that we have big problems there already because of the way the Liberals have managed Ontario.", "If the government moves ahead with this wrongheaded decision, there will be dire consequences on every front, particularly, though, in rural and northern Ontario. We know that those kinds of communities, particularly in the north, have very long, very cold winters. We know that some of them are still in an untenable situation where they are heating with electricity. Those folks are paying $20,000 a year on their household electricity bills. They’re not going to be able to afford the 70% increase or so that’s going to be likely with this wrongheaded move that the Liberals are bringing in.", "The government-side MPPs need to actually ask themselves what they’re going to say to their constituents when their constituents ask them, “Why was there no consultation on this? Why didn’t you tell us when you ran for election that you were actually running on a plan to privatize Hydro One? Why were the New Democrats talking about all the problems in the budget and the platform but Liberals denied it all?” And yet it was all there; they didn’t talk about it once when it came to the actual privatization of hydro. They talked about silly things like opening up ownership, maximizing the assets and leveraging this—that kind of double-talk, if you want to call it that, doublespeak. But not once were they open and transparent and up front and straightforward with the people in their ridings, in those Liberal ridings.", "Those Liberal members—not a single one of them was true to the people who actually voted for them on the ballot, because they did not tell them during the election campaign that they were actually going to privatize their Hydro One system. And now they’re saying, “It’s too late. You bought a bill of goods. You voted for us, but ha ha, you got fooled.

I think it’s probably brought forward in a constructive way, and it certainly expresses very strongly, the opinions of that party as to what the future of Hydro One should be.", "Certainly I think, when we look at the history of Ontario, the provision of power to the industry in this province and to the people in this province, we live in a climate, we live in a country, we live in a province where the reliance on a reliable system of electricity generation and distribution is something that is very, very important to the people in the province of Ontario. It’s something that I think governments in the past have treated sometimes with the seriousness it deserves and sometimes in, my opinion, simply haven’t placed the highest priority on it or sometimes haven’t given it the attention that it deserves.", "In this case, Speaker, a proposal is being brought forward into this House that there should be a change, in the government’s opinion, to how Hydro One is constructed and to the way it does business.", "In the past—the speaker is absolutely right—it served the people of Ontario; I think sometimes it served the people of Ontario very, very well. Hydro One, in some respects, has a very good reputation. In other respects, I think, to my constituents and to others around this province and in recent years, perhaps, the reputation hasn’t been what it should be.", "What we did in the last election, Speaker, is, we went out and we each presented our platforms to the people of Ontario. And I think two of us at least—ourselves and the third party—suggested that we would take a look at things and we’d take a look at them with a different view. Basically, that we’d examine what we had in the form of public assets, and see if those assets could be used in other ways. The idea behind that is that you go out, you examine the issue and then you proceed on the best advice you have.", "I think the speaker herself was very, very sincere when she said, “There’s no doubt we did talk in our platform about looking at some of the physical assets that the province owns.” I think that’s perfectly responsible, Speaker. She goes on to say, “I mean, you can never be closed-minded about that.” I think for a political leader in the province of Ontario to say that at that juncture is the right thing to say, Speaker.", "What we did is, we went out, we sought advice from people in the business community. We sought advice from the people who work at Hydro One themselves, the Power Workers’ Union, and, of course, others around the province offered opinions on this. At the end of the day, the advice that came forward was that we should allow the privatization or the selling off or the IPO—or whatever you want to call it—of about 60% of the company. The feeling was that you still wanted to have control over the organization, but you wanted to attract that private sector discipline and you wanted to build a hybrid model of Hydro One. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that.", "During periods of my own life, I worked for Mississauga Hydro for a number of years. My father, for example, as a skilled tradesman, helped build some of the Ontario Hydro nuclear plants. So I’ve had a personal interest and a professional interest in how the hydro system is run in the province of Ontario.", "I think what’s being brought forward today is an opinion as to—I don’t know what. I really don’t know what it says, other than, “Don’t do what the government’s proposing it should do.”", "I’m suggesting that the advice that the government has received is actually sound advice. It’s advice that the people who work right in that company, the Power Workers’ Union, also support as well. I think other governments over the years have attempted to engage themselves in the Hydro One issue, and the idea was to build a combination of public sector ownership and private sector discipline into the organization, so that when it did the distribution for people in the province of Ontario, it was doing it in an efficient way but it was also doing it in the best interest of taxpayers, ratepayers and citizens in the province of Ontario.", "Some of the safeguards that are being suggested that we should put in place are that 40% of the board of directors will be nominated by Ontario and that a two-thirds board vote will be required for any major decisions that are brought forward to the Hydro One board. We will have the power—the government, this House, this Legislature—to dismiss the board if we so see fit. We will introduce some legislation along with this proposal that would mean that the government cannot own less than 40% of Hydro One shares.", "I appreciate the opinion of the leader of the third party. I think she put it forward very forcefully and has expressed an opinion. I think, on an issue as major as this, there’s going to be a variety of opinions. The one that we’ve put forward, I think, is the one that will, in the fullness of time and perhaps even today—I haven’t seen any polling on it, but there’s a variety of polling on it. I think in the fullness of time, people will look back to the decision that was made by this House, by this government, on this proposal and will realize that this was the right way to proceed.", "So my thanks to the member for bringing this forward.

It is responsible for the $50 billion that is going to be paid out in global adjustment by the end of this year. It is responsible for the lucrative contracts to Liberal friends to build wind turbines all across this beautiful province—a blight on the land—ones that are inefficient, intermittent and produce power at excessive rates. We pay excessive rates for them to produce the power.", "They have not done any of the things with regard to solving the electricity challenges.

Ontario is about growing as a people and growing as an economy. So do we need majority ownership or do we need control of the entity that is Hydro One? Clearly it is the latter and not the former.", "For the transformation of our electricity system to be 99.7% carbon-emissions-free, for the public transit expansion and renewal that we need to continue to be Canada’s engine of growth and North America’s destination of choice for foreign investments, let’s give our pension funds something to buy in Ontario.

We all were on the pre-budget consultations, all three parties, not only this year but last year and every other year, for that matter. We saw it last year and we saw it this year: People throughout Ontario are desperate when it comes to their skyrocketing hydro bills. Whether it was the YMCA in a community or the social planning council, whether it was individuals like Jennifer in Ottawa, who I’ve talked about 100 times in this Legislature, or whether it was some of our largest industries, the skyrocketing hydro rates, the highest hydro rates in North America, are hurting our families, hurting seniors and hurting businesses.", "Last year, we had 2,700 fewer businesses in Ontario than the year before. They’re exiting Ontario. Families were lined up out here today talking about how enough is enough with the hydro rates. This is the real crux of it.", "As the member from Renfrew–Nipissing–Pembroke spoke of earlier, it’s the Green Energy Act—the flawed, failed Green Energy Act. Incidentally, according to all of the experts—whether it’s the Auditors General, both of them, in their 2011 and their 2014 reports, or all of the other organizations, the IESO and all—they tell us there’s nothing green about the Green Energy Act.", "We started off in 2009 with 25% of our power in Ontario coming from the cleanest, the greenest, the most reliable and—the key—the most affordable energy, water power. Here we are today, $50 billion later, thanks to the global adjustment, the price that’s paid, the difference between what we pay to have energy made and what we sell it for—$50 billion was spent. Here we are with 25% of our power in Ontario coming from green energy. Water power is now reduced to around 22% and we’ve seen wind power come up to 3%. So we’re still at 25%. We haven’t added one kilowatt of so-called green energy in Ontario more than we had when we started.", "I was shocked, actually, this week; our current energy critic—and as a former energy critic and our other former energy critic, we can all three of us tell you that we were shocked to hear the minister say, “There’s no more capacity for water power in Ontario. It’s over.” I’m thinking, “Oh, my gosh. Water power?” There are 2,200 potential water power sites in Ontario; 700 of them appear to be viable.", "When talking about clean, green energy, we could talk about nuclear energy as well. In nuclear energy—56% of our power comes from nuclear, one of the cleanest, greenest energies in the world. So this flawed Green Energy Act—former energy minister George Smitherman told us, “Don’t worry, it’s only going to add 1% a year.” Good heavens, Speaker. On the first day of May, the peak energy went up 15% in one day. It’s going up another 9.8% or 10%, according to the Liberals, next November 1; it’s going up again. And on January 1, they’re rolling back the consumer benefit. We’re talking about a 35% increase to families, peak energy, in a period of eight months. Oh, but Minister Smitherman? “Don’t worry. This great, brilliant plan of ours will only cause energy to go up 1%.”", "So they put ideology ahead of the needs of the people. They put the needs of the renewables sector over and above the needs of seniors, families and businesses in Ontario. That’s what we saw happen in all of Ontario.", "So this is the real issue at the core of it: What the heck is happening to skyrocketing energy prices and what are these guys going to do about it? Now, so far, we know what they’re going to do about it. They are adding more wind power. You know, back in 2006, the global adjustment was $700 million that year. In 2011, the Auditor General said, “Watch out. This thing called the global adjustment is going to hurt your business.” He estimated that global adjustment would hit $8 billion. It was $700 million. He estimated $8 billion by 2014—" ],

In 2008-09, when the government of the day had to make a choice about whether to continue to borrow money to make sure that those services that people depend on are there for them, those things that we built up, the government made that decision.

But it is wonderful to have someone in the chair to listen to my comments on this particular opposition day motion.", "My colleague the member from Renfrew–Nipissing–Pembroke led off our debate this afternoon and he said that our caucus’s position is this: We need to retain majority ownership of Hydro One. We need to have a value-for-money audit to ensure that whatever is done is in the best interest of the taxpayer. We need to involve the Financial Accountability Officer as well as the Auditor General in that. And whatever money is generated should go to pay off the electricity debt in the province of Ontario.", "As you know, Madam Speaker, the Liberal government announced this year that they intend to sell controlling interest in Hydro One. By selling 60% of Ontario’s hydro shares, they anticipate that the proceeds of the sale will be approximately $9 billion. They have said that they plan to restrict any single shareholder from owning more than 10% of Hydro One so that the government will remain the largest single shareholder. They say, of course, that they’ll control rates through the Ontario Energy Board. That is their position.", "Our caucus has raised concerns about this plan in the House many, many times. The government claims they will use a large portion of the money to fund infrastructure projects, but based on their track record we don’t believe them.", "It’s my understanding that Hydro’s debt currently is approximately $27 billion. You would think that a responsible government would begin paying off that debt before allocating the proceeds of the sale to other uses. However, this government is even changing the law in the budget bill so that they don’t have to use all of the proceeds to pay down Hydro One’s debt.", "Our interim leader, when he was Minister of Energy, built into the Electricity Act a provision that would have required any proceeds of the sale of Hydro One to pay down the debt. We believe that is the responsible policy. The government rejects that idea and wants to use that money for other uses. Unfortunately, it hasn’t even made a firm commitment to put the money in a dedicated fund for infrastructure, even though they say that they will put the money into infrastructure.", "This Liberal government appears intent on selling off Hydro One because they need the money after years of overspending, waste and mismanagement. This year, Ontario Power Generation and Hydro One generated over $1 billion in profits which were turned over to the provincial government to fund programs. Should they continue down this path in selling controlling interest in Hydro One, much of that revenue stream will no longer be available to the government in future years, and this is something the government isn’t acknowledging.", "The government also needs to answer questions about what impact this will have on electricity rates, moving forward. As a result, the price of electricity in the province of Ontario has skyrocketed. Of course, on May 1, just a few days ago, we saw an increase of 15% in the peak power rate. It’s my understanding that it’s now 16.1 cents a kilowatt hour. When they first took office, the price of hydro was 4.3 cents a kilowatt hour. It has skyrocketed under their policies and under their approach, and as we all know, all of us as MPPs constantly receive expressions of concern from constituents who are afraid to open their hydro bills, who believe that the price of hydro has become exorbitantly expensive. And they’re absolutely right.", "Under the Liberals’ watch, Ontario has become one of the highest-cost jurisdictions for electricity. Not only has this had a negative impact on Ontario families—in particular, our seniors and low-income residents—but it has also made it increasingly difficult for Ontario businesses to compete. As you know, Madam Speaker, as the price of hydro has skyrocketed, we have lost coincidentally with that about 300,000 manufacturing jobs.", "There was a time when the province of Ontario sold Ontario as a preferred location for manufacturing investment, based on the fact that we had inexpensive hydro rates, and it was very successful. Through the years—through the 1940s and 1950s and 1960s—Ontario became a manufacturing mecca in the world, largely because of our competitive energy rates and, of course, many other factors. But the fact is that energy rates were one of the prime selling points we used. Now we’ve lost that competitive advantage, and at the same time we’ve lost 300,000 manufacturing jobs.", "Our PC caucus will be carefully monitoring and scrutinizing the sale of any hydro assets, to ensure that this government is held to account.", "Again, Madam Speaker, I thank you for listening to me this afternoon. I hope your replacement comes back soon, to allow you to resume your seat, where you might want to sit. The fact is that this government has undertaken energy policies that have not been in the public interest, and have put considerable upward pressure on hydro rates and bills. They need to be held to account for their actions, and that’s what we do today." ],

I don’t blame them for feeling uncomfortable. Of course, it was, after all, an 11-page manifesto that was so soundly rejected by the people of Ontario last June 12. So it’s understandable that they would be so eager to run away from what was clearly such thin gruel.", "But beyond that, when I look over at that caucus and I see people who represent communities from the north, from urban areas in the GTHA, from Hamilton and beyond, I, for the life of me, Speaker, cannot understand why they would not want to stand with this Premier and this government to invest in infrastructure that’s so important to the quality of life that the people they represent look forward to having, but also for the kinds of investments and infrastructure that will build a stronger economy and create jobs.", "For example, just in the last few weeks, I’ve had the privilege of announcing that we are going to forward with the $1.6-billion Hurontario-Main LRT. I proudly stood alongside the Premier of Ontario, the most progressive Premier in Ontario history, and the fantastic member from Barrie to announce a $13.5-billion GO regional express rail plan.

Again, for the life of me, reading this motion and listening to the consistent contribution they make in debate and during question period and when they talk to media, for the life of me I don’t understand—and, more sadly, I would guess that the people they represent do not understand—why you do not want to support communities like Kitchener–Waterloo, communities like Hamilton, communities like Niagara Falls, communities like Algoma–Manitoulin, communities like Bramalea–Gore–Malton, communities like Renfrew–Nipissing–Pembroke and so many others.", "Our budget, our plan for infrastructure, specifically—you know the numbers and the people across Ontario know the numbers, because they embraced those numbers last June 12, 2014. When we won a majority government, they gave us the mandate to proceed over the next decade with investing $130 billion in crucial infrastructure—$31.5 billion for transit, transportation and other critical forms of infrastructure. That’s a plan. It’s an ambitious plan, but it’s a plan that’s commensurate with the ambitions of the people of Ontario. It’s why we won last June. It’s why you lost and you just can’t let it go." ],

He’s been in contact with Hydro One to sort out the situation. But, honestly, seven bills in one month? Clearly, there are issues.", "I heard from another constituent who just can’t keep up.

The Auditor General will be out of the picture. The ability to look into something like the gas plant scandal will disappear. We’ve been told by the government, “Well, this new company will have auditors.

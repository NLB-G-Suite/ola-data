  "text" : [ "First, I’ll be splitting my time with the great member from Leeds–Grenville. It is my pleasure to rise today to speak to Bill 173, the budget measures act or, as the government likes to call it, the Jobs for Today and Tomorrow Act.", "Mr. Speaker, I read the title because that’s exactly where I want to start today, the jobs of today and tomorrow. Before I do that, it’s important not to forget the jobs of the past. There are more than 350,000 manufacturing jobs lost under this government—the thousands of people working in the mining and forestry sectors in the north, or the thousands of nurses and health care workers let go because of the negligent freeze on hospital spending.", "Even within that context, the government has the nerve to table a budget talking about jobs of today and tomorrow. But let’s look at the jobs of today. I direct your attention to page 247 of the budget document, Mr. Speaker. There it shows the newly adjusted job creation forecasts for the coming year. This budget revealed that the province will see 76,000 fewer jobs—fewer jobs—created between 2015 and 2019 than they thought last year. Further, page 246 reads “weaker-than-expected employment growth” until 2019.", "Ce n’est pas seulement que moins d’emplois seront créés, c’est la perte d’emplois qui existent déjà.", "The Ontario Retirement Pension Plan is slated to force 54,000 Ontarians to lose their jobs in the next few years. That’s not fear mongering, Mr. Speaker. That’s straight from the Ministry of Finance’s own internal documents.", "Que ce soit le Régime de retraite de la province de l’Ontario, le nouveau système de plafonnement et d’échange qui prend de l’argent, dont je parlerai bientôt, ou les hausses des frais d’énergie, la vie est plus difficile sous ce gouvernement, et il pousse les emplois hors de la province.", "The budget may be called Jobs for Today and Tomorrow, but it’s really a clever way of saying that jobs that exist today won’t tomorrow.", "It is that very concern that I have for workers and families in Ontario that brings me to our party’s three budget asks.", "Ce sont des simples demandes que nous pensons que les gens de l’Ontario méritent de voir dans le budget mais que le gouvernement a choisi d’ignorer.", "(1) Include a credible plan to make energy more affordable and to stop the fire sale of Hydro One.", "(2) Stop the damaging cuts to our health care system in this province and properly manage health care.", "(3) Include a credible plan—not a stretch goal, a credible plan—to balance the budget, including immediate action to pay down the debt; a debt, I remind you, of a staggering $308 billion.", "But, when the Minister of Finance was asked what he thought about these three budget asks, he said, “That’s quite a fiscal fantasy world.” I don’t think an Ontario where residents can afford to pay their hydro bills is a fantasy world. I don’t think a properly funded health care system, and a properly managed health care system to boot, is an impossible task for this government. And I surely don’t think a balanced budget is lunacy.", "We asked for a credible plan to make energy more affordable; instead, we got $2 a month worth of energy rebates coming from the cap-and-trade money collected from the very people who will get the rebate. It’s a classic bait and switch—not to mention the fact that hydro bills went up roughly $100 January 1. This new rebate won’t even cover the last Liberal hydro hike. That’s not a credible plan.", "We asked for a properly managed health care system. We’ve continued to say that the Liberal government’s history of scandal, waste and mismanagement is taking funds away from essential services. This budget is no exception. This budget fails to reverse current and planned cuts to doctors, nurses and hospitals, all at the expense of patients. Not only are there no plans for more funding for long-term-care beds, which could help manage the system better, or for restoring funding for physiotherapy for seniors when we’ve seen falls spike at long-term-care facilities, but this budget also makes medication more unaffordable for most seniors.", "We asked for a credible plan when it comes to dealing with having a balanced budget. Budget 2016 is simply a laughable response to that demand. They took $850 million out of the rainy day contingency fund to reduce the deficit. Over $1.1 billion was taken from the Hydro One revenue, which, by the way, the government had said again and again was for infrastructure. And the one-time $2.6-billion departure tax on the Hydro One sale was used against the deficit, despite the fact that the government said a hundred times that it was being used for infrastructure.", "Mr. Speaker, the future plan needs better planning. We need a government that sees the big picture. The government claims they’re on track to balance the budget by 2017-18, but they also claim that they’ll bring in $4 billion more in revenue than the Financial Accountability Officer said was even possible under best case scenarios. Let me stress that: The office that the government created to verify their figures so the public can have confidence in their figures—that independent oversight—is saying that their numbers are wrong. It is saying that the government’s numbers are $4 billion rosier in revenue than they should be. That should be astonishing to everyone in Ontario, because it says that the government’s numbers don’t add up. And if I’m going to trust someone—the Financial Accountability Officer, a non-partisan oversight office, or the Minister of Finance, who has a history of making mistakes on his numbers—I’m going to trust the Financial Accountability Officer.", "This budget is simply another Liberal tax-and-grab. The budget forecasts an additional $3 billion in tax revenue alone: $1.9 billion in personal income taxes, $700 million in corporate taxes and $500 million through cap and trade. Doesn’t this government ever get tired of imposing new taxes and taking more from Ontarians? If the tax increases weren’t enough, this budget increases virtually every other government service fee. Fees for driver and vehicle licensing are going up. The price of cigarettes and wine will increase. Camping in provincial parks and fishing and hunting licences just got more expensive. Everything from liquor licences to even event permits for charities will cost more. It’s that easy: This budget makes life more expensive for everything; this budget makes life harder for Ontario. It’s for all these reasons the PC Party has serious problems with this Liberal budget.", "Les chiffres ne correspondent pas. C’est de la fumée et des miroirs à son meilleur.", "All we requested was a budget that did what Ontarians expect, want and deserve. Ontarians expect a government to look after their tax dollars, not squander them on everything from gas plants to computer systems. Ontarians want a government that makes life more affordable, not harder. And Ontarians deserve to see the whole picture. When I say “the whole picture,” I’m referring to the asterisk that hangs over every Liberal promise in this budget.", "The Liberal government will tell you that the budget funds for health care are unfrozen, showing that hospitals get $345 million in new funding, but that’s not the whole picture. Hospital budgets have been frozen for the last four years despite more patients—150,000 new patients—and inflation.", "Dans ma circonscription de Simcoe-Nord, Orillia Soldiers’ Memorial Hospital a dû réduire le nombre de lits de soins continus, éliminer son hôpital de jour gériatrique et couper 20 infirmières à temps plein.", "In fact, the Ontario Nurses’ Association details that 770 nurses were cut—lost their jobs—by this government in 2015 alone. As a result, patient care is suffering.", "But it’s not just the past that needs to be discussed. Every give in this budget comes with a take. I’ll be very specific about what I mean when I say that every give in this budget comes with a take. The health care take is on page 289—the government wanted to hide it and make sure that no one noticed it. Page 289 quietly shows hospital revenue from gaming—$107 million that hospitals depended on—gone. The changes to hospital parking: Although providing much relief to patients, and we applaud the help to families, hospitals lose $28 million. It’s just switching envelopes. It’s smoke and mirrors.", "So when the Liberals say they have increased funding for hospitals by $345 million, what they’re really saying is that they’ve increased it by $210 million despite a much more significant demand. While I applaud them for breaking their self-imposed funding freeze on the health care system in Ontario, this is simply a band-aid solution. It’s not dealing with the better management that we have been suggesting is needed in the health care system.", "Nous avons besoin de plus qu’une solution pansement pour améliorer l’état sombre des soins aux patients dans cette province.", "Mr. Speaker, it’s not just hospitals that are being duped; it’s seniors, too. This budget announces that the shingles vaccine will be free for those between the ages of 65 and 70. If you’re in that age bracket, that’s great news; if you’re not, too bad. But it’s not just age limits that are penalizing seniors in this budget; it’s also the ability to pay for their much-needed medications that keep them healthy and out of the hospital. For seniors in the Ontario Drug Benefit Program, their deductible will increase by $70, nearly double, unless they are low-income. What’s low-income to this government? A senior making under $19,000 is low-income. The notion that a senior making $19,500 can afford these exorbitant increases in their medications, the fact that this government thinks a senior making $19,500 is affluent and rich is just ridiculous. The Premier has already acknowledged that this threshold was far too low.", "Peut-être que si le gouvernement libéral avait consulté les Ontariens sur le budget, ils auraient réalisé cela plus tôt, mais je vais revenir sur ça plus tard.", "Back to seniors, Mr. Speaker: Not only will they have to pay nearly twice what they’ve been paying now as a deductible but they’re also going to have to pay an extra dollar every time they get a prescription filled. Seniors don’t have a choice but to take their medication. We’re not talking about efficiencies or buzzwords; we’re talking about the health of our elderly. Government should be there to take care of those who need our help and make their lives easier, not more unaffordable.", "This government claims the shingles vaccine will give some seniors a one-time $170 savings, but they fail to mention that most seniors will be paying a minimum of $70 a year more for drugs plus an extra dollar for every prescription. This government has made life harder for the vast, vast majority of seniors.", "And it’s not just the cost of prescription drugs that is increasing. Seniors are already being hit with high hydro rates, especially those who have more serious conditions that require assistance to help them enjoy life. For example, should a senior who has poor circulation and has to keep their heat up be paying more for that heat? Should a senior with an at-home dialysis machine be paying peak rates? Health care can’t be turned on and off whenever it’s convenient for the government.", "But it’s not just energy rates or drug costs, Mr. Speaker. This government took it a step further by cancelling the Healthy Homes Renovation Tax Credit used by seniors to make their homes more accessible. So, sure, some seniors may save $170 on a free shingles vaccine, but every senior in Ontario will lose on renovations, prescription drugs and energy costs. The moral of the story is: If you’re a senior in Ontario, your costs are going up because of this Liberal government.", "Comme je le disais plus tôt, chaque chose donnée est livrée avec une « prise ». Ce budget, tout simplement, va rendre la vie plus difficile pour les personnes âgées de l’Ontario.", "Whether it’s seniors or health care funding, the government isn’t telling the whole story. It’s the same thing when it comes to the hallmark of their budget 2016: free tuition, as they call it, for students from families with under $50,000 in annual income. Mr. Speaker, our party supports increased access to post-secondary institutions, as everyone would. Easier access to education is a noble goal to pursue. The reality is that students in Ontario are already faced with the highest tuition rates in Canada. I repeat, students in Ontario are faced with the highest tuition rates in Canada, and 70%—70%—of the families are not eligible for the full benefit.", "While Ontario students should be able to choose a career path that best suits them, there are certainly skills gap challenges needed for the jobs of today and tomorrow, and this government doesn’t address it. We must address the skills gap, which is costing Ontario’s economy $24.3 billion a year in forgone revenue and is forcing young Ontarians out of the province to find work.", "I read one survey that said 52% of engineering and infrastructure firms have to hire young people from outside Ontario because we don’t graduate them here. This government is not willing to have that conversation. How about graduating young people for the jobs that exist in Ontario today?", "When I speak about the full picture, whether it be on health care, jobs or deficit reduction, I truly believe the government should have understood the people of Ontario better. And they would have, if they’d actually listened—if the pre-budget consultations weren’t simply for show.", "This government had the audacity to tour around the province—mind you, on taxpayer dollars—to hear concerns from concerned Ontarians without even waiting for that committee to produce a report on its findings. It’s unbelievable that they would use taxpayer dollars to go out and listen, and never bother to let the committee write the report. It’s shameful. We all know that this budget had to be written well in advance. After all, it’s 340 pages and had to be translated into French. That means that for it to be have been ready on February 25, it would have had to have been completed weeks before.", "What about the feedback that this budget should be have been informed by? What about that consultation? This government is slow to act on many issues, yet they’re telling us that on the most important document of the year they were unable to reflect and hear the concerns that they said mattered to them—so hypocritical.", "C’est évident que ce budget a été imprimé sans les opinions des Ontariens à l’esprit.", "I’ve knocked on countless doors and visited every corner of this province and I’ve never heard a single Ontarian, in my riding of Simcoe North or elsewhere, say that they want seniors to pay more for prescription drugs. I’ve never met a single Ontarian who said that they want the government to announce action on the Ring of Fire three separate times but never actually spend a dollar on the project. I’ve never met a single Ontarian who says that they want our province’s debt levels to be beyond $300 billion. Mr. Speaker, this government is truly out of touch with the people of Ontario.", "However, we in the PC caucus are listening to Ontarians relentlessly. In fact, at our convention this weekend, we will be launching our policy process. We plan to go to every corner of the province and listen—not listen for show like the government does, but listen to engage the grassroots, to engage stakeholders, to engage individuals on the front lines. That’s what real leadership is about. It’s about treating the people of Ontario with respect and attention. It’s about taking their concerns to Queen’s Park and advocating for the constituents who put you there.", "Je suis fier de dire que notre parti prendra en compte les points de vue réels des gens de l’Ontario, pas seulement les vues de quelques initiés libéraux qui veulent prendre soin de leur propre survie politique.", "That being said, if I may, I want to go back to the fiscal situation of the province. We have a debt that has eclipsed $300 billion for the first time in the history of any province in Canada. It’s scary—not just Ontario, but any province. In fact, we’re the most indebted state or province in the world. It’s astonishing. That is their legacy to future generations." ],

We pay roughly $11.8 billion in interest payments alone. That’s almost $1 billion a month in interest payments. That’s more than we spend on our colleges or universities, which are apparently Liberal priorities, but they’ve removed the ability to support them. It’s more than we spend on our children and youth or agriculture. It is 22 times more than we spend on the environment.", "We need to get our debt and deficit under control. We need a province that has its fiscal house in order so that we can fully invest in the things that Ontario need—not just band-aid solutions to systemic problems; I’m talking about efforts to improve the errors in the system, to improve our transportation corridors and to create less red tape. We have 354,000 regulations. We are the capital of red tape in Canada.", "We need to have affordable energy so we can create an environment where businesses can flourish, where we can create jobs, where if you’re an investor, you want to be in Ontario. We can’t waste $11.8 billion a year on one hand and expect to have money to support the services Ontarians need and deserve on the other. When we are wasting that much money a year on interest payments, it’s unacceptable. It has left no room—no room—to support the social infrastructure of our province. This province is left with no choice but to turn to new taxes and sources of revenue, and that’s what we see in this budget.", "Whether it’s toll roads on lanes and highways that people and families in Ontario have already paid for, or whether it’s the new cap-and-trade cash grab that doesn’t even contain guarantees that the money will actually go to reducing emissions, it’s getting to be too much. It’s not just the income taxes and corporate taxes I referred to earlier that the government is taking more in on; it’s increased taxes on a bottle of wine, and the reduction of several important tax credits—because the notion of giving Ontarians a break is not something this government would entertain.", "Specifically on cap and trade, Mr. Speaker, I don’t know of anyone who trusts this government to invest $1.9 billion in emission-reducing technology. They have no track record of raising revenue for the proper purposes. They had the health levy, which was the largest tax in Ontario’s history. It didn’t go to health care; it didn’t go to supporting our hospitals. It went to pay for waste and mismanagement.", "Climate change is a serious issue that requires a serious response from the government. There is no question about that. But this government has not presented Ontarians with a credible plan to tackle climate change. It’s simply photo op environmentalism. Instead, this cap-and-trade cash grab will finance a new Liberal slush fund that lacks any accountability.", "While Ontarians are willing to do their part to reduce emissions, it’s wrong of this government to raise money in the name of the environment, taking advantage of Ontarians’ goodwill on the environment, goodwill in wanting to tackle climate change, simply to be what they call another revenue tool or, as I call it, a cash grab on the backs of Ontario families.", "This is the same government that handed out billions in grants, through the Ministry of Economic Development to businesses to create jobs. But they didn’t actually keep track of the jobs; that would get in the way of their slush fund. Many businesses, because of Ontario’s skyrocketing hydro rates, had to leave this province with that money in hand, the ones that actually got grants. If they can’t hand out money to create jobs properly, why would anyone think they can hand out money to reduce emissions properly? They have no track record on this. They have no one’s confidence that they can get this right.", "Despite this glaring fact, home heating and gasoline are going up 4.3 cents a litre—which will cost Ontarians $400 a year and another roughly $450 a year in home heating costs. That’s almost $900 for the average Ontario family. If we’re going to pay this type of money to fight climate change, it had better actually be going to fight climate change.", "Needless to say, we in the PC Party have some serious concerns with the Liberal track record. This money cannot—I repeat, cannot—be used to pay for past scandals, whether it’s gas plants, eHealth or Ornge. This cannot be a revenue tool to make up for this government’s incompetence. We will call the government out on it.", "That is what this comes down to: It comes down to trust in this government. Throughout my remarks and throughout this budget, we can see that the people of Ontario do not trust this government to get it right.", "In the last few weeks, they realized they built a train storage shed too small and that their airport express train was too expensive for the average Ontarian to afford. Sometimes it’s the little things that are indicative of how this government manages our affairs.", "But the direction of the province and the 2016 budget is no small thing. This is a critical document. This budget is too important to trust to a government that has been under investigation by the OPP on four different occasions.", "Il est trop important pour faire confiance à un gouvernement rempli de scandales, de gaspillage, et de mauvaise gestion. Il est clair que les libéraux rendront la vie plus difficile pour les gens de l’Ontario.", "The PC Party won’t stand for that, and they certainly won’t stand for a budget that has contents that aren’t in the best interest of Ontario.", "In closing, I want to return to the title, Jobs for Today and Tomorrow.", "Il est clair que la direction des libéraux pour l’Ontario ne mènera pas à une augmentation d’emplois et d’investissements dans cette province.", "Why? It’s simple. The title of the budget is just like the contents within: It doesn’t tell the whole story. This is the budget of smoke and mirrors. The title doesn’t tell you everything you need to know. So when the people of Ontario, who are smarter than the government gives them credit for, voice their displeasure with this budget and its programs, we’ll be here to listen. We will be here to reflect their frustrations, to reflect on the Liberal mistakes, and to ultimately fix them. That’s what real leadership is.", "In the meantime, I’d encourage the members opposite to take off their rose-coloured glasses for just a moment and see what this budget really is. Again, the budget may be called the Jobs for Today and Tomorrow Act, but it’s really a clever way of saying that the jobs that exist today won’t be here tomorrow if we have more of this government." ],

It’s a real privilege for me to rise and share our caucus’ lead-off debate on the government’s budget motion with my leader, Patrick Brown.", "Off the top, I want to commend my leader; my seatmate, the member from Nipissing; and our entire Ontario PC caucus for their work this week on behalf of Ontarians in exposing the government.", "The caucus has done a tremendous job showing that there’s more to this budget than the headlines the government is trying to spin. I know from my days in the newspaper business that there’s always a story beneath the headline. As we’ve shown, despite the grand pronouncements that this government has made, the real story in the budget is not good news for retired Ontarians on a fixed income. It’s not good news for students or the 350,000 people who have lost a manufacturing job on this government’s watch, or, quite frankly, for anyone in need of a doctor, or in hope of trying to find improved health care services for a loved one, or families that are desperate to get a break on their hydro bill so they can make ends meet. For every item the government claims is in there to help, there are increased taxes, increased fees and deep service cuts that more than offset any gains.", "In the end, a full reading of the budget, beyond its headline of Jobs for Today and Tomorrow, leads to just one conclusion: This government continues to make life more unaffordable for Ontarians.", "Frankly, I would argue that Premier Wynne has reached the same conclusion. Well, she has at least with one item in the budget. She’s already made a major flip-flop this week on the budget’s plan to nearly double the deductible on prescription drugs for most seniors. Perhaps in the finance minister’s rush to get the budget to print, even before public consultation was ongoing, the Premier didn’t have a chance to actually read the budget. It gives me a new take on that old line that the government likes to use on opposition politicians every year at budget time: I guess the Premier was in favour of the budget before she actually read it.", "I can tell you, when I was in the lockup and I found what the budget had in store for seniors on prescription drug costs, I was absolutely against it. I knew that seniors all across my riding—in Toledo, in Lyndhurst, in Maynard, in Oxford Mills, Prescott and Cardinal—would be outraged. I knew it. I knew it because they told me the struggles that they were having, the struggles to make ends meet, to keep up with the rising cost of life under this government. Only a government so out of touch with the day-to-day struggles of Ontarians, stretching their household budgets tighter and tighter, would consider a senior making $19,300 to be well off—only a government that out of touch. This is such a disconnect that this Premier has, who actually likes to show—she likes to make a lot of pronouncements that she wants to have conversations, but she doesn’t actually listen to what the people are saying to her.", "When the Premier found out that her own budget hiked the deductible for the Ontario drug benefit by $70 a year, do you know what she did? She didn’t apologize and promise to fix it. No. She promised to consult more to see if she got it right. That’s all she did.", "First off, given the sham that the budget timeline made of the pre-budget consultation process, I’m not sure too many seniors will be eager to consult with this government. Really, if this Premier is so disconnected from reality that she needs to check with seniors to see if she got it right in raising the low-income threshold to $19,300, as our leader said, that’s absolutely ridiculous.", "The issue of drug costs is just one example of something that you see in every section of budget 2016. It’s the same theme over and over again: There’s something shiny to attract attention in hopes Ontarians won’t notice what’s really going on. As I stated earlier, they want to distract your attention. They don’t want you to take the time to look.", "Again, I just want to compliment my caucus for exposing some of these issues this week. They’ve done a tremendous job.", "For seniors, the headline the government wants you to read is “Free Shingles Vaccine.” The real story you need to read in the budget is the hike in drug prices and the loss of the Healthy Homes Renovation Tax Credit.", "For students, the government’s headline is “Free Tuition.” The real story: It’s two years away; it only applies to about 30% of students and covers only the average tuition and no other costs; and the government is taking away $165 million in financial support until it kicks in.", "For hospitals, the government proclaims a 1% budget increase. The real story is, it’s the first increase, as we all know, that hospitals have had in four years. It doesn’t provide any catch-up, and almost one third of that increase—", "Interjection." ],

I’ll get to that problem and the glaring oversight on the agriculture file a little later in my speech.", "I’m so proud of our work on this side of the House in the past week to expose, as my leader said earlier, this bait and switch budget.", "I want to put some comments on the record for some of my folks in Leeds–Grenville. Prior to the return of the Legislature, I had the opportunity to hear from some of my constituents. I held a series of pre-budget consultations in very small communities in my riding. Over two days, I held meetings in Gananoque, Seeley’s Bay, Merrickville and Spencerville. They were excellent discussions. I ended up sending six pages of recommendations to both the finance minister and the Standing Committee on Finance and Economic Affairs. We know those recommendations were ignored by the government. We know this because, as my leader said this morning, the budget was already drafted by the time I sent my letter to the committee—and I sent it before the deadline. It’s clear what was being ignored, because the priorities I heard from people in my riding, in particular in rural Ontario, were certainly not reflected in this budget. I don’t think anyone would describe this budget as a rural Ontario-friendly budget.", "Even if the government ultimately tuned out the recommendations from my constituents, those meetings were really valuable to me. I found real value in having those four meetings and being able to be engaged with my constituents. It gave me the confidence to know that when I’m speaking here today, I’m speaking for the people that I represent when I stand in my place to tell the government that their priorities are wrong.", "The budget speaks to infrastructure commitments but does nothing to address the concerns raised by local mayors and local council members at my consultation. They asked for a review of what they describe as the arbitrary manner in which grant program applications are reviewed for municipalities. It leads to a scenario where one municipality is turned down because they’re carrying too much debt while the neighbouring township loses out because they don’t have enough debt.", "I think it’s like the Goldilocks approach to infrastructure: Municipalities are supposed to somehow get it just right for this government before they actually get a dime from them for their infrastructure. Instead of a lottery, these municipal leaders wanted some substantive changes to the process in the budget so they could better plan for their own spending.", "Also in the break, I had a chance to have a wonderful speaking opportunity at a breakfast meeting of the Brockville and District Chamber of Commerce. It was a well-attended event. It also gave me a chance to talk about two reports from the Ontario Chamber of Commerce, their Emerging Stronger 2016 report and Empowering Ontario, which they released last year.", "Now, I’d like to think a government interested in kick-starting our economy and getting Ontario back to work would actually pay attention to some of those reports. Look at the chamber of commerce: They represent 60,000 small and medium-sized businesses. Those, I think, are who we need to engage to get our engine of job creation started again in the province of Ontario.", "One of my favourite parts of the Emerging Stronger report is the Ontario Business Confidence Index. It provides some real insight into what these businesses are feeling as we head into the new year. As I told my chamber, the results for 2016 are not encouraging, and they reflect a clear desire by the business community to see our province go in a different direction. Actually, there’s quite a disconnect in the confidence index. On one hand, it’s encouraging to learn—here’s the statistic: 62% of those surveyed expressed confidence in their business’s economic outlook. That’s slightly up from about 58% last year. It’s a positive sign that businesses feel good about what they’ve done internally to position themselves for growth.", "Unfortunately, that’s where the good news ends. When it comes to expressing confidence in Ontario’s economy, just 30% like what they see going into 2016. It’s down from 47% last year. It’s actually quite a shocking decrease in just a 12-month period. Frankly, it’s a condemnation of this government’s performance. And with that lack of confidence, it’s no surprise that the survey revealed only 46% of businesses have plans to expand in 2016. That’s down from 54% last year: Again, it’s headed in the wrong direction.", "What should be the take-away for us as legislators on this report? When nearly two thirds of our businesses feel good about the situation but they’re hedging their bets on Ontario, that’s a message that the government’s budget needs to do something different.", "The reason businesses lack confidence in our economy is the result of what’s happened on this government’s watch over the past 13 years. Sadly, more of the same is found within the pages of the budget we’re debating this morning. There’s not much here to inspire confidence in Ontario. Heck, the government isn’t even inspired; they’ve reduced their own job creation projections by 16% over last year. Last year, they boasted our economy would create 93,000 jobs in 2016. Now that number is down to 78,000. I always say that well-run businesses want to invest in well-run jurisdictions, and as we know, the words “well run” are two words I don’t think you’d ever use to describe Ontario under the Liberal Party.", "Our leader outlined in his portion of this morning’s leadoff the three asks that our PC caucus wanted to see in the government’s budget. I think he did a great job outlining them so I’m not going to go into detail on them again. One of those asks was a credible plan to balance the budget. It goes to the very heart of that reluctance businesses surveyed by the Ontario chamber have when it comes to investing here and creating jobs. They’re not going to be fooled by the so-called plan to eliminate the deficit by 2017-18 tabled by the finance minister last week. These businesses wouldn’t try to build their own budget by overestimating revenues as this government has done to the tune of $4 billion. For those watching at home, that’s not our caucus saying they’ve overestimated what they’ll take in; that’s in the words of the Legislature’s Financial Accountability Officer.", "Then we have the inevitable $1.9-billion increase in personal income taxes factored into the government’s calculations. The rest of their so-called plan is cobbled together using $850 million from a provincial contingency fund and, confirming what we’ve been saying all along, taking revenue from the sell-off of Hydro One. As I told the chamber that morning, any business owner knows you can’t fix your bottom line by selling off your business assets. Eventually, you’re going to run out of things to sell. That’s what’s truly amazing here, Speaker.", "Interjections." ],

  "text" : [ "They get mad over there when we expose the truth.", "For all the wishful thinking, tax grabbing and asset selling contained in this budget, it still doesn’t solve the problem with all that red ink. That’s because we now have a structural deficit, one they’ve managed to paper over with some one-time infusions of cash. As a result, we’re still going to watch this year as the province’s total debt climbs past the $300-billion mark for the first time, on its way to a staggering $308 billion. To put that into perspective, Speaker, that’s $22,103 for every man, every woman and every child in this province. And unfortunately, it’s growing. It’s shameful.", "I can tell you that improving the confidence of our business sector and recruiting new ones to come here doesn’t start with being the world’s most indebted subnational. That means, even if the deficit is eliminated, interest payments on our debt remain the third-largest spending item in this budget. As I told the president of St. Lawrence College, Glenn Vollebregt, when he was at my speech at the Brockville chamber, how do you build a workforce for tomorrow when the budget for training, colleges and universities is $3.6 billion less than interest on the debt?", "You don’t inspire confidence by refusing to get serious about the soaring cost of electricity in this province. I mentioned earlier the Ontario chamber’s Empowering Ontario report. I know the Minister of Energy likes to debunk any criticisms and concerns we raise about how the cost of electricity is driving businesses and industry out of the province and people from their homes. I want people to understand we’re not responding to information. The opposition is not just simply making this up, Speaker. Our questions and concerns about Hydro One and the cost of electricity are based on reports from the Auditor General, the Financial Accountability Officer and the Ombudsman. Those are all independent, non-partisan officers of this Legislature, and they’ve exposed mismanagement of the energy sector and have let Ontarians know that rates are going to rise, as we’ve said many times in this House, 42% between 2013 and 2018. Remember, that’s on top of the already highest rates in North America.", "It’s those increases, Speaker, that the Ontario chamber’s study found will lead to the following—here’s a quote from their report: “One in 20 businesses in the province expect to close their doors in the next five years due to rising electricity prices. In addition, 38% will see their bottom line shrink, with the cost of electricity delaying or cancelling investment in the years to come.”", "Again, you’d think that an independent report like the one from the chamber would lead the government to provide cost relief in the electricity sector, and it should be in this budget. Instead, homeowners got nothing other than, basically—we’ve said it in the House—a $2-a-month reduction. It pales in comparison to the $100 increase that they’re facing because of rates. In terms of small business and industry, they don’t even get that. This budget offers no relief; it just offers more of the same. The take-away is that the government is happy to watch those businesses surveyed by the chamber close their doors and throw more people out of work.", "I just want to take a moment to speak to something that really shocked me in regard to this report. It was the Minister of Energy’s response to the chamber of commerce Empowering Ontario report. The executive director of the chamber in Brockville, Pam Robertson, wrote to me for feedback on the report. She included a letter that the minister gave the chamber as part of this correspondence. Here’s how he opened his response to the Ontario chamber on their survey and recommendations: “Many of the key aspects of electricity planning and system management were not captured in your report.” That sounds to me a lot like his response to the Auditor General. He patted the chamber on the head and said, “This is too complicated for you people to understand.” I wrote back to my chamber, “I’d suggest the Ontario chamber and the 60,000 businesses it represents do understand the issue well—because their members are footing an increasingly larger bill for the decisions this government is making.” It was unbelievable to see that that was Bob Chiarelli’s response.", "I want to now turn to something about the budget that is of great concern to the folks back home in Leeds–Grenville. That, of course, is that the budget absolutely ignores the rural communities and the province’s agricultural sector. Actually, I should correct my record. We would be better off if they ignored ag instead of cutting the budget by $28 million.", "That cut to OMAFRA’s budget is from the same government, remember, whose Premier in 2013 challenged Ontario’s agri-food sector to create 120,000 new jobs by 2020—the same Premier who, a year after issuing that challenge, stood by as the University of Guelph closed the agricultural colleges in Kemptville and Alfred two years ago this month. They’ve since put no real money on the table to ensure the continued delivery of the agriculture degree and diploma programs at those colleges.", "Look, I respect and applaud the work of the municipality of North Grenville and what they’re trying to do to revitalize the Kemptville campus. But I maintain today, as I have since March 12, 2014, when the closure of Kemptville College was announced, that those degree and diploma programs must be brought back. That’s the only way to do it. It’s not just to ensure that the campus has a future—but a guarantee that we’re producing the educated graduates in agri-food in Ontario that we need, to compete in that global economy. But there’s nothing in the budget for those programs, which are so vital to helping the agri-food sector meet the Premier’s 120,000-job challenge.", "On the electricity front, rural Ontarians are hit the hardest by the soaring costs of hydro, because they pay higher delivery charges. But again, the OFA’s request for a farm industrial rate was ignored in the budget. I guess that 120,000-job challenge from the Premier was just another one of her stretch goals.", "As for our agriculture critic, the member for Haldimand–Norfolk, he noted in a question this week to the minister that there’s just one reference to agriculture in the budget. It’s on page 346, the very last page of the document—almost an afterthought, I might suggest to the House today. But I was quite intrigued by the reference, because it concerns value-added farm activities and the property taxes that penalize farmers for investing in them. When a farmer, for instance, wants to create a product from what’s produced on the farm, the portion of their property used for that activity is taxed at the industrial rate. Talk about a disincentive for the farmer.", "I raised this issue in question period and a late show in November 2013, in relation to a pair of farm operations in Leeds–Grenville: Bushgarden Farmstead Cheese in Rideau Lakes, and Edgewood Farms in Elizabethtown-Kitley. I told the story then, Speaker, of Nigel Smith, the artisan cheese maker, and what he went through to finally get his operation off the ground so he could start making world-class cheeses. It’s an incredible story of perseverance. Nigel spent three and a half years fighting this government’s red tape to make it happen. When the big day finally came and he did put out that “open for business” sign, the first person down the laneway wasn’t a customer. It was MPAC, with news that his artisan operation was being classified as industrial and he’d be paying an additional $1,200 in property taxes.", "Over at Edgewood Farms, Terry and Dave McGurrin were forced to close their pancake house due to harassment by MPAC. They demanded they pay year-round commercial taxes for a six-week operation. And if that wasn’t enough, MPAC showed up after the pancake house was shut down, to grill Terry about why she still owned a cash register.", "This disgusting treatment of value-added farm activities by MPAC is something I’ve been sounding off on for about two years.", "But even after all that time, budget 2016 is a disappointment because it doesn’t outline how the problem is actually going to get fixed. No, all the agri-food sector gets is a promise—another promise—to try to work out the solution.", "I’d like to pick up the phone and make a phone call to both Nigel Smith and the McGurrins. I’m hopeful a solution is coming, but I know this government all too well, Speaker. Frankly, even if I did make the call, I don’t think they’d believe me, with this government.", "On this file, I challenge the government: Follow through on your word. Don’t just put empty rhetoric in the budget. Actually move forward in the agri-food sector and recognize these on-farm-premise operations.", "Speaker, the lead this morning by my leader talked about this government’s waste, their mismanagement and their scandal on a scale that I think is just unprecedented in our province’s history. Billions are wasted on gas plants, eHealth, Ornge, SAMS and, up next, a carbon tax scheme that promises to be this government’s latest debacle.", "As I said in the media after the budget was tabled last week, what worries me is that this government has no idea how their plan will reduce carbon emissions. They can’t tell us anything about it. But what they’ve got all revved up, Speaker, are the details that they’re going to add 4.3 cents a litre to the cost of gasoline, which is so typical of this government—to figure out how to separate people from their money first and then worry about everything else after.", "I heard the parliamentary assistant to the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change mention this week how he hopes that the increased cost of gas will lead more people to ride their bicycles to work. I’ll be sure, this weekend, to share his advice with the folks in my riding who commute from Brockville to Ottawa or to Kingston to work. That’s the kind of advice you get from a government that tables a budget that continues to grow the a debt that has increased by 91% in a decade.", "Think about it for a moment, about having someone try to commute in a rural riding where there’s no infrastructure there to be able to support that. Think about the mismanagement of this government—so reckless that a $139-billion debt when they took over in 2003 has ballooned to $308 billion. Even a moderate level of incompetence over that time would leave more of that $11.7 billion in interest payments to go towards front-line services.", "We hear government members always heckling us in opposition that we want it both ways. They say we want to balance the books while asking for improved hospital and home care services, more affordable electricity and investments in our rural communities. But it’s not an either/or proposition. We can do both, but only if we have a government that understands how to manage this province in the best interests of Ontarians—not the kind of government Ontario has today. They don’t make life easier for Ontarians, particularly for those of us who live with a rural postal code.", "This budget offers more proof that life is harder under the Liberals. But there is some good news: People are getting wise to this government, and increasingly we’re hearing from every corner of the province that Ontarians won’t be fooled again." ],

They all oppose this government’s short-sighted sell-off of Hydro One. It’s something I’ve heard across my community, from doorstep to town halls. Ontarians are sending the message loud and clear that they don’t want the Premier to sell Hydro One, but she isn’t listening.", "Fortunately, people in Oshawa don’t give up that easily. I hold in my hand here 70 letters that I’ve received from people in Oshawa and the Durham region, and they’re calling on the Premier to stop the sale of Hydro One. They all share the same message: “I did not give you permission to sell Hydro One or any other public utility or publicly owned asset on my behalf.”", "Let’s not forget, Speaker, what “public” means. The Premier has taken it to mean “government property for her to do with as she pleases,” but I have 70 letters here that disagree, and there are thousands more across the province that are fighting tooth and nail as well. It’s an important message, one that the Premier should hear.", "Since these letters are addressed to the Premier, I will ask that a page please put these 70 letters on her desk because I want to make sure that she receives them. The people of Ontario have spoken. The people of Oshawa have spoken. Let’s hope that the Premier decides to listen." ],

In the late 1940s, Ms. Jaworska studied painting at the Polish State Academy of Fine Art in Lodz. She was awarded a master’s degree and then went on to teach at that school for many years.", "In 1969, Ms. Jaworska and her husband, Tad Jaworski, a noted filmmaker, immigrated to Toronto to escape censorship and repression by the communist regime in Poland. As a new Canadian, she found inspiration in Canadian nature and landscape, and created abstract and realistic compositions. One of her most notable works, called the “Unity of Canada” tapestry, was hung in the Place Bell Canada lobby in Ottawa. Her artistic legacy has been displayed in museums, Canadian embassies, galleries and private collections in Canada and across the world.", "Ms. Jaworska was elected a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts, a prestigious opponent to the centre national de tapisserie d’Aubusson in Paris, and she is a member of the Order of Canada.

There, Syrian refugees come to the hub to find free household items, clothing, school supplies and other necessities that make settling here in Canada that much easier. The hub is staffed and supplied entirely by local volunteers, many of whom are local members and families, and every item in the store is either donated or purchased with donated funds.

It is important that people in our cities and towns know about the vital role that Ontario’s agri-food sector plays in their everyday lives. Supporting our agri-food sector is a key priority for our government. We’re working with our industry partners to ensure that our farmers and food processers continue to be successful and that Ontarians know the important role they play in making the province’s economy strong and, indeed, competitive.", "I want to take a moment to recognize some of our dedicated partners who are building awareness on the importance of our agriculture and food system. With support from our government, organizations like Ontario Agri-Food Education have made it their mission to teach students about farming and where their food comes from. Last year alone, Ontario Agri-Food Education teacher ambassadors delivered 185 interactive classroom lessons focusing on a variety of agricultural and food themes across Ontario.", "Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss if I didn’t recognize the honourable member for Huron–Bruce, in terms of promotion of agriculture education and literacy related to her private member’s bill that she introduced in this Legislature some time ago.", "They also offer student tours, education exhibits and workshops to help students gain knowledge and understanding of agri-food topics. These teacher ambassadors also support events and organizations through classroom lessons, student tours, education exhibits and workshops.", "I also want to thank Farm and Food Care Ontario, an organization that runs a number of innovative programs and workshops to help raise local food awareness by connecting farmers to non-farming audiences.", "I also want to thank the Dietitians of Canada and the Ontario Fruit and Vegetable Growers’ Association for helping to raise awareness of local food among students through the Fresh from the Farm initiative. Since 2013, nearly 300 schools have participated in this very innovative program, helping schools raise funds by selling local apples, carrots, onions and potatoes within their communities, just like my community of Peterborough, while teaching children about where the produce comes from. Last year was bigger than ever, with students selling more than 465,000 pounds of Ontario produce, nearly triple the volume from a year earlier. I can’t wait to see how the program continues to grow in 2016.", "Mr. Speaker, a big part of agricultural literacy week and a priority of our government is promoting the healthy, high-quality food that Ontarians have access to right here in Ontario. Our government recognizes this need, and it introduced and passed the Local Food Act in order to support and celebrate the hard work of Ontario farmers and to make it easier for Ontarians to choose local food wherever they are. We need to educate and encourage young Ontarians to embrace fresh, seasonal produce so they can experience the delicious corn, asparagus, broccoli and tomatoes that we grow right here in Ontario.", "Mr. Speaker, we all should be aware of the high demand now for French’s ketchup in the province of Ontario. In fact, they can’t supply the market. This is the story: I was in Leamington a short time ago to see the rise-again of the old Heinz operation in Leamington—now Highbury Canco—doing tomato ketchup for French’s, and they cannot supply the market here in Ontario. That’s a good-news story that we all embrace in this Legislature.", "Part of this comes from promoting farmers’ markets and continuing to support the venues that allow Ontarians to experience and taste food that is grown in their community. I want to thank now-Senator Bob Runciman. Ten years ago, he brought forward a private member’s bill for fruit wines at farmers’ markets. We have now been able to deliver on his idea from a decade ago.", "It might be hard to believe after the February we’ve just had, but we should also be sharing the successes of our remarkable greenhouse sector, which is able to produce lettuce, cucumbers, peppers and other vegetables through the winter months. In fact, you can grow a cucumber from a flower to a mature cucumber in exactly 10 days.", "Mr. Speaker, local food isn’t just about fresh ingredients; it’s also about offering busy families high-quality prepared food using ingredients from Ontario farms, such as Campbell’s soups or French’s ketchup.", "By helping our children understand and appreciate the value and importance of Ontario’s farmers, local food and food processors, we’re helping to build a better Ontario. We’ll continue to work collaboratively with our partners to ensure that the next generation knows about the important role that agriculture plays in our lives and the range of high-quality, locally produced foods that we grow right here in Ontario, year-round.", "I want to encourage all colleagues on all sides of the House to take a moment, not only this week but throughout the year, to visit a farm or farmers’ market and have a conversation with family members or co-workers about the food we eat and where it comes from." ],

So many of our residents in Ontario are two, three or more generations removed from the farm. Many of us may or may not—tofu, for example, comes from soybeans. It’s a two-way street, and I can attest that many soybean farmers down my way don’t eat tofu; they don’t eat the product that they produce. So it’s truly a two-way street. There has to be this communication back and forth.", "In various whipped toppings, much of the main ingredient can be vegetable oil. I just assumed dairy, myself. It’s white and kind of fluffy and what have you. Vegetable oil is also used in soap, skin products and perfume. I grew up on a corn farm, and it’s just astounding, the products that come from field corn: the starch used in aspirin, for example. So it’s much broader than just food, much deeper than that, the products that are used for fibre and pharmaceuticals, and the value-added side that is also so important right across Ontario and right across Canada.", "Agri-Food Canada indicated that the sector generates $106 billion a year, 6.7% of Canada’s gross domestic product, and employs 2.2 million people right across our country. That’s one in eight jobs. It’s very important for the economy alone, and certainly our Ontario economy.", "I think that if we knew more about agriculture, there would probably be a bit more of an outcry about the recent cut to the budget. We lost $28 million. The Local Food Fund, I understand, has wrapped up, although we were recently told by the minister that it has gone over to the greenbelt people. I don’t know where that leaves us in Windsor or the Slate River Valley, or up in Thunder Bay, Timiskaming, and northeastern Ontario. So much of our agri-business stretches from the Michigan border right across to the Quebec border. It’s certainly not limited to the greenbelt.", "I had lunch today and noticed in the cafeteria that the bright sign that is lit up, down at the sandwich bar, was advertising, asking all of us to take a 100-meal journey. I think this is in March. During the month of March, on average, we’ll eat about 100 meals. It’s asking us to think about vegetables, drink more water—", "Interjection." ],

I know them as OAFE.", "Coming from a farm, I just had this illusion that most kids knew about agriculture. I came from a farm community, and we all talked about agriculture. My first real taste of why we needed it was at the 2009 plowing match, when we helped with the education tent. We had 9,000 kids come through that tent. That’s when it struck me how important a role these people play in teaching.", "That’s actually when I met the member from Huron–Bruce, who worked with me in that endeavour, and we both continue to work on teaching kids about agriculture. I think for all the people who are involved in this, it’s a very worthy endeavour.", "Today, I would like to stray a little bit. There’s another problem that agriculture faces, and it’s not literacy so much; it’s comprehension. You can read something, but you might not be able to understand it; or you might be able to say something from notes, but you might not be able to understand what you’re saying. My example is that when the Premier became Minister of Agriculture and she challenged agriculture to create 120,000 jobs, I was happy about that because I thought, “Okay, she doesn’t know a lot about agriculture, but she recognizes the potential.” There were a lot of people saying, “Oh, she shouldn’t be minister.” I thought, no; she could learn a lot.", "The fact that she recognizes there’s so much potential is a good thing. But in my mind, as a farmer, I thought, “Okay, so if you want to grow, you need the tools to grow.” If I’m going to work more land, I need a bigger cultivator. If I’m going to grow the industry, I need tools. That is where this government is failing. They don’t comprehend agriculture, because for us to reach goals like they are setting—and farmers set goals of growth every day for themselves and so do food processors; so do food retailers—they need the tools.", "One of these tools would have been an increase in the Risk Management Program, which is capped; that would have been a tool. Obviously, this government doesn’t fully comprehend agriculture, because they didn’t move on that.", "I’ll give you another example: The government introduced regulations on neonicotinoid insecticides. We’re not opposed to that. We should have a robust regulation system for pesticides, but it’s got to be a robust system that works. Once again, the government didn’t seem to comprehend that, because as we speak, farmers and crop consultants are telling me that the forms you have to fill out for your planting intentions have changed not once, not twice, not three times—" ],

You want to keep young people in rural Ontario? A novel concept: You know it would be nice if you could actually use your iPad, because farmers need stuff like that.

  "text" : [ "Thank you, Speaker. It’s truly an honour to stand here today on behalf of the one in 12 people of Ontario who suffers with one of the close to 7,000 rare diseases—diseases with acronyms like CCHS, PAH, PKU, EDS and aHUS, and names like alpha-1, Duchenne muscular dystrophy and Angelman syndrome—the list goes on.", "Today, I stand united with those rare disease sufferers who came to this morning’s press conference, those packing the galleries today, those I met over the last months of cross-province round tables and those suffering in isolation throughout Ontario. Together, we stand united in a call for action in support of my private member’s motion to strike an all-party select committee into rare disease diagnosis, treatment and support.", "It’s been well over a year since I began my own journey in learning about the unique, yet shared, challenges faced by those rare disease patients across Ontario. Having no personal or family connection to rare disease concerns, it was the stories of patients who are forced to come here to Queen’s Park to plead with legislators for the treatment and support we all would expect and deserve in Ontario—stories that were shared by people like Madi Vanstone and the stories that soon came directly into my office when a Kitchener friend, Anne Bilodeau, contacted me to detail the unfunded treatment and life-threatening crisis faced by her friend, aHUS patient Johann Kerlow.", "Once I began writing letters and digging into the issues surrounding rare diseases in the province, I soon learned that these stories were only the beginning. The more I learned, the more I realized that we couldn’t just sit idly by and allow the challenges faced by those suffering to go unaddressed. Bottom line: I was sick of seeing those who were suffering coming to Queen’s Park and coming into my office when there was nothing I could do about it.", "Well, there was something. There is something we can all do about it, in fact, as Ontarians and as provincial representatives. I know I’m not alone. I’m sure we’ve all heard from patients who have contacted our offices or made the trip to Queen’s Park to urge the government to provide specific, often life-saving, treatments. The message from these patients and those I have since met from across the province, as I’m sure you have heard in your own ridings, is that we in government are a last resort. The majority of these patients are coming to us as legislators because they have run out of options and they are desperate for our assistance. They’re coming to us after years of misdiagnosis; after being told, “It’s all in your head”; after being prevented access to life-saving treatment; after being refused vital life-enhancing equipment; and after watching their families beg and borrow, remortgage or even sell their homes to afford treatment. They’re coming to us after spending too many dark days and nights suffering in relative solitude without the support networks available to those with a more common disease.", "While rare or orphan diseases may only affect a small percentage of the population, their impact is so much more. These are people of Ontario deserving of access to medical treatments we all deserve as residents of this province. Their small numbers shouldn’t mean the government can go along ignoring their suffering.", "Today, we have the opportunity to finally address what governments have failed to address for far too long. We have the opportunity to join together in a united response to support our #TreatRareDisease campaign and, more specifically, to support our call for an all-party select committee to hear from experts, medical professionals, sufferers and their families, and use that first-hand experience to develop meaningful, lasting recommendations for the treatment of rare disease here in the province of Ontario.", "In the last year alone, I’ve sponsored a media studio for families suffering from a series of rare diseases whose challenges are unique and yet shared, families whose heart-wrenching stories cry out for the government’s attention and action. And yet, despite words of understanding from government when they are on their doorsteps, they continue to wait for support. Again, it was hearing these stories from the patients who I feel are the experts in many of these cases that prompted me to launch my #TreatRareDisease campaign and today’s motion.", "In recent months, instead of forcing patients to come here to share their stories, I felt it was time to go to them. Over a series of visits I made from Ajax to Windsor, from Sudbury to Ottawa and Brockville, from Hamilton and Kitchener, the stories I heard directly from patients only further supported the series of factors I’m asking the all-party select committee to consider.", "In our first stop in Ajax, where we were hosted by the Carion Fenn Foundation, we heard from alpha-1 patient Tom Leckie, who suffered from a collapsed lung and liver. Tom is a survivor. He will be on anti-rejection drugs for the rest of his life.", "In Ottawa, we heard of the difficulty surrounding misdiagnosis, where an EDS sufferer was prescribed antidepressants instead of getting an x-ray that may have led to a more proper diagnosis. She indicated that it was the journey to be diagnosed that was the most frustrating.", "It was also in Ottawa where I heard one of the most troubling and yet brutally honest statements since I started this campaign, when the wife of an alpha-1 patient addressed the challenge of access to treatment for rare disease patients. She told us that had he been diagnosed with a cancer, he would have been inside the system and would have had the access to treatment and supports that remain out of reach. You can stop for a second and think of what struggle and hurdles one must have experienced to make that type of statement. It really puts the entire issue into a heart-wrenching perspective, to think that they would have rather had cancer than the rare disease that they happen to have.", "In Hamilton, we heard of the need for research into a cure for Angelman syndrome, a rare congenital disorder leading to mental disability, when Kathryn Nicholls told of the challenges faced by her young daughter, Alyssa. They remain waiting for a cure that medical experts believe is well within reach but, due to its rarity, lacks the necessary research support.", "In Kitchener, access to medication was again a key concern to Sue Thomas, mother of Jason, a 23-year-old whose life took a sudden U-turn when he was diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy at the age of 19. I know that Jason may be watching today, and I want to thank him for sharing his story. Jason, who relies on a wheelchair and will never be able to eat again due to the continuing throat issues and lung infections, is his own best advocate in the twitterverse @jasonsWHEELS, where you can learn more about his work to champion vital medications that are difficult to access here in the province.", "Patients weren’t only sharing their stories at our tour stops. They were also writing them and sharing them on our website, treatraredisease.ca. I continue to encourage my colleagues to log on and read through the concerns and challenges faced by rare disease sufferers throughout the province. You’ll read about Windsor’s Jon Brentnall, who lost his mother after she suffered from an undiagnosed, serious bacterial skin infection that spreads quickly and kills the body’s soft tissue: necrotizing fasciitis. He tells us, “No medical scans were done to diagnose properly.” The doctor told her to take an antibiotic and that she should notice a difference by morning and dismissed her. “Rest in peace, Mum,” Jon wrote.", "Leamington’s Donna Coulter was one of a handful who told us of the excruciating situation faced by those with complex regional pain syndrome, also known as the “suicide disease.” She is one of many advocating for desperately needed education and research and assistance to those suffering.", "Speaker, the stories go on. There are so many who have suffered so long in relative silence that once they are given the opportunity to share their unique challenges they are grateful to understand that their elected representatives are finally listening. It is because of these compelling stories that I believe that working together through the select committee open public process will prove to be the best route to hear from patients, their families, and experts in the medical community to try to come up with a solution to help these families.", "With that said, I think it’s important, as we look to push forward the select committee approach, that we do register our appreciation for the Minister of Health’s announcement earlier this week to acknowledge the need to address the challenges facing rare disease sufferers. And while the minister’s announced working group provides one step in the search for answers, the select committee process I’m calling for will provide the transparent public forum and discussion that will lead to the concrete answers and province-wide strategy patients deserve.", "Speaker, we are all well acquainted with the success of past all-party select committees in bringing long-hidden issues to the fore and leading to informed and essential recommendations dealing with difficult concerns that demand government attention. I think of the success of select committees on developmental services and on mental health and addictions, and the recent work of the Select Committee on Sexual Violence and Harassment.", "Select committees provide the transparent, open forum required to deal with these issues that have, for far too long, remained hidden. Without a select committee, these discussions go on behind closed doors. That’s where it has been for years and that’s not what is helping patients.", "Too many times we’ve seen announcements of government intentions to address these issues and too many times we’ve seen them little more than a practice in spinning wheels. It has been five years since the government received the Ontario Citizens’ Council report on rare disease, and five years later we’ve seen no action.", "I’ve learned first-hand over the last year that, when it comes to rare disease, the real experts are the patients. Our government needs to hear from them. If we walk away today, we’re caught in the same waiting game we’ve been trapped in for far too long now. Bottom line: The select committee approach will deliver the transparent public forum that rare disease sufferers deserve to complement the recent provincial acknowledgement of the need for attention. It’s my sincere hope that we can assist the efforts of the minister through this all-party select committee.", "Today, we have an opportunity to build on the minister’s announcements by supporting the open, all-party select committee process. But to be very clear, should MPPs choose to stand against this afternoon’s motion for an all-party select committee into rare disease treatment, they will be turning their backs on the transparent public process and recommendations that these patients are calling on you to support. So I’m standing with them today to ask that you don’t turn your back on them. It is a truly bipartisan issue that crosses party lines. I look forward to the support to push forward this important initiative and finally give rare disease sufferers the support they so dearly deserve." ],

Most of them have a gut-wrenching story to tell before they finally got diagnoses. Once they get there, sometimes there is relief and sometimes there isn’t. But all of them have suffered in silence for a long time.", "Finally, the wind seems to be shifting a little bit. People are interested in reaching out to those rare disease sufferers and seeing that, if we put our time, effort, energy and brainpower together, maybe we could do something to help them and maybe we can do something to help all of us. This is what the member is trying to do.", "I had the privilege to sit on the Select Committee on Mental Health and Addictions. I come from 25 years in health care. I’m glad to see that the Chair of that committee is here today. When I started work on that committee, I came with my health provider’s set of eyes and ears to it. But I quickly realized that this is not what people wanted; they wanted to have an opportunity to come and talk to politicians and talk to their government as to how things could be made better. I think we made some pretty good all-party unanimous recommendations.", "Just the fact that we had the select committee, the fact that we travelled the province, the fact that we gave close to 300 people and families the opportunity to be heard, to share their story, to tell us how we had failed them and to tell us how we could do things better: This, in itself, I am convinced, helped change the conversation about mental health and helped to bring it to where it is now, where it is a whole lot more open.", "We have the opportunity to do the same thing with rare diseases. We have an opportunity to let every Ontarian know that they exist, know that those people struggle, and to put some good—hopefully—recommendations forward. A select committee is transparent, it is accountable, it is public, and it is open to everybody. It is not cumbersome; it is easy for people to participate.", "I have nothing against the Minister of Health doing his work and getting his experts together and getting the voice of a few clients through that. That could go on. It doesn’t keep us from having the select committee go forward. I am positive that, at the very least, we would help to educate and change the view of many Ontarians about those rare diseases, do our work and bring forward some basically unanimous, nonpartisan ways forward.", "New Democrats will be voting 100% in favour of putting together this select committee. Anything we can do to help the #TreatRareDisease campaign, we are willing to help. Those people are here today because they want us to do something and they want to be part of the solution. Let’s not turn our back on them; let’s bring them in. We can learn from them. We will learn from them. Rare diseases will change for the better because we will have a select committee." ],

I know that many of them have joined us in the gallery today. Thank you for being here.", "Our government is committed to putting patients first, which is why our recent budget includes increases to health care spending of $1 billion, including $345 million in hospitals, to ensure patients receive the right care at the right time and in the right place. Understanding the experience of those individuals who use our health care system is essential to this commitment, because when we understand their experiences, we can make the changes necessary to our system to meet their needs.", "Our government knows that there are many Ontarians living with or who have family members living with rare diseases or disorders. We also know that because these conditions are rare, they can often be misdiagnosed. The effect of this is that these Ontarians face challenges in their ability to access appropriate care. We recognize the hardship and stress that this can cause and the impact it can have on people’s everyday lives. We recognize, too, that we need to take action, and I want to assure Ontarians living with rare diseases or disorders, and their families, that this work is under way.", "As a government, we have done much to improve access to care for these individuals, but still more needs to be done, and that needs to be acknowledged. Our goal has been and continues to be to offer the best possible care to help them. The Minister of Health and Long-Term Care has been working hard with partners across Canada, leading a working group to develop a pan-Canadian rare disease strategy. As a clinician, he not only empathizes with those who suffer from rare diseases and with their families; he is committed to working with colleagues from across our country to strategize possible solutions.", "Just this week, on International Rare Disease Day on Monday, February 29, the minister announced further steps to better serve Ontarians with rare conditions.", "Our government shared the report of the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, or EDS, expert panel with the public. In response to the panel’s recommendations, our government is creating a new centre of excellence clinic that will focus on diagnosing and treating adults and children living with EDS, a group of inherited disorders that affect your connective tissues, primarily your skin, joints and blood vessel walls. This new clinic would strengthen care and support for individuals and families living with EDS by offering primary care providers a single point of contact to receive information and guidelines on related signs and symptoms. It would also provide advice and feedback from clinical experts on diagnosis and treatment options, as well as make referrals to specialists, including geneticists, pediatricians and pain management professionals. The minister also announced that the clinic could be expanded to support primary care providers treating people with other rare diseases, if required.", "Further to the announcement of the clinic, our government announced that we will be creating a working group comprised of Ontario experts to explore how services for people with rare diseases and disorders in Ontario can be improved. The group will look at improving early detection and prevention, providing timely and accurate diagnosis and care, and improving community supports for patients and their families. Issues such as these require advice and input from experts in the field and those with clinical experience, which is exactly the reason this working group will be made up of both.", "I’d like to take this opportunity to share an excerpt regarding our government’s recent announcement from the Canadian Organization for Rare Disorders, or CORD: “ ... the Canadian Organization for Rare Disorders (CORD) welcomes the announcement made by Ontario Health Minister Eric Hoskins to open a new clinic for patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), which could be expanded to other rare disorders, as well as his commitment to strike a working group to develop an Ontario approach to a coordinated provincial health care system for patients with rare disorders.” Their president and CEO goes on to say, “Minister Hoskins’ previous efforts on behalf of patients with urgent and underserved needs gives Ontario families with rare diseases great hope that his leadership and commitment will inspire other stakeholders and offer an example for other provinces.”", "I take pride in the support shown to our government, and that quote in particular, for our work in this area by organizations such as CORD. It reinforces our commitment to putting patients first and acknowledges our hard work on developing a plan of action.", "In closing, I’d like to acknowledge an outstanding advocate in my constituency, Lynn Clark, who came to see me recently about the need for our government to work towards an approach on rare disorders. Lynn sits on the board of the ILC, the Improving the Lives of Children Foundation, based in Halton region. She attended Minister Hoskins’s announcement as a result of her passion for and commitment to finding solutions for patients. Her experiences with her daughter, Chelsea Clark, a gold-medal Paralympian, and a young woman whose challenges with chronic pain were largely misunderstood, drove Lynn to become the passionate advocate that she is.", "I’d like to commend again the continued efforts by the member from Kitchener–Conestoga in advocating on behalf of Ontarians with rare diseases and disorders. He clearly shares our commitment to putting patients first and ensuring that their needs are met as quickly as possible by providing the best possible care.", "Our work in this area will continue, because it must. I look forward to working together with the member opposite and, indeed, all members of this House. I want to underscore, in closing, that while we might not always agree on the mechanism for moving this forward, no one should take that as a sign or a commitment that our government doesn’t care about this issue.

He should be commended tenfold, continually, because without his work on this issue, rare diseases would still be on the back plate of this government’s agenda. This motion brings it forward, and we’re hoping that, through this debate, they have a change of heart and will support this motion.", "Everybody, in their riding, has someone that comes knocking on their door with a rare disease, because, as Mr. Harris has mentioned, there are over 7,000 diseases. I’m going to mention two in my riding. You might hear this government, later on in this debate, talk about how they want to remove the politics from the decision-making. Sometimes you need the politics to create the structure for the bureaucrats to make the decisions necessary.", "My concern is, through my two people from my riding who came forward—their concerns were because the bureaucracy was too rigid in their decision-making and not flexible. I think that when you’re dealing with treating rare diseases, you need to have that flexibility in place. I believe that this motion, this committee that the member from Kitchener–Conestoga wants to create, will allow that to develop.", "I have one resident who has pulmonary hypertension. She’s six years old, Mr. Speaker. Not very many young children get pulmonary hypertension. That’s a high blood pressure between the lungs and the heart. It’s very rare and very hard to treat. In fact, the medications that they’re developing, and the research, are focused around adults, because they’re the majority of people who end up getting pulmonary hypertension.", "For her to get treatment, the doctors have had to mess around with the doses, and they came up with three different medications that work. Unfortunately, the government will only agree to pay for two of them. For the third one, the family is left to scrounge around to get enough money in order to give their six-year-old daughter some enjoyment in life. She has to carry around this great big oxygen tank with her. She has to have a nurse at school with her. She’s six years old.", "We live in a province where we think we should be doing all we can for children with rare diseases. We should be giving them a life.", "My other concern in my riding is this poor little girl who suffers from Diamond-Blackfan anemia, which means her one treatment is a corticosteroid and it has to be given by the IV route.", "Now, this is where this drives me nuts, this bureaucracy that has formed there. This government, which I’m thankful for, helps pay for the pumps for diabetics. This poor girl’s medication can be delivered by this pump. The government pays for diabetic children, but because she has Diamond-Blackfan anemia, it’s not covered. It’s $5,000 for that family. That’s unheard of. How many children have this disease? How much more would it cost, actually, to pay for those additional pumps for these children? But it’s a rigid structure over there that doesn’t allow this to occur.", "Mr. Speaker, this government talks a lot about wanting to work together with us. This motion allows us to work together—all three parties working together—for solutions. I’m calling on this government to change your mind. Support this motion. Get your heads out of the sand. We can work together and make a difference. This isn’t political. There’s no politics in this paper. Support it." ],

They feel like their voices aren’t being heard.", "I was speaking to a wonderful, beautiful, articulate, blue-eyed young woman last night, whom I met through many years of working with her. She has been educating me on her behalf. She shared with me a story and an experience that she has gone through many times. But she did ask me to share an experience that she recently had over the course of this last weekend. With her permission, she granted me the opportunity of doing that. I think a lot of people will feel what this girl has felt through other diseases that are here in the province.", "I just want to make sure that I can put this in and have enough time, so I’ll start reading. I’d like to share the story of Paige Spencer and her recent experience while attending a hospital for care. She writes on her Facebook page, and you can check out a lot of her stories that are there.", "“Hey everyone, so here’s my health update: I apologize that it isn’t going to be positive ... usually I’m a happy person who finds positivity in everything but lately I feel no control at all over my life....", "“The hospital really didn’t help me at all Sunday night. They basically put me in a room and ignored me while I screamed in horrendous pain for two hours.", "“One time when my mom went out she told them that I had to use the washroom but was in such horrible pain and was wondering when I was going to get my pain meds. They kept making excuses to delay giving me the meds and the one ‘health care provider’ just was rude to my mom. So after, like, about an hour of me waiting and holding, I told her just go get me a bedpan considering I’m getting over a bladder infection and it’s now causing me more pain. They continued to delay for so long.", "“After, like, 20 minutes a lady came in with attitude and told me there are no bedpans and that I need to get up and basically stop crying and grow up. Last time I checked a ‘health care provider’ is supposed to be kind and helpful. I couldn’t believe her. Every time I started screaming due to feeling like my spine felt like it was going to snap, my mom was so upset seeing her daughter like this and the woman goes, ‘Get used to it, honey. This is your new normal. You’ve just got to suck it up and be a big girl.’ My mom said, ‘It shouldn’t be normal ... she’s been suffering for too long....’", "“Oh yeah and, of course, the ‘health care provider’ suggested that I get psychological help about 10 times. Of course, no wonder I’m depressed because every hospital I go to and every doctor who sees me are ‘uninformed about Lyme’ and say I’m crazy, a drug addict, or that I’m just stressed out or want attention! If that’s the case, I deserve an Oscar if this is all an act.", "“Anyways, they didn’t offer me much help at all. They thought I was exaggerating my pain. I flipped at the doctor and was hysterically crying, telling him I can’t take this pain anymore. I’ve never had spinal pain and I’d rather take a bullet. After my freak out at him, I could see he was a little bit more considerate and sympathetic to my situation. So they gave me pain meds, booked a neurologist appointment, and a prescription for pain meds.", "“So yesterday was absolutely hell and so is today. I couldn’t sleep at all last night because the pain is so intense. I’m on heavy pain meds and also marijuana oil and all of that is still not taking away the pain in my spine.", "“Us Lymies are tough because we live with excruciating pain all the time but this spinal pain is absolutely horrendous. I’m so angry with my life, I’m not going to sugar-coat it.", "“I handle my disease with strength and faith, but I have no clue what is going on with me anymore. No one is helping me or giving me answers.", "“At home, every day my family feels completely helpless and terrified as they watch their 21-year-old daughter scream in agonizing pain. Not only am I suffering in pain physically, mentally and emotionally, but I’m suffering from guilt and anger as I watch my pain and my disease destroy my loved ones. It’s affecting their health so much that it kills me because I can’t do anything about it.", "“I’m so sorry for this rant; usually I’m very positive and happy about sharing my story and spreading the word about my disease. I don’t like my disease or my pain control my life or allow it to destroy it. But it’s hard when things start to finally go well in my life and then, bam, everything falls apart again so quickly. I know I will get through this, and I will beat this battle. I’m just going through a very hard time right now.", "“This pain is just not giving up. I can only hope some doctor will want to help me. All I can do right now is try to get lots of rest and pray.", "“I sincerely thank everyone for their love, support and prayers. You guys really do keep me going. Just when I want to give up, I remember how much support I have from all of you. I’m sorry I haven’t gotten to replying to the emails or messages some of you sent to me. I’m just so exhausted. This message took over an hour to try and put it together. I thank everyone. I keep praying this fight will be over soon.”", "I thought I’d share a few comments her friends put on it. One of her friends said, “I hate this. I hate seeing my beautiful friend and her family suffering while nothing is done. When does this stop, Michael Mantha? When will the government undo this injustice? Let’s hope it’s not before we lose more warriors!”", "My reply to her was, “This pains me to no end. It angers and fuels me to get the changes done now! Too many are suffering. I’m trying my best and will continue doing so until the job is done.”", "Paige replies, “Thank you, Michael. I pray one day this nightmare will end. I’m just getting very tired of being treated like this.", "“We talk so much about mental health and how important it is, but they are making mine worse. I’m depressed because I’m in chronic pain, and the doctors make me feel like I’m crazy and that my life isn’t important. I go to the hospital in an emergency and they yell at me and treat me like .... So I’m left to thank our medical system for making me feel suicidal. Michael, if you ever need my story, please let me know. I have no issue telling people the suffering I’m forced to endure.”", "I replied to her, “I do, and we will share your story!” I have, and I hope you listened." ],

I want to congratulate him on his efforts and his advocacy for people and their families suffering with rare disorders.", "I’d also like to recognize the advocacy of Ontarians with rare disorders, their families, their friends, and the organizations that stand behind them for their work and their efforts. There are many of them in the Legislature with us here today. I’d like to recognize and acknowledge their presence.", "Many members in this House have someone in their extended family who suffers from a rare disorder. I can guarantee you that all members in this House have probably met a constituent who suffers from a rare disorder. It’s something that affects all of our communities.", "In particular in my community, a lady named Unita Louis was a very strong advocate for those suffering from sickle-cell anemia. Her son, Brent, had sickle-cell anemia. I had the opportunity to work with her and help her in organizing a conference. She did a lot of work, and her son Brent passed away in July this year. He was in his thirties. She stepped back from being an advocate, but I can still remember in 2005, when sickle-cell was added to the tests for newborn screening and the kind of difference that made in people’s lives in terms of early diagnosis and the ability to provide the treatments that those suffering with sickle-cell anemia needed.", "As we know, diagnosis is an important thing. I’ve heard a few times here today where people haven’t been diagnosed—I think the member from Kitchener–Conestoga mentioned EDS—and that’s a very serious thing, because if you don’t recognize what you have, it’s pretty hard to treat it.", "I am very pleased to say that newborn screening is housed at CHEO, in my riding of Ottawa South. Right now, I think there are 29 disorders and illnesses that they test for, and I know they are moving along in terms of trying to expand that even further. I think that’s going to go a long way. By the way, we screen for the most disorders in all of Canada and we’re trying to lead a pan-Canadian approach to newborn screening so that it’s effective across Canada. I want to recognize that, as well as the work that the ministry is doing on the effort to pull together work on rare diseases at the pan-Canadian level.", "Now, I know that people are saying the debate is not politicized, but it gets a little politicized when the actions of the government are characterized as no action. As I’ve said before in this Legislature, all of us have sat on this side—all of our parties. We all have had to make decisions, and we all share one common value. I think that to impugn motive on people is not the right thing to do in this Legislature, and I just want to point that out.", "I think that when it comes, for instance, to therapies and new drugs, I as a legislator don’t feel that I’m equipped to make those decisions. I know that I’m emotionally equipped to make those decisions, but I don’t know if I can make those decisions in the best interests of the public.", "I just want to bring people back to multiple sclerosis—MS—and liberation therapy. We can all remember the hope and the desire that was created at that time in patients who were suffering, and that hope was not well founded. But there was a lot of pressure, and we have to recognize that those things happen in the system.", "I do want to finish by saying that I applaud the recent announcement by the minister on EDS, the report of the expert panel and the new centre here at UHN. I applaud the working group. This is being used as a model for how we treat rare diseases and how we look at the issues around making sure that primary care is aware, making sure that—there’s a lot of need for information out there.", "I do want to say that I believe the actions we are taking as a government will go a long way—a very long way—to improve conditions for those suffering with rare disorders. I’m not saying it’s an easy road, and I’m not saying that everything is going to get solved. What I am saying is that I believe this is the right approach, and as my father used to say, the best way to get started is just to get started." ],

He’s a real true champion of this issue, and he has taken a lot of time travelling across our province to give a voice to those people who are suffering with rare diseases—people who, in many cases, wonder if the government is listening. I want to thank him. He came to my riding of Leeds–Grenville, and we hosted a meeting in Brockville. We had a great turnout and an excellent discussion about the incredible obstacles that people with rare diseases face every day.", "It’s heartbreaking to hear the stories, and I have many stories I could tell today. But I want to mention a few people, like Charlie Smith and his sister, Jessica Smith-Covey, who suffer from Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. They’re sick and they need treatment. But some spend years looking for a doctor who won’t tell them it’s all in their head. Then if they’re lucky enough to do that, they must fight the provincial health care system for support. As we know, far too often, that uphill battle ends with patients and their families being forced to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars or more, to travel outside of Ontario for their treatment.", "All their time should be spent fighting the disease; they shouldn’t have to fight the system. With the minister’s announcement this week regarding an Ehlers-Danlos clinic, I think the member can take some satisfaction that his motion today is already resulting in some improvements in our system. I think you can take some congratulations for that.", "But I think we all agree on this side of the House that we need to do more and that a select committee would be an excellent opportunity to provide a non-partisan forum to do that. It could allow us to hear from experts and from patients, so we can design a system that does a better job of treating rare diseases.", "We’re blessed in this province to have many resources. Those resources should be going to help people like little Kaiden Sturgeon. He’s an eight-month-old kid whose mother, Kristen, lives in my riding. Kristen and Kaiden wanted to be here. He suffers from Sandhoff disease, an incredibly rare genetic disorder. But the trip here would just be too much for them, as with so many people who I think would have loved to be here today to be able to tell their story.", "I was with Kristen’s family on Saturday at an event they held to raise money so Kaiden can travel to Minnesota for treatment. I still have the bracelet that Kaiden gave me on Saturday. With everything this family is going through, trying to look after their sick little boy, organizing fundraisers is the very last thing they should be doing, but that’s the reality. That’s the reality for so many families that are here today. That’s what the government has made them do: They’ve made them fundraise for their health care.", "So we owe it to Kaiden and to Jessica and to Charlie, whose lives have been shattered by a rare disease diagnosis, to make Ontario a leader in getting the treatment they desperately need. Speaker, there’s one way we can do it. Michael Harris articulated it today: It’s this motion. We should stop the partisan bickering and get it done." ],

The stories I heard from two patients in my riding of Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound are truly harrowing. They are a nine-month-old little girl, Darcey Papineau, and six-year-old Michael McManaman.", "Dan and Dionne Papineau wrote me after their nine-month-old daughter, Darcey, was admitted to SickKids for the second time, back in November. Darcey was diagnosed with aHUS, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, a rare blood disorder. Up until that day, the family had never even heard of this disease. They said that Darcey initially responded well to a dialysis type of treatment, where doctors removed her plasma and replaced it with new. But when her blood counts didn’t stay stable and dropped, Darcey was readmitted.", "When the parents contacted me, Darcey was going into day 3 of plasma transfusions. The doctors advised them that Darcey will, at some point, likely require a drug called eculizumab, which is not covered by OHIP and costs approximately $500,000 per year. I don’t know who in Ontario could afford such astronomical drug costs, but the Papineaus certainly cannot.", "I quote from Darcey’s mom. “It is heartbreaking,” her mom said to me, “to think that at some point money (or rather, a lack of) will dictate our daughter’s quality of life ... To think that as parents, we would be unable to afford to give her that feeling all of the time is simply heartbreaking. We are asking that you lend your support to MPP Harris’s bill.”", "Amanda McManaman’s story is very similar. Again, it is a story of struggling, coping and living a parent’s worst nightmare. Her son Michael was born with phenylketonuria, PKU, an inherited metabolic disorder found in approximately one in 12,000 infants born in Canada. If left untreated, symptoms of PKU can range from mild cognitive impairment to severe intellectual disability and epilepsy. It is critical to the child’s brain development that the appropriate treatment is initiated immediately and maintained throughout life.", "Ontario listed KUVAN in February 2013, but the highly restrictive criteria are preventing patients who respond to KUVAN from qualifying for publicly funded access to this brain-protecting treatment, including her son Michael. Amanda wrote multiple letters to the Minister of Health to ask why patients are not getting access to life-saving KUVAN, the first and only pharmaceutical treatment for PKU.", "She wrote:", "“While your government says they cover the cost of KUVAN for those with PKU, the reality is it doesn’t, because no patient has been able to access it to date.... For those living with PKU who are responders to this drug, the evidence thus far shows that it improves one’s quality of life by preventing further cognitive, psychiatric problems, and further permanent disabilities, which would alleviate pressures on the health care system.... It really takes a village to raise a child, but sometimes it takes more. And in my case, because Michael was born with this rare, genetic, life-long condition, it’s going to take help from you, our provincial government, to ensure that he has what he needs most for the rest of his life—this medication.... That is why I am asking you to start protecting the brains of children and adults living with PKU, by following the guidance of medical experts, in Ontario and worldwide, and immediately rewrite the KUVAN criteria to make the drug accessible to all patients who respond to it.”", "Darcey and Michael are two faces of the rare diseases Ontarians are fighting. They need and they deserve to have the very best treatment options moving forward. I urge the members opposite to vote with us, to vote with Michael Harris and all the people of Ontario.", "I want to acknowledge Michael—and he’s way too humble. He’s doing it for the right reasons. He’s doing it for those thousands of people out there who are doing it. He has raised, through compassion, the awareness of this debilitating situation for many, many families—and as well, to his staff who have done the research and travelled with him across this province.", "I believe John Adams is in the gallery, and I would like to acknowledge him as well. He met with me last week. He’s a sufferer and he came to me, again, from personal convictions, to try to get us to listen, to try to make our provincial government listen and make sure we have the ability.", "This all-party select committee is the ability. As the member across the floor said, the best way to start is to just start. Today, every single member of this Legislature can put their hand up with a positive. They can vote for this select committee and they can truly make that step, make a difference in the lives of everyone suffering with a rare disorder.", "Thank you." ],

I find it hard to believe the minister could hide behind yet another closed-door working group to reject our proposal for a transparent, all-party, public select committee to tour the province, hear from experts, the sufferers, and use the first-hand experience to develop meaningful, lasting recommendations for rare disease treatment in Ontario.", "Just outside these doors, the minister tried to suggest today that the working group would take the politicians out of the process, but he knows as well as I the recent successful history of the all-party select committees. Too many times, we’ve seen announcements of government intentions to address these issues, as we heard earlier this week, and too many times we’ve seen the announcements used an excuse for inaction.

I want to begin by welcoming the stakeholders who are in the gallery and who have remained committed to building a healthy home inspection industry: Len Inkster and Patrick Auriol from the Ontario Association of Certified Home Inspectors, Murray Parish and David Hellyer from the Ontario Association of Home Inspectors, Graham Clarke and T.J. Smith. as well as William Stratas from Eagle Audit. I want to recognize the hard work they’ve done in support of all home inspectors, and I want to make sure that work does not go unnoticed.", "My EA, Shawn Ogborne, my former OLIP intern Sara O’Sullivan and I brought this bill forward to enhance consumer protection for homeowners and to unify the industry.", "The purchase of a home is one of the largest investments homeowners will make in their lifetime. That investment should be protected. Many homebuyers, especially first-time buyers, rely on the expert opinion of a home inspector with regard to the condition of a potential home. However, if you ask homebuyers whether or not they know home inspection is a nonregulated industry, I believe many would be shocked to hear that is no regulated body to license or regulate.", "There is no way for consumers to confidently know their home inspector is meeting the high and consistent standards we expect in Ontario. I have heard over and over from constituents about challenges they have faced with their home purchases that could have been flagged by a qualified home inspector. Now, there are several hard-working home inspector associations that are dedicated to the professionalism of the industry. These associations, some of whom are in the gallery today, have given the industry a strong foundation to build on. However, these associations have varied governing systems and requirements that could be confusing to average consumers.", "Industry stakeholders whom I’ve consulted with have expressed strong support for regulating the industry to make sure it’s sustainable and trusted by Ontarians. This bill, if passed, will create one licensing regime operating under an independent board that reflects different aspects of the home inspection industry. The delegated administrative authority, or DAA, will carry out licensing and other regulatory responsibilities at arm’s length to the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services.", "Regulation by an industry-funded DAA is a way to ensure a more level playing field for home inspectors to operate with similar qualifications. By enforcing a single standard, the DAA would provide greater transparency and consumer protection in the ever-changing market.", "This bill also proposes accountability measures such as minimum mandatory insurance, a code of ethics and other requirements which will be determined in the regulation process. Licensed by the proposed DAA, qualified home inspectors will earn the legal title of “licensed home inspector,” which symbolizes professionalism and industry standard. In short, the creation of a home inspection DAA would provide consistent, reliable service by licensed home inspectors at an affordable price.", "During the consultation process, some asked me, Why a DAA model? Five years ago, Mr. Don Drummond, a prominent economist, published a report that later became known as the Drummond report. In it, Drummond referenced the delegated administrative authority review. This review found that the DAA model worked effectively and efficiently as a regulatory body for consumer protection. The benefits of a DAA were found to be reducing cost to government and reducing size of government as service delivery is transferred to an external, not-for-profit service provider, improving regulatory outcomes and improving efficiency. Government oversight is retained, and there is increased industry engagement through participation on the board.", "The Drummond report and the DAA review have confirmed that a DAA is the best body to regulate home inspectors. But most importantly, a DAA model was the recommendation of the 2013 panel and was seen as the most beneficial to the majority of those we’ve consulted.", "As mentioned earlier, I have heard issues from many of my constituents in Trinity–Spadina.

After electing not to have an inspection done, this individual found a problem that is now causing the family extreme irritation and discomfort in their home. In hindsight, this issue could have been easily flagged by a qualified inspector.", "In addition to speaking to constituents, I spent a long period of time speaking to a variety of stakeholders in the home inspection industry about issues such as getting complaints from consumers about an individual calling himself a home inspector; searching for the individual in the association records only to find out that they don’t belong to their association; and needing to refer the consumer to make a complaint elsewhere because the person is not part of their association.", "The DAA would make navigation easier for consumers: Either they are licensed and can be found through the DAA, or they’re not licensed and are breaking the law.

Based on his or her knowledge and expertise, a licensed inspector would spot potential issues, helping the owner to minimize or avoid financial loss.", "Many stakeholders mentioned that in the hot real estate market, individuals are waiving the option of having a home inspection. I view this as a great loss, especially to first-time homeowners, who, without a home inspection, are taking a risk on their investment and on their family’s health and safety. If passed, the home inspection DAA will build up the profile of the home inspection industry and inject consumer confidence into this invaluable service, encouraging more consumers to utilize home inspectors.", "In 2013, the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services brought together an expert panel to look at qualified home inspectors. The panel included home inspectors, consumer advocates, educators and other professionals in sectors such as real estate, law and insurance. The panel prepared a comprehensive report that recommends the regulation of home inspectors. I want to thank the minister, who’s not here right now—" ],

It was not discovered during the home inspection, and he lived in that home for several years before he realized that he was inflicting permanent damage to his lungs. Since that time, he has endured years of difficulty breathing, numerous lengthy hospital stays, and massive doses of prednisone, which have depleted his bone mass to a fraction of what it once was, to the point where he can break ribs from coughing. His lungs function at 30% of their normal capacity.

I’m sure we’ve seen that in all of our constituencies.", "I recall some of the ones that I’ve had to deal with. One particular individual and his wife, like everybody else, worked hard and put the money away in order to get a down payment to buy their first house. They go out and buy the house. The thing is inspected and they buy it. The mortgage is done. They take possession of the house. And then they start to find out that there are problems with the foundation. As a result of the problem with the foundation, there needed to be repairs done to the house which ended up costing a fair amount of money.", "When they went back—this was within a couple of years of having bought the house but it was over the one year that you have some coverage—they ended up having to spend tens of thousands of dollars to fix the problem. Lo and behold, there’s nobody who’s liable for what should have been caught if there had been a proper home inspection. It turned out, in this case, that the person who did the home inspection didn’t know what they were doing and they allowed something to be unseen in the inspection that wasn’t reported to the buyers. As a result, they were out literally tens of thousands of dollars.", "I have another one—not in my constituency, but a cousin of mine in Sudbury. He buys a house for hundreds of thousands of dollars, lives there for a couple of years, and what had happened, he finds out, is that house was built in two stages. It all looks like one if you look at it now because construction means allow you to do that. The foundation on the second part of the house—guess what?—is not holding up too well. As a result, the house started to subside on the one side and it’s thrown the attached decks out, it’s cracked the walls and it’s cracked the ceilings. So he’s gone through this entire process of trying to recapture the money necessary in order to do the repairs, which are in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.", "I was there last week and I got to see it because they are working on it as we speak. You hear them doing the work that they’ve got to do on changing the footing and the foundation. Oh, my God, you should see what they’re doing there. But here, lo and behold, they have a house that they’ve now got to put an extra couple of hundred thousand dollars into. What is that going to do to their position of equity on that house? Again, why? Because when the house was purchased, it had been inspected, and the inspector missed whatever had to be caught so that they could then make a decision on how to negotiate the price of the house on sale.", "But the other issue is that if we do this right—I would hope this is something that we include in the legislation, should this become law—the home inspector has to be carrying some kind of insurance in order to make sure that the buyer is protected in the event that the inspection misses something, so that there’s a liability issue that is dealt with. Now, there’s obviously all of the other stuff that goes with this: making sure home inspectors are actually home inspectors and are certified and they know what they’re doing. But there should also be some sort of liability insurance, in the same way that most of us have liability insurance.", "I’m an electrician by trade. I worked in construction and maintenance in the mining sector, but if I was in the construction sector, I would have to have liability insurance on the work that I do because—who knows?—there may be a fire; there may be something that’s happened with the workmanship or the people who work for me or myself. If it causes harm to the building or it causes some sort of damage, then you have to be able to cover those losses, and you have to carry liability insurance.", "There should be the same kind of thing, I would hope, for home inspectors. I think this is something that has been brought to the House before, and I congratulate all of those who have raised this issue a number of times. Who knows? Maybe this is like strike one, strike two and, boy, you hit the ball out of the park—you never know.", "We’ve got to hope that this bill actually gets to go forward and deals with making sure that consumers are properly protected when it comes to making what is, in most cases, the biggest purchase in a person’s life or a couple’s life: buying that home.

We had about 60,000 members in those days, and it always amazed me that people would spend days and days, and months and months, researching what car they were going to buy, but they would see a house and buy it, and bind themselves to a contract—a mortgage—that would last seemingly hundreds of years into the future. Those were the days when home inspectors started to really come on the scene. The markets were very hot, and it was so important to have someone to give you that second sober advice as to whether or not you should purchase a house. But we began to receive complaints that some of the people weren’t properly trained. Some were great. In fact, the vast majority of home inspection people that I’ve dealt with over the years, including the gentleman that I’ve used when I’ve purchased homes, are absolutely fantastic and worth every penny I’ve put into them, quite frankly. I continue to go back to the chap that I used as we do renovations over the years.", "But there are so many people who don’t understand the value of a home inspection, and if they do, they’re at a loss. They have no idea who they should hire. Just last week, I was talking to an individual who hired a home inspector who told them that the prospective house they were about to purchase was filled with mould in the attic. They hired another inspector who came and said, no, in fact, that’s not mould. And when they looked a little further, the first individual ran a company that did mould remediation. So I suspect that somewhere down the road, they were going to come back and want to clean that mould up.", "I know this type of licensing will go a long way to fixing that type of mischief. As I said earlier, the vast number of home inspectors I’ve worked with and heard about do a really good job, but I think the industry as a whole has matured. It needs to be standardized. If you hire a home inspector in the Soo, they should have the same skill set as a home inspector in my riding of Newmarket–Aurora or one in the riding of Trinity–Spadina. So I look forward to that.", "I want to perhaps correct a bit of information that the member for Whitby–Oshawa put forward. There was an awful lot of consultation, extensive consultation, done by the government with all sorts of groups in pulling this forward. In fact, there are representatives from a number of those organizations in the visitors’ gallery, and judging by the smiles on their faces, I suspect they are in favour of what the member from Trinity–Spadina is moving ahead with today. There was extensive consultation with consumer groups, extensive consultation with real estate agents and lawyers—the whole gamut of people who work with home sales, and they’ll tell you, I know, that this is really good legislation. This is excellent consumer protection legislation.", "Again, I commend the member for Trinity–Spadina for moving it forward, and I look forward to everyone supporting it." ],

A home inspector can help prospective owners evaluate the true value of a home and identify any potential issues: everything from the exterior shell to the internal systems of heating, plumbing and wiring.", "Home inspection is currently regulated under a voluntary registration framework, administered by the Ontario Association of Home Inspectors. Unfortunately, it is my understanding that they were not consulted in the drafting of this proposed legislation.", "But I think it’s also an opportunity to have a discussion on the fundamental importance of having that third-party validation. What comes to mind whenever we’re talking about the kind of investment that a home is that we must not forget caveat emptor—buyer beware—and the fact that you have to be proactive in looking at that big investment you’re about to make.", "I have to tell a personal story: Years ago, when my husband and I were looking for a place, we saw one that, on the surface, we thought was absolutely perfect, and we were so excited that this particular piece of property was on the market. My mother said to me, “You know, dear, that’s an older house, and it’s got a complex property around it. You maybe should consult with somebody to find out what should happen. When you consider the cost of the house versus the cost of asking a home inspector to come and have a look at it, it would perhaps be a good investment.” Well, it was such a good investment that we didn’t buy the house. I often think of that as a demonstration of how important it is to have somebody with that kind of expertise.", "The other example I have is as an MPP, where a group of residents came to see me about some egregious things that were happening. They were happening in line with about 14 houses, where the garage and the house were sort of coming apart; they were separating. Of course, it meant pools of water collecting, it meant leakage into the basement—some serious concerns that they had. I tell this story because of the fact that it eventually drew in the local building inspector and other experts and so forth. This is a cautionary tale to tell about this particular example: that people need to understand that they have to drive this process, and that we can’t have building inspectors and home inspections and the two don’t meet, or there’s too much red tape or it’s too narrowly defined what is actually the purview of a town employee—the building inspector—and the home inspection person.", "I think this is well-intentioned, but we need to have further debate." ],

I’m no longer represented by the member from Toronto–Danforth; I’ve moved into the Beach. I didn’t have the opportunity to use a home inspector when I bought this property because the market was so hot. They put it on the market on a Friday. We saw it on Friday, saw it again on Saturday morning and bought it Saturday afternoon in what’s known as a bully bid, because they weren’t going to take offers until Tuesday. If I had to wait around to get a building inspector to take a look at it and reassure myself that it was worth the money, I would never have got it. So we just jumped right in.", "But my secret was that my real estate agent used to be a builder. My real estate agent, Roger Kilgour, is also known as Guy. Guy took me through the house—the little nooks and crannies—and did a check from a builder’s perspective. Guy is really knowledgeable about this, and using Guy’s advice, I go forward and we buy the house. In fact, we paid a little bit more than the asking price.

But it also means that the buyer alone is responsible for checking the quality and suitability of the goods before a purchase is made. That’s what a home inspector does for you, because you can’t be an expert in all things.", "So the buyer, exercising caveat emptor, goes and retains the professional services of someone in order to satisfy himself that that’s in fact the right thing to do. And I agree with the member from Timiskaming–Cochrane that there have to be penalties and insurances attached for errors and omissions. That’s an incredibly important part of this bill, and I think that the member from Trinity–Spadina has it absolutely right in the way he has framed the bill.", "I’m also delighted that this is going to a delegated administrative authority that is not going to cost the taxpayer of Ontario a cent, except for maybe the early minor cost of the set-up, but it’ll be paid for and administered on the basis of the fees they collect from the home inspectors, who could easily absorb this as part of the work they do.", "I would also like to say that I agree with the member for Whitby–Oshawa that there has to be greater oversight of delegated administrative authorities. I would be quite open—I hope the member will be—maybe to having that they are part of the sunshine list, because I think that the public, as part of its protection, should know how much we’re paying senior administrators in all of our delegated authorities, including the Electrical Safety Authority, because that is where money hits the road: What are we paying those executives to protect the public?

It affects everything, in terms of quality of life to the taxes they pay to where their children will go to school.

In addition, Chris Watson is here from CUPE. Welcome back to Queen’s Park, and thanks for being here today.", "This piece of legislation is long overdue. I think there is some consensus around supporting Bill 167, which, given the body of evidence with regard to poor contract oversight, expense and cost to human life, shouldn’t be too surprising. This bill deals with public-private partnerships and the contracting out of public services with regard to P3s, what this government likes to call alternative financing procurement, specific to infrastructure. Given the stated investment promise of now $160 billion over 12 years, as announced in budget 2016, this debate is timely—given the growing and emerging trend of all levels of government, from all jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, to review and reverse the use of public-private partnerships; given their track record of poor service delivery, cost overruns and high cost of financing.", "In this province, recently, a respected academic at the University of Toronto argued that renting money from capital markets is more expensive than issuing government bonds because private investors pay significantly higher interest rates than governments do.", "The United Kingdom should serve as a cautionary tale for Ontario. The debate on public-private partnerships—or, as they are called in the UK, private financing initiatives—has come full circle. A 2011 National Audit Office report—the equivalent of our AG—said that the use of P3s “has the effect of increasing the cost of finance for public investments relative to what would be available to the government if it borrowed on its own account,” and “the price of finance is significant higher with a PFI.”", "Currently, the British government is paying for the mistakes of billions in P3 spending by slashing public services again and again, something we are already seeing in the province of Ontario.", "We should learn from these other jurisdictions that we need to be cautious about P3 contracts. Bill 167 provides a solution that ensures public oversight, transparency and accountability.", "Even municipalities in the United States—the city of Chicago is making changes to prevent future P3 boondoggles. In November 2015, their city council passed an ordinance requiring independent evaluation, public hearings and ongoing oversight among other safeguards that will be required for future privatizations of city assets or public services. Their planner even said that it will provide “an insurance policy for the public,” something we need in the province of Ontario. And we agree.", "Ontario’s Auditor General has done this province a great service by exposing and questioning the practice employed by Infrastructure Ontario around the design, build and financing of P3s. I hope that we can agree that no government should borrow money at rates as high as 28% when they can do so at 2.9%—noting that this was one of the first times that any Auditor General questioned the fundamental methodology of P3s.", "The Ontario Auditor General went on to question the whole underpinnings of the risk transfer justification. She found that there was absolutely no empirical data supporting the valuation of the cost of risks transferred to the private sector by P3s. The risks to justify the enormously higher costs, she reported, were anecdotal. Many people know the story now. She reviewed 74 P3 projects. She found that we paid $8 billion more than the traditional public procurement. That buys a lot of health care.", "It needs to be said that those who unequivocally defend the P3 model almost always have a pecuniary interest or a financial interest in the transfer of wealth from the public sector to the private sector. They defend their right to access public dollars, particularly with this government, as a right of access—almost an entitlement.", "We, on this side of the House, defend the public. We defend the citizens and their right to transparency of public dollars and their rights and privileges as citizens to have their roads maintained, to have access to a universal health care system and a strong publicly funded education system.", "This piece of legislation, Bill 167, asks the government—any government—to make the business case for contracting out of any public service. We believe the case does not exist, and we have the data and the evidence to prove it. But at the minimum, opening up this information to the broader public is in the public interest. Indeed, they have the right to this information.", "Now for a little context, Mr. Speaker: When I was first elected to Queen’s Park, in 2012, I entered this Legislature when it was embroiled in the gas plant scandal. A contempt motion had been tabled—eventually, an OPP investigation; charges were laid. A cover-up of a conspiracy was afoot. In fact, the court case is quite topical even today. I mention this because had Bill 167 been in place, it is highly unlikely that the government would have been in a position to agree to compensate TransCanada for lost profits even though it had no legal obligation to do so. You’ll remember: At the time, the Liberals pledged that TransCanada would be made whole. In this instance, the private and political interests trumped the public interest. We need to learn from this. The nature of those contracts remains a black mark on this government. The only reason we found out the full costing was because it was a minority government.", "Access to information about how this government spends your money should be more transparent, should be more responsible and should make more sense. And every dollar that is spent should have some direct correlation to benefiting the citizens of this province.", "Over the years, as privatizing public services becomes the default position of this government, the public becomes less and less aware of how tax dollars are being spent. This does not inspire confidence in our economy, our public service or our democracy.", "Let me be clear: New Democrats are not against working with the private sector, but we need to ensure that the public interest always comes first and is always protected.", "In 2014, Tom Walkom gave an overview of this government’s privatization agenda:", "“Ontario’s Liberal government has an almost pathological desire to involve the private sector in public business.", "“When awarding contracts for new power plants, it has favoured private electricity firms over publicly owned....", "“It is anxious to contract out the delivery of public medicare services to private clinics.", "“For a while, it even privatized regulation, giving industry groups the authority to charge consumers fees for handling electronic and other kinds of waste.", "“In one notorious case, the Liberal government established an arm’s-length public agency called Ornge to run the province’s air ambulance service. Then, inexplicably, it allowed this agency to set up a web of privately owned, profit-making subsidiaries.”", "It’s completely unacceptable.", "Finally, he went on to say that the government “insists that large-scale public construction projects, such as hospitals, be handled by private firms paid from the public purse.”", "This approach doesn’t even create good jobs, Mr. Speaker.", "As an aside, with regard to the Eglinton Crosstown transit project, for instance, Clive Thurston, who’s the chair of Construction Design Alliance Ontario and the president of the Ontario General Contractors Association, criticizes the bundling of P3 projects by stating: “Simply put, bundling the station and maintenance facility construction into one contract has hamstrung the tendering process, limited competition, stifled innovation, and isolated the small and medium-sized construction and design firms.” So this is actually hurting the economy.", "On the side of public service and contracting out, I don’t have enough time to go through all of the scandals, but the body of evidence is growing with each passing year, and it needs to stop.", "While some may say Bill 167 is onerous, by doing the due diligence you’ll actually be saving money down the line. This is a scandal-saving piece of legislation, and the government should be very interested in it.", "Just to review some of the contracting out and the privatization: We had the chemotherapy drug debacle between February 2012 and March 2013, when 1,200 patients at four hospitals in Ontario received watered-down chemotherapy drugs.", "We had the SAMS scandal, when this government introduced a new system for social assistance. It was expected to cost $242 million, and yet a year afterwards it was $50 million more, and $20 million in social assistance had been mistakenly overpaid, and some welfare recipients didn’t receive their intended payments. This system means it takes longer for people to qualify for social assistance, and low-income Ontarians are worse off than before. Outsourcing IT is not cheaper, it’s not more efficient, and it often hurts the people whom we’re supposed to be serving.", "The child abuse prevention database: This is a heart-breaking issue. CPIN is supposed to be, one day, a unified database connecting all children’s aid societies. This came out of the Jeffrey Baldwin inquest. It was supposed to be in place in February 2016; it will not be in place until 2019. Why is this acceptable, Mr. Speaker?", "The CCACs: The Auditor General found that 39% of the funding that went to CCACs was being contracted out and was going to profit, administration and bureaucracy.", "Road maintenance: While the government saved millions of dollars on road maintenance, the AG found that, in 2015, it was taking twice as long to clear highways to bare pavement, and people are being hurt. If Bill 167 had been in place, for instance, road maintenance contracts would not have been awarded to companies that didn’t even have the equipment to complete the work, that didn’t do the work because it affected their profit margins, that were then fined for not performing the work. And they wouldn’t have to explain why they haven’t even bothered to collect the $33 million in fines. It does amaze me, Mr. Speaker, that this government can’t collect MTO fines that they levied, but they can claw back social assistance from the poorest families in the province of Ontario.", "Finally, if this government was bound by Bill 167, they would have had to make the business case to sell off Hydro One, and that does not exist. It does not. This government, under the leadership of Ed Clark, has refused to share the economic analysis with the Financial Accountability Officer. This option would not have been open to the Premier and the Minister of Finance to sell off Hydro One. It is not in the interest of the people of this province. The people of this province know it, and moving ahead will only hurt them. Bill 167 would stop that.", "The sell-off of Hydro One is a breach of trust.", "I urge all parties to support this step forward for accountability and greater transparency in this bill." ],

In the same way, if only the MPP for Kitchener–Waterloo had checked to see what the government is already doing, she would have realized that much of what she’s proposing is already being undertaken.", "To be clear, I have no quarrel at all with the overreaching goal of the bill, which is transparency and accountability. What is at issue is how to achieve the transparency and accountability. What is at issue is the bill’s failure to recognize the strides that this government has already made in ensuring transparency and accountability across government, but especially around public-private partnerships.", "The bill sets out to—and I quote from the proposed bill: “The preliminary analysis”—", "Interjections." ],

We’ve already heard from the member from Kitchener–Waterloo around some of the specific boondoggles. We’re talking about Ornge air ambulance and a number of the other specifics that she raised, the big one of course being the $8 billion of overspending that this government undertook in their alternative financing and procurement model of financing infrastructure projects. I don’t think a day goes by when the Premier of this province doesn’t stand in her place and talk about all of the investments the Liberals are making on infrastructure and all of the plans that the Liberals have to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on infrastructure. And yet what they’re not telling the public is the fact that they’ve wasted billions of dollars on infrastructure. What we should be getting is a tally of how many subways we could have built if the priority of the Liberals hadn’t been making sure they were feathering the nests of their friends and of the well-connected on Bay Street instead of making sure that every single public dollar goes to the benefit of the general public in the province of Ontario.", "However, there are certainly a number of my colleagues who are also going to want to speak to this bill, so I’m not going to take too much time myself, except to say that it is much too important an initiative to continue to ignore. I congratulate the member for Kitchener–Waterloo for actually bringing forward some practical ideas about how to clean up what this government has been doing when it comes to infrastructure and privatization.", "I say that because we know that the privatization schemes have gone as badly as the infrastructure schemes and they need to be cleaned up. It’s unfortunate because infrastructure is something that actually can do a lot for the province. It certainly creates jobs. It allows us to ensure that we can train the next generation of workers, for example, in terms of the apprenticeship programs for registered apprenticeships and making sure that the tradespeople are able to train their next generation of people to help us to make sure our infrastructure is safe and of the highest quality.", "When you’re doing things the way that this government is doing them, the way that was described by the member for Kitchener–Waterloo, we don’t get those benefits because what happens is we end up in a situation where one hand doesn’t know what the other hand is doing, where we have 20 different general contractors on a site, nobody knows who the boss is and everybody is working at cross purposes. That’s certainly the feedback that I’ve gotten in terms of these megaprojects that the government puts out to tender.", "There certainly needs to be some work done there, and this bill goes a long way to do that. In fact, one of the things that the president of the Ontario Public Service Employees Union, Smokey Thomas, who’s here with us today, says about this bill is that it lifts the veil on the contracting out and privatization that this government has been undertaking. I think it’s absolutely time that that veil is lifted.", "There are certainly some of the things more recently around SAMS and the boondoggle on the IT with SAMS and other ones that I’m sure are coming down the pike, but there are more things than that. When you look at what has happened with privatization in this province, we see so many services and so many initiatives that the public used to have provided by a reliable, accountable, transparent public process that are now in the hands of the private sector. I think about things like driver testing, for example. ServiceOntario has gone through I don’t know how many iterations. In fact, this government put a bunch of kiosks out there to take the place of real people and then had to dial that back because that was a big mistake as well.", "There’s no doubt that there needs to be much more scrutiny and much more attention to what this government is doing when it’s privatizing our public services because what we end up with is not only mistakes like the ones that happened with the chemotherapy drugs but mistakes that can actually be life-threatening. We’ve seen mistakes that occur because people’s private information that they trust their government will keep private ends up getting into the hands of people that have no business getting that information. I think the people of Ontario would much rather have their personal and private information in the hands of trusted public workers than they would in some private company who’s more interested in profiting off of it than anything else—selling that information, perhaps, to some of their other colleagues in the private sector.", "There are many instances in the health care sector where we’ve seen privatization. We’ve seen labs, for example, in hospitals being sent out to the private sector, and now all of a sudden there’s consolidation in those labs and some of them are shutting down. If it was a public service, you could be sure that the government would be responsible and responsive to complaints about shutting down lab services. Now that they’re in the private sector, it’s all about how the private sector can get more money and more economy of scale for lab services because they’re no longer being done in the hospital to the extent that they were, Speaker. Again, the further privatization of hospital services is a serious concern of Ontarians.", "When I first became elected, I was serving as a councillor at city council. This was when the Conservative government downloaded all kinds of services to municipalities. I sat in one of my first meetings where the head of that region was pushing a sole-source contract for paramedics in my community, and if it wasn’t for me realizing that this is not only a sole-source contract but a contracting out of public services, that’s quite possibly something that could have happened in Hamilton. That’s not acceptable and certainly not what Hamiltonians would have wanted to see.", "Of course, the biggest privatization that’s facing the people of Ontario these days is the privatization of Hydro One.", "I haven’t done the math yet, I haven’t done the tallying yet—I shouldn’t call it “math”—but I have to say that I’m pretty concerned that, just looking at the budget numbers that we’ve seen year over year the last number of years, we are seeing a significant erosion of the quality and the accountability of the services provided to the people of Ontario because the Premier of Ontario has actually implemented the promises from the Conservatives’ playbook in the last election. So I don’t know if it’s 100,000 jobs yet, but I expect it’s getting pretty close." ],

I’m happy to support legislation that has the potential to improve transparency and accountability, and I look forward to hearing more from other colleagues who are debating this matter.", "Just as a personal experience that I’ve had overseeing how large-scale procurements for major infrastructure projects are done—I note that the leader of the third party mused as to how many more subways could have been built if we had not used P3. Well, Mr. Speaker, as a commissioner of the Toronto Transit Commission, I fought for the TTC to undertake a proper P3 process for the York-University-Spadina extension. The commission chose not to and now we see massive cost overruns and multi-year delays on that project. The chair of the TTC at that time was, I believe, the one-time president of the NDP. He was very opposed to a P3 model. Now we’re paying hundreds of millions of dollars more, and commuters in northwestern Toronto and Vaughan aren’t able to use the subway, which should have already been opened.

Speaker, we have seen, in the college sector in this province, a very dramatic shift toward the privatization of educational programming and the contracting out of educational services. We just have to look at what happened with Algonquin and Niagara setting up campuses in Saudi Arabia. We know that Algonquin College lost almost $1.5 million of public money in just one year by setting up that Saudi campus. This was an arrangement that was supposed to generate profits of over $20 million in five years. It is nowhere on track to do that. Those are public dollars that are being used to support a private partnership. We also saw Niagara College lose almost $1 million on its Saudi campus.", "Now, the government, thankfully, has seen the error of its ways and announced that those men-only campuses will be reversed.

It’s something that the NDP, federally and provincially, has campaigned on in the past and continues to campaign on. We want a system that is fair, that is effective and that is transparent.", "I have to say that the bill before us—and the cap-and-trade system described in the bill before us—falls short of those standards, and it needs substantial improvement. It needs to be improved because without changes, it will damage the credibility of climate action in Ontario and won’t give the changes that are needed to actually come to grips with climate change.", "The government of the past has needlessly undermined public support for environmental initiatives, because it failed to heed warnings and listen to expert advice. Climate change, Speaker, is too important. We can’t afford to make mistakes when we’re dealing with this issue. The government needs to get this right. It needs to listen to various voices in this Legislature and across this province, so that whatever bill finally comes before us for a vote is one that will actually be effective, will be fair, will be transparent.", "The Ontario NDP wants to make sure that the cap-and-trade system doesn’t disproportionately burden low-income Ontarians, or Ontarians with little control over their emissions. Northern Ontarians, people living in remote communities, people who lack access to transit or clean energy: Those people should not bear a disproportionate share of what it will take to make a change. The government needs to help these people reduce their carbon footprints and to save money. It also needs to help them financially get through the transition to a carbon-free future.", "In British Columbia and soon in Alberta, low-income families get a rebate to help offset the cost of carbon. In California, there’s a law requiring that a certain percentage of cap-and-trade revenues be spent on programs that benefit disadvantaged communities.", "Speaker, those are very positive steps taken by California and taken by British Columbia. Unfortunately, no such measures exist in this bill. I say to the Liberals in this chamber that they have a working majority. They can amend this bill and make it address the issues that are addressed substantively in other jurisdictions, without undermining the efforts necessary to come to grips with climate change, and at the same time building the political support that will allow this program to last more than two years.", "I have to say that I have followed climate politics globally. I watched, with interest and despair, what happened in Australia when the carbon pricing system in Australia was used as a bludgeon against the Australian Labor Party—their coalition with the Greens. It was used by the Liberal and the National Party as a bludgeon, to roll back those changes and undermine climate action on that continent.", "The Quebec government announced its climate change action plan to much fanfare 10 years ago. However, a 2013 report found that Quebec had only cut their greenhouse gas emissions by about 10% of their original goal.", "The Ontario government is promising even greater reductions than Quebec had put on the table, with fewer tools. This government needs to learn from the mistakes made in Quebec, and they need to know that we and Ontarians across this province want to see real results, a real reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. They don’t just want messaging. They don’t simply want a wonderful-sounding bill or a wonderful-sounding plan. They want to see this risk, this looming crisis shunted aside. They want to see this province protected.", "This government has recently announced $325 million worth of programs to be funded from cap-and-trade revenues, but there are no greenhouse gas reduction targets connected to any of the programs that were announced. Although some good work is featured, and that needs to be acknowledged, the investment in co-op and non-profit housing for energy conservation retrofits—badly needed and wisely invested in, but at the same time, greenhouse gas reduction targets weren’t tied to those investments. That’s critical in terms of determining whether, in the end, the investments were effective, and for the public to know whether or not these investments are ones that are going to make a difference in our lives.", "We in the NDP want to see greenhouse gas reduction programs that have real impact. We don’t simply want a slush fund established by this bill, which will not provide targeted, verifiable, effective change.", "The government’s so-called greenhouse gas reduction account is not a special-purpose account. It is an accounting fiction that gives the government total flexibility in how it spends the cap-and-trade revenues.", "Because this bill is of great importance, I’ve actually gone door to door in my riding, doing a canvas poll, stopping at doors, outlining what’s in the bill and asking people’s opinions. I have to say there’s a lot of support for climate action but a great deal of concern about how the money will be spent and whether it will be spent transparently. I would say there are two great Achilles heels for the government with this bill, and one is ensuring that the money is spent and seen to be spent on the goals that have been outlined, and the other is fairness. If those two pieces are missing, this bill, this system that is put in place, will be vulnerable to being rolled back and thrown out in the future. That would be a loss.", "The NDP wants the money to flow to a separate account that is separately and transparently audited and directly connected to targeted, measurable and independently verifiable greenhouse gas reductions.", "One other feature: This act allows the cap-and-trade system and its administration to be delegated to an unaccountable private corporation that is not subject to public oversight. We’ve had issues in this province with delegated authorities in the past. The TSSA, the Technical Standards and Safety Authority: That authority did not and has not responded to the public. It has been a problem for the people of Ontario, as well as for the government of Ontario. That approach does not cut it in terms of making this bill useful.", "Speaker, I appreciate the chance to speak to the bill. I recognize that we’re talking very high stakes here—high stakes environmentally, politically and economically.", "The environmental stakes: A failure to take effective action means that we will not be able to curb rising global temperatures, and a failure to act means much higher food prices for us here in Canada and, in many parts of the world, a lack of food. It means a world of unstable and extreme weather that will put people’s lives and property at risk. Those are very high stakes.", "There are political stakes. No matter what option any government picks for action on climate change, there will be a battle because we’re changing the way society is structured. We’re changing who is getting wealthy off that society and who is not. So when you make a choice, when a Legislature makes a decision as to what policy direction it should take, it needs to find options that will unify as many people as possible, rather than dividing as much as possible. It has to put forward an approach that secures the greatest possible buy-in. For that reason alone, it’s critical that fairness be incorporated into this bill, because without fairness, you won’t get the buy-in. It’s as simple as that.", "Lastly, the economic stakes that are tied to the previous two: Climate change will disrupt our economy. It was interesting to me, reading an article today about an extension of the Yonge subway up into Newmarket. One of the options for dealing with commuters from north of the city is to use rail lines coming in, but unfortunately, because of more extreme weather events, those rail lines are now vulnerable to flooding. So, Speaker, we will see, in this society, more and more constraint on our economic activities, and more and more constraint on our economic possibilities, if we are not able to bring climate change under control.", "Again, in order to get it right, this bill will have to be fair, it will have to be transparent and it will have to be effective. In order to get it right, this bill will have to be part of a larger climate change program that will be fair, transparent and effective, because I believe that pricing carbon is a part of a larger plan, and it cannot be the whole plan. If it is, then that is too small a set of tools to actually accomplish the purpose.", "This bill has to be understood in the context of the state of the climate today and what will be coming at us tomorrow. The world, Speaker, is heating up and changing faster than we projected even five years ago. Arctic sea ice, which plays a major role in shaping our climate—some climatologists refer to it as “the world’s thermostat”—is melting at a much faster rate than all of the climate models around the world had ever predicted. As you disrupt that thermostat, you disrupt local weather everywhere. The past two winters we went through were extremely cold here in Ontario. But in Alaska, they were quite warm. As the polar ice cap melts, the rhythm of the seasons is changed, and the potential for disruption becomes far greater.", "Yet, Speaker, world action on climate change has been completely inadequate. In 2013, Kevin Anderson, who’s the deputy director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at the University of Manchester in the UK, sent a letter about our global failures to the office of the president of the European Commission. Now, I had an opportunity at the Paris climate summit to listen to Mr. Anderson. He’s a well-recognized climatologist—a bright guy; tough thinker; good with math. He wrote about the European Union’s 2030 climate targets. He wrote:", "have been released into the atmosphere. As a result, in 2013 the scale of mitigation”—the scale of action that has to be taken to cut greenhouse gas emissions—“required is now an order of magnitude more challenging than it was in 1990.”", "Speaker, if it was hard in 1990, it’s 10 times harder now, because 20 years have just passed without the action that was necessary. You don’t see a 60% increase in global carbon dioxide levels without a recognition that what’s been done to date has been a failure. He notes that the European Union “must acknowledge this reality if it is ever to catalyze meaningful action on climate change.”", "We too, Speaker, in this Legislative Assembly, have to recognize that reality: that there have been more than two lost decades on this; and that with this bill, we have to have an approach that will actually deliver, and deliver in a way that people in Ontario can buy into, and deliver in a way that actually will make meaningful change.", "Increasingly, scientists are talking about the possibility of abrupt climate change. If you talked to scientists 15 years ago, they would have talked about changes happening over a horizon of a century or a century and a half—largely smooth, incremental changes. Those would have been hard enough to adapt to, even at a slow but steady rate of change. Increasingly, it’s being put forward that we are looking at a situation of abrupt climate change, where we would be looking at jagged changes in the world environment that would push many people and many societies to the breaking point.", "I just note that in the United States, NASA follows this issue, has a website and publishes current scientific information. They note that the earth is currently projected to warm between 2 and 6 degrees Celsius in the next century. That’s a lot, Speaker. According to them, when global warming has happened at various times in the past two million years, it has taken the planet about 5,000 years to warm 5 degrees—about a thousandth of a degree per year. The predicted rate of warming for the next century is at least 20 times faster.", "In the past century alone, temperatures climbed 0.7 degrees Celsius, roughly 10 times faster than the average rate of Ice Age recovery warming. That means we are exposed to a whole range of risks that have never been seen before. We are entering a whole unknown territory of risks and changes, and we can’t fully know the scale of risk that we’re facing.", "Speaker, I like to hike in winter. When it’s a good minus 25 or minus 30, I can walk out on a frozen lake and know that I’m safe—a beautiful place to walk. But if you do that in late winter when the ice has begun to melt, even though it’s covered with snow and looks beautiful, you can’t tell where that ice is particularly thin. Speaker, we are in a similar situation. We are walking on ice that increasingly is finding thin patches worn into that surface. We don’t know when things will change abruptly, but we have a very good chance that they will. This is literally true.", "Tyler Hamilton wrote in the Toronto Star the other day about Deer Lake, in northern Ontario. It’s a First Nation community that depends on ice roads for goods to get into that community. It has depended on those roads for decades.", "He writes: “Historically, those roads could be relied on for 70 to 80 days during winter months. But shorter and warmer winters have significantly narrowed that window, sometimes to fewer than 30 days.", "“No community is more aware of the risks than Deer Lake ... former deputy chief Henry Meekis drowned in late 2012 after the ice-road grooming machine he was driving plunged through the ice.”", "My guess, Speaker, is that he had gone and groomed those ice roads for many years before that, on the assumption that the ice was frozen solid and he would be safe.", "I have to say that the scale of economic risk is one that has not often been addressed. In 2006, the British government commissioned a study. It’s called the Stern Review, after its author, Lord Stern, who commented on the scale of risk. At that time, he wasn’t talking about how quickly things could come on; he was talking about the level of disruption we faced.", "He wrote, “If no action is taken to reduce emissions, the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could reach double its pre-industrial level as early as 2035, virtually committing us to a global average temperature rise of over 2 degrees Celsius.”", "Speaker, it is generally acknowledged globally—and it may be optimistic—that a 2-degree centigrade rise is the maximum the world could sustain without dramatic disruption.", "“Our actions,” he wrote, “over the coming few decades could create risks of major disruption to economic and social activity, later in this century and in the next, on a scale similar to those associated with the great wars and the economic depression of the first half of the 20th century.”", "Which person in this House would not see it as critical to avoid a disruption like the Great Depression? Which person in this House, in this Legislature, would not think it important to avoid years as catastrophic as those of World War II?", "He noted as well the “emerging evidence of risks that higher temperatures will trigger massive system ‘surprises,’ such as the melting and collapse of ice sheets and sudden shifts in regional weather patterns like the monsoons. Thus there is a danger that feedbacks could generate abrupt and large-scale changes in the climate and still further losses.”", "Speaker, real solutions to climate change are deeply connected to income inequality. Right now, for the last few decades, the vast majority of people have seen their income stagnate or drop. It means they are pushed hard. They don’t want to see a further drop in their standard of living. And when you push them, Speaker, they will push back. I raise this because any plan that is brought forward to take on climate change has got to be one that addresses fairness and income inequality at the same time .Without that, it will not stand the test of time. It will not get the buy-in that’s required.", "We’ve been through this debate before. I was here in 2009, when the last cap-and-trade bill was introduced. I would say that those who were here for that debate should be forgiven for any level of cynicism they might feel about the intentions of the Liberal government when it comes to action.", "I’ll quote the Minister of the Environment at the time, Mr. John Gerretsen. On September 14, 2009, he said that “we are truly dealing with a phenomenon, with a situation, that absolutely has to be dealt with, and we as a government are doing something about it within the province of Ontario.” It was only seven years ago.", "“We all know that it will take bold action and a range of strong concerted efforts from every level of government—federal and provincial, in North America, Europe and elsewhere around the world, and across every sector of society—to tackle this challenge.”", "He went on to say, “That’s why our government has made tackling climate change our most critical environmental property.” I think he meant “priority,” but anyway: “It is, for example, why we introduced our climate change action plan in 2007, with bold, ambitious greenhouse gas reduction targets in line with some of the leading jurisdictions in North America.”", "That climate plan sank without a trace. It left no imprint on the world. The recession, and the closure of coal—something that was started long before that climate plan, something supported by all parties in this Legislature—that plan had virtually no impact. The recession and the closure of coal plants gave us what reductions we’ve had, and as there has been some recovery from the recession, the lack of a real climate program has meant our emissions have continued to climb. Using a recession as a climate change strategy is a bad plan. It’s just a bad plan.", "That’s the background, Speaker. That’s what has been said and done in the past. That’s the scale of the risk and crisis that we’re facing. Now I want to talk to the bill itself.", "The NDP has stressed three main principles for the upcoming cap-and-trade system: that it be effective, that it be fair and that it be transparent. So let’s apply these principles to assessing the bill itself.", "Talking about effectiveness: We need to have measures that will actually, in a verifiable way, cut greenhouse gas emissions, and we have to have targets that will get us where we want to go to. We have to have accountability.", "First, I want to talk about the targets that are set out in the bill. These targets are not as ambitious as the European Union targets, which one can find easily with a quick Google search. Their target is a 20% reduction in 2020, a 40% reduction in 2030 and an 80% reduction in 2050—2050, Speaker. Very few of us will be around for that date. Maybe the pages that are sitting up with you at the front, but most of the rest of the people sitting in this Legislature won’t be around for that date.", "I have to note that the targets set by the European Union reflect the fact that there is differing ability on the part of different nation states to actually take action. Some have natural resources that give them an opportunity to act more quickly. Some are wealthier; some are less wealthy. So this is the target for the European Union as a whole. The United Kingdom—their government has a climate act that takes those EU targets, sets them as the baseline and then sets deeper targets, reflecting the fact that the UK is much more well off than a country like Poland. It’s simply the reality.", "In the UK, they’ve set up a climate change committee by statute that advises the government. It works with the government on doing their carbon budgets, and they reported that in the UK, “emissions were 35% below 1990 levels in 2014 and the first carbon budget has been met.” Note—to my colleagues—that Ontario’s target was 6% below 1990 levels in 2014 and was only met because of the recession.", "The UK has much more aggressive targets. Their target for 2025 is a 50% reduction compared to 1990 levels—much more aggressive. Even then, I’m not saying that the UK is a climate change utopia; I’m just saying that on the face of it, they are looking at the problem and realizing that they have to be far more aggressive than is being proposed in this bill.", "We need more aggressive climate change targets. We need better climate change programs because, as I said earlier, we have had two lost decades.", "Cap-and-trade is not enough to meet the targets that we need to set. It’s not enough to meet the targets that have already been set. In the UK, there’s a recognition that the cap-and-trade program is only part of what has to be done by society as a whole to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. In their most recent plan, 60% of their reductions come from activities outside cap-and-trade—the European Union emissions trading system—and 40% come from the cap-and-trade sector.", "In California, 15% of California’s greenhouse gas reductions come from their cap-and-trade program. In Ontario, the way we’ve seen planned so far, it looks like 100%. What it appears to me is that this government really has abandoned this since 2007, finds itself way behind and is opening the door to buying large numbers of credits from California to at least say on paper that we’ve met our targets. That is problematic because we need to invest here in Ontario. We need to invest financially. We need to put in place regulation to dramatically cut the use of fossil fuels here in Ontario, and that is because, to the extent that we invest here and we regulate here, we create more jobs here, and, frankly, we reduce other air pollution problems that come from the burning of fossil fuels, not just greenhouse gas emissions.", "We need to learn from what’s gone wrong with other jurisdictions. In 2006, the Quebec government announced an action plan to spend $1.55 billion over six years to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 14.6 megatonnes by 2012. However, a 2013 report found that Quebec had only cut greenhouse gas emissions by less than two megatonnes—only about 10% of their original goal.", "The report found that Quebec’s plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions related to the transportation of merchandise resulted in a mere 8% cut as compared to the plan’s projections.", "Another plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, food production, forestry and municipalities resulted in a cut that was less than 1% of the plan’s projections.", "L’Association québécoise de lutte contre la pollution atmosphérique described the poor results as a “fiasco.” Greenpeace was similarly scathing, saying that the government’s great-sounding climate change plan had collapsed like a deflated balloon.", "Quebec’s Sustainable Development Commissioner warned about these disappointing results in his 2012 report which revealed that Quebec would not meet its 2012 GHG reduction targets. The report also said that the problems were evident from the beginning, noting that the government’s plan lacked defined goals, timelines and accountability measures: “The objectives are vague and are neither quantified nor accompanied by a timetable. The strategy is therefore general in scope; it does not make it possible to anticipate results or evaluate government performance over time.”", "We need to look at what went wrong in Quebec and we need to make sure that we don’t repeat their mistakes. It’s vital.", "British Columbia’s climate change policies similarly came under fire from its Auditor General, John Doyle. In 2013, Doyle reviewed British Columbia’s carbon-neutral government policy which obliged BC’s public sector to become carbon neutral through the purchase of carbon offsets from private companies. Doyle found that “the majority of offsets purchased to meet government’s carbon-neutral goal in 2010 were not credible.” The government was paying offsets to private companies for carbon reductions that would have happened anyway without the offset program.", "Doyle examined two projects that received 70% of BC’s public offset money in 2010. The Auditor General said, “In industry terms, these projects would be known as ‘free riders.’ Together, they received $6 million in revenue for something that would have happened anyway.”", "The British Columbia government rejected the Auditor General’s report, claiming the Auditor General lacked the necessary expertise to understand the complexities of the offset program. It sort of reminds me of a situation we’ve seen here with our own Auditor General, rightly criticizing electricity planning in Ontario. Even so, Speaker, BC later closed down the Pacific Carbon Trust, the government’s crown carbon offset agency, and transferred the offset program to the environment ministry.", "The government’s Cap and Trade Program Design Options document says, “Cap-and-trade will be the primary tool for achieving Ontario’s 2020 target.” Again, Speaker, contrast that with California, which projects that 85% of its emissions reductions will come from complementary programs other than cap-and-trade. I think this is a fundamental problem in Ontario’s strategy, and one that has to be addressed: an over-reliance on cap-and-trade when it comes to greenhouse gas reductions.", "Cap-and-trade can be a useful thing; carbon pricing can be a useful thing. But it has to be understood in the perspective of a larger climate action plan and not be subjected to a whole bunch of hype about what it can do when, normally, it doesn’t do it—it’s not used that way. Effectiveness is a key matter. Let’s learn from those other jurisdictions. Let’s not repeat their mistakes.", "I now want to speak to the question of fairness—fairness, first of all, for low- and middle-income households, and the need to provide for low-income and northern and remote support. Unfortunately, we don’t see that in this bill or the minister’s statements or the consultation document that the ministry put out a few months ago. That, Speaker, is a shocker. I don’t think BC is a particularly progressive jurisdiction, but they recognize that it was something that had to be addressed.", "When you look at the UK’s climate budgeting plans, they actually talk about fuel poverty and how to address it. I have to say, I don’t expect that they run an energy utopia. I would be shocked if anyone would say they ran an energy utopia, but they at least recognized that this is a substantial issue—one that has to be addressed, one that has to be taken into account—when they put together their climate plans.", "In British Columbia, the carbon tax system provides up to $200 per year per household for rural and northern households. In British Columbia, low-income households are paid rebates to help cope with higher fuel prices—almost $400 per year for a family of four. Speaker, we can have a debate about whether that’s the right amount or the wrong amount, but I have to say, that jurisdiction has gone through elections in which the carbon tax survived because they actually made concessions to fairness. A refusal to make concessions to fairness does not augur well for the future of this program.", "When you think about it, we have a health care system that benefits the whole society. Certainly it benefits individuals, but it benefits the whole society. We understand that people with high incomes are in a position to put more money in, and those with low incomes can only put in a small amount of money. But we know that the society as a whole benefits from funding of health care through a progressive tax system. We understand the benefits that come from that.", "Taking action on climate change will benefit the whole society. Some will be able to contribute more than others, and the program and the plan have to be structured to recognize that and build in that support.", "Low-income people spend a disproportionate share of their income on home heating, motor vehicle fuel and other expenses. Policies that increase the costs of these expenditures will have a disproportionate impact on low-income households.", "A 2011 report, which was updated in 2013, by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives and the Sierra Club, studied British Columbia’s carbon tax from a perspective of fairness and social justice. The CCPA and Sierra Club noted that the carbon footprint of the people in the top 20% of income earners is not quite double that of people in the bottom 20%. Yes, high-income people burn more fossil fuels than low-income people. Meanwhile, the median after-tax income in the top group is more than five times the median after-tax income in the bottom group.", "They write: “Relative to income, a carbon tax, like sales or consumption taxes, will have a regressive pattern—that is, low-income individuals and families will pay a greater share of their income to the tax because they consume all of their available income, and more”—they use household debt to fill in that gap—“and pay a greater proportion of their household budgets for energy. Higher-income households will pay more tax in absolute dollars because they consume more, but will pay a smaller share of that income to the tax.”", "The Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives and Sierra Club report also notes that lower-income households have much less control over their emissions. “For example, renters in apartment buildings will have more difficulty reducing heat or making investments in energy efficiency upgrades, and people living in suburban or rural areas will be much more automobile-dependent for their mobility.” It’s simple reality.", "The Minister of Agriculture is here. He can speak about people in the rural areas around Peterborough who, my guess is, have to rely on their cars much more than people in downtown Toronto, because in the downtown part of Toronto, Ottawa and Hamilton, there are transit systems. However inadequate we may find them at times, they are there, and they’re an option.", "The CCPA and Sierra Club report recommends a higher low-income rebate for British Columbia: “Half of carbon tax revenues should be used to fund a new refundable tax credit that reaches more households than the current low-income credit. We model a scenario where the bottom half of households”—and that’s up to $60,000 worth of income—“would receive, on average, more in credits than they pay in carbon tax.”", "In 2014, the Pembina Institute, well regarded in these matters, put out a fact sheet that identified four principles of a fair and effective carbon pricing system. One of these principles was, “Help low-income families be part of the solution.”", "In its submission to the provincial government in December 2015, the Canadian Environmental Law Association recommended: “There should be a legislated requirement to use revenue from the cap-and-trade program to counteract impacts of the program on low-income communities.”", "The submission recommends that at least 25% of cap-and-trade revenue, possibly more, should be used to mitigate the impacts on “low-income, First Nation and other marginalized communities.”", "Then the Canadian Environmental Law Association reaffirmed these principles in its February 2016 briefing, Fair and Equitable Carbon Pricing: Comments on Ontario’s Cap and Trade Program.", "I’m going to quote from that report because I think it should exist in our record, and because I think what they have to say is very important. They say, “The burdens of climate change are fundamentally unjust: Vulnerable communities that are responsible for the least carbon emissions are faced with the most severe effects of climate change. It is essential that Ontario achieve rapid and deep emissions reductions, however, carbon pricing programs are known to be regressive in that they unevenly affect vulnerable, low-income communities.”", "The cap-and-trade legislation must also provide explicit support for low-income and vulnerable communities in this transition. CELA, the Canadian Environmental Law Association, notes that the Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change “indicated that it considers the issue of the use of proceeds from the cap-and-trade program not to be strictly within the scope of the program design.”", "Well, Speaker, if you want to be really strict, that may be true, but if you’re talking about a program that works for the people of Ontario overall, you can’t just be a technocrat. You have to think about people across the income spectrum, across the geographical spectrum, and design your program accordingly.", "They write, “The design of the cap-and-trade program, however, will determine whether Ontario will have the resources to assist low-income communities with carbon reduction, or whether it will impose the double burden of climate change and regressive carbon pricing impacts on those most in need.”", "They note that “when Ontario experiences more frequent and severe extreme weather events, low-income individuals and remote communities are most vulnerable to infrastructure disruptions. The rising price of food caused by disruptions to the global production/supply chain will impact already food-insecure, low-income communities the hardest. Changes to plant and animal species ranges and the surge in invasive species will disproportionately affect First Nations traditional and subsistence food sources.”", "They conclude, “The cap-and-trade program, as proposed, does not adequately protect marginalized Ontarians. Their disproportionately high burden of climate change is twofold: They experience the negative impacts of a changing climate much more severely, and they are most affected by the pass-through costs of carbon pricing. Ontario’s cap-and-trade proposal is an opportunity to tackle greenhouse gas emissions while also lifting underprivileged communities out of a cycle of poverty.”", "Speaker, their paper is thoughtful, comprehensive, logical and in tune with the realities of Ontario. But they aren’t the only ones who have made such comments. The Clean Economy Alliance in their report Getting It Right: Design Recommendations for Ontario’s Cap-and-Trade System recommended that some cap-and-trade revenues be used for “mitigation of climate impacts on low-income and otherwise marginalized communities.”", "As I noted previously, BC’s carbon tax has a special rebate for low-income families. A 2012 California law mandates that at least 25% of cap-and-trade auction revenues must be spent on programs that benefit disadvantaged communities. Alberta’s new carbon tax plan proposes a consumer rebate, which would be sufficient to offset the impact of carbon pricing on most households in the bottom 60% of income in Alberta and would make most low-income Albertans much better off.", "Speaker, it is not politically impossible to design climate programs that actually make a difference in terms of low-income households. It is entirely possible. In fact, it is politically necessary and ethically necessary to make those changes.", "Meanwhile, the Ontario government’s Cap-and-Trade Program Design Options document from November 2015 lists “Overarching Design Principles.” The principle of fairness is not one that is listed, nor does fairness receive much consideration in the government stakeholder feedback report from January 2016.", "In Ontario, people living in remote and northern communities face a disproportionate burden with few options available for reducing it. Not only are their energy needs greater because of colder temperatures, they often lack access to low-carbon choices that are commonly available in southern Ontario, such as transit. In fact, while GO bus service in the south is subsidized and carries no sales tax, the Ontario Northland bus service is expected to be self-funding, and riders must pay HST on their fares. In order to cut costs, the Ontario Northland transit corporation recently raised fares by 6%, closed bus terminals and reduced service. Is that going to help people take on greenhouse gas emissions? Will that help them cut their car use? I don’t think so. This comes after the government promised enhanced bus service to replace the Ontario Northland rail service, which the government cut in 2012.", "One can say very clearly that here is a program, on one side, saying that we’re going to do a lot about greenhouse gas reductions, and on the other side, concrete actions that make it more difficult for people in northern Ontario to reduce their carbon footprint. That does not augur well for the Liberal climate plan.", "I want to turn lastly to the question of transparency. In the 2015 Ontario Economic Outlook and Fiscal Review, the government projects that the cap-and-trade system will generate $300 million in 2016-17 and $1.3 billion in 2017-18. The government has committed to “ensuring that all proceeds from a cap-and-trade program would be dedicated to actions that reduce GHG emissions and build the foundation of new sustainable prosperity for the province’s households and businesses.”", "In the fiscal review, the government also proposed to create a Green Investment Fund “that will be targeted at reducing greenhouse gas emissions while strengthening the economy. Through this initial investment, the fund will support energy retrofits in homes (including affordable housing), energy-efficiency investments in small and medium-sized businesses and industry, support for aboriginal communities, and new investments in electric vehicle infrastructure.” The fund will be seeded by a $325-million down payment—government sources all.", "But it’s not clear whether all cap-and-trade funds will flow to the fund or exactly what it means for cap-and-trade revenue to be dedicated, and this is a government that likes to play games with dedicated funds, as we’ve seen with last December’s very quiet dismantling of the Trillium Trust as a special-purpose account dedicated to infrastructure. Playing games with climate change funds is playing with dynamite: dangerous all around.", "The bill before us sets up an accounting procedure known as the greenhouse gas reduction account to track accounting transactions associated with the cap-and-trade system. Unlike the existing greenhouse gas reduction account that was established with Bill 185 in 2009 to receive cap-and-trade revenue, this new account does not record the in-flows and out-flows of money like a piggy bank. The greenhouse gas reduction account is now an abstract accounting procedure with rules for when the balance in the account may increase and when it can decrease. Carbon allowance sale revenue, system fees and penalties are to be recognized by an entry in the account, which is not the same thing—not at all the same thing—as saying that cap-and-trade money will actually flow into this account. The balance of the account can be reduced by an amount equal to any expenditure related, and I love this phrasing, “directly or indirectly”—because indirectly can be pretty tenuous.", "My colleague from Parkdale–High Park can talk about the Union Pearson Express and how someone might say that indirectly it helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions. One could then say, “Well, we could allocate money to the deficit from the Union Pearson Express,” and the money will have been correctly allocated. I think people would go out of their minds. I think they would be extraordinarily angry.", "Speaker, it’s not just this language, “directly or indirectly,” talking about expenditures for this greenhouse gas reduction account. We could talk about the administration or enforcement of the cap-and-trade program that the government believes “is reasonably likely to reduce, or support the reduction of, greenhouse gas and costs relating to any other initiatives that are reasonably likely to do so,” or any reimbursements to the government for costs related directly or indirectly to these purposes. We’re starting to get into really tenuous territory here, really vague “Yeah, it looks kind of green; I think we’ll pay for it out of that account” territory.", "In fact, the Financial Accountability Officer has commented on the most recent budget, and he has an interesting commentary. He says, “Assuming that both cap-and-trade proceeds and the expected new federal transfers will largely be tied to new spending initiatives, both sources of revenue may prove to be fiscally neutral....” But, he says, “It is unclear to what extent these new revenues”—he’s talking about cap-and-trade–-“will be directly tied to new program spending or can be used to fund existing spending commitments.” In other words, Speaker, this money that’s being collected could be used to flow and deal with other political problems the government has as long as someone can put a very thin coat of green paint on them—and maybe not even a full coat of paint, maybe just a green Magic Marker. That’s all you need.", "The criteria are loose and the accounting is so abstract, there’s no guarantee any of the cap-and-trade revenue will deliver meaningful, independently verifiable greenhouse gas reductions. That is a huge risk, and I say it to everyone in this chamber who’s concerned about climate change. To the extent that we reproduce what was done in British Columbia where a fund was set up that effectively had no impact on greenhouse gas reductions that allowed funding of projects that would have gone forward without that money; and to the extent that the people of Ontario don’t see this as legit, then the credibility of the program is profoundly undermined and the government needs to change this bill so that not only is the disposition of the money clean but it is seen and understood to be clean. It needs it for credibility. That is a great moment in this bill, in this matter.", "The legislation is written to allow cap-and-trade money to be applied even against projects that are already funded within the current fiscal framework, thus freeing up money to be spent on anything. Right now, the minister must provide a review to the Treasury Board for any project whose funding is to be attributed to the greenhouse gas reduction account. This review may—may—consider various things, such as potential greenhouse gas reductions of the initiative or its relationship to the action plan. There appears to be no requirement that the review be made public.", "What if the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change gets a program proposal put on his desk and he concludes that this won’t make any difference at all? The Treasury Board or the management board can say, “We want that project anyway. Your review will never be public. It’ll be buried. It’s a cabinet document. No one will ever read this.” The ability for people to hold the government to account and feel that they can hold the government to account is profoundly weak the way this is written, and that undermines climate action in this province. That undermines climate action.", "The experience in Quebec shows why this could be a concern. Just like Ontario’s proposal, all the revenues from Quebec’s cap-and-trade system are committed to a Green Fund. But an April 2015 report from Clean Energy Canada summarizing the findings of various observers of Quebec’s cap-and-trade system questioned the transparency of the Green Fund expenditures, noting that this money often serves “highly political objectives.”", "The Green Fund spending in Quebec was also criticized by Quebec’s Sustainable Development Commissioner Jean Cinq-Mars. Cinq-Mars’ 2014-15 report said that Green Fund spending lacked project criteria, calls for proposals, clearly defined objectives and program information. “When the departments choose projects without launching a call for proposals beforehand or without considering other recipients, there is a risk of inequity. In addition, the lack of specific assessment criteria does not make it possible to ensure that the best projects are selected,” said the commissioner. For those who are interested, you can go to his report, page 19.", "A recent submission from the Ontario Chamber of Commerce also expresses concerns about the lack of detail about how and where the provincial government intends to spend cap-and-trade revenue. They say that “there remain outstanding details, including how the remaining revenue will be used and how the allocation of revenue will be administered. These questions must be answered quickly to ensure that the programs and policies that will help businesses, households and others adjust to cap-and-trade are available when the system launches.”", "They go on to say, “Cap-and-trade proceeds should not be directed into general government revenue. It is important that the allocation of the revenue be objective and transparent. To increase transparency, the government should consider the creation of an arm’s-length organization to administer this revenue.", "“In addition, the government needs to clearly define the principles that it will adopt when deciding how to invest revenue from the cap-and-trade system.”", "Speaker, we have lost decades taking action on this issue—literally decades—and the consequences could be very stark, and they could appear very soon in our lives. Fifteen, 20 years ago, people thought this was a problem our grandchildren would deal with—bad as that would be, disturbing as that is. But that timeline has changed. Things are happening much faster and much more profoundly than we thought five years ago or 10 years ago.", "So it is critical that climate legislation that comes before us actually is successful; that it is fair so that there is buy-in; that it is effective so it will make the change and the difference that we need; that it is transparent so that people feel that it is credible.", "We have a very small window to get it right—very small. Speaker, it is important for the government to actually listen to the criticisms and commentary and suggestions levelled from all sides in this Legislature; listen carefully when we go to committee for commentary and amend the bill so that it is overtly—strongly—fair, effective and transparent." ],

You don’t get, out of tax and dividend, the kinds of carbon reductions that we can expect out of a cap-and-trade program that’s rigorously enforced. So we know that we’ll be effective in getting the kinds of reductions that are necessary to meet our megatonne reduction targets, and I’m looking forward to it.", "Fair: I get the point about the proportionate impact on low-income people, and it’s a concern to all of us. Proportionate, however—the higher-income families will be spending a lot more and will be contributing a lot more through the increased costs. And there are measures being put in place in order to assist low-income people, through, for instance, the $100 million announced for retrofit programs, which will allow them to replace windows, weather stripping, new furnaces and water heaters. That will help reduce expenditures on energy and help them meet their targets.", "Certainly, transparent: We know this is a transparent bill—" ],

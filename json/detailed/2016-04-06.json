  "text" : [ "It’s a pleasure to rise in the House to discuss our government’s Smoke-Free Ontario Amendment Act this morning. Typically, I think, when we think of smoking, we think in terms of cigarettes, cigars and tobacco but, obviously, it also applies to other products and other substances. One of those products, one of those substances that is in the newspaper a lot lately and is being regulated in other jurisdictions, is medical marijuana, but because the Smoke-Free Ontario Act is currently in place in the province of Ontario—which I believe enjoys the support of all parties in this House—we also need to bring in a few rules that are going to apply to other products or substances, the example being medical marijuana.", "What we believe on this side of the House, simply, Speaker, is that it’s time we expanded the Smoke-Free Ontario Act so that it also allows the government to prescribe products and substances other than tobacco to be subject to the terms of the Smoke-Free Ontario Amendment Act that talks to the no-smoking provisions. With the help of this legislation, the government is going to prescribe, through its regulations, medical marijuana as one of the substances that is subject to the current Smoke-Free Ontario Act’s no-smoking rules. What it is doing, certainly, is it’s taking a piece of what I think is popular legislation and it’s updating it to changes that are taking place in our society today.", "What it would mean is that a person who was smoking something like medical marijuana for medical reasons would have to do that in certain places and could not do it in workplaces, could not do it in enclosed workplaces, in public places that are enclosed. The same health risks we recognized with the Smoke-Free Ontario Act should also apply to new substances as they emerge. Really, in my opinion, this is a sensible amendment to existing legislation and should be supported by all members of this House." ],

Her constituents are very fortunate. You couldn’t help last evening but be moved by her continuous, consistent effort to make Ontario healthy—and I applaud her for that—from reducing flavoured tobacco to going up against the Liberal government when they wouldn’t be listened to with regard to making Ontario healthier, with regard to being smoke-free, with regard to her comments around the need to address different cancers. Again, I commend her; her constituents are very lucky.", "Specifically to this bill, Bill 178, the Smoke-Free Ontario Amendment Act, we have to call it for what it is. This is an effort by a tired government that made a mistake initially, and they’re trying to clean up their act. As they are cleaning up their mistake that they made in their efforts to make Ontario smoke-free, I would suggest to them and invite them to continue cleaning up their mistakes. For instance, why on earth are we affording and awarding proponents of wind farms more opportunity to pollute the countryside with a source of energy that we cannot afford and we absolutely do not need? It baffles so many people as to why this government continues to choose to make mistake after mistake.", "But we have seen this government backtrack before. Just yesterday—apparently, they’re stepping back from their effort to pull more dollars out of seniors’ pockets by backtracking on the prescription directive they were taking. They have time to clean up the Green Energy Act as well. I encourage them to do that." ],

This is what this government has been doing in many examples, just like seniors’ Ontario drug benefits. They decided that they were going to increase the deductible from $100 to $170 for seniors. What happened? There’s an outcry and this government has now put a pause on it; the same example here. This is really rudimentary, in a sense. We’re here debating this bill because this government isn’t listening to people when there are consultations.", "Now we’re talking about regulating tobacco and prescribed products and substances. We know second-hand smoke is not good for the public at large. Yet now we have to debate this, knowing this is something that could have been worked into Bill 45. It’s disappointing; it’s really disappointing. It’s always important, though, to talk about health prevention, which I know our critic supports very much. Anti-second-hand smoke is making sure we have health promotion in public places.", "The effectiveness of this bill is going to be that it’s going to protect employees, customers and bystanders from exposure to second-hand marijuana smoke.", "I’m glad we’re debating this bill, but it’s disappointing that we’re debating it because this government didn’t listen to the original Bill 45 consultations on how this important issue should have been incorporated into Bill 45." ],

That was a very controversial issue at the time. I believe the Attorney General, the member from Ottawa–Vanier, was on city council, and the member from Ottawa West–Nepean, the Minister of Energy, was the mayor at that time.", "They really broke ground in Ontario and in Canada, I would say, by being the first jurisdiction to make sure that people were not allowed to smoke in public spaces. It has resulted, I can tell you, in a much healthier city and an environment where people thrive—businesses, in fact, are thriving even more—because they are able to go and enjoy their time. Ottawa then took another big step as a leader by saying that outdoor spaces like patios be excluded as well. Again, that was the right move.", "So I’m really happy, Speaker, that under the Smoke-Free Ontario Act we continue to take a leadership role and, through this legislation, are expanding the scope of the legislation from tobacco products to other products as well, so that we can ensure that people continue to breathe and live and enjoy themselves in a healthy environment, and that they will not be exposed to second-hand smoke, not just from tobacco but from other products and substances as well, like medical marijuana. Of course, we have to respect other people and their rights, but we need to make sure that we do so in a way that we all continue to breathe in a healthy environment. I look forward to expanding a little bit more on this issue when I get the opportunity to talk on this bill." ],

All the bill will do is change four words in the Smoke-Free Ontario Act, and add “prescribed products and substances.” Speaker, we just spent seven months working specifically on the Smoke-Free Ontario Act when we were talking about Bill 45. Bill 45 just ended on May 29, 2015. It hasn’t even been nine months since we had worked on this bill for seven months—changed the Smoke-Free Ontario Act—and now we’re back at it again.", "Why are we back at it again, Speaker? Because the Liberals refused to listen. People were not only smoking tobacco, Speaker; people are smoking shisha, they are smoking medical marijuana, they are smoking many other products. All of those deputants came and told us this while we were doing the work on Bill 45. But the Liberals knew it all. The Liberals had their way; they had their bill. It did not matter how many amendments we made—over hundreds—they voted them all down. They refused to listen; they knew it all.", "Now, nine months later, we have to go back and fix it. It’s not going to cost them anything, but during that period of time, businesses have been set up. People invested their money, time, effort and energy building up those new businesses because we had passed a piece of legislation and the regulation was finally clear. All of those businesses will go under and will have to fail, will have to fold, and this is on their record. They were willing to bail out the gas plants. Will they be bailing out all of those small businesses that will go under because of their lack of listening? I hope so, Speaker." ],

I’ll see you on the weekend, Mom. I love you. My mother is a smoker—sorry, Mom, was—and I’ve outed her. A bit more about that later, but I would like to mention it, because it’s an important part of what I want to talk about today.", "Of course this Smoke-Free Ontario Amendment Act is going to provide us with the opportunity, through regulation, to be able to add products to the Smoke-Free Ontario Act to ensure that we treat products that could cause harm to people in the same way we’re doing with tobacco.", "I would like to say a couple of words about a few colleagues of mine: Phil McNeely, who was the member from Ottawa–Orléans; the Minister of Energy, Bob Chiarelli, who was the mayor of Ottawa at the time; and Rob Cushman, who was the medical officer of health. I remember the work they did to stop smoking in restaurants. That’s some 10, 15 years ago. At the time, the sky was going to fall. Businesses were going to go out of business, restaurants were going to have a hard time, bars were going to have a hard time. Indeed, the exact opposite happened.", "I want to go back to my mom. My mom quit smoking more than 40 years ago. Sorry, Mom. You were 20—not quite. But here’s the thing: Forty years ago, my mother, who is a registered nurse, knew smoking wasn’t good for her and wasn’t good for the family, and so she quit smoking. So did my father at the time. He quit smoking as well. That’s 40 years ago. You’re roughly looking around 1986.", "As you take a look at smoking legislation and how it has progressed since that time, how slowly it progressed through the 1980s and through the 1990s and through successive levels of government, and our attitudes toward that, when we all knew that smoking provided a serious, serious health risk—we really didn’t do very much.", "It wasn’t until things started to happen at the turn of this last century—in 2001, 2002 and 2003, and then the Smoke-Free Ontario Act, things began to happen. Then my colleague from Ottawa–Orléans at the time, Phil McNeely, the former member, had a private member’s bill banning power walls, which was very important to ensure that young people did not begin the habit of smoking. I congratulate him on that, and the Minister of Health. It was an important measure going forward.", "Smoking legislation has been something that’s been incremental over a period of time. I take the member from Nickel Belt’s admonitions—I don’t want to take them to heart; I’m just saying I can understand a certain level of frustration. But I do want to say that over a period of time, successive governments of successive stripes have incrementally improved legislation to protect the health of Ontarians. The finger-wagging is not really helpful, and that kind of goes both ways. So I’m not wagging mine right now, but what I do want to say is we have a bill in front of us that’s going to enable us to be able to—", "Interjection." ],

Attitudes have changed about smoking over time. When I was growing up, my dad smoked—and he was a firefighter. So that was like double smoke. There was the smoke from cigarettes in the house, and then there was the smell of smoke when he came home from being on call as a Toronto firefighter.", "Fast-forward to the year I graduated from university—I think that was 1986—and I started my career as an Ontario government intern. What were people doing in their offices then? Smoking—smoking in Ontario government offices. But that was acceptable. It had been going on for quite a bit of time.", "Then we had that transition that banned smoking in workplaces. It was a hard transition for some people, but over time, and especially based on what we learned about second-hand smoke, people got with the program, so to speak, just like they did with using seat belts and so on.", "Then, of course, we had the smoking sections. You all remember those: smoking sections in coffee shops and various spots. Even in hospitals there were smoking sections. There were smoking spots even on high school properties. We had a smokers’ corner at West Hill Collegiate in Scarborough, where I went, where everyone went out to smoke. There was a smoking section outside the building in the Ferguson Block, in the Macdonald Block, where I worked when I first started my career. So things have changed.", "Now, of course, things like smoking in cars and other places are generally viewed as completely unacceptable. So times change, attitudes change, and all of this is backed by what the experts tell us, and that’s important.", "Now, of course, it’s important to our health. This is a very important piece of legislation to me, as the Minister of Children and Youth Services, because we want all of our children and youth to grow up happy and healthy and not to suffer ill effects of second-hand smoke.", "Some people have raised questions about the existing framework but, as I said, things have changed over time. For example, the number of people in Canada who are legally able to possess marijuana for medical purposes under that federal framework is rising, and since the most common method of consumption of medical marijuana is indeed smoking, businesses and employers were grappling with how to provide safeguards for their patrons and for their employees exposed to second-hand medical marijuana smoke.", "Also, the exemption we proposed for medical marijuana users under the Electronic Cigarettes Act triggered a number of events that really started a public debate. It started a public debate about the acceptability of smoking or vaping and so on. Of course, we all know, too, that the federal government has committed to legalizing marijuana in Canada, which has heightened further discussion, public stakeholder interest and the controls that governments have to put in place to protect people from potential health harms associated with marijuana, be it medical or otherwise.", "So things evolve, things change, and that is what we’re here to do as legislators: to make sure that our legislation evolves and changes, given the realities of what’s going on, not just in Ontario but in Canada, quite frankly, and what the experts are saying.", "We do believe it has come to be the time to make some changes to the Smoke-Free Ontario Act that will enable the government to proscribe products and substances other than tobacco that would be subject to the no-smoking provisions. I think Ontarians get that. I think people in my community get that. I see this as very much the evolution of what has been going on in our society, what’s been going on in terms of changing attitudes and what we know in terms of how smoking affects our health outcomes at the end of the day.", "Thank you for this time, Speaker, and I look forward to listening to the rest of the debate." ],

It was not an easy decision. It was very, very controversial at the time, as many may recall. But it has been a decision that has not only been very popular but, I would also say, it has been a decision that has impacted, in a positive way, the health of the citizens of Ottawa. It has also resulted in businesses growing because they have now been able to attract more people to come in because they have that healthy environment to present.", "Similarly, Ottawa most recently took another very important leadership stand—and I’m very happy that it was incorporated in the Smoke-Free Ontario Act—and that was to prohibit smoking in outdoor spaces like patios. We know how important patios are. They are enclosed spaces, and the impact of second-hand smoking has been the same. Again, it was a very popular decision that has resulted in healthier places to live. That ban includes parks etc. as well.", "I think the times that we live in right now, the conversation that is starting to take place when it comes to the use and the acceptance of using medical marijuana, which is allowed by law—the conversation that the federal government has embarked on, on taking the prohibition away from the recreational use of marijuana, really makes it imperative that we have this conversation now as to where those products can be used and what kind of second-hand impact it will have on other people, all the bystanders who may not use those products.", "So I think what we are doing through this bill is what Ontario should be doing: taking a leadership role. We’re actually really setting the standard when it comes to other products and substances, where they can be used and in what circumstances they can be used in public spaces. We’re not telling people not to use it; that is not our place. What we can do, which is our role as legislators, is to make sure others are protected in our environment and in our community. That discussion around the use of medical marijuana, or the practice of the use of medical marijuana, and now the potential use of recreational marijuana, makes it very, very important. When I’m speaking to my constituents in my community, this is an issue that is coming up. It’s a conversation that is taking place on a regular basis.", "As many know, I knock on doors in my community every weekend on Saturdays. I’m out talking to constituents, and this is a conversation we’re having. And I will also be frank with you, Speaker: You hear both sides. I would say a majority of my constituents in my community of Ottawa Centre very much support legislation like this. They want to make sure that they are shielded from the second-hand impact of the use of medical marijuana or recreational marijuana. They appreciate the leadership role that the provincial government is taking in a proactive manner to ensure that the Smoke-Free Ontario Act is not just limited to tobacco products and that it actually is expanded in its scope.", "But I want to acknowledge that there are others who think this may be going too far, especially those who use medical marijuana, because there is a medical reason for them to use it. I acknowledge that, and very quickly, I want to address that by saying of course this bill does not prevent them or prohibit them from using medical marijuana for medical purposes, as has been prescribed to them by their medical practitioner. What it is doing is limiting where they can use that product.", "Just as we are concerned about the health of the individual who has been prescribed the use of medical marijuana, we also as legislators have to think about and be concerned with the health of others in their surroundings who would be exposed to second-hand smoke. We know that our restaurants and our public places are open to our children, open to other elders and seniors—all kinds of people, vulnerable or not. We have a duty and an obligation to make sure that we look to their well-being and health as well.", "In my opinion, this bill is doing something very simple. This bill is doing something thoughtful. What this bill is doing is taking leadership in a very real discussion that is taking place in our country, and that is to make sure that, just like the kind of regime we have created around smoking in public spaces, we extend that prohibition to other products and substances as well, such as the use of marijuana, medical or recreational—whenever that second part becomes legal.", "Speaker, I think this is the right thing to do. We know the benefits from the Smoke-Free Ontario Act and how it has resulted in a healthier province. I think we stand on solid ground from an evidentiary point of view, that we are making the right public policy choice. I really encourage all members to support this bill, because I think Ontarians support this approach. I look forward to voting in support of this bill, and I urge other members to do the same." ],

In those days, the funny thing was, you’d be serving a customer and the customer and the person serving them—one of our people on the floor—would both have cigarettes in their hands or in their mouths and would be talking.

That’s what I see with these two bills, and I want to explain why.", "Bill 178 now captures medicinal marijuana, or cannabis, under the Smoke-Free Ontario Act. Bill 45 also captures these things—vaporizers. These are now considered tobacco products under this Liberal government. What they basically have done is they’ve said, “We are legislating that apple trees are now orange trees in Ontario.” The member from Eglinton–Lawrence, I believe, brought in a bill the other day to recognize a fruit as Ontario’s vegetable. Evidence and reason are out the door with this Liberal government.", "Let’s put this in perspective. There are approximately 25,000 people taking medicinal marijuana in this province to alleviate the pain and suffering that they’re experiencing due to illness or disease; they’re alleviating their pain and suffering. Medicinal marijuana is recognized and prescribed for that function. It’s everything from PTSD to epilepsy to people on chemotherapy. These people are enjoying a somewhat better life, less pain, because of medicinal marijuana. This bill now ostracizes and unduly restricts where they can take their prescription medicine, but it also prevents them from using less harmful methods, such as a vaporizer, to take that prescription. So we’re taking away the harm-reduction component with Bill 45, and then we’re also taking the cannabis itself and saying, “If you want to take your prescription, you must do it in the same place where people are smoking.”", "Just picture this. If you’re in public housing, if you’re in a condo building, a college dorm, if you’re visiting in a hotel and you take prescription cannabis, you will not be allowed to do that. You can’t do that in public housing; you can’t do that in condos; you can’t do it in a hotel or a motel with this bill. You certainly can’t go to a cannabis or vape lounge, because they won’t exist under this bill. So where do you go?", "Here in Toronto, right at the moment, we have 13 vape lounges where people are taking their medicinal marijuana, often in devices something like this, in a less harmful fashion. Those vape lounges will now be extinct. They will not be allowed to operate." ],

They’re not just a cancer victim. They’re not just a person who suffers from epilepsy. Whatever the affliction is, they still remain a person, a person who requires social interactions, who requires that interchange between people.", "Bill 178 and Bill 45 ostracize those people. They make pariahs of those people. It’s like we’re going back to the 1800s or the 1700s with lepers, with Bill 178 and Bill 45: If you need to have a prescription, we’re going to put you over in that corner where society can’t see you and doesn’t want to see you. That’s not caring. It’s not compassion. Obviously, under this bill, these vape lounges, these cannabis lounges, places where people can socialize and take their prescription, are outlawed. They’re extinct.", "I’ll say to you, Speaker, that instead of promoting harm reduction, this Liberal government is promoting harm with Bill 178—promoting harm, not harm reduction. Instead of promoting health and healthy living, they’re promoting poor health. They’re promoting pain. They’re promoting suffering for these people.", "Interjection." ],

  "text" : [ "It’s a pleasure to follow my colleague from Lanark–Frontenac–Lennox and Addington this morning. The one thing I’ll say about my friend from LFLA: He’s never afraid to stand in this House or anywhere else and be the voice for people who feel they don’t have a voice. In our democratic system, I think that’s extremely important. Sometimes it’s not easy to paddle against the current. I’ll say to my friend Mr. Hillier that he has never been shy about paddling against the current, even if sometimes that’s a rapid he’s trying to go against the flow on.", "Having said that, he raises a significant, important issue. No matter what piece of legislation we bring forth as government or in opposition, whatever piece of legislation comes before this House, there’s always an element about that piece of legislation that will be viewed or can be shown in a very empirical way to be restrictive for one group or another group of people.", "I happen to be one of the people who generally take the position that the benefit of the greater number—the benefit of all, as we say—trumps the rights of the few. Having said that, I think it’s important in our system that there are always people who are willing to take the other view and say that the rights of the few cannot be trumped simply because a piece of legislation is designed to be for the good of all. That is something that my colleague from Lanark–Frontenac–Lennox and Addington has never been shy about doing, and I take my hat off to him and congratulate him for taking sometimes an unpopular stance on a challenging issue." ],

I have to tell the member from that riding that there are a lot of people who find it very difficult to get all the way through that title; no question about it.", "There are two elements here, Speaker. One is that when it was first announced by the parliamentary assistant that people would be able to smoke medical marijuana in many places where they wouldn’t be able to smoke tobacco, that very day I got blasted by cab drivers, restaurant owners and others who said, “I’ve got nothing against people smoking marijuana. It’s going to be legalized. It’s probably a good thing.” But they didn’t want to smoke the second-hand smoke. It’s as simple as that.", "So I think it makes sense that we look for the way that we can accommodate and assist people who need that medication for their health, for pain control or for seizure control, but it also has to be very clear that people who don’t want to be smoking things on a second-hand basis should not be put in a situation where they are. It’s not a good thing. There is going to have to be regulation and control on this.", "The second thing I want to say, though, is that my colleague from Nickel Belt spoke very well yesterday for an hour and others have had an opportunity to address a similar line of argument today. We went through this with Bill 45, which left out four critical words in that bill, and we’re back here again. Really? She also made the point that shisha, the smoking of water pipes, is not regulated. Frankly, it’s something that is now being addressed here in Toronto. I think it will be addressed in other municipalities.", "We’re—sorry, not we; the government, the Liberals, are once again doing exactly what they’ve done within the last 12 months: ignoring a huge issue, thinking that they have figured it all out and it’s going to be dealt with. It ain’t gonna be." ],

As someone who calls these two cities home, I’m proud to recognize the state-of-the-art palliative and end-of-life care that Hospice of Windsor offers. In fact, Karen Candy, the executive director of Carpenter Hospice in Burlington, travelled to the Windsor hospice recently to compare and discuss best practices.", "As we all know, making end-of-life care decisions is a challenging and sensitive topic for patients, families and health care providers alike. That is why we are extremely fortunate to have hospices like the one in my community and the Hospice of Windsor, too.", "For over 37 years, the staff and volunteers at the Hospice of Windsor and Essex County have been providing compassionate care to patients and families dealing with life-altering diagnoses. I know this well as my mother, Marie McMahon, has been a volunteer there for over 30 years. Even at age 90, every Thursday she cooks lunch for patients who are dying and for their families. I know she receives just as much as she gives from doing something so close to her heart.", "Today, the Hospice of Windsor is taking the next step in serving their community with the grand opening of their new Erie Shores location in Leamington. Now, patients will be able to access the valuable services they provide closer to home in a comfortable and warm environment.", "I’d like to commend the staff and volunteers, including my mother, Marie, of the Hospice of Windsor for their amazing and compassionate work and wish them great success with their new Erie Shores location." ],

To put this in context, the auto sector in the province of Ontario generates about $35.5 billion in GDP every year. And, of course, this sector feeds people here at home and indeed around the world.", "Within the sector, food and beverage manufacturing is one of the largest employers in Ontario, with some 3,000 establishments employing approximately 95,000 people across this province. Mr. Speaker, everybody should know that Toronto is the second-largest food distribution hub in North America.", "These businesses employ butchers, electricians, marketers, accountants, engineers, scientists and more. The job opportunities in this sector are as diverse as the food and beverage products this industry makes, and I think we can all agree that it’s always good when we can promote job and career opportunities in the great province of Ontario.", "Mr. Speaker, I’d like to tell you about the good work that Food and Beverage Ontario, a not-for-profit, industry-led organization, is doing to promote the great opportunities that exist within this sector. With the support of our government and the government of Canada provided through Growing Forward 2, FBO has created a province-wide awareness campaign called Taste Your Future. This campaign aims to draw attention to the abundance of jobs and careers available in the food and beverage processing sector. It will promote 164 programs at 29 Ontario colleges and universities that offer diploma and degree programs, and it will help people learn about the industry, find their place in it and seek their destiny in it.", "Long-term, secure employment is tremendously important to Ontario’s social and economic health. Opportunities for good, permanent jobs are available in the agri-food sector, and we need to encourage the next generation of agricultural and food processing leaders to seize these opportunities. A healthy agriculture and food sector is crucial to the success of our province, and we want to encourage more Ontarians to pursue careers within the agri-food and beverage processing sector.", "That is why this government, your government, is committed to working with partners to support agricultural learning so that it can continue to be a leader in job creation. This is why, to ensure sustainability and success for the agri-food sector in the future, our government created the Food and Beverage Growth Fund, which is part of the province’s 10-year, $2.7-billion Jobs and Prosperity Fund.", "Our most recent announcement was a $5-million investment to help P and H Milling company build its first greenfield flour mill in Ontario in 75 years, to be located in Hamilton Harbour.", "Just this past year, I also had the pleasure of announcing a $1-million investment to help Mississauga’s Super-Pufft purchase and install a new canister crisp line, allowing them to double their production capacity and leverage new market opportunities in over 34 markets.", "Overall, our government has invested nearly $7.5 million, leveraging a total investment of $62.3 million in projects through the food and beverages fund to boost the productivity and competitiveness of Ontario’s food and beverage manufacturing sector. These strategic investments have, in turn, created or maintained over 700 jobs in our province and helped create further growth in the food processing sector. These jobs, and many others that are being created each and every day, need to be filled by innovative and eager young Ontarians. Ontario is an ideal place for the industry to grow and thrive thanks to a growing population, leading colleges and universities, and access to local and export markets.", "I applaud the efforts of Food and Beverage Ontario and their new Taste Your Future awareness campaign, and I encourage everybody in this House to keep eating granola bars that are manufactured right in Peterborough. I encourage all my colleagues in the House to visit tasteyourfuture.ca to learn more about the campaign and help spread the word to the people of their communities about the great opportunities that exist in Ontario’s world-class agri-food and beverage processing sector." ],

Their efforts strengthen our communities and make a real difference to countless people each and every day. Volunteers can be found in every corner of the province and in every sector. They support caregivers, welcome newcomers and refugees, coach teams, support food banks, protect our environment, and knock on doors for worthy causes. For some, volunteering is a one-time event; for others, it is a lifelong commitment.

My ministry is committed to strengthening and supporting volunteerism in Ontario through implementing our first-ever volunteer action plan. We are working with the public, not-for-profit and private sectors to promote the value of volunteerism, and we continue to support the legacy of volunteerism from the 2015 Pan Am Games. More than 23,000 volunteers helped make the games a success. As part of this legacy, we developed two initiatives to support volunteerism that continue to this day. Number one: the SPARK Ontario website, which connects thousands of Ontarians with volunteer opportunities in their community. Number two: the PREB–Ontario certificate program, which is used by not-for-profit organizations across the province to recognize volunteers and the skills they have developed through their experiences.", "We in government all play an important role in supporting volunteerism.

A recent survey by Angus Reid: 57% of Canadians say that rising food prices have made it more difficult for them to feed their households. This is tough on low-income earners and young people.

We meet those individuals and organizations who promote volunteerism, and inevitably I am impressed with the commitment and creativity of the thousands of volunteers who make these events possible.", "In 2007, nearly half of all Canadians volunteered. Of these volunteers, 40% were involved in two or more organizations. People volunteer their time to an organization because they want to support their community. They want to give back. In 2010, almost all volunteers said that making a contribution to the community was a key motivating factor in their decision.", "For those of you who don’t volunteer, I’m going to try to scare you now. One beneficial reason to go and volunteer is that it improves our health. An American Journal of Public Health study found that individuals who volunteer are better protected against stress. In fact, individuals who don’t give back as much have as much as a 30% higher risk of dying after a stressful event as compared to people who volunteer.", "Not only do individuals benefit from volunteering, but activities undertaken by volunteers reduce costs to organizations, which allows them to increase programs within our communities.", "There is, however, a barrier to volunteering, and that is the financial cost to get the police record check that is so critical for protection. It is an important cost factor, considering many individuals volunteer for two or more organizations.", "That’s why I brought forward my private member’s bill, which is called the Helping Volunteers Give Back Act. Bill 79 would allow volunteers to pay for their criminal record check once per year, yet access this record and distribute it to multiple volunteer organizations at no additional cost to the volunteer or the organization. This cost savings initiative would actually encourage more volunteers to donate their time to more worthy causes.", "Volunteers are the real heroes in our communities, and I urge the government to show support for the thousands of individuals who want to volunteer by making it easier to do so." ],

Specifically, the motion calls upon the Liberal government to present a credible plan to balance the budget, as well as to take immediate action to pay down the debt.", "Mr. Speaker, I am going to repeat some facts that become no less shocking each time you hear them. Ontario has become the most indebted subnational borrower in the world. Under the Liberals’ watch, we continue to see our credit downgraded again and again, most recently by Standard and Poor’s.", "Budget 2016 was the ninth budget in a row that the Liberals have tabled with a multi-billion-dollar deficit. For the first time in Ontario’s history, our debt has passed $300 billion. I want to let that sink in. That means that every man, woman and child living in Ontario has a share of the debt that is $22,103.", "We continue to have serious concerns about the credibility of the government’s numbers. Budget 2016 confirmed that the government is using one-time money from the sale of Hydro One to make the deficit appear smaller. It’s also concerning that the Wynne Liberals are dipping into our province’s rainy day fund to serve their political interests by artificially lowering the deficit.", "But make no mistake. In a couple of years, after these one-time sales are exhausted and the spending continues, this will leave a massive hole in the government’s budget. Should our province experience another economic downturn like the one in 2007-08, Ontario will no longer have those rainy day funds. It will be ill-equipped to support families with the services they deserve in their time of need.", "It’s not just us suggesting that the numbers are questionable; the government’s revenue projections for 2017-18 are $4 billion higher than in the Financial Accountability Officer’s best-case scenario that he laid out last fall. Why create an office for independent oversight of the government’s financial figures if they completely ignore the independent oversight?", "In addition, last year, the Auditor General outlined how debt servicing costs are taking money away from the funding of government programs and cuts to essential government services such as education and health care. The Auditor General calls it “crowding out.” The Auditor General also highlighted what we have known for some time: The government has no long-term debt reduction plan.", "This is not sustainable. We are already seeing the impact of services being crowded out. Hospital beds are being cut; autistic children older than five are being removed from wait-lists, leaving families with nowhere else to turn; and funding for physicians has been slashed across the board.", "To add insult to injury, this is all the result of the Liberal government’s scandal, mismanagement and waste. Let me just name a few examples:", "—$1.1 billion wasted on the gas plant scandal;", "—$2 billion squandered on smart meters;", "—$9 billion overspent on renewable energy contracts;", "—over $1 billion spent on bungled electronic health records; and", "—the ongoing health care dollars that go towards Liberal bloated administration and bureaucracy, rather than front-line care—rather than patients.", "Taxpayers should not be paying for this government’s mistakes and this government’s mismanagement. This year alone, as a result of the Liberals’ governance, the government will be paying approximately $12 billion in interest on the debt. That amounts to $1 billion a month. We cannot continue to waste $1 billion each and every month, paying interest on the debt to foreign creditors. Put simply, that $1 billion means less money available for services that Ontarians depend on.", "Let’s put this into context. What is the result? What does $1 billion mean? What is the result of this government’s mismanagement? What does it mean for the people of Ontario? Well, $1 billion could pay for one year of long-term care for 17,096 seniors; $1 billion could have paid for the food of 14,000 families of four for one year; $1 billion could build 8,000 new affordable housing units. You could even purchase the Toronto Maple Leafs for $1 billion." ],

Just ask any nurse, just ask any educator, just ask any physician in the province of Ontario, and they will tell you about the cuts we’ve seen because of this government’s mismanagement.

The public chose Ontario’s debt and deficit as the issue they want to see the government address.

We agree they have done a horrible job of investing in and making life easier for everyday Ontarians. We agree that Ontario is $300 billion in debt due to years of scandal, mismanagement and waste linked to gas plants, eHealth, Ornge and smart meters.", "Where we do strongly disagree is on how to solve the problems facing our province. For example, the official opposition have echoed the NDP’s long-standing claims that the health care system is in crisis mode, yet they have not echoed our calls for investment in our cash-strapped health care system, a system that is buckling under four years of frozen budgets and core funding, excluded inflationary costs and skyrocketing demands in growth.", "We can appreciate that the opposition is working very hard at changing the tone of their policies. However, most of us just can’t forget that they too have a legacy of slashing health care budgets. During the 1995 election, Harris also promised to increase health care spending, but once he became Premier, he sang a different tune. As Premier, Mike Harris shut down 28 hospitals throughout the province, and thousands of health care workers lost their jobs. Unfortunately, this is not a new concept in Ontario politics: Campaign on promises of investment, but deliver cuts instead.", "Nor are we likely to forget that Tim Hudak’s plan, supported by his caucus, was to cut 100,000 public sector jobs, with most of those jobs coming from the education and health care sectors. Hudak claimed it would save money to fire 2,000 health care planning staff and replace them with volunteers, and offload the cost and responsibilities onto our hospitals.", "These ideas just don’t make sense. The false idea that cutting jobs and services in the public sector somehow creates investments and jobs in the private sector has been disproven time and time again.", "Over the past 13 years, the Liberals have deliberately chosen to invest our hard-earned tax dollars in bureaucracy and administration when they haven’t been tying it up in scandal after scandal.", "Interjections." ],

However, it has only been recently that their voices have been found. Frankly, it is entirely out of step with their long-standing history of privatization, austerity budgets and demands for smaller entitlements to now believe their call for investment in education.

There is something for everyone in this budget: something for youth, something for seniors, and something for indigenous people and middle- and low-income families. Our investments are significant, and we have a firm plan that is working: working towards eliminating the deficit and balancing the budget. This isn’t easy, but we are on track.", "Mr. Speaker, I don’t understand why the opposition would be critical of that. Our strong fiscal management is achieving results, and the numbers prove it. Again, the government’s plan to eliminate the deficit is working. We are on target.", "In fact, Mr. Speaker, let me tell what the rating agencies said. Moody’s confirmed, “Ontario’s 2016 Budget Stays on Track to Balanced Budgets.” And DBRS said, “2016 ... Budget: Economic Momentum Keeps Fiscal Plan on Track.”", "The deficit will be returned to balance in 2017-18. The deficit has already been reduced by close to $2 billion just since November. We have been ahead of our targets almost from the beginning. For the seventh year in a row, the province is on track to beat its deficit projection. What that means is this: The government is working hard and people are working hard right now to do the right thing. We are focusing on doing away with the deficit to build a strong future for our children and ensure a healthy Ontario economy.", "This government’s number one priority is growing the economy and creating jobs. Ontario is on track to generate more than 300,000 net new jobs by 2019, bringing total job creation to more than 900,000 since the recessionary low in 2009. On top of that, our unemployment rate continues to be below the national average. In fact, Ontario’s economic growth is now outpacing national growth and is expected to continue being among the strongest in Canada over the next two years.", "Just think about it: This is a time when the rest of the country is talking about how challenging it is financially and how challenging it is for provinces when it comes to the economy, but Ontario is leading the way. We’re the strongest in Canada. We’re doing what governments should be doing: We’re creating quality jobs and investing in our people, their skills and their talent.", "A key part of ensuring Ontario’s continued economic growth is investing in our youth and education. This budget preserves post-secondary education like never before. In fact, what we’re doing now is historic. Starting in 2017-18, the new Ontario Student Grant will offer free tuition for students with financial need from families with incomes of $50,000 or less—free tuition.", "Applause." ],

Think about it: Those single-parent families—people trying to put food on the table and take care of their kids, who have been unable to really further themselves and their education—will now be able to head back to university and further their education and really give their families a start; give their children a bit of a chance to have a brighter future. We’re doing the right thing.", "We’re also taking steps to improve special education in Ontario. Our government is doing a thorough review and speaking with parents across the province to make sure students and families get the services they need. We want to ensure that the system works.

That is the largest infrastructure investment, not just in Ontario’s history but in Canada’s history. What are we doing? We’re making infrastructure investments, we’re investing in our people and we’re driving down the deficit. I can tell you that Ontarians know that we are on track. This will not only support the creation of 110,000 new jobs a year; it will also help to move goods more efficiently and allow people to spend more time at home with their families. We are creating jobs by building bridges, by building highways, by building roads, by building public transit and by building hospitals and schools.", "Ontario residents also want to know they can depend on a strong and efficient health care system. Our government is increasing funding for our hospitals by $345 million, and we’re supporting our health care by increasing our overall budget by close to 2% a year. That’s a huge amount of money. This will help Ontarians get faster access to quality health care they can rely on.", "The budget also adds $75 million over the next three years in community-based residential hospice and palliative care. That takes that number to $155 million. We’re helping out our seniors and helping out families who are facing challenges when they’re dealing with some of the things our seniors face when they’re aging. We’re also adding $10 million to the BSO. This helps personal support workers get the assistance and guidance they need by investing in them.", "This government recognizes the vital role of our nurses in the delivery of quality health care in Ontario. Since 2003, we’ve had more than 26,000 new nurses employed in their field. This represents a growth of 23.7%, almost 24%. On top of this, the government is making the shingles vaccine free for eligible seniors. We’re also adding $178 million for affordable housing. Now, not only is this a major step toward keeping seniors in good health, but it would save them about $170 and emergency room visits and hospitalizations.", "Recognizing that our aging population is increasing, this budget also helps people achieve a more secure retirement. I can’t tell you how important that is. We know that not all Ontarians have the ability to save over the years, so we’re going to ensure that down the way, down the road, five years from now, 10, 20, those Ontarians aren’t coming to us and needing support and assistance. We know that governments will have to step in and help, so what are we doing? We’re looking ahead and we’re making those investments now. We’re making investments in the ORPP because we recognize that this is an investment in our future and it will help Ontarians. After all, why are we here? We’re here to ensure that all Ontarians—not just the rich and the wealthy—retire and are able to settle down to a life that will give them a comfortable living after putting in work throughout their lifetimes for us.", "Our government is investing strategically in the future of Ontario through responsible spending and debt reduction. First and foremost, we’re securing job growth and a healthy economy. We’re also staying firmly on track to eliminate the deficit in 2017-18.", "All of this is being done alongside significant investments in education—as I mentioned—in health care, in housing, in our seniors and in our environment. We’re taking care of people and their needs. That’s why they gave us the mandate they did to be here today. We are trying to do the best we can in ensuring that we have a strong foundation for the future of the people of this province.

But I ask the question that I trust most Ontarians are asking: What happens after that? As my colleague from Renfrew–Nipissing–Pembroke just said, it’s a structural deficit. We need to address it and change it. We need to look beyond just the next election cycle. We need to not be self-serving and only looking at how we can make our books look good. We need to ensure it’s there historically.", "At the end of the day, this is happening—and this is being said by the Auditor General. He has identified that the net burden will lead to the crowding out of front-line services. The crowding-out is being realized as this government has fired over 1,000 nurses and threatens to close special education demonstration schools, which my colleague and seatmate from Prince Edward county is working diligently to try to stop. The Auditor General talked about hospital beds being closed, the costs of medication for seniors being raised, and funding for doctors being slashed because of this government’s debt, deficit, mismanagement, scandal and incompetence.", "In Barrie alone, 50 positions are going to be eliminated at Royal Victoria hospital. In London, St. Joseph’s Health Care will cut 49 full-time positions, seven part-time and four casual. They will also cut 12 temporarily funded transitional care beds from Parkwood Institute. All across Ontario, LifeLabs is being forced to close its laboratory testing facilities because demand for testing has increased but the funding has not. It only makes sense, with our baby boom demographic moving toward us at a fairly rapid pace, that the costs are going to continue, and yet they’re cutting service. Does that make sense to you, Mr. Speaker? I would suggest, in the conversations I’ve had with you, definitely not. In my own backyard, Hanover LifeLabs actually reduced operating hours. We have one of the highest seniors’ populations in the province. Again, it only makes sense that they’re going to need more care as they get older, with the more challenges they face with their health care, and yet there are less hours to serve them.", "It truly is mind-boggling to be in this House every day and hear this government applaud themselves and say how wonderful and how rosy it is. I’m wondering if they ever walk outside and actually have chats with the average Ontarian who can’t pay their hydro bill that has doubled, tripled and quadrupled over their 12 years of mismanagement. They are predicting it’s going to double to triple over the next four years again. Have they talked to small, medium or large businesses about the costs of operating and why businesses are really struggling to maintain? They try to throw it back on our government as opposition, that we don’t stand up for Ontario. No, it’s exactly the reverse of that. We are standing here to say we want Ontario to be the leader of Confederation again. But we have to make decisions and we have to make choices, at the end of the day, that are going to ensure we have the care and the support for people at the time they need them. We can’t continue to run deficits and just say, “We’ll get to it later.”", "Those pages in front of you, Mr. Speaker: We’re burdening and saddling them with the poor decisions of this government today, and they are going to pay for that for many, many years. I don’t have grandchildren yet, but I’m already fearful that we’re going to actually put them in a situation where they may never get out of debt.", "We want and we will continue to call for this government to present a credible plan on affordable energy, proper management of health care and a credible plan to balance the budget. We’ll ask them to vote for this opposition day motion to ensure that that happens going forward." ],

Certainly, there are a number of references in this motion that resonate with me. The motion talks about “scandal, waste and mismanagement, in particular with the gas plants, eHealth, Ornge and smart meters.”", "I am somebody who came to this House in 2013, when concerns about the mismanagement of gas plants was front and centre in the minds of the people of London West. London West was, quite frankly, ground zero for the gas plant scandal, because it was Chris Bentley’s resignation that created the opportunity for me to run in the by-election. London West was also ground zero for the diluted chemotherapy drugs. Over half of the patients who received those diluted drugs lived in London; they were going to London Health Sciences Centre.", "So, Speaker, I know something about the impact of Liberal scandal and mismanagement. I know how that affects people in my riding of London West. Quite frankly, right now, almost three years since my election, I still feel that London is at ground zero in terms of Liberal mismanagement, particularly in the health care sector. You can’t get up in the morning in my community and open the London Free Press without reading another scathing indictment of how government has failed the citizens of this province and, in particular, how it is failing the residents of my community in London.", "Just last December, before the Christmas break, we heard about 500 surgeries being delayed and postponed, at the direction of the government, because of the government’s flawed funding formula that allocated a set amount for surgeries regardless of the need of patients to get these surgical procedures done. Hospitals were instructed to trickle patients over a 12-month period; to make sure to space them out so that the funding would last. Quite frankly, this is contrary to what a lot of doctors believe they should do—believe it is their commitment to patients—which is to address a patient’s need; if a patient has a need for surgery, to get that surgery completed in a timely manner so that the patient is the purpose for the health care system. The system doesn’t exist without the needs of the patients. Instead, we saw hospitals directed to slow the queue of patients; in particular, to hold off elective surgeries that potentially could very seriously compromise the health of patients.", "One of my constituents was waiting for a hip replacement. He was told it was going to be almost two years. In the meantime, his doctor told him it was quite likely that he wouldn’t be able to walk any longer by the time he was able to access that surgery. It could potentially seriously undermine his physical well-being. He was put at much greater risk of falls and any number of complications that could arise because of the delay in that surgery.", "That was in December. Later, in February, just a couple of months ago, we heard about the shortage of hospice beds and palliative care in my region. There are 26 beds in the South West LHIN. Experts say that three times as many palliative care beds are needed to address the aging population and the demographic realities of people as they age and spend their final years. We know that without access to these palliative beds, people end up spending their final days in hospital.", "In 2012 to 2013, which is the most recent data available, 54,230 patient days were spent in London hospital beds among palliative patients who were unable to have their right to die at home respected, who were unable to access a palliative care bed because we don’t have a system that can support them in doing that. Instead, we have a system that spends thousands of dollars more on hospital beds because we don’t have the community care available.", "In March, just last month, we heard about the demand for psychiatric care at Victoria Hospital, which required a classroom to be converted into an emergency ward because the hospital was being overrun by critically ill psychiatric patients who didn’t have access to beds, because once again, we saw that 22 of those beds that are in the psychiatric emergency ward were occupied by people who have nowhere else to go. There was no way to admit new patients who were coming into the ward.", "We heard about a patient with Alzheimer’s who had to spend eight days on the floor of the emergency ward. At the same time the Alzheimer Society of London and Middlesex is reporting a 50% increase in caseloads over the last two years because of the growing need for dementia specialization to help people with complex needs in our community.", "There is a lot that has to be done to address the crisis in health care in the province and in my community, and this motion won’t do anything that is needed to be done." ],

I think I have that correct.", "I’ve had a chance to hear some of the discussion and debate that has taken place over the course of the afternoon. I know some of my colleagues have, I believe, already spoken and more will be speaking after me on this particular motion.", "I know that you know, Speaker, that I’ve served here in the Legislature for the last three years and a bit—almost four years coming up this fall. But when I read a motion like this one—I say it still as a relative newcomer to this Legislature—I have to admit that I’m a little bit taken aback. I’m a little bit shocked.", "This is one of those motions, as I glance down at the text of the motion itself, that strikes me as more than passing strange. The leader of the Conservative opposition here in this chamber—notwithstanding the very important and pertinent history that took place or that existed or that occurred when that party was last in power—now seems to be in a situation where he has put forward a motion suggesting, rather magically, that we should, like they, the Conservatives, did when last in power, slash and burn and cut to the bone, literally, core public services in many important sectors and at the same time balance the books because of that slashing and burning, but at the same time invest in health care and education.", "I’m paraphrasing, but that is essentially the gist of it: “balance the budget ... pay down the debt ... preserve quality education and health services.” That’s actually a quote from the last paragraph of this particular motion. Again, it’s a bit of that bizarre kind of fictitious approach to governing.", "Though I’m still a relatively new MPP at three and a half or close to four years, I have been around the political scene as an activist in our party for a number of years. I can remember working in Toronto on the campaign in the riding of Willowdale in 1995, when then-leader of the third party, Mike Harris, went on to—not Michael Harris, but Mike Harris—put forward the Common Sense Revolution.", "This actually has a significant flavour of what was put in front of the people of Ontario in 1995: “We’re going to be able to reduce your tax burden”—at that time I think it was a 30% tax cut that they had committed to—“we’re going to cut the debt, we’re not going to take any money out of health care or education and we’re going to get the economy back on track and do all those magical things.”", "People of Ontario, for all kinds of reasons that I won’t get into this afternoon in debate, chose to support, as they can in a democracy, that particular—and who wouldn’t, frankly? Who wouldn’t support that kind of political fiction, as we learned that it turned out to be post-1995?", "Because, of course, we know, looking back in retrospect, that over the next eight or nine years—whatever the exact term was through both the 1995 and 1999 campaigns—that the Conservative Party that Mr. Brown now leads, which has put forward this motion today, did exactly the opposite in many respects of what they had committed to the people of Ontario to do. Not only did they literally eviscerate core public services—they did, Speaker—like health care and education; not only did they mock and ridicule key participants in the health care system by comparing, for example, nurses to hula hoops; not only did they close hospitals in community after community after community; they did all of these things and so much more.", "I remember the quote that the former Premier used during the 1995 campaign—I’m blessed with a good memory, Speaker: “We will not take one cent out of the classroom for our education system.” Imagine that, eight, nine years later. Imagine how those people in communities—including my own community—who back then supported that particular approach must have felt when they saw, again, the chaos and the crisis that was created in health care, in education and in all of those other crucial areas that people rely on their provincial government to provide.", "I could say, as Minister of Transportation, that I think when people look back to that era, they realize that when politicians come forward and either create election platforms or motions, such as the motion that we’re debating here this afternoon, that are based on that kind of fiction, on that kind of political wizardry, I guess, if you can call it that—people now know better in the province of Ontario.", "In the transportation realm alone, not just health care and education, they know that when any politician walks out there and says, “I’m going to find a way to magically cut everything, keep your taxes low, charge nothing else for anything else and still massively increase your transit options”—when that kind of politician, who is not being, perhaps, as transparent as they otherwise should be, gets the reins of power, the people of this province know what happens. They know what happens because they’ve seen it before when the Conservatives were last in power in this place. They saw subway projects brought forward by the NDP when they were in power not only stopped—that would be difficult enough to grasp; I say this as someone who has lived here in this region my whole life—or delayed or paused, but actually cancelled. The Eglinton subway line was cancelled and the tunnels that had been burrowed to that point filled in.", "Imagine that today, here in the province of Ontario, here in the GTHA, we are spending $5.3 billion to build the Eglinton Crosstown LRT, the single largest public transit project in Ontario history. We’re doing it not only because it’s necessary and it will create jobs and improve quality of life and be transformative for this region; we are doing it because 10, 15, 20 years after the fact, we are trying to make up and we will successfully make up for the horrific mistakes of the Conservative ideology that underpins the motion we are debating today, the Conservative notion that you can kind of have it all and that asks of people, the electorate and voters, to just close your eyes and wish hard enough and everything will work out. That’s on the investment side in health care and education and in transit and transportation and so many other realms.", "The fiction doesn’t end on the investment side; the fiction ends on the fiscal side. Because, of course, even if you didn’t serve as an elected official in this chamber back in 2003, it would be hard for people not to remember, notwithstanding the fact that in the last year or so in which they held power, they told everybody—when their then-finance minister and some who still serve in that caucus today in this chamber were in that caucus then, they said literally to the people of Ontario, “The books are balanced because of our Conservative ideology, because we’ve managed to keep spending down and cut taxes and build the economy.” They claim all of those things took place, but we know, really and truly, that they didn’t quite take place the way they suggested they did.", "We know, at the end of it all, that when then-Premier Dalton McGuinty called in the former Auditor General—and, by the way, today’s motion is replete with mentions of today’s Auditor General, but when the then-retired Auditor General was brought in to review the books that were left—" ],

We also know that in fact there was a $6-billion hidden deficit that existed. It wasn’t me saying it and it wasn’t the former Premier saying it. It was, in fact, a retired Auditor General from the province of Ontario.", "It begs the question. It really begs the question for those watching at home, certainly those who live in my community of Vaughan: Why would Ontarians ever want to go back to that kind of chaos, that kind of fictitious political environment in which political leaders put forward motions like the one that we’re debating today and, back then, as I referenced a second ago, put forward platforms that suggest that this philosophy that’s here very clearly at the heart of the motion that Mr. Brown has brought forward is the exact same ideology? It’s the exact same philosophy that weaves through it. The difference, I would argue, is that in 1995 the good people of Ontario, for reasons at that time that were germane and relevant, didn’t have—did not have—at their fingertips the sense of the history of what had taken place when this kind of ideology was foisted upon them.", "Today, in 2016, in 2017 and in 2018, the people of Ontario, the people that we all represent, whether they’re from Niagara Falls or from Vaughan or from Hamilton or Kitchener-Waterloo, wherever they reside in the province, know that the philosophy that’s at the heart of not only this motion but of Mr. Brown himself and that Conservative opposition—they know that the numbers don’t add up. They never add up. And we get less investment. We get nurses ridiculed. We have schools that don’t open, schools that are crumbling. We have fewer hospitals opening.", "Not that many months ago, I was proud to stand in my community—actually, right at the edge of Canada’s Wonderland—alongside the current Minister of Health. We released the request for proposals for the brand new Mackenzie Vaughan Hospital. This is a project that I’ve been working on not only as the MPP for this community, but also, I would say, as a former activist or volunteer in my community. We released the RFP. We will start construction of that hospital later this year. This is just one example of a philosophy and a government and an approach to building the province up, where we don’t base our assumptions, we don’t base our philosophy, we don’t base our platforms or our budgets, we don’t base our debate in this chamber, on fiction.", "I guess if I was being generous, Speaker—and I try from time to time to be generous to both opposition parties in this chamber. But I would say that perhaps it’s forgivable because Mr. Brown is a relative newcomer. I’m a newcomer, but he’s even more of a newcomer to this chamber. I would have thought that as someone who has served, in his case, in public life for a number of years in his home community, in the federal House of Commons and now here in the Legislature, after seeing various forms of governing and approaches to this—and coming from a community as he does in Simcoe, from Barrie, from that whole area up there, where I was last week—I would have thought that Mr. Brown would understand that past approaches to getting it so wrong as a Conservative are not the best way to go forward.", "Alas, Speaker, we see with this motion here today that we’re debating that, in fact, he hasn’t. In fact, he’s trying to go right back to that horrible past where we had crises; we had chaos; we weren’t building the province up; we weren’t fixing the fiscal issues that were here in the province at that time. Deficits were left over; hospitals were closed; schools were crumbling; nurses and doctors ridiculed; teachers ridiculed—so much more, Speaker.", "It is fundamentally why since 2003, at every single opportunity when the people of Ontario have had the chance to consider, do they want that approach that Mr. Brown and his party are espousing today with this motion, or do they want an Ontario Liberal government approach that builds the province up, makes rational and balanced investments, tries to work with everyone else and move the province forward, four times—four times, Speaker—in 2003, 2007, 2011 and 2014, it would come as no surprise to any sensible Ontarian that the people of this province made the right choice." ],

Please let me provide some historical context into the looming debt we are all up against. It was CBC’s Mike Crawley who recently pointed out that the last time an Ontario finance minister balanced the budget, George W. Bush was in the White House, the iPhone wasn’t yet available in Canada—good thing; I’m the home of BlackBerry, of course—Mats Sundin was captain of the Maple Leafs, people were still renting DVDs from Blockbuster and Justin Bieber was performing in talent shows on the steps in Stratford.", "Unfortunately for everyone in Ontario—my parents’ generation, my generation and my children’s generation—we can’t even begin to have a conversation regarding a finance minister balancing a budget because, quite frankly, it is that far out of reach as it stands today. This is because the Liberal government keeps making the same mistakes over and over again. As we have said in this House on multiple occasions, life is harder under the Liberals, and this has been true for a staggering 12 years.", "When the Liberals took power in 2003, Ontario was the seventh most indebted province. Thirteen years of Liberal rule later, Ontario is now the second most indebted province after Quebec. By next year, we’re predicted to be the most indebted province in Canada. This government’s fiscal mismanagement means more spending to pay down more debt interest. It means that nine cents of every tax dollar collected by the provincial government in revenue is being spent on interest payments. It means less money available to invest in the priorities of Ontarians, both now and in the future.", "In fact, this year, according to the Wynne government’s own projections, interest on debt payments will cost Ontario taxpayers $1 billion every month. Can you imagine? Again, the interest payments on Ontario’s debt have now become the third-largest expenditure in this government. That does not go toward health care, education, social services or infrastructure. That goes nowhere but to the bank; to foreign credit bondholders who invest in their infrastructure, not ours. It goes to banks that are uncertain about Ontario’s future. And why shouldn’t they be uncertain? We haven’t kept our fiscal house in order for over a decade under Liberal rule.", "Yet the spending continues as the Liberals just keep swiping the province’s credit card. Swiping or tapping it just everywhere, piling up more debt on the next generation: swipe, tap, swipe—out of touch with reality and out of touch with how it affects the people of Ontario. As interest spending continues, the cuts to front-line services continue. We see the continued toll from ongoing wasted spending that has taken funding from where it is most needed and led to cuts throughout the province.", "The Premier was elected on a promise of no cuts to front-line health care workers. Yet, again and again, we see the complete opposite, with Grand River Hospital in my region being the latest to announce cuts: 30 vacant positions being slashed and layoff notices given to 38 others, including nurses. Make no mistake: These cuts fall at the feet of this Liberal government and its fiscal mismanagement. Unfortunately, when billions are wasted on gas plants and non-existent eHealth registries, it means less for the priorities we actually care about most.", "Quite frankly, there is an ongoing concern with the way this government handles its money, and the spending choices made for our health sector continue to highlight that reality. With all our promise and potential, this reality hits hard. But what hits even harder is that, for generations, Ontarians have been paying into a system that is expected to take care of us when we can’t take care of ourselves. It is supposed to take care of our children when they’re making their start in their adult lives, and yet because of years of fiscal mismanagement under the Liberal government, there will be nothing left to take care of them.", "We live in a world where parents expect to provide their children with better lives than they had themselves, but after 12 years of tax-and-spend Liberal rule, we will be leaving them with less. That is not the cycle of human nature. It is not the cycle of fiscal responsibility. It is not the cycle of social responsibility, and it is not a cycle I feel comfortable with continuing as a member of this House.", "The Liberals are mortgaging our future—Ontario’s future—on a generation that doesn’t even have a running start due to government fiscal financial mismanagement. In fact, the Premier herself has stated that nobody wants to imagine a future where their children and grandchildren don’t have a future. Well, we couldn’t agree more, Speaker; she’s right. It’s not only our children; it’s also our grandchildren and future generations who are going to be paying for the Liberal fiscal mismanagement in Ontario.", "It is because of this that the opposition has come here today for one reason and one reason only: We actually want to build a better Ontario. The first step is finally taking aim at getting this province’s finances in order. The Premier needs to clean up the mess she and her predecessor have created. It’s time for immediate action to balance a budget that hasn’t been balanced in their 12 years and time for real solutions to pay down the provincial debt to allow investment into our priorities, such as community health care, and remove the heavy debt burden this government has allowed to compromise the future of our next generation.", "Speaker, I appreciate the time given today. I want to remind those watching at home that everything we do we put on a credit card, and it’s those future generations that will be concerned most about the actions we make today." ],

It is clear not only to New Democrats but people across the province that the Liberals are not building Ontario up. In fact, they are tearing Ontario down.", "The pre-budget hearings were a farce. Over 140 witnesses appeared in person and another 114 written submissions were presented before the all-party legislative committee. That’s not including the scores of people who participated in the Minister of Finance’s separate consultations.", "The budget was tabled far earlier than in previous years. Rather than being released in April or May, the budget was tabled in February. Factor in the reality that the budget is sent to the printer many days prior to public release, and that the entire document has to be translated to French. Key decisions are made well in advance of sending the budget document to print, and it is clear to Ontarians that the budget was already written during the time the Liberal government was supposedly consulting with the public. What this tells us in this House and those across the province is that the Liberal government wasted the time of the members on the legislative committee, the time and efforts of those who presented to the committee in person, and they disregarded the written submissions.", "For a government that claims to be open and transparent, they aren’t behaving in a manner that is open to input and ideas, and they aren’t transparent about the fact that, like the rush to sell off our public hydro system, despite 80% of Ontarians saying they don’t support the plan, they really don’t care about what Ontarians want. They only care about what the Liberal government and their wealthy friends want.", "While I’m on the topic of the sell-off of Hydro One, I’d like to speak about the Conservative Party’s current call to stop the sale. Speaker, I don’t think anyone in this room is fooled by the smoke-and-mirrors approach the PCs are taking on the hydro sell-off. Everyone in this chamber knows that the Conservatives also want to sell our publicly owned hydro; they have their own plan on how to do it and which friends of theirs it will benefit.", "I’d like to talk about jobs for a moment. Chrysler, FCA, in Windsor, in my riding specifically, recently had 1,200 new hires, and that’s not including the spinoff jobs from the feeder plants. Those were both production workers and skilled trades. The Liberal government stood up and claimed victory for those hires. Yet, they didn’t acknowledge that it was the hard work of the people within the plant itself that led to the high production, the quality product and, then, the new hires.", "On the topic of auto jobs, the new leader of the PCs, when he was a member of the federal party, stood with his fellow members in caucus and did nothing—nothing—to support our auto sector. In fact, they preferred to watch workers in Canada, one by one, get on the unemployment line. The previous leader of the Ontario PCs, when asked about supporting the auto sector, said, “We don’t pick winners and losers; let it die.”", "Albert Einstein once said that logic will get you from point A to point B, but imagination will get you everywhere. The PCs clearly have an imagination as they don’t appear to have a real stance on anything. Once upon a time, in an election not too far away from today, everyone knew clearly what the Conservatives stood for. But lately, thanks largely to their new leader, Patrick Brown, they seem to feel whichever way they think will get them elected and form government in 2018. The problem with that is that what they say and do from one day to another, sometimes hour by hour, is frequently contradictory.", "There’s another saying, Speaker, and it certainly applies to the PC Party: “When you stand for nothing, you will fall for everything.” Clearly, the PC Party doesn’t truly stand for anything anymore and has fallen for the idea that Ontarians would accept a government that says whatever they feel necessary to get elected and then do whatever they want, even if it contradicts what they claim to stand for leading up to and during an election campaign.", "I think it’s on that premise that we are here today debating this motion. If the PCs are pointing out that this way of thinking isn’t working for the Liberals, then perhaps they need to take a long, hard look in the mirror, figure out what they really stand for and proudly share that with Ontarians. They should be proud of their stance on topics important to Ontarians, shout it from the rooftop and wear it like a badge of honour. Do away with the smoke and mirrors and stop trying to fool Ontarians: Tell us how you really feel.", "On the topic of health care, nearly 12,000 nurses have been fired across the province. Under this Liberal government, we can likely expect more cuts. In Windsor, 169 RNs were handed their pink slips on Family Day this year—Family Day, Speaker. The Liberal government has picked a fight with our doctors; wait times for long-term care beds are out of control; and many people with mental health issues can’t access the community supports they need. Seniors were under the threat of having their prescription drug costs increased by nearly double. I’d like to say thank you to the thousands of Ontarians who worked with New Democrats to pressure this government to reduce course on that wrong-headed plan.", "The head of the Ontario Dental Association told us that Sarnia’s hospital has been forced to cut operating room time for dentists to practically nothing. Speaker, as a former dental assistant, I can tell you that dental health plays a key part in overall health. To be cutting operating-room time for dentists, who are often doing procedures when we have children with rampant decay and they need to be put out in order to have that treated, or when we have young children who need a root canal or an extraction and it can’t be done in-office—if these conditions are not treated right away, they can affect the overall health of a patient. In fact, many don’t know that if an abscess in the mouth is left untreated, it can cause infection in your body and you can die.", "The Conservatives speak about the need to stop cuts to our public health care, to ensure access to health care services for all Ontarians, and halt the losses of our front-line health care providers, such as nurses. The Conservatives ran on cutting 100,000 public sector jobs in the 2014 election campaign. That wasn’t that long ago. I ask them: How many doctors and nurses would have been part of the 100,000 job cuts and how much would it cost taxpayers out of pocket for the health care services they needed once the Conservatives privatized health care? What would be the real cost to the physical and mental well-being of Ontarians once the Conservatives satisfy their high-priced corporate friends by selling out our public health care system?", "I have limited time to speak, so I want to speak about something else that’s near and dear to my heart, which is also, coincidentally, my critic portfolio: education.", "The motion before us talks about supporting education. With a cut in education of $430 million in the 2016 budget and prior cuts in previous years that total over $1 billion—that’s $1 billion in the last three years—it is clear that the Liberal government is not investing in our education system. We see cut after cut after cut which result in a loss of programming and a loss of the front-line workers, the education workers in our system.", "In order to truly and support our publicly funded education system, you must acknowledge, appreciate and respect the invaluable service of education workers: the front-line workers that are the heart and soul of our education system, the very people working in our schools and other educational facilities who clean up after, console, counsel, encourage, educate and help shape the minds of the students our education system was built to serve.", "It is very clear that both the Conservatives and the Liberals don’t value education workers. We only have to look to legislation passed in September 2012 and again in 2015. The first bill, which passed in 2012, imposed contracts on education workers and deprived them of their rightful process of collective bargaining. Both Bill 115 and, later, Bill 103 stripped teachers of their right to strike. The government threatened to dock the pay of the lowest-paid education workers in the education sector if they exercised their right—and that’s important—to do their job exactly as described in their employment contracts.", "Language about education workers used by both the Liberals and the Conservatives in the recent past has created a very negative and unfortunate view of the professionals we trust in the care and education of our children and grandchildren. They use education workers as collateral damage to gain political points.", "To finish, I want to draw attention to the piece in the motion that speaks to keeping demonstration schools open. Demonstration schools are in place to assist students with severe learning disabilities. It’s not that these students can’t learn; they can and they do. In fact, with the specialized supports provided in demonstration schools, students not only succeed but they excel.", "Demonstration schools provide focused supports and learning that isn’t available in a student’s home school within a district school board. Demonstration schools provide an educational environment that is vital to the success of the students who attend them and is complementary to the education that students receive once they finish their program and return to their home school. Myself and my New Democrat colleagues fully support keeping demonstration schools open. There is no doubt about that, Speaker.", "We also support and have led the fight, along with members of the deaf community, to not only draw attention to the importance of provincial schools for the deaf but to keep them open as well. Provincial schools for the deaf were left out of this motion. Provincial schools provide an ASL—American sign language—or QSL—Quebec sign language—environment where students who are deaf or hard of hearing thrive. It is vital to the success of these students that they be provided an education in an ASL or QSL environment.", "It was a huge oversight on the Conservatives’ part to leave provincial schools for the deaf out of this motion. I tabled a motion on March 22 of this year calling on the government to recognize the success and importance of both provincial and demonstration schools, to ensure that no provincial or demonstration school would close as a result of current consultations and to reopen the enrolment at all provincial and demonstration schools. I hope that I can count on my colleagues in both the Conservative and the Liberal caucuses to support my motion when it is debated on April 14. I thank you for the time that I’ve had to speak today." ],

Yet the Republican faith that you can tax-cut your way to deficit reduction has never dimmed. This year’s Republican race is dominated by candidates whose budgetary plans make Reagan’s look downright reasonable.", "“Not surprisingly, the most extreme plan is Donald Trump’s. He would slash taxes across the board, reducing revenues by nine and a half trillion dollars over the next decade, according to estimates by the non-partisan Tax Policy Center. Yet he has also promised to balance the budget, protect social security and medicare, and not cut services. How? Well, he says he’ll get rid of ‘waste and fraud and abuse,’ and abolish the Department of Education and the Environmental Protection Agency. And he thinks that the tax cuts would spur an economic boom, so that revenues will actually increase.”", "Does that sound familiar to members of the House? Have you read the resolution this afternoon? That’s what it sounds like.", "The article goes on to say: “This is pure fantasy. Those spending cuts would save just a tiny fraction of what he claims, and the revenue projections have no basis in reality. Yet, unrealistic as Trump’s ideas are, they differ from those of his chief opponents only in degree, not in kind. Marco Rubio wants to couple a $6.8-trillion tax cut with significant increases in defense spending, while Ted Cruz has proposed an $8.6-trillion tax cut with—guess what?—significant increases in defense spending” at the same time. So Ted Cruz has said that. “Naturally, Rubio and Cruz have been vague about where they’d find the necessary trillions in cuts, and about how what the government does would be affected.” Does that sound familiar again? It does to me. “This is par for the course. Paul Ryan’s infamous budget of 2012 would have effectively eliminated ... all the federal government’s non-defense discretionary spending, even as he insisted that he wanted to ‘strengthen’ the social safety net and keep the government investing in infrastructure.", "“The candidates are engaged in a familiar dance. Voters always say that they’re worried about the deficit, but, as Brendan Nyhan, an assistant professor of government at Dartmouth, put it” to this writer, “they’re skittish when cuts are specified: ‘They may have a symbolic preference for cutting spending, but that’s different from their actual preference for spending on programs they like.’”", "This article goes on, and it just describes what the new leader is all about. I suspect that’s why—somebody over there will correct me—28 members of the caucus supported the former member, now known as Christine Elliott, who was appointed by this government, by the way, as the patient advocate and is a very good person, but the others did not.", "I don’t want to get into this subject because it’s not on today’s topic. But when I was going down the list of contributors to the leadership campaign of the Conservative leader, I couldn’t find, I think, maybe one or two members of the government caucus itself who made a contribution. I think most of those members, when they were elected, were consistent Conservatives. They didn’t believe that somehow you could spend like Santa and save like Scrooge. They believed, instead, that this was a total contradiction. I know that when my cabinet colleague Mr. Mauro has a chance to speak, he will elaborate on this." ],

We all know how important infrastructure is to our economy and how it translates into jobs when those infrastructure projects are going to be initiated and completed. So it’s great that the government is bringing forth legislation, but what we really need to see is a concrete, laid-out plan as to what they’re going to do with infrastructure here in the province of Ontario, because we hear the clarion call from municipalities all over Ontario, how we are all struggling with an infrastructure deficit.", "This government has a history over the past 12 years of doing things on paper—because that’s what these bills are; they’re on paper—and then not following through with them. We’ll have to see what happens with this bill and see if it’s an exception to some of the other pieces of legislation that have not been followed through with in the past.", "In my riding of Renfrew–Nipissing–Pembroke, one of the biggest challenges we have is we have the Trans-Canada Highway going through it but it’s not four lanes throughout the riding. We need to see some more action on that. I know it’s under progress right now, the Highway 417 expansion through Arnprior and now moving beyond Arnprior, but it is painfully slow. People in my riding want to see some real, concrete—no pun intended; asphalt will work, too—action on this particular project because it is of vital importance, not only from a traffic safety point of view, which is clearly paramount and should be and always is for the ministry, but also as an economic development tool for my riding of Renfrew–Nipissing–Pembroke. We’d like to see some further action on that as quickly as possible." ],

There were many promises made by this Liberal government with regard to infrastructure and transit. KW, or Kitchener–Waterloo: They were promised a bullet train. Niagara Falls, the member from Niagara Falls: They were promised transit as well, GO train services. London–Fanshawe: The city of London, which is a great city, is facing transportation concerns, and we were promised a bullet train. All these promises that came about—there was never a plan of how to fund them. So we’re very interested to know how the government has pre-empted promises without a plan to actually fund transit.", "We don’t believe in privatizing hydro as a way to finance transit. We’ve had many suggestions to this government of how to do that. One of those was closing corporate tax loopholes. That was a billion dollars of funding that could actually go into projects for transit and infrastructure. So it’s disappointing that this bill doesn’t have that vision of how to actually enforce what it’s proposing.", "Again, it’s a bill that’s got an idea. The idea is great—when it comes to ideas, the Liberals are full of them—but we’d like to see some funding attached to those ideas that’s actually concrete and not privatizing hydro, where people will end up paying higher rates in their hydro, which people don’t want in my riding of London–Fanshawe and people don’t want in London. They want to keep our public facility services like hydro public so that we have oversight and transparency and they’re not going to be gouged for a necessity of life." ],

Last year in the budget we had a sentence that told us exactly what they intend to do with their asset sale. It’s not going into infrastructure whatsoever. In the budget, it said they “may” put a “portion” into the Trillium Trust. Our party brought forward amendments that said you “must” put it “all” into the Trillium Trust. First the government voted down the word “must,” so now they only have “may” put it in, and then they voted down the word “all,” and they left the word “portion.” So instead of all the money going into the Trillium Trust, now they may put some or none of it in, but they don’t have to put all of it in and they don’t have to put any of it in. That’s what these people voted for. That’s the amendment.", "Speaker, we took it one step further, and we said, “We want an amendment that has the Auditor General looking, within 90 days of the sale of any asset, and reporting to this Legislature what was sold, how much was received and where the money went.” These guys voted it down; that’s what they did. That is the lack of transparency and openness. That’s what is happening to the sale of GM shares; that’s what is happening to this fire sale of Hydro One; that’s what is happening to their planned sale of the LCBO. It’s all about squeezing money out to try to balance the budget. It’s not about infrastructure." ],

I’m not going to spend any more time on that, because I think the public understands that budget for what it is.", "I do want to say that this bill, Bill 6, represents our government’s priority for building Ontario up by investing in people’s talents and skills, building new public infrastructure, and creating a dynamic business climate. We know that there will be $130 billion spent on public infrastructure over the next 10 years. That, obviously, is one of the biggest spends on infrastructure in the history of this province. If we look back at the history of this province, that is one of the key things that has made Ontario great. The building of the 400-series highways, the building of the railroads: They’ve all worked to make Ontario very prosperous, and we need to continue to invest in those. It’s unfortunate that the bulk of that falls on the shoulders of Ontario taxpayers.", "The Conference Board of Canada has told us that every dollar that Ontario invests in public infrastructure raises Ontario’s GDP by $1.14 in the near term, and our own studies have shown that that expands to $3.10 long-term, so it’s a significant investment going forward.", "Bill 6, if passed, would require our government and future governments to regularly prepare long-term infrastructure plans so that we don’t get caught in the deficit we’re in today." ],

I want to just read the very first section:", "“Purpose", "“(1) The purpose of this act is to establish mechanisms to encourage principled, evidence-based and strategic long-term infrastructure planning that supports job creation and training opportunities,” and on and on.", "So this law is now going to compel the province—this government—to establish evidence-based, strategic long-term infrastructure planning. That clearly implies that they have not been engaged in evidence-based, strategic long-term planning for infrastructure in the past. I think the evidence shows that that is indeed true. They have not been involved in long-term planning—not long-term planning that is for the benefit of the people of Ontario; maybe long-term planning for the benefit of the people of the Liberal Party, but certainly not for the people of Ontario.", "You would think that we’ve had responsible government here in what is now Ontario since the 1830s, and you would think that somewhere in those mere 200 years governments have actually been engaged in some strategic long-term infrastructure, that this is not just an epiphany that’s happened today with the Ontario Liberals, that they have now found evidence-based strategic planning where all other governments in those mere 200 years did not understand or comprehend or implement long-term strategic planning.", "I would say to you, Speaker, and to this House, that I think the 401 was a long-term strategic plan. I would think the Adam Beck generating station at Niagara Falls was probably a long-term strategic planning project. I could go on and on. This is not something new, but what is new and what is evident to me in my time in this House is the cavalier and casual regard for the law that this Liberal government does provide in its abiding of its own laws. What people will notice in Bill 6 is that there are no enforcement or compliance mechanisms. Nothing compels the government to actually do anything in Bill 6, other than it being the law. If they had a conscience, they would follow the law, but we know that most people would be suspicious if they do have a conscience.", "Let me take you back, Speaker, and this House, to the deleted emails. Deleting the emails was unlawful. It was against the law. However, there was no consequence in the legislation for failure to abide by the law. So the Liberal government could and indeed did violate the law but not bear any consequence for that violation or that offence to the law, that offence to the people of this province, that offence to this Legislature—scot-free.", "In this bill, there are no enforcement or compliance mechanisms. So if the Liberal government goes like this tomorrow and throws it in the trashcan and doesn’t ever do anything about it, nothing will happen. It will be somewhat like what we found out during estimates committee last fall when we had the Ministry of Tourism and the Ministry of Energy there, and a host of ministers came in to have their ministries scrutinized for their appropriations for the year. Time and time and time again it was revealed to us, when we asked questions of these ministers and their senior staff, when we asked questions why the annual reports were not filed by their agencies—and, again, these were statutory obligations, included in a law just like this. The government and the ministers have an obligation to file annual reports. However, they weren’t filed.", "The minister seemed to be somewhat perplexed, even though it was his responsibility to ensure the agencies filed the annual reports. But there was no consequence. Some of those agencies were up to three and four years behind in filing their annual reports. But the minister didn’t really—I shouldn’t say “the minister”; the ministers, because we had a number of them in estimates committee. They just said, “They’re late. They’re late. We’d like to abide by the law, we’d like to fulfill our statutory obligations, but we just don’t know how to do it,” or, “It’s just not that important because there is no consequence for us being lazy or cavalier or disregarding the law.”", "We saw the same thing with the filing of expenses. We saw the same thing. Many, many, many people have an obligation to this House and to the public to file their expenses online. It was a law that was just passed in the 40th Parliament. In the 40th Parliament we passed a law that said that all these people have to file their expenses online. However, there was no consequence in that bill if they didn’t file online and in a timely fashion.", "So once again, we see this government repeating its past failures time and time and time again. They put a puppy in the window; they get some people to talk and to be distracted about this new-found crusade of the Liberal Party to act on evidence, to act on science-based and strategic planning, but guess what? “We don’t really have to. It’s just a law.”", "What we’ve seen very clearly is that this Liberal government believes everybody must abide by the law except themselves. When they craft a law that is to be applied to the general public, they don’t forget about enforcement and compliance. They put in a host of mechanisms to ensure compliance and to enforce it: warrantless entry into homes, warrantless entry into businesses, compelling of documentation. But in their own bill, they leave enforcement and compliance absent. Why is that? In the questions and comments maybe we’ll get the member from St. Catharines to explain to this House why enforcement and compliance are not mandatory for government but only for the subjects.", "I come from a line of advocacy for democratic institutions that say their foundation is that “neither prince nor pauper is above or beneath the law.” Clearly, this Liberal government believes their princes are above the law, but the paupers will feel the weight of their enforcement and compliance each and every time.", "So once again, after 12 years in government, this government has now decided it’s going to be thoughtful about infrastructure projects. Does anybody believe that? Does anybody actually believe that now, after 12 years of wasteful mismanagement, after 12 years of maladministration, of scandals, they have now found and turned a new leaf and they are going to be thoughtful and methodical in conducting business with regard for evidence and science? It’ll be interesting. I’ll be watching for the next three years. I’ll be watching to see if they ever actually table this plan that they say is now mandatory in this law.", "If I’m still here, I’m going to be waiting for that day when it says that this plan is going to be tabled. I’m going to stand up in this House and I’m going to ask the question: Why not? Because it won’t be. The track record demonstrates time and time and time again that this Liberal government does not have any regard for the laws that are based for itself.", "We’ll see what the member from St. Catharines says on that day. He’s not saying much today; he probably won’t be saying much that day, either, just, “We didn’t get around to it. It wasn’t that important at the time. We thought it was important way back when, in 2015, but it’s not important now”—because they’re that good, that they don’t have to apply to the law.", "But I want to also say, going through the bill, that they lay out these broad, general frameworks of what projects will be subject to this long-term plan. And then they put forward a host of exemptions and a host of clauses which allow them to essentially exempt any and all projects from being involved in the long-term evidence-based strategic plan. And I want to hear during questions and comments: Why are they exempting so many projects from the obligation to be included in the long-term plan? I’m really looking forward for somebody on the government side to explain that to me. Explain to me why there are no consequences. Explain to me why there’s no enforcement. Explain to me why there’s no compliance. And explain to me why it is full of exemptions that you could drive a Liberal Party bus through. That’s what is in this bill.", "After we saw the events of the last week, with this Liberal government making deals with Ed Clark and other people outside of this House, beyond the view of this Legislature, I wonder what else we’ve got in store with this, what actually is going to be included in the evidence-based strategic plan that actually comes before this House. Or will it be done outside of the House—" ],

But it is a convention. It is a tradition. It’s a tradition that some people don’t respect very much, but it’s a tradition that others have a high regard for. And we’ve seen that this government does not have a high regard for traditions or conventions. If there’s an opportunity to skate, they’ll skate, and this bill, Bill 6, allows them to skate ever more. It allows them to skate around traditions and conventions. It allows them to skate around obligations to the people of this province. It allows them to rag the puck and not be forthcoming in a complete fashion about what they’re doing with infrastructure projects.", "I’ve put out a challenge to the Liberal benches if they can explain to me in the questions and comments why there are no enforcement and compliance mechanisms in this bill. That’s number one. Why is there no enforcement? Just like the deleted email offence that they engaged in that had no consequence, why are they repeating the same mistake here? And why have they created so many exemptions? So many projects can be exempted from this bill.", "Finally, over the last 12 years—as I stated at the outset, “The purpose of this act is to establish mechanisms to encourage”—I guess that’s the one: encourage; not to make mandatory. It’s just to encourage the Liberal government, give them a pat on the back: “Maybe if you just go this way a little bit to evidence-based and strategic long-term infrastructure planning.”", "I’d like to see the Liberal backbenchers encourage themselves to do better, encourage themselves to walk the walk and actually put some enforcement mechanisms into Bill 6 when it does come to committee. I challenge you: Put enforcement mechanisms in this bill during second reading at committee. I’d like to see it.", "Just like the deleted emails, if some minister down the road doesn’t table the reports like the convention asks, like the bill requires, what will be the consequence? Will the minister be forced to step down? Will the minister have to vacate his seat? What mechanisms will we require to ensure that the minister does his job? Because from what I’ve seen in estimates committee over these years, none of them—very, very few of them—take their responsibilities of the law very seriously, and have little regard for both the law and the traditions of representative democracy in this Legislature.", "Thank you very much.

It goes back to something that I’ve been using for a very long time when talking about this government: We’re developing a plan to have a plan to implement a plan. It’s a lot of planning but no action.", "We see a lot of what is coming from this government as nice media front-line announcements—" ],

This is a bill that was introduced in this Legislature way back in July. It was actually one of the first bills that was brought forward by the new Liberal government following the election, and it has had a very short period of time for debate since it was introduced.", "I’m glad to participate in this debate because, surprisingly, here at Queen’s Park, MPPs don’t get a lot of opportunities to talk about jobs and prosperity. There are actually very few bills that the Liberals have brought forward that contribute to getting our economy moving, that will create jobs for Ontarians and especially for young people.", "There are, of course, bills like the Fighting Fraud and Reducing Automobile Insurance Rates Act and the Pooled Registered Pension Plans Act that will create jobs and prosperity for the insurance industry and for financial institutions, but there are very few pieces of legislation we’ve talked about here that address the needs of people who are underemployed, who are unable to find employment or who are looking to enter the labour market for the first time.", "I do want to point out that my own private member’s bill, the Protecting Interns and Creating a Learning Economy Act, would have done just that. Unlike the bill that we are debating today, my private member’s bill did address the needs of vulnerable workers and it did include measures to boost productivity and grow the economy. I’m still waiting for that bill to be considered at committee and I hope it will be soon because I’m looking forward to debating it in the House at third reading and I know other members of my caucus are also looking forward to that.", "The bill that we’re debating here today, Bill 6, is similar to several other bills that have been introduced by the Liberals this Parliament. It is another fairly innocuous fluff bill. It has a grand title but relatively little content. It is more feel-good legislation, more spin than substance, and it includes no enforcement mechanisms that will ensure that it actually has an impact on some of the most pressing issues that are facing Ontarians today.", "The primary purpose of Bill 6 is to encourage long-term infrastructure spending for the government of Ontario and the broader public sector by setting out specific principles that have to be followed and requiring the minister to prepare a 10-year infrastructure plan. Now, I said “principles that have to be followed”; I should have said “principles that have to be considered” because there is no requirement, actually, that these principles be adhered to.", "Certainly, there’s no question about the importance of long-term planning. Infrastructure spending is not a tap to be turned on and off depending on the political will of the day, nor is it a temporary solution to economic downturn to be discontinued once the economy improves. In fact, it’s this kind of thinking, this kind of short-termism and ad hoc-ism, that has created the huge infrastructure deficit we see in this province today, which sits at around $100 billion. Without a long-term infrastructure plan, what we have seen are many of our assets across this province in the communities we represent falling into serious disrepair and decay.", "In London, in my community, the most recent State of Infrastructure Report indicates a current infrastructure funding gap of $52 million, which could grow to $466 million under current investment plans. Londoners are understandably concerned about the fact that 7% of our city’s assets are listed in very poor condition. They are still functioning, perhaps, but the level of service they provide is well below par.", "At the same time, Londoners are excited and energized by the work that’s under way on Shift London, which is an initiative to develop a rapid transit system for our community. An environmental assessment has started, and we will certainly be looking to the province to support this major infrastructure investment in London’s growth and prosperity.", "I should say that Londoners are intrigued. We recognize the potential of high-speed rail but we’re not exactly holding our breath to see this initiative move forward, given the lack of planning that went into this hasty Liberal pre-election goodie announcement.", "Of course, properly planned life cycle infrastructure is important, but, as has been said earlier this morning, the government doesn’t need a new law in order to undertake this kind of long-term infrastructure planning. There’s absolutely nothing stopping the government, if it wanted to, to proceed with the development of 10-year, 20-year, even 50-year infrastructure plans for this province. However, they did decide they need a law, so now I want to turn to specific aspects of the legislation that they have proposed.", "First, in looking at the definition of infrastructure, I couldn’t help but notice one very significant exclusion. The infrastructure covered by Bill 6 includes highways, bridges, bicycle paths, drinking water systems, hospitals, courthouses and schools—basically any physical structure or facility through which a public service is provided to Ontarians.", "What the bill doesn’t cover is publicly owned electricity infrastructure, nor does it cover Hydro One or OPG. The cynic in me wonders if there was perhaps a deliberate omission by the Liberals when they wrote this legislation last summer. Maybe they knew all along what they were planning to do with the sell-off of Hydro One and maybe they knew how awkward it would be to have this bill debated in the Legislature while they were in the process of dismantling our public electricity system. How hypocritical this would make them appear, because there is no way that the privatization of Hydro One could be justified according to the principles that are set out in this bill.", "There are nine planning principles that are described in Bill 6 that the government of Ontario as well as all broader-sector entities are required to consider when making infrastructure decisions.", "First, take a long-term view and be mindful of demographic and economic trends.", "Second, take budgets and fiscal plans into account.", "Third, identify infrastructure priorities.", "Fourth, ensure that core public services like health care and education continue to be provided.", "Fifth, promote economic competitiveness, productivity, job creation and training opportunities.", "Sixth, make innovative use of technologies.", "Seventh, plans should be evidence-based and transparent. I will come back to that principle in a moment.", "Eighth, be mindful of provincial and municipal plans or strategies; for example, those developed under the Planning Act or the Metrolinx Act.", "Ninth, minimize impact on the environment, and design infrastructure to be resilient to climate change.", "Speaker, I can tell you that, as a former school board trustee—and school boards will be covered by the act and be expected to take these principles into account—I would have loved to be able to make decisions about managing school assets that were based on principles and not just budget concerns.", "Here in the NDP caucus, we have three former school board trustees. All of us were involved in very, very difficult decisions about school closures. These decisions were forced on school boards as the only possible option we could take, directly as a result of provincial underfunding. In these cases, the only principle that school boards were able to apply was principle number two—budgets and fiscal plans—because in all of these school board debates it was basically impossible to take the long-term view. The provincial funding model left school boards unable to maintain assets for long-term community benefit and for future generations of students.", "If this bill goes to committee, I will be very interested in hearing from school boards how it will affect their infrastructure planning process and how it will inform their accommodation review process.", "I want to speak in a little bit more detail about principle number seven, which is ensuring that infrastructure plans are evidence-based and transparent, which seems highly ironic in light of the Auditor General’s report last December. The Auditor General revealed that the government spent an additional $8 billion on public-private partnerships than they would have spent if the projects had been financed and managed by the public sector using traditional procurement methods and private construction.", "These projects were undertaken as P3s because the government claimed that the P3 model allowed them to transfer large amounts of risk to the private sector. In fact, they claimed that the risks would have been five times greater if they had used public sector procurement compared to P3s. But as the Auditor General points out, they provided absolutely no evidence to support this claim. After confirming with external consultants like Deloitte, the auditor’s report stated that there “is no empirical data supporting the key assumptions used by Infrastructure Ontario to assign costs to specific risks.” Basically, the assumptions the government made about risk transfer, the costs that they calculated to compare the P3 model to traditional models, were fabricated. They were pulled out of thin air. They were cooking the books, so to speak, to provide a rationale for directing tens of billions of dollars of public spending—" ],

What we see at Infrastructure Ontario is not evidence-based infrastructure planning and investment. It is evidence-free planning and investment. It is not transparency, as would be required by principle number 7.", "With $130 billion to be spent on public infrastructure over the next decade, it would be a very good thing if principle number 7 prevented more money being wasted on overpriced P3s. But as we see the Liberals rushing to privatize whatever they can get their hands on, I suspect we are unlikely to see an end to their commitment to the P3 model, despite the evidence that shows that this is a bad deal for Ontario.", "The second part of Bill 6 requires the minister to develop a long-term infrastructure plan, to be tabled in the Legislative Assembly and published on the government of Ontario website. The first plan is to be tabled in 2018, if the act passes this year, and subsequent plans every five years thereafter. But while the minister is expected to consider the planning principles set out in the bill, there is no requirement that the principles actually be incorporated into the plan.", "The plan must include an inventory of government infrastructure assets, as well as a strategy on how to address anticipated infrastructure requirements through improvements or new assets over the next 10 years. Basically, the long-term plan must show how infrastructure investments and maintenance will be funded.", "Again, when we look at the sell-off of Hydro One, one certainly sees the value of this approach, because instead of keeping plans secret from Ontarians, people would have known, when they went to the polls last June, that the Liberals planned to privatize Hydro One and drive up electricity bills, in order to fund GTA transit.", "So New Democrats certainly see the value of this provision of the bill and support this direction.", "Bill 6 also sets out the criteria to prioritize and evaluate new infrastructure projects, including alignment of the project with existing provincial or municipal plans; capital and operating costs; and economic impacts, such as long-term return on investment and implications for tax-based growth.", "Here I see a missed opportunity to incorporate criteria related to community benefits agreements, like that negotiated by Metrolinx for the Eglinton subway. This was, of course, after the Toronto Community Benefits Network fought hammer-and-nail to get Metrolinx to sign.", "I was at the Good Jobs Summit last fall. I heard the Premier say that she supports community benefits agreements for major infrastructure projects and would have liked to see that commitment reflected in this bill.", "Community benefits agreements are legally binding contracts that detail the specific benefits a community must receive from a given development project, such as equitable hiring practices, funding for training, neighbourhood improvements, good jobs, and support for social enterprise. They are gaining traction in the US and are starting in Ontario, so why not use this bill to incentivize municipalities to develop community benefits agreements as a criterion for major infrastructure projects?", "The bill also requires apprentices to be hired for the construction or maintenance of infrastructure projects, but provides very little detail on what this will mean in practice. We understand that these details will be worked out in regulation; however, it will be critical to ensure that apprenticeship ratios are maintained. I look forward to hearing from the construction trades about this bill during the committee process and what they believe needs to be included in the regulations to ensure increased and more systematic use of apprentices on large infrastructure projects.", "Finally, perhaps the most worrisome provision of this bill is the regulatory authority it gives to the Minister of Infrastructure to establish regulations on virtually any infrastructure issue, including what infrastructure can be exempted from the definition of infrastructure. This kind of extremely broad latitude always raises concerns for Legislatures because passing such a bill is like writing a blank cheque: It’s an open-ended invitation for the minister to introduce regulations on almost any aspect of infrastructure planning and funding.", "Before I close, I want to comment on two other gaps I see in this legislation.", "First, it doesn’t require school boards and municipalities and other broader public sector entities to work together to make infrastructure planning decisions. What I experienced as a school board trustee was boards and municipalities often working in isolation instead of collaborating to maximize the impact of infrastructure investments in supporting the well-being of citizens and the needs of communities.", "The other gap I see: Certainly, I think this bill is attempting to take a triple-bottom-line approach to infrastructure planning, but it is very weak as currently written. There’s only one vague reference to environmental sustainability as a principle that should be considered, and there is basically no reference to social benefits other than the hiring of apprentices and the principle that core services like health and education should continue to be delivered. I also believe that this is an aspect of the bill that could definitely be strengthened, and I hope we will be hearing about that when and if the bill moves to committee. Triple-bottom-line approaches ensure not only environmental protection, not only an economic boost, but also that people who are disadvantaged and marginalized from the labour market receive some of the benefits of infrastructure projects.", "In closing, New Democrats do have some reservations about this bill. We are concerned about the lack of impact that we suspect it will have on ensuring evidence-based infrastructure planning from this government. However, we believe there is enough merit in the bill to support it through the second reading process, and we are very much looking forward to hearing from stakeholders at the committee about how this bill can be strengthened." ],

  "text" : [ "It’s my pleasure to speak to this bill. As the member from Toronto–Danforth pointed out, it’s unfortunate that we even need a bill like this because the government already has the power and the authority and I would say the responsibility to plan for infrastructure and investments.", "However, the nature of government is such that all good planning and investment priorities are not done as they might be in the private sector, where profit would be the motivation, keeping costs under control would be a motivation and delivery of good services and good products would be the motivation. Sometimes other things happen, like, strangely, gas plants get closed—and that was not for profit; at least, maybe for political gain—and other activities like that that have interfered with investment planning as we want to do it now and in the future. We find ourselves now in a position where we can’t afford subways because bad investment planning was done in the past, with gas plants and things of that nature.", "Our member from Lanark–Frontenac–Lennox and Addington articulated very clearly that what’s wrong with this bill—which is a well-intentioned bill, unfortunately a necessary bill, because we have a government that’s not doing what it should be doing: There’s no accountability for compliance, no penalties, and therefore the bill will not be complied with. There are no penalties, no reason to comply with the unfortunate need to even write this bill.", "We will support the bill because unfortunately government needs this kind of thing. We will have to put amendments into it in committee for accountability and oversight." ],

  "text" : [ "I sat very attentively and listened to the words of the member for London West. She touched on the lack of enforcements and consequences within this. This is another announcement which is going to bring concern in regard to bringing proper transparency, oversight and accountability on it. She was right when she highlighted that this was one of the first bills this government brought forward in their new mandate on July 7, 2014, and quite frankly, this is probably only the second or third time that they’ve talked about it. Traditionally, they have to do it six, seven, eight times before it moves forward. So it’s still a long way from actually becoming policy.", "In her comments she talked about the P3s and the amount of money that the Auditor General was able to identify that was lost in years of P3 development and projects. We’re talking about $8 billion, Mr. Speaker: $8 billion. That’s with a “b”—$8 billion. That’s a heck of a lot of money. That’s money that we could be using today. If we had that money, would this government actually be considering selling off and privatizing Hydro One? I think not, because that’s money that would be going toward our services and our programs.", "One last comment that I wanted to make on behalf of the member: She talked about something in regard to baking, some kind of a recipe, something going on. And you know what? I look at this bill—this is like a birthday cake, but the only people who are going to benefit from this cook are Bay Street individuals and large construction consortiums, which are not only going to benefit from blowing out the candles, but they’re going to be eating their cake as well." ],

I would like to suggest that there were four weeks when there was nothing talked about but the riding of Sudbury and there was lots of time then to talk about jobs and prosperity.", "But moving on: If passed and proclaimed, this proposed legislation would build on this work by ensuring that current and future governments regularly prepare long-term infrastructure plans and continue to improve how this province prioritizes and addresses infrastructure needs. We need that. We need to know that it’s not going to be left for years and years and years and hope that it doesn’t break down. We need to have plans so that it doesn’t cost as much money as it does because it has broken down.", "The number one thing that the city of Barrie wants is money for infrastructure. I know that the rural communities, when I’ve been at rural events, definitely need roads and bridges improved. This will help them, and they’re very happy about it.", "In Barrie on Friday, we were there and our government announced that we will be having our GO train be more of a priority, and over five years we will have it all day, every day—that is very exciting—both ways. We believe that we’ll be able to entice people to come and visit Barrie, not just have people from Barrie commuting in to work in Toronto.", "I urge everyone to pass this bill." ],

We question why you need a law to enable the government to do that. Isn’t that something the government could just go ahead and do? What this legislation includes is a list of feel-good, motherhood principles that it says the government should consider, but there is no requirement that these principles actually be reflected and incorporated into the long-term infrastructure plans that are brought forward. We have serious reservations about the lack of enforcement of this bill.", "The member for Kitchener Centre talks about the social benefit of the jobs that are created, and that’s one of the issues about infrastructure investments. We know that jobs are created, but who is benefiting from those jobs? Are jobs being created for people who are long-term unemployed, who are disadvantaged, who have been marginalized from the labour market, who are living in poverty, who need opportunities to get a leg up in the labour market? There are no current provisions in this bill to ensure that there are some strong, targeted social benefits for individuals who have been shut out of Ontario’s economy.", "Speaker, as I said, we will be supporting this bill. We would love to see some evidence-based planning in infrastructure investments to prevent more P3s." ],

He’s a cop’s cop, having worked alongside the members of his force for more than 30 years, coming up through the ranks to the position of top cop.", "Prior to his days as chief, Bill Blair worked in many different areas of the Toronto Police Service. Starting as a beat officer in downtown Toronto—a somewhat different downtown in those days, I suspect, than we see today—his career saw him involved in some of the most challenging areas of policing. Drug enforcement, organized crime and major criminal investigations were all areas of the force that Chief Blair spent time in, broadening his experience.", "Among the many achievements he has had as chief, the development and implementation of the Toronto Anti-Violence Intervention Strategy stands out as an innovative way to go about combatting violent crime.", "As chief, he has spent the last 10 years working with members of his force, various levels of government and the city as a whole—a valued member of the Toronto community through his involvement in a variety of organizations such as Covenant House and the United Way.", "It would be remiss of me not to mention that Chief Blair and I share the same alma mater, the University of Toronto. While I’m pretty sure we weren’t there at quite the same time and we didn’t major in the same courses—he having completed his degree in economics and criminology—I’m pleased to say that we are both graduates of that wonderful place across the street, and to announce that Chief Blair hasn’t really left, as he’s now going to lecture at the University of Toronto.", "As his time as Toronto chief of police draws to a close, I’m proud to stand in this House and join members of the PC caucus—and, I’m sure, all members of the House—and ask my fellow members to congratulate Chief Blair for a job very well done." ],

Tragically, it can be fatal in one or two days.", "About 1,000 people die from meningitis every year. Public awareness is key. It’s so important that we’re better informed, better aware, of the dangers of meningitis, and that’s why recognizing April 24 as World Meningitis Day is so important. By proclaiming this day, we can ensure that there’s a platform to ensure that there’s further education and awareness around the symptoms and what can be done to address this very dangerous disease. We can ensure that no one else has to lose a loved one to this very serious and tragic disease.", "Again, it’s my hope to see this bill passed and April 24 will be recognized as World Meningitis Day in Ontario." ],

In fact, as the Harper government balances the books, the Wynne Liberals continue to increase their deficit to a level 68% higher than those of all other provinces and territories combined. Apparently, budgets do not, in fact, balance themselves.", "While Ontario suffers through a decade-plus of Liberal waste, mismanagement and scandal, the federal surplus in Ottawa means new opportunities for Canadians. When you get your fiscal house in order, Speaker, you can help families and businesses.", "Even as Ontario sells Hydro One to pay off Liberal spending-addiction debts, federal Conservatives are delivering a $27-billion package of family-focused tax cuts, including an expansion of the universal child care benefit.

Our forests provide a wide range of benefits to each of us, and I can assure the members of the House of our government’s unwavering commitment to our province’s forests and to our province’s forest industry.", "Our government has committed to protecting over 225,000 square kilometres of northern Ontario through the Far North Act, which includes large swaths of the boreal forest. We are committed to sustainable forest management practices that ensure the long-term health of our forests while also supporting economic prosperity for present and future generations. That is why we have put in place a regulatory framework that is grounded in science and that is open and transparent to those that may be affected.", "We harvest at sustainable levels. The actual harvest occurs on only 0.6% of the managed forest. This framework includes an independent forest audit on every management unit at regular intervals. Where issues are identified, the ministry takes appropriate action. In fact, through careful environmental stewardship, we’re not only protecting our forests and the species that call them home, but we are also helping to create good jobs in Ontario while marketing our world-class forestry sector on the global stage.", "Speaker, our forest industry has been at the table with government to ensure that Ontario’s rigorous forest management practices promote the long-term health of our forests. Working together, we have become world leaders in sustainable forest management.", "Almost 80% of Ontario’s managed crown forests are third-party certified—almost 80%. That compares with just 10% globally.

In fact, our government has invested over $1.3 billion in our forest industry through a range of programs, such as the provincial forest access roads funding program and the Northern Industrial Electricity Rate Program.", "The provincial forest access roads funding program benefits not only the forest industry, but all users. These roads provide essential rural infrastructure for emergency preparedness and response.", "We recently announced a permanent investment of up to $120 million per year under the Northern Industrial Electricity Rate Program. This certainly may encourage even more investment in Ontario’s forestry sector.", "We also held the largest wood supply competition in Ontario’s history, and we continue to work with municipalities, with aboriginal communities and with the forest industry to modernize our forest tenure system.", "Our government launched the Ontario Wood brand, and we’re working with industry partners to promote Ontario wood. When they see the Ontario Wood brand, Ontarians will know that they are helping to support jobs in our province, and reducing their environmental impact by using a resource that is both attractive and renewable.", "Last September, our government changed the building code to enable wood-framed buildings of up to six storeys. It is estimated that this one policy change alone will result in an increase in sales in the range of $150 million to $200 million a year.", "We know Ontario’s forest industry is more than just lumber. Over the past six years, we have worked with the Bluewater Wood Alliance, a cluster of over 60 secondary wood products producers in southwestern Ontario’s traditional furniture and hardwood flooring industry.", "We also have a growing wood pellet industry. Last year, the Atikokan generating station completed its conversion. It’s now fuelled entirely by wood pellets. Those pellets are being harvested and processed in northern Ontario. Ontario suppliers are also providing wood pellets to international buyers, and there are opportunities to use pellets to replace diesel generation for remote communities.", "I am pleased to see increases in the use of biomass energy. Biomass helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigates the effects of climate change.", "Our forest industry has been through challenging times in recent years, but we’re seeing positive developments. Companies are investing millions in communities like Hornepayne, Atikokan, Ignace, Thunder Bay and others. Greater demand for wood products, increased US housing starts and a lower Canadian dollar are all helping to contribute to the recovery. Ontario’s forest products exports are increasing.", "We still face challenges, but we’re heading in a positive direction. The combination of a market that’s on the upswing and our government’s ongoing support bodes well for the Ontario forest sector. This is an important sector. It generates over $11 billion in economic activity and supports over 170,000 people in 260 communities across Ontario, in both the north and in the south as well.", "As Ontario’s Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry, I want to recognize everyone who works in our industry for their contributions to our province. Ensuring that we maintain sustainable forest management is essential for industry and for our province. We’ve got an excellent track record, which we continually strive to improve.

Today, mills across the province operate and produce a variety of products ranging from newsprint to specialty papers, veneers, cardboards, lumber, plywood and strand board. The forestry sector has produced as much as 3.3 billion board feet of lumber, 7.2 million metric tonnes of pulp and paper, 5.2 billion square feet of panels, veneer and other value-added wood products annually.", "The forestry sector employs, both directly and indirectly, 200,000 people across the province. The forestry industry is one of this province’s and the country’s largest industrial employers.", "We know that the sector’s future success is dependent on the health of the forest resource, and we congratulate the industry for making tremendous achievements in sustainable forest management. Thanks to their dedication, Ontario’s forest practices are among the world’s best.", "I commend the forestry industry on fully utilizing their resource. Whole logs are used to make lumber, while wood chips left over from the lumber-making process become the raw material for pulp and particleboard. Hog fuel, which contains bark and other wood waste, is burned for energy. Biosolids, which includes wood fibres, the organic by-products of effluent treatment and mineral matter such as clay and lime, are used as soil conditioners on agricultural land.", "The forestry industry is a major contributor to the economy in Ontario. For every dollar generated by the industry, approximately 16 cents is paid to the government. In short, the forest industry is helping to meet the economic, environmental and social needs of Canadians without jeopardizing the ability of future generations to carry on the industry.", "However, Mr. Speaker, I must also point out that this government needs to do more for the industry. As the forestry sector grows as a result of market rebound, companies are looking to invest in production and create more jobs. Ontario needs to address the elephant in the room—industrial electricity rates. As a primary resource industry, forestry is energy-intensive.", "The government has introduced a number of programs that provide some relief from the steady rise in electricity pricing. However, given the government’s own projections in the recent long-term energy plan, these benefits are quickly being erased along with any small competitive advantage. A coherent encompassing energy policy will allow manufacturers to reduce costs, make investments and maintain jobs. We must ensure that our industry remains in Ontario instead of moving to cheaper jurisdictions such as Quebec. Ontario must have competitive energy rates.", "The minister and this government know that Ontario’s sustainable forestry sector, with proper public policy, such as that brought forward by Nipissing member Vic Fedeli’s wood frame buildings act a year or two ago—congratulations, Vic—competitive measures and competitive electricity rates will continue to flourish and our forestry sector will maintain jobs for generations to come.", "On behalf of the PC Party, I’d like to thank those who work in the forestry industry for their contribution to our province." ],

  "text" : [ "On behalf of the New Democrats and our leader Andrea Horwath, I want to first of all acknowledge that those who work in the forest industry, quite frankly, are a good example of how we can green our planet. A lot of people don’t know the story, but the forest industry has been, for years, managing the forests in such a way that allows for the regeneration of oxygen on this planet probably beyond what people recognize.", "We have been managing our forests in this province in a sustainable way for years. We have done that in such a way that watches the ecosystem to make sure that not only do we have a healthy forest when it comes to being able to harvest trees—and really, this is what this is, it’s a harvesting business. It’s somewhat like farming except the flowers and the wheat are a little bit bigger. They’re growing trees, but what we end up with is also a very healthy forest where animals and fauna are taken into account to make sure that we protect them as we do our forest activities. We’ve been doing this in northern Ontario, through our forest industry, for some years now.", "I can tell you that, as a northerner, I get frustrated because a lot of people don’t realize we’re at the vanguard of this and sometimes we’re accused, in northern Ontario and in the forest industry, of somehow being opposed to the greening of our planet and making sure that we do things right on the environmental side. I’m just here to say, we’ve been doing it for years and we’d like to have a little bit of recognition for that every now and then.", "The other thing I want to say is that the minister says—and I want to say this in as gentle a way I can because I will be extremely critical. The government says, “Oh, there’s such an importance to this industry, and this government knows that.” Well, you’ve got a funny way of showing it because, if you look at what industry has had to do for a number of years now, since the beginning of this Liberal administration, it has been to spend more time lobbying us, members of this assembly on all sides of the House, in order to deal with the myriad of things that this government has done that, quite frankly, have not led to a more efficient harvest, have not led to a more efficient industry, have not led to building a stronger economy, but have led to us having to basically try to protect what it is we’ve been doing for a long time, which is sustainable forest redevelopment.", "I look at the government across the way and I think of the many things we’ve had to deal with, and I’m just going to go through a couple of them. The government says they’ve put in place the northern industrial program when it comes to electricity. Well, electricity prices used to be three times less than what they are now at the beginning of this privatization scheme. The very fact that the government had to put this program in place—and I’ve got to say it’s necessary. If you didn’t have that plan, there’s a number of mills in my riding that would close their doors, as we’ve seen in Iroquois Falls, where that mill has closed its doors because we can’t afford the electricity prices.", "But the point I make is this: The very fact that the government has got to put those programs in place speaks to the lack and wrongheadedness of the policy when it comes to electricity in the province of Ontario and how it’s really affected the bottom line of being able to operate in this industry and others.", "The government crows that they’ve been able to invest in roads that lead to the forest when it comes to being able to do what we have to do in the forest. Well, it was the government in their own budget that withdrew money that was much-needed in order to be able to support the industry when it comes to making sure that we build roads that not only the industry uses—and this is the point—but local residents and other utilizers of the forest use as well. It is everybody from the cottager to the people who pick blueberries to the First Nations people to the people who want to go hunt and fish to people who are in the exploration industry. Those roads are used by many people, and what we have is a government that says, “Well, we’re going to slow down the tap when it comes to supporting this industry.”", "We have no difficulty and I support making sure that we build infrastructure when we build new plants, whether it be a car plant or whatever in southern Ontario, because that is the cost of economic development. Governments come to the table; they provide what is much-needed infrastructure when it comes to attracting those investments. But where we do have the investment here already, industry has had to be at Queen’s Park for the last 12 years to lobby to stop the erosion of the support of the infrastructure that is so needed within their industry when it comes to regulation, when it comes to legislation, when it comes to electricity prices and when it comes to what goes on generally in the industry.", "So I say to my friends that are here today, there is hope. You’ve survived this long. You’ve survived this long because, quite frankly, you guys know what you’re doing and you’ve been very effective. You’ve had good communities. You’ve had good partnerships with the people in the communities where your establishments are in the forest industry, be it a sawmill or a paper mill or whatever it might be. But we will continue working together because we understand, in northern Ontario, the importance of making sure that this industry not only stays, but that it prospers and that we allow the growth of this industry to go in a way that quite frankly it has not been able to for some time." ],

  "text" : [ "The Ontario PC caucus put forward this motion today because we’re gravely concerned about the direction this province is going in under the Liberal government and very wary regarding what will be in the government’s budget tomorrow.", "This government has a history of fiscal mismanagement and a chronic spending problem. Their years of bad spending decisions are beginning to show up in the reductions to services that we’re seeing across the province.", "A number of weeks ago in this House I spoke of the size of the provincial debt and gave some examples of what services were being crowded out as a result of the interest payments on the $288 billion worth of debt.", "I said that we believed the Liberal government could do much better in its 2015 budget than it did in 2014, and, to help them to improve their fiscal performance and better deliver services, we would raise a number of key issues and suggestions to be included in tomorrow’s budget.", "Over the last few weeks, my colleagues and I have raised five different issues and put forward five sensible solutions. We’ve asked the government to include them in the 2015 budget to be delivered tomorrow. Only by embracing the direction we have laid out will the province begin to turn the corner, stop hurting people and start on a path to a better economy that will create jobs.", "Again, the five items we asked the government to commit to in its budget are:", "First, an announcement that the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan will not be pursued, as it places an enormous burden on businesses and individuals and will kill jobs in this province. The finance ministry’s own internal documents show that it will kill at least 18,000 jobs in its first year of introduction. This mandatory plan is another tax on both employers and their employees. It will mean less money today in people’s pockets, which will affect their spending and ultimately affect the entire economy. The government is yet again trying to tell people how to spend their money. Mr. Speaker, most people know they have to save for their retirement. In fact, a study by the McKinsey consulting group reports that 83% of Canadians are already saving adequate amounts for their retirement. Any new proposal should be focusing on the 17% remaining who need a little bit more help with saving for their retirement. On top of all of this, the government has yet to provide a definition of what a comparable pension plan might be. Who knows what will happen with existing pension plans? I urge the government to take the opportunity tomorrow to say you have seen the light and tell us you will not be going ahead with this plan.", "Our second ask is a commitment that a pay-to-pollute carbon tax or its close cousin, a cap-and-trade process, not be adopted, as it is a cost that Ontario residents and businesses cannot afford. This is merely another misguided tax that will create even more of a financial burden than people are already carrying. In the jurisdictions where it has been tried, cap and trade and carbon pricing have been a failure and have increased costs for all ratepayers while doing almost nothing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In last year’s election, the Premier told the people of Ontario that she wouldn’t implement a carbon tax. She should have stuck to this promise, but she does still have an opportunity to make up for what she’s been saying about the tax recently and to tell the people in tomorrow’s budget that she won’t go ahead with this nonsense.", "Our third request is a plan to fix home care by streamlining the system to reduce the number of agencies and the layers of bureaucracy that patients must deal with by tying community care access centre funding outcomes with clearly defined results. Health care providers, stakeholders, patients and their families have said that the system is broken. Currently, home care services are inadequate and inconsistent. If it’s this bad today, what will it be like when we have even more seniors in the system? The Donner report, a recent report issued by the government, highlighted that the two biggest issues with today’s home care system are excessive bureaucracy and a lack of accountability for system outcomes. This report and these issues must be addressed, and soon. Again, Mr. Speaker, we hope these will be addressed in tomorrow’s budget.", "Our fourth ask is a serious, credible and detailed plan to balance the budget by 2017-18. It’s desperately needed. All we’ve heard on this subject to date are platitudes and numbers that don’t add up. In fact, this government hasn’t even been able to keep its own deficit numbers straight. Rather than reducing the deficit as they claim, the deficit has actually been rising, going from $9.2 billion in the 2012-13 fiscal year to $10.5 billion in the 2013-14 fiscal year, to this year at $10.9 billion. Dealing with the deficit has been done on a wing and a prayer, and if the province is to have a hope of turning its finances around, there needs to be a solid plan put in place immediately. Interest payments on the debt are beginning to crowd out critical front-line services like health care and education. Over the last number of weeks, we’ve seen 249 nurses laid off, 250 teaching positions lost in Toronto alone, and 118 teachers lost in Kawartha, to state just a few examples.", "Finally, we ask for a commitment to reduce electricity prices so that all people and businesses no longer have to be paying some of the highest energy costs in North America. Every time we turn around, hydro rates are going up. Just on Monday, we heard that rates will rise by 15% on May 1. The government’s wasteful spending on the Green Energy Act and the awarding of FIT energy contracts are but two of the reasons that electricity prices are skyrocketing here in Ontario by more than $1,100 a year for the average homeowner. This amount is without either Monday’s announcement or the increases that will result from the privatization of a majority share of Hydro One. Clearly, real action needs to be taken, and needs to be taken now, to reduce electricity prices and bring back manufacturing and create jobs in this province.", "In conclusion, as I said in March, this government needs to get its fiscal house in order—my colleagues say it every day—and we need to stop making the people of Ontario carry the burden for this overspending and lack of financial control. My caucus colleagues and I have presented five sensible solutions to assist this government. We’ll be hoping and watching to see that they’re in the budget tomorrow. I urge all members of this House to support our motion this afternoon." ],

Ontario, prior to the Mike Harris attempt to privatize and the Ernie Eves attempt to privatize the system, used to generate about 25,000 megawatts. Our total generation capacity was roughly 25,000 megawatts. At a time when the economy of Ontario was doing rather well, our demand was somewhere around 19,000 to 21,000 megawatts. Yes, there were some times that the demand went above that, but generally it was 19,000 to 21,000 megawatts.", "The Conservatives first, followed by the Liberals who really accelerated this, signed private power deals with their friends in the private sector in order to build energy projects that generate electricity at a much higher cost than we see our public assets delivering energy. For example, from falling water at the Niagara Falls dams at Beck or on the Mattagami River, or wherever they might be, we’re able to generate electricity for around 3.5 to 4 cents per kilowatt hour. If you look at our nuclear plants, they’re able to generate electricity at about 5 to 6 cents per kilowatt hour. Our total capacity, between the nuclear side—what used to be the complete nuclear side, because we privatized Bruce—and the hydroelectric side, used to be somewhere around 15,000 to 16,000 megawatts. The government, by way of its privatization schemes under the Conservatives and by way of privatization under the Liberals, has increased the capacity of the system by 10,000 to 12,000 megawatts—" ],

Yes, you refurbish what you have when it comes to your various hydro facilities, but you don’t add capacity in the way that we did.", "Currently we’re using sometimes, on average, between 14,000 and 16,000 megawatts at any one time in our system, and our system is able to generate about 30,000 to 35,000 megawatts depending on what’s running on that particular day.

And what’s worse is, we are locked into buying it whether we need it or not. So when Ontario needs 14,000 megawatts of power, we run the water through the dams by not running our generators, or we run our generators at our dams as motors. At our nuclear facilities, we’re actually venting steam because we’re not buying the nuclear power from them at times because we have to buy power at two, three and four times the cost from the private power deals that they’ve signed.", "Now this government is trying to make us believe that privatizing Hydro One is going to lead to efficiencies and save us all kinds of money. Well, I’ve seen what the efficiencies have done to my hydro bill. People across this province have seen what that has done to their hydro bills. Privatization has led to higher hydro prices, industries have had to shut down, such as Xstrata in Timmins and many more across this province, and people can’t afford it.", "One of the concerns, I have to say, in this motion—and this is one of the key reasons I will not vote for this motion—is that they talk about a commitment to reduce energy prices.

My remarks will be devoted to the proposed Ontario Retirement Pension Plan.", "From the introduction of this pension scheme, we have raised issues. First, the government hasn’t provided a plan. Questions abound, but with no answers. Employers have told the government that the mandatory financial contributions will cost jobs, and we know that jobless people can’t pay into or collect a pension. Employers and employees alike will have less money in their pockets, reducing their purchasing power now.", "People want choice in their spending priorities and their saving methods. The ORPP robs Ontarians of that choice. It is clear to those who understand what’s at stake that this pension scheme must be abandoned.", "Instead, next week, we will have third reading of Bill 56, the ORPP bill, amid uncertainty. Let me explain. There is no clear definition of who is in or who is out of the plan. How many years will individuals be required to make contributions in order to receive benefits? For those who see this as an opportunity for a pension, there is also uncertainty—no idea how their money will be handled and how investment returns will be generated. We don’t even know whether this ORPP is a Ponzi scheme, fraught with intergenerational inequity, whereby younger participants are paying for the older, soon-to-be-retired.", "The lack of a plan has created further uncertainty, as there is no definition of “comparable” workplace pension plan. What will be the impact on existing private sector pensions? Hundreds of thousands of people employed in Ontario have workplace pension plans that, together, amount to trillions in assets.", "In 12 hours of public hearings, we heard 41 speakers. It was clear that the majority who spoke were opposed for a number of reasons. One concern raised is that, without exemptions, the ORPP may crowd out or eliminate existing pension plans and retirement savings plans. For many people, this may mean that the ORPP provides no net increase to savings, or it may even reduce their retirement assets. Without a plan, it is impossible to evaluate; only speculate.", "Another aspect is that the 1.9% contribution, provided by both the employee and the employer, is tax-exempt. Without a plan, we don’t even know if the government has contemplated the impact on its revenues. How much is the government losing in tax revenue by this approach? We don’t know about administration costs. How much will it cost to provide a stand-alone pension scheme: $300 million, $400 million? With no plan in place, it’s back to speculation.", "But there is a clue in last year’s budget, on page 20 of the introduction: “By unlocking value from its assets and encouraging more Ontarians to save through a proposed new” pension plan, “new pools of capital would be available for Ontario-based projects such as building roads, bridges and new transit. Our strong alternative financing and procurement model, run by Infrastructure Ontario, will allow for the efficient deployment of this capital....”", "But this too leaves much open to uncertainty. “Efficient deployment of this capital” doesn’t sound like a solid foundation for a pension plan; it sounds more like a building fund. There is a difference. With a properly tendered public-private partnership, infrastructure investment is carried by the private sector to build, and there is no evidence to illustrate the mechanism by which this process would provide the stream of income necessary for a pension.", "My remarks today reflect the genuine concern that I and my caucus colleagues share about this proposal and its effect on the well-being of Ontarians. We know, through public discourse, businesses from around the province, and even the Ministry of Finance document, that this proposal is a job-killer.", "Small businesses especially have been assaulted by this government by increased red tape and matching increased fees. They don’t have any financial cushions to absorb this proposal. Instead, they see a government bent on squeezing more money from them through increased hydro rates, a mandatory pension contribution and a carbon tax, to name a few. Businesses can only pay these when they make a profit. More and more these days, businesses are unable to make a profit. They close their shop or move away.", "I remind the Premier that the jobless rate has been the worst in this country for the last six years. The last thing Ontarians need is a plan to kill jobs.", "Premier, unemployed people and people who will have to shutter their businesses are the people whose lives will be drastically affected by your pension scheme.

The government can say they put some additional money in, but that went to new initiatives. Rozanski, back in 2002-03, identified $2 billion which was removed by the PC caucus—this is, like, 14 years ago, 13 years ago. That money has never been replaced to the core funding of public education, because you directed the new funding to new initiatives. So you can’t say that you’ve increased core funding. It went to your political interests. Now, on full-day kindergarten, that was also one of our interests, and I would never speak out against investing early in children. But the problem was that the Liberal government didn’t follow their own advice, which Charles Pascal recommended, with our best future in mind, and that was to create community hubs. But you succumbed to the pressure that was out there around changing the status quo of what schools should be doing and what should happen in education, and you backed off that plan, which really was such a waste of energy. It just created more conflict between child care and education.", "Now, it did in Ottawa, and in Waterloo, I’m very proud to say, we actually followed through on the initial report that Charles Pascal made, the recommendations he made to the government. At no cost to the taxpayer, because it’s a not-for-profit model and because there’s a wraparound model of care, we created almost 2,000 child care spaces in Waterloo region at no cost to the taxpayer. That’s the kind of creative, innovative idea that this government should be pursuing, not selling off a public asset at $4 billion. There is a $100-billion backlog on the infrastructure file in this province alone. You guys drop $4 billion on the way to work.

The Ombudsman also raised this. Of course, the Ombudsman is not going to have oversight over the new hydro. It’s a very sought-after job. Of course, everybody is looking for a job in Ontario these days. They want that beer ombudsman job. It’s definitely a highly sought-after job. It was all over Twitter, actually, when that first story broke out. The Ombudsman is not going to have oversight over this important file around energy.", "Then we have this transit issue. The Conservatives are calling for a serious, credible and detailed plan to balance the budget by 2017-18. Well, there are so many knowledgeable stakeholders—chambers of commerce, municipalities, Better Business Bureaus, universities. They’ve come together in Kitchener-Waterloo, my community, and they’ve gathered the research and the evidence to make the case for two-way, all-day GO to Kitchener-Waterloo. This promise is like Groundhog Day. Just before the election, the Minister of Transportation and the Premier went all the way around Waterloo region and promised two-way, all-day, 30-minute service. The former Minister of Transportation even offered us a bullet train. I love that. I love that he said, “We can get a bullet train going along the Windsor-Toronto corridor for $500 million.” I guess some people bought it. But on Friday, when they made their last announcement, of course, Waterloo region was left out of that equation. The whole idea of two-way, all-day means that people from Toronto can also get to Kitchener-Waterloo. So now we’re waiting 10 years—a 10-year wait on top of a five-year wait makes us a priority community. Do you know what? I just hope that the people of Kitchener-Waterloo don’t buy what you’re selling next time around. I’ll be here to remind them about the broken promises. It’s disgraceful for a Minister of Transportation to stand up and say to the community that generates hundreds of millions of dollars—that’s the key piece. That’s the economic development piece. In Kitchener-Waterloo, amazing things are happening: the commercialization of research, the innovation, the research, the advanced manufacturing. Google is there, and Desire2Learn. Good things are happening in Kitchener-Waterloo, but people need to get there, and they also need to get home, and they live here in Toronto. The municipalities of Kitchener and Waterloo made a proposal. It was delivered to the cabinet. The cabinet said, “This is amazing. This is worthwhile investing in.” That was before the election. On Friday, we found out that we’re now a priority by waiting an additional 10 years.", "We’re obviously concerned about transit. As the Auditor General points out, the more we delay these decisions and investments—the longer that the economic investment will pay off. Then, because the government is not generating that revenue, which they’re so desperate for, they, in turn, will not have the money to invest in education and health care. Those are the core values which people in this province have said they really value.", "So what we’re going to be looking at in this budget—the public-private partnerships. You can’t ignore the AG’s report altogether; you can’t just dismiss it out of hand. Even if you don’t take the $8.2 billion, the $6.5 billion in financing and legal and consulting costs that were above and beyond what a traditional procurement process—you can’t ignore that. Governments can borrow money as low as 3%. It’s not like you can leave the province, because you’re the government. They know that you’re not going to skip town. Although, I’m sure some people, on some days, may want to." ],

  "text" : [ "I’m pleased to join the debate today on the PC Party’s opposition day motion, specifically regarding carbon tax. Last March, I requested that this Liberal government not adopt a carbon tax. The announcement of the cap-and-trade program does not change this. It’s just a tax by a different name.", "Last Monday, when this cap-and-trade scheme was announced, even the Premier admitted it would be a tax. This tax will increase the cost of living and raising a family. It will also increase the cost of doing business here in Ontario. It is an irresponsible tax that Ontarians cannot afford.", "This tax was introduced for no other reason but to fund a cash-strapped, mismanaged Liberal government on the backs of Ontarians, and it’s unacceptable. Ontario already is in a dire economic state. This government has a nearly $11-billion deficit that has increased for a third straight year, up from $10.5 billion last year to $10.9 billion. By 2017-18, Ontario’s net debt will have reached $325 billion, nearly $23,000 for every Ontarian.", "Instead of taking responsible steps to balance their budget, the Liberals are instead trying to find new sources of revenue, which means taxing Ontarians in any possible way. This budget is all about gouging Ontarians. Cap-and-trade, the sale of Hydro One, changes to how beer is sold, ORPP, these are all initiatives that have one thing in common: an increase in costs for Ontarians. Again, I repeat: Ontario families and businesses simply cannot afford another tax to fund Liberal mismanagement.", "Now, let’s talk about the carbon tax, the cap-and-trade scheme that they’ve talked about. According to Stats Canada, Ontario has only contributed half a percentage point towards global greenhouse gas emissions, making Ontario very much a marginal producer of carbon emissions compared to many developing states around the world. The result of a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade, whether it decreases emissions or not, will undoubtedly be rising costs to consumers across the marketplace. The costs of heating or cooling a home will increase, while companies in energy-intensive fields will have increased costs that will be passed on to consumers, or they may very well just choose to leave Ontario, causing consumers to lose their jobs.", "We already pay some of the highest energy rates in North America. We saw, just this week, that hydro rates will be going up yet again under this Liberal government by 14%. A further increase, by the way of a tax on carbon, may drive families into a heat-or-eat scenario. This Liberal cap-and-trade or pay-to-pollute scheme isn’t a plan to reduce emissions, but rather it’s a plan to take money from taxpayers to fund government initiatives.", "Speaker, I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: Based on history, I have absolutely zero trust that this government can implement this type of system properly. It’ll be just like the health tax implemented previously. It’s called a health tax, but this revenue doesn’t even go into the health sector. Instead, the health tax, one of the largest tax hikes in Ontario history, goes into general revenue—general revenue that is the Liberals’ slush fund to pay for their billion-dollar scandals, such as gas plants and eHealth. The list can go on. All the while, front-line health care continues to be cut.", "I was speaking with OPSEU representatives today and I heard that the equipment is there to do a lot of procedures, but in many cases, they cut the procedure because the hospitals can’t afford the man-hours to run the equipment. I share that with you because last Monday, a week ago this past Monday, my sister-in-law broke her leg below the knee in two places. She is only being operated on today to get a rod inserted. It’s absolutely abysmal what this Liberal government has done to our health care.", "You know what? I would dare reflect on a comment made by the former Premier and also the former energy minister, when they professed that the gas plant cancellation would cost a mere $40 million. Sadly, we learned that they misled us when the figure was actually $1.1 billion. As I said before, I do not trust this government to get it right.", "Even if gas increases by three cents, like the government claims it will, that will cost Ontarians another $700 million a year. That’s an additional $100 per driver per year on top of everything else. It’s not just gas that will increase, but groceries, clothing and heating. As I said before, this is a tax on everything.", "It’s not the first time that the Liberals have copied a European energy plan before they saw the evidence. The Liberal Green Energy Act was going to save the environment, reduce pollution and create jobs. Instead, it caused energy prices to skyrocket, devastated communities, made Liberal friends rich and drove jobs out of this province. The Green Energy Act is a disaster, and this cap-and-trade tax is setting up to be the Green Energy Act 2.0. However, this time, it won’t be just electricity rates that soar, because now, as I mentioned before, sadly, their cap-and-trade scheme will be a tax on everything.", "The Green Energy Act cost each household $1,100 a year over and above what they were already paying. That’s $1,100 that could have gone towards saving for a home or for retirement. That is $1,100 from taxpayers’ pockets, and it’s about to get worse.", "Let’s be clear here. I care about the environment, and the PC Party of Ontario cares about the environment. I would be remiss if I didn’t mention today, Earth Day, which is a very important day across the world, that it was the PC Party of Ontario that invented the Ministry of the Environment. We were the party to shut down the first coal plant in Ontario, thanks to Environment Minister Elizabeth Witmer. The PC Party of Ontario created wetlands, stood for conservation, and we are truly the original environmental party here in Ontario. I just wish the other side of the House would acknowledge that.", "That is why I find it shameful that this government is planning to implement the cap-and-trade system or, as we call it on this side, pay-to-pollute. I call it that because emitters will still pollute, but they’ll just pay to do more of it. It is not helping or improving the environment; rather, it’s just increasing the cost of doing business, which in turn raises the cost of living here in Ontario.", "We have seen this system in place in other jurisdictions around the world, and what we have ultimately found is that it’s been plagued with fraud and mismanagement. It is a system that allows government to choose winners and losers—so really, when you think about it, it should not come as a surprise that this system is best fitted for this particular Liberal government.", "Instead of taxing all Ontarians, there are a number of other options that we could take a look at to deal with climate change without hurting businesses and families. We can take a closer look at the role of conservation, expanding forests, green spaces and wetlands. These are all natural and cost-effective solutions. We can also look at the role of innovation. We all know that the private sector drives innovation as long as the government stays out of its way and does not further burden them with red tape.", "There’s so much more I could go on about, Speaker, but at the end of the day, I would like to remind everyone that what we are asking for here today, by way of our PC opposition day motion, is a sensible solution that the PC Party knows will address the dire economic state of this province." ],

It’s actually a pleasure to rise today because we’re finally going to be discussing fiscal responsibility in this House instead of the usual lip service that the government pays to responsibility in question period.", "As I only have a few minutes today, I’d just like to highlight a couple of components of the motion that are of particular importance to the great riding of Chatham–Kent–Essex. We’re calling on the government to make a commitment to reduce energy prices so that all people and businesses no longer have to be paying some of the highest energy costs in all of North America.", "Yesterday I took a look at the Ontario Energy Board’s graph of historical energy prices. The upcoming May 1 spike to energy costs was so massive that the on-peak energy cost didn’t even fit on the OEB’s graph. The Liberals have literally sent energy prices through the roof. Since then, they’ve added a bit of height to the graph so that the skyrocketing prices actually fit, but since October 2011, hydro prices in the province of Ontario have actually increased 49.1%. All of that is on the backs of hard-working Ontarians.", "The graph that I was just referring to only goes back to 2006, but the latest hike is the biggest increase in energy costs in nearly a decade, and it’s only going to get worse from here as the Liberals move forward with their incredibly dangerous and extreme plan to sell off Hydro One for pennies on the dollar in order to pay for projects that a real government would be able to cost without selling off key assets.", "According to the Liberals’ long-term energy plan, which was revamped in 2013, hydro prices will rise even more by 2018. Who knows how much further these prices will rise with the Liberals’ plan to pawn off Hydro One?", "This is an absolute disgrace. I know that the members opposite didn’t campaign on this, and I wonder just how they feel about such a radical and dangerous plan. I wonder how many members sitting on government benches have ever had to fear the day that their hydro bill arrives in the mail. It’s an awful feeling. And I wonder if any of those members have ever had to make the choice between keeping the lights on and putting food on the table. I know for a fact that the great people in the town of Ridgetown, no less, are fearing that whenever their hydro bill comes in. I cannot believe just how high their hydro prices are. Thank you to this government.", "I also don’t believe and don’t know, really, how the members on that side of the House can, in fact, support a plan that will take so much money out of the pockets of their constituents and local businesses. In the case of small businesses, many people are going to be forced to choose between keeping staff or keeping the lights on.", "The last part of this motion actually calls on the government to have a serious, credible and detailed plan to balance the budget by 2017-18. Now, I said a credible plan. If they can do that, that will, in fact, be incredible. This is in contrast to the government’s ridiculous, unbelievable and detail-free sham of a plan to balance the budget by 2017-18.", "Balancing the budget is a difficult task and it requires years of hard work and thoughtful planning. We look to Ottawa. They took the time to chip away at their deficit until they were able to present a balanced budget. It took a lot of steps to get there." ],

I heard that from, I think, a federal Liberal leader at one point in time.", "As I said, it takes many steps to get a balanced budget.

This clinic means too much to the people of my riding as well as neighbouring ridings, whose members are also mad about the potential closure, to scrap it just so that the government can fund yet another pet project somewhere else in the province.", "The Liberals are planning on rewriting the law to use money raised from pawning off Hydro One to pay for unknown infrastructure projects, which they say will cut commute times in the GTA.

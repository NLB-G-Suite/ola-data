I think the key to this bill, which I was talking about last time, is that it provides another tool for people to save money for a pension plan. As we all know, not even 50% of the people in Ontario have pensions or save for pensions. I think we as a government have an obligation to encourage people to put aside money for when they retire.", "In my riding there are many people who come to see me—older people—and say, “I don’t have much money to retire.” They are in their sixties looking for jobs. It’s not a very pleasant situation to be in.", "When someone’s younger they think, “I’ll contribute later,” but you have to start as early as possible. And when you start reaching my age, you’ve got to realize that when you stop working you’ve got to have enough money to survive the rest of your life.", "I think our government is committed to implementing a bold new strategy to enhance this province’s retirement income security. That’s about all I want to say at this point. We do have other speakers on this matter and I could just pass it on to the other two members that I mentioned earlier." ],

Of course, this is a commitment the government made through the fall economic statement. We followed through in terms of introducing legislation last December. It’s an important piece of the puzzle in our efforts to enhance retirement income security for all Ontarians.", "This is partly spawned by the federal government’s unwillingness to enhance the CPP, which most Ontarians, indeed most Canadians, are dependent upon. For instance, in my riding of Ottawa South—and even in my own family, my father, who was on the Ontario Parole Board and the Federal Parole Board, did not actually have a pension, so he was dependent upon his RRSPs and the Canada Pension Plan. As he got older, he had to be very careful about spending his money. Many people in my riding of Ottawa South are dependent on the CPP.", "It’s incumbent upon us to provide a vehicle—which the PRPPs are—for small and medium-sized employers to be able to provide some security for their employees, and to have it work complementarily to the ORPP, the Ontario registered pension plan. We as legislators have to look 10, 15, 20 years down the road, to see where people are going to be at. I want to go back to the federal government, again, not enhancing the CPP, which I do believe is a mistake, is an abdication of responsibility. In the absence, or the vacuum, of taking on that responsibility of ensuring that Ontarians—indeed all Canadians—have access to a good, solid retirement plan, or some security, we have to take these measures.", "I’m fully supportive of this legislation, Bill 57, and PRPPs. As I said, they are a tool: They are a tool to work complementarily to the ORPP, to provide some retirement income security for those people who need it, to provide employers a vehicle by which they can support their employee and, again, work complementarily to the ORPP.", "As I said, I hope that we can get this legislation moving forward.

  "text" : [ "Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, and good morning. I’m very pleased to be given the time this morning to support Bill 57, following my colleagues from Ottawa South and Scarborough Southwest.", "There was a very important article written recently by Adam Mayers about the relationship between pensions and healthy communities. As most of you in the House know, as a former registered nurse, healthy communities are very important, not just to myself as a professional nurse, but also to every community here in Ontario.", "The author clearly states that, “In the private sector, 76% of employees don’t have a pension.” In contrast, “In the public sector, 86% do.” But the article is very interesting, Mr. Speaker. It looked at a study by the Boston Consulting Group. They were commissioned by four of Ontario’s largest pension plans, looking at the relationship between pension plans and the health of the community. Now, there’s a strong correlation, according to this article: that when you have a defined pension plan, the community is more healthy.", "I’m going to share some of the data as part of my remarks this morning. According to Adam Mayers and the folks from Boston Consulting, “In 2012, Canadian defined benefit plans paid out $72 billion to 3.5 million pensioners. Most of this money is spent where they live.” Again, that’s a good thing. They’re not travelling all over the world; they’re staying here in Ontario. I can’t stress it enough. “In Ontario, 7% of all income in our towns and cities, or $27 billion, is derived from defined benefit pensions.” The article continues on to talk about how “Seniors with defined benefit plans are confident consumers because the predictable income stream allows them to better plan their” business.", "The article concludes by the following: “Make workplace pensions mandatory to force savings. The coming Ontario Retirement Pension Plan is an example,” according to the author, of such a thing. Also, the author states, “Don’t wait. Governments should do something now, whether enhancing the CPP or going another way.” They also talk about sharing “the risk between the employees and employers, so that pensioners aren’t left managing” their own affairs.", "I heard, when we were debating Bill 57, the member from York–Simcoe speak eloquently in support of Bill 57.", "I know my colleague earlier talked about the fact that the federal government is not working in partnership with Ontario, but I also wanted to say that we’re not the first province to have PRPPs. Other provinces, like British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Nova Scotia and Quebec, have all already passed legislation to have PRPPs. We’re following other provinces.", "An important message is that in the proposed legislation, in the explanatory note, it’s clearly stated right at the beginning—it talks about how the purpose of this legislation is to provide a legal framework for the establishment of the administration of a type of pension plan that is accessible to both employees and those who are self-employed. We note that this province has a lot of self-employed individuals, and they are mainly small businesses. As such, it is a good thing to have such a framework to support those individuals, to make sure they retire with a healthy, comfortable income.", "More importantly, Mr. Speaker, the proposed legislation, if passed, will also set out rules for dealing with the funds of PRPP accounts for certain family law purposes, because often the family breaks down and a family will move across provinces. It’s very important that we set out the rules to make sure everybody is aware at the time of the establishment of the plan.", "The other piece about the proposed legislation is the fact that as a government we have been very clear to support seniors and their well-being as they retire. I have a very aging riding, Scarborough–Agincourt; a good proportion of my constituents are seniors.", "More importantly, the fact is that the government, in their fall 2014 economic statement, confirmed our intention to introduce this legislation. And I believe most members of the House to date who have spoken on Bill 57 support the intent of this bill. I hope that we can have further dialogue as this bill gets discharged to a committee, to seek out more stakeholders to discuss this bill further." ],

It’s like, they’ve got their legislation but they’re not that sure about it, or they’re not that proud of it. We’re just trying to figure out what they want, because normally a member gets 20 minutes to speak on a piece of legislation. I know my colleague from Huron–Bruce is going to speak a little bit later, and I’ll have the opportunity to help as well, fairly soon, to speak to this bill. But I’m just wondering what the MO of the Liberals is these days. It’s like they’re in and it’s changing like it’s musical debaters, just one after another?", "Having said that, I’m going to have to say to them, you’re going to have to pick a lane here. We’re just after having debated and, through time allocation and the power of the tyranny of the majority, they pushed through, on second reading, Bill 56, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan—You know, that one where it’s going to cost up to 18,000 jobs here in the province of Ontario for every $2 billion that it takes out of the economy; the one where there is simply no demonstrated need for it but it’s a good political move on the part of the government because they’re trying to pretend that somehow, if we pass Bill 56, everybody’s going to retire in luxury here in the province of Ontario, when the reality is that it’s up to everybody to plan. We’ve been doing that in Ontario through our RRSP system, the federal system, for many years.", "The fact that people are not putting enough money into their RRSPs is directly related to the fact that they don’t have enough after you people over there have taken it all from them.

He always adds a lively contribution to the debate, and I know we’re all awake after listening to his comments.", "But we know that the PRPP is not really the way to encourage people to save for a healthy retirement. We have RRSPs; there are those options out there. CPP is the right way; we need to enhance the CPP in order to actually effectively help people who are going to be in a retirement position to be able to afford the everyday costs of living: home, gas in their car, food in their belly.", "So we agree with the Ontario retirement plan. That one is one that the NDP had proposed back in 2010, and we agree with that simply because there is buy-in both from the employer and the employee. That is what a retirement plan, really, in a fulsome way, should look like. It shouldn’t be forced on an employee.", "In this case, what’s happening is that the employer goes out and purchases this program or product for retirement, and banks and insurance companies are going to charge an administration fee. That’s not really going to help the employee. If the employee wants an RRSP, they can actually access that on an individual basis on their own. So I don’t see how this is really going to help retirement at large for the citizens of Ontario, and I look forward to more debate. Maybe there’s more information that will help us reconsider, but on the basis of this bill, I highly doubt that this is the answer to a retirement savings plan for Ontarians." ],

I think it’s also important to understand that, obviously, this will be something that will be adding to what is already in place related to the federal plan.", "We’ve been speaking also about our Ontario Retirement Pension Plan over the last year or so, very capably led by my colleague Minister Hunter and, of course, strongly supported by the Minister of Finance. This is all part of a package that we recognize is about dealing with the reality of the fact that people are not in the circumstances that I think they want to be in, in terms of looking forward to retirement.", "If I may, in passing, with the little amount of time that I have left: I was very grateful that Minister Hunter, as part of her consultations over the winter break, was in Thunder Bay. It was interesting actually listening to all the people that came forward. I think you could accurately describe it as people from all sides of the political spectrum. Certainly social activists, who obviously lead the charge in regard to advancing social causes, and union leadership, as well as the chambers of commerce all agreed, actually, that we need to find some way to move forward to advance this issue. So this is a piece of legislation that is important, and we are certainly hopeful that all parties in the House will support it." ],

It’s funny how this government operates the rules of debate. I’ve read the standing orders, but it’s like they’ve cracked a code on how we can have as many people speak for the least amount of time, to be able to get a bill into committee. So I’d really like to have at least one of those members that spoke earlier talk about the government’s plans to move this bill through committee and ultimately come back to the House for third reading. That’s a request, through you, Speaker, to whoever is finishing the two minutes.", "I was in my riding last week, and I spoke at the Brockville Chamber of Commerce and had a great speech. I didn’t get one question about Bill 57, but I had a lot of questions about the ORPP. In fact, I ended up quoting Liam McGuinty, the son of our former Premier who, at his deputation before the committee on the ORPP, representing the Ontario Chamber of Commerce, expressed some very valid concerns within the business community. I heard loud and clear, when I was in my riding, the opposition to the government’s ORPP plan, the fact that there is so much misinformation out in the community about that. I hope that during debate today and in the days ahead, someone from the government will talk about their commitment to Bill 57, and really let businesses know exactly what their plans are." ],

It’s a little bit ridiculous because saving for retirement is very, very important. Bill 57, An Act to create a framework for pooled registered pension plans and to make consequential amendments to other Acts, is an interesting proposal put forward by Minister Sousa. We need to take planning for our future very, very seriously, but we also have to trust that Ontarians can get it right. Because, Speaker, what I don’t trust, at this stage of the game, is the Liberal government to get it right. I worry about that because so many times in this House we have seen acts come through first, second and third reading that tend to have a knee-jerk reaction to issues. I am afraid this is just a little bit of window dressing to cover up for other actions of this government that are detrimental to the future of our Ontario population. For instance, they want to talk about pooled registered pension plans, but how much money will Ontarians have to go into their pooled registered pension plans when, on the other hand, they are trying to hit the Liberal hand going into their pocket that is squeezing every last cent out where they can?", "We had an eHealth premium introduced—the largest tax in Ontario’s history—by this Liberal government. Where did that revenue go? It was to go to health care, but quietly it slipped into general revenue.", "The fact of the matter is, just yesterday, we heard of another knee-jerk reaction and an example of the Liberal government wanting to jump on the bandwagon with regard to using people’s sincere concern over climate change to introduce another opportunity to tax Ontarians. Their cap-and-trade proposition that has come forward in the announcement that we heard yesterday by the Premier and Minister Murray is nothing more than a tax. Unfortunately, there are very few pennies left in Ontario pockets these days. Here we have a government trying to reach in again and squeeze every single last cent out. It’s not right.", "It’s interesting: When a government is $300 billion in debt, I question how effectively they can manage a pooled registered pension plan. It’s an interesting concept because I just feel—like they did yesterday—with the debt load that they’re carrying and the enormous deficit, they’re just looking for every possible revenue tool available, all at the expense of Ontario taxpayers.", "I really admire my colleague and friend from York–Simcoe. She has given a lot of thought and a lot of time to this issue. She has done her homework. She has taken time to explain to us as a caucus what it means, in terms of the impacts of a pooled registered pension plan. I dare say that I’m worried that the government across the floor from me actually hasn’t taken the time to do due diligence. I think that’s a trend that we’re seeing from this government.", "Not only do we see speed debating happening on this floor; we’re seeing speed legislation. So much is knee-jerk reaction. Have they done a cost-benefit analysis of the Ontario pooled registered pension plan that they’re proposing? What is the bottom line? What would this mean for Ontario taxpayers and for people struggling to get by?", "If they were really sincere about helping Ontarians, they would be making life a little bit easier in Ontario by way of addressing the exorbitant increases in energy. They would be addressing the issues that really matter. Instead, they’re piling on more pressure after more pressure on the shoulders of people throughout this province. There’s going to be a breaking point, and I worry about that. When we reach that breaking point, Ontario will not be in a position to have a lot of pooling happening because, just like our young people are quickly leaving this province, our seniors will be leaving the province as well and following their children to Alberta." ],

It’s very important, just in carrying over from my colleague from York–Simcoe’s comments last week, that we have to review exactly what we’re talking about.", "With regard to this particular pension plan, what does it mean to be pooled? Again, there is so much confusion out there in the small business world, amongst Ontarians, amongst even legislators, with regard to where this government is going. So let’s talk about this particular act.", "What does it mean to be pooled? What does it mean to be registered? Obviously, other pension plans are registered, so that’s not quite as potentially unknown as the pooled part. But this is a legislative initiative that comes from the leadership of the federal government in being able to provide people with a savings instrument that could take them anywhere across the country. Again, I come back to the fact that there was actually a member from the Liberal government heckling the fact that I said seniors and parents are following their children to other provinces because they are tired of what is happening in Ontario. Meanwhile, this very piece of legislation that we’re debating today allows them to move their savings easier.", "Again, I come back to this: How well does the Liberal caucus actually know what’s going on in Ontario, and within their own legislation as well? Again, I question, if they don’t know what’s going on and they don’t understand how their impacts are causing Ontarians to make very big decisions in moving out of this province—" ],

The member from Lambton–Kent–Middlesex just said maybe it’s not a matter of understanding; maybe it’s a matter that they just don’t care what their direction over the last 10 years has given Ontarians, which is no choice but to “get out of Dodge,” meaning get out of Ontario.", "But let’s go back to this particular act. This particular act enables people, if they are tired of what’s happening under this Liberal government, to get out of Ontario and take their savings with them. So the umbrella legislation has been passed federally about two years ago, and because of that, other various provinces have picked up the opportunity that it represents and provided their constituents with companion legislation that would then allow the notion of the pool.", "In 2013, the member from York–Simcoe introduced her own private member’s bill, which the government picked up in its 2013 spring budget. Of course, I sat here with the member from York–Simcoe, and I can say, on behalf of the entire PC caucus, that we were naturally very happy that they picked it up. Because of the general confusion around pensions and pension plans—and people from all walks of life have commented on the problem of financial literacy—in terms of this particular concept, we have to utilize an opportunity around pooled pensions to grow financial literacy as well. That begs the point: Just like we need agricultural and agri-food literacy in our classrooms, we’d be remiss if we didn’t take time to say how important our financial literacy is as well. I would encourage this Liberal government to take a look at how they’re encouraging our education system to prepare our students in that regard.", "Coming back to saving for the future, the pooled registered pension plan is a tool, as I said, that the federal government has provided. Finally, in Ontario, we are now making an opportunity available to residents of Ontario to become part of that pension plan that is pooled. One of the things we know about pension plans is that they need lots of members. If a pooled pension plan is going to work, they need lots of members. If you’re going to be able to act in the best interests of pensioners, then you have to have enough money to be able to go out and make good investments.", "But again, can we trust this government to get it right? Time and time again, they’ve squandered dollars on scandals and mismanagement. I worry about it, but we have to hold out hope, because in terms of making good investments, it’s much easier, obviously, when you have a large number of participants. That’s the notion, actually, behind the pool: that it goes into exactly a pool, and from there, decisions are made that provide interest on the money that’s being collected and therefore the availability to go out and make investments on behalf of the pensioners.", "We need a good return, for goodness’ sake. I can tell you that seniors on fixed incomes do indeed need a good return in terms of their pensions, because their line of living, if you will, has been planned for some time. I worry because this Liberal government, every which angle you look at it, is causing life to become more and more expensive as every day goes by. Just yesterday we heard about a cap-and-trade initiative that’s going to drive the cost of everything through the roof, from groceries to heating your homes to the gas you put in your car. While seniors have tried to plan and they have a ceiling in terms of what their monthly expenses should be in terms of maintaining a certain quality of life—guess what?—the Liberal government, based on their announcement yesterday, is busting right through that ceiling, and they’re really causing a lot of stress, not only on seniors trying to stretch their dollars as best they can but on all Ontarians. It is such a worry.", "Going back to savings: Another thing that we hear often, particularly about RRSPs and the space left in them, is that people don’t put the full amount in. That tells me that they don’t have a lot of money left over because, as I said, the Liberals are making the cost of living in this province skyrocket because they’re so desperate to generate new revenue tools to cover their backsides.", "When you take everything into account and when you look at a pooled investment system, individuals have their accounts in a pooled plan for investment purposes, and that means that you have low costs and better investment. Hopefully that allows seniors and people planning for their retirement to have a little bit of wiggle room. There’s general interest in the pooled retirement registered pension plans, and we should look at some of the interest that others have taken in this.", "The first one that I’d like to use is the Portfolio Management Association of Canada. They have written to the government in support of this particular initiative, and they’ve also written to the government opposing the Ontario registered pension plan. That goes back to my point earlier. We have two different initiatives that are conflicting, and even the marketplace is recognizing that this Ontario Liberal government can’t get it right.", "We have to understand and take what the Portfolio Management Association of Canada is saying to heart because there is probably no other group that understands the value of registered pension plans and the dangers of a specific, dedicated Ontario pension plan.", "There is an excerpt from a letter to Minister Hunter from this association:", "“We are pleased that Ontario has recognized the advantages of a PRPP program and has moved forward with PRPP legislation. PRPPs provide the opportunity to participate in a simple and straightforward pension plan.”", "With that, I will conclude my comments in support." ],

It is a glorified RRSP. It is part of the pooled investment system, granted, and it certainly has its place in that, but it isn’t a pension per se.", "As the member said, we’re asking: What does it mean to be pooled? What does it mean to be registered? But I’d like to talk about what it actually means to be a pension. To my way of thinking, a pension has contributions both from the employee and the employer, and these PRPPs don’t oblige the employer to put in.", "Interestingly, we’d heard the member talk about how pooled plans need more members in the plan, and these PRPPS, if an employer chooses—and the choice is at the employer level—to have these plans for their employees, the employees don’t have a choice whether or not to buy in. The choice is made for them. So certainly there will be more people in the plan but not more money, because, again, without that employer contribution, how large can this grow? Not nearly as large as it could have if both were contributing, as it would be with a pension.", "Another thing is, the member said that we’re getting to a breaking point. While I agree that, as she said, the Liberals are causing the cost of living to skyrocket, we are already at a breaking point.

Yes, it’s a little bit better than an RRSP, because in an RRSP you are the individual who has to make the decision where the money is invested and you determine your own return on investment. But in a pooled plan, you pool the money from everybody and you would have an administrator who will give you some advice that will help you to do better, and that’s the whole intent of it.", "The reason the government is proceeding this way is the federal government allowed this to employers in the federal sector back in 2012. Ontario sees an opportunity here to provide it for employers in Ontario, and we’re following along with other provinces.", "But, Mr. Speaker, I want to correct one comment made by the member from Oshawa. In the plan, where an employer elects to offer a PRPP, enrolment of employees would be automatic, subject to the ability to opt out within 60 days. So employees do have the option. If they don’t like the plan their employer is offering them, they can opt out after the automatic sign-in. That’s a little correction; I think the member from Oshawa is slightly off course.", "But I would say to you there is no benefit in what the government is bringing here directly to the government, as was mentioned by the speaker.

So that’s $1,600 out of the economy for every employee in Ontario making $45,000 per year.", "I had the privilege of talking to Professor Lee from Ottawa at finance committee, who said that with the ORPP, anyone 40 years or older in Ontario is not going to receive the full benefit of the ORPP.

Pension plans are one such issue. Whether you are drawing from a pension plan, contributing to a plan or longing for a plan to be offered by your employer, Ontarians are thinking about their pensions and retirement.", "I think it’s important to discuss the right pension framework for Ontario. The bill before us today, Bill 57, An Act to create a framework for pooled registered pension plans and to make consequential amendments to other Acts, is the wrong plan.", "In Ontario, we are facing a retirement security crisis. As my honourable colleague and NDP pension critic, the member from Oshawa, stated, two thirds of Ontarians do not have a workplace pension plan and personal savings are not enough to fill the gap. Pooled retirement pension plans are not sufficient to make up for this and fix the retirement security crisis in this province.", "I think outlining some of the reasons why there is a retirement security crisis in Ontario will help us understand which pension legislation we need to be moving forward. From there, I hope to outline why the legislative regime outlined in Bill 57 is insufficient in dealing with this.", "To expand on this point, the cost of living in this province is skyrocketing. The cost to make ends meet in Ontario, to raise your children, and to put gas in the family Chrysler Town and Country minivan are all on the rise. Looking simply at increases in hydro rates in this province will help us understand these rising costs and the impact this has on Ontario families.", "According to the Ontario Energy Board, rates have gone from 4.3 cents per kilowatt hour in 2002, to 14 cents per kilowatt hour today. I should point out that this tripling of rates happened over successive periods of Liberal and Conservative governments, both of which were involved in the process of the privatization of our hydro system.", "Windsor West is not immune to these increases. One constituent wrote to me in January, in the dead of winter—and believe it or not, we do get winter in the deep south of Ontario—and declared that the rates he was paying were unaffordable. To quote this person directly, the email stated, “These increases [are] absurd. Middle class [Ontarians] can’t afford this. These rates need to lower as soon as possible.”", "“As soon as possible,” says my constituent, yet this government only offers more privatization in this area.", "The other point I want to expand on is that two thirds of Ontarians do not have a workplace pension plan. Explaining this requires some nuance. In Windsor and the rest of southwestern Ontario, a major issue we are grappling with is the loss of our manufacturing footprint in the rest of North America.", "In Windsor specifically, we can see this in the automotive sector. These manufacturing jobs usually come with workplace pension plans. Ideally, these would be defined benefit plans. Simply put, in these plans the beneficiaries can expect a certain level of income in their retirement because it is based on their salaries and years of service. Their retirement benefit is defined.", "Unfortunately, labour trends in Ontario are shifting. Statistics Canada reported last week that manufacturing, as a total share of employment in Canada, fell to just over 9% in March. We saw this story published in reports all over the weekend. It speaks to the importance of these industries to Canadians. These industries are vital to the economy of southwestern Ontario.", "Statistics Canada also released the latest job numbers last week. Again, Windsor’s jobless rate was among the highest in the country at 11.1% unemployment. This is a staggering increase from the already high February figure of 9.6%.", "The Windsor Star reported that, a large part of this drastic increase was because of the 4,500 Windsor Assembly Plant employees currently laid off. Now, these layoffs are only temporary while Fiat Chrysler retools their plant, but these figures underscore how important the automotive industry is to Windsor.", "I’m glad that investments are being made in our assembly plant, and I know this will help sustain other industries in my community, like the very successful tooling industry. What I want, and what people across southwestern Ontario want, is to see jobs in automotive and parts manufacturing available to the next generation of workers. We want our children to have the same options we did and benefit from the excellent quality of life that working in an auto plant or a tooling shop offers.", "Ontario needs to not only keep its current automotive plants in operation, but needs to attract investment and expand its automotive footprint throughout North America. To do this, my New Democrat colleagues and I have continually called for a comprehensive automotive strategy. This can include incentives for investment, research and development, and coordinating intergovernmental involvement in the automotive industry. We need this government to work with industry and those employed in the sector, to bring automotive investment to southwestern Ontario.", "Strategizing around industries that have a history of providing workplace pensions to hard-working Ontarians is one way to help bring about a level retirement security in this province, but of course it’s not the only way. We need a strong public sector pension plan.", "With the decline in manufacturing jobs, we are seeing more working Canadians employed in service sector jobs than ever before. Statistics Canada reports that in March, the share of Canadians working in service industries climbed above 78%.", "Many of my constituents are employed in the service sector and perform jobs in areas like retail and food service. These people work hard, but are often not compensated nearly as well as those employed in manufacturing. A disappointing characteristic of many service jobs is that they do not come with an employee pension plan. We need real action to help Ontarians plan for their retirement and retire comfortably.", "The Canada Pension Plan has been praised several times on both sides of this chamber and is the Canadian benchmark for a strong retirement framework. This plan is universal, portable and directly benefits retirees. It also offers extremely low investment fees.", "I think many Canadians were disappointed, although perhaps not surprised, but disappointed nevertheless, when the federal government decided, in 2013, not to enhance the Canada Pension Plan.", "Instead, the Conservative government opted for a pooled retirement pension plan model. A pooled retirement pension plan is essentially an expensive pooled savings mechanism that is structured a bit like a Registered Retirement Savings Plan. One of the main problems with these private sector plans is that they charge outrageous management fees, compared to plans like CPP. For example, Canadians pay 2% or more for administration of their RRSPs, whereas the large public pensions, such as CPP, pay well less than 1% for fund administration. Fees erode returns for Ontarians and everyone across Canada. The most beneficial plans will have the lowest fees. It’s unlikely to find low fees in a pension plan that’s geared towards profiting the administrator rather than solely benefiting its contributors.", "The bill before us today attempts to establish and provide for the administration of PRPPs in Ontario. It draws from and largely adopts 2012 federal legislation. If passed, the bill would extend the regulatory authority over PRPPs to the Ontario Superintendent of Financial Services and set out the process for a PRPP administrator to rule on the decisions of the superintendent.", "The bill would also include PRPPs in the definition of a pension plan and add PRPPs to the list of vehicles to which a plan can permit a former member or eligible spouse to transfer plan assets.", "This bill, the Pooled Registered Pension Plans Act, is flawed by design.", "PRPPs do not require employers to contribute to an employee’s plan. Generally, this means there is less in the pool, and we can conceive that this would likely lead to reduced returns. These returns, as I’ve stated before, are subjected to much higher fees than we see in more traditional public plans, like the CPP.", "A few points to add here: PRPPs are market-based and cannot offer the predictability that many Ontarians entering retirement require, so that they can plan ahead of time for their retirement. Moreover, employers can offer their employees enrolment into a PRPP but do not have to contribute anything themselves. This is a direct contrast to the employer/employee contribution model we see in the CPP and, most recently, in the Ontario pension plan.", "Bill 57 sets up the structure to allow for PRPPs. This Liberal government touted the creation of the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan as the progressive way forward, only to slot the creation of pooled retirement plans next on the order paper. This government is playing a shell game with our retirement.", "I spoke on Bill 56 and asked for details. Instead, I get the government focusing on a pooled retirement regime when they should be focused on setting up the ORPP. We’re concerned that, rather than allowing for the ORPP to take effect and then looking into some supplemental saving options, if they have such a desire to do so, this government has decided to simultaneously introduce the framework for profit-making pooled plans. Yes, on the same day that the Liberals tabled a bill setting out a framework for an Ontario pension plan that includes both employee and employer contributions, they also tabled a bill allowing the sale of pooled, for-profit plans.", "Will PRPPs be considered comparable to the ORPP, thus making those enrolled in PRPPs exempt from contributing to the ORPP? This is the question our NDP pension critic has tried to have answered several times, but this government will not provide a clear and comprehensive answer. This question is an important one, and I hope in the coming weeks, the government provides us with a definitive answer.", "The clear winners in PRPPs are the large banks and insurance industries. PRPPs are a financial product, not a pension plan. As a product, those administering PRPPs receive a share in their performance. As I stated before, the administrator of the plan erodes the return for the beneficiary through excessive fees. Also, as I’ve said before, employers are not obligated to contribute to their employees’ PRPPs. Despite Bill 57 trying to expand the definition of a pension to include PRPPs, these pooled plans are financial products, not pensions.", "I want to clarify with my remarks here. I do not wish to be seen as arguing that financial products do not have a role to play in our retirement savings. Certainly, many families across Ontario contribute to a Registered Retirement Savings Plan or a tax-free savings account or employ other mechanisms to help save for their retirement. What I’m saying is that the financial products must be viewed as additional saving tools and not foundational mechanisms for retirement planning. Purchasing these products can be a way to augment your pension plan, but they cannot become your pension plan.", "I’m aware of my time, Speaker, and I’m glad I had a chance to voice my opposition to this bill. At a time when we need to unpack the crucial details of the Ontario pension plan and have a discussion on how to foster growth in industries that provide good jobs to Ontarians, complete with competitive pension plans, this government is appeasing its friends in the financial sector.", "Describe a PRPP as you will, it is not a pension plan. A pension provides security in retirement and sees both employer and employee make contributions. A pension is the vehicle of your retirement: a way for you to travel, pay for your hobbies and spoil your grandchildren. A pension is foundational for hard-working, middle-class Ontarians. A PRPP is not a pension at all.", "With the little amount of time I have left, I’d just like to go back over some of the points that I made. I spoke at some length about the automotive sector and the importance of the automotive sector—the manufacturing sector, frankly—to Windsor and Essex county, but it’s important across the province as well. I think an important thing to address is the pension security of people who work in all sectors who have a pension plan offered through their workplace. They put in many, many years in order to reap the benefits of that pension. We’re seeing more and more across the province that those pensions are not secure. We have companies that declare bankruptcy or they close up shop and move on across the border to the States or to Mexico, and they leave the employees who dedicated 20 or 30 years of their life to the company without retirement security, without a pension.", "I think that when we’re looking at pension plans for the broader public, we need to make sure that they’re secure plans. When we’re looking at the PRPPs, I think the key here is the excessive fees that will be charged to those who contribute to them. Therefore, their return may not be exactly what they need in order to be able to live comfortably in retirement.", "We see the cost of living going up, as my constituent—and this is not the only constituent who has written my office or phoned my office to speak to me about the cost of hydro. People across the province are having a very difficult time paying their hydro bill. They’re deciding between whether they’re going to eat or whether they’re going to keep the lights on. I think that we need to make sure that when people do have the opportunity to put money away into retirement, into a pension plan, that pension plan needs to be fairly secure; they’re not looking at losing a good portion of what they’ve struggled to put into it; they’re not losing that to these excessive fees; we’re not having people on Bay Street or those in the insurance industry getting rich off of them and them having a secure retirement at the expense of those who struggle to pay into these.", "I had also talked about being able to enjoy family time in retirement. I think that’s something else we need to be sure of. Again, a lot of these people who would be contributing are in lower-income, minimum wage jobs. This has to be something where they know their money is secure when they do manage to put it in and that in the future—should they have grandchildren, should they want to retire and travel with their loved ones and their family members—that money is secure and it’s there for them to be able to do that.", "We need to make sure that people have the opportunity to opt out. I know a member from the government side had mentioned there is the opportunity to opt out, but I think we see—when you see the commercials on TV, “Phone now and order this,” people think it’s a great idea. They call in, they order it and they don’t necessarily see the fine print that says, “You are now going to be on an auto-ship program,” where they’re going to ship out every month and they’re going to bill you every month.", "We need to be very careful with a plan such as this, although I think it was mentioned that there are 60 days and then they have an opt-out period. There are 60 days when they don’t have the opportunity to opt out. I’m curious to know if for the 60 days they paid into it, they are able to get that money back, should they decide to opt out.", "I also think that people lead very busy lives and they—", "Interjection." ],

They’re at work, they’ve got family to take care of, they’re worried about paying their bills, whether they can afford to keep the lights on, and sometimes deadlines pass—they miss the deadline to cancel whatever it was they ordered. I’m afraid this plan is setting them up for that same type of situation, where we could see five or six months or a year pass and they’re paying into something that they don’t necessarily want to be paying into. We need to make sure that it’s clear to people where their money is going. We need to make sure that everybody understands what this PRPP is and what their rights and obligations are. We need to make sure that they know they have the opportunity to opt out.", "But ultimately, we would rather not see this bill pass. We think there are definitely better options available than a PRPP. I certainly wouldn’t want to work my whole life and put into a plan, only to find out when I retire that there’s less in the plan than what I had been paying into it all those years. We need to make sure that whatever avenue people use to invest their money to save for retirement, that money is secure at the end.", "I understand that even with RRSPs there is some uncertainty as to whether or not you are going to gain some on your investment or whether you’re going to lose a little bit on your investment. There’s always some uncertainty there, but I think that an item such as the PRPP sets people up for even a greater loss in their investment. That’s something we certainly cannot afford in this province, as I mentioned, with the cost of living going up. We look at the hydro rates and grocery rates; gas rates have gone up. We certainly want to make sure that when someone is in their senior years, when they have worked their entire life and they’re looking to retire, they have the income and the stability to be able to live not only in comfort, but to be able to enjoy what they have worked their whole life to do.", "I think I’m just about out of time, Speaker, so I’ll wrap it up for now.

This has been reintroduced—it’s been around the bend once. The government is taking action to address the serious threat of invasive species to Ontario’s economy and to our natural environment. In February, our government first introduced the proposed Invasive Species Act and reintroduced this proposed legislation on November 5, 2014. If the proposed legislation is passed, Ontario will become the first jurisdiction in Canada with stand-alone invasive species legislation.", "Let’s look at some of the threats if we don’t do this. Invasive species impact the life of every Ontarian, as I’ve said in the past, and the cost to the Ontario economy is tens of millions of dollars each year. There are jobs at risk in the forestry industry, in the commercial and recreational fishing industries, not to mention tourism.", "Let’s look at some of the impacts of some of the invasive species that already exist in Ontario.

It’s estimated that zebra mussels are costing the province some $75 million to $90 million each and every year to manage—and make sure that these pipes stay free.", "The other invasive species that we know is here already is the ruffe. This species can seriously damage native sport fish populations such as yellow perch—I know my seatmate is an avid fisherman—by directly competing for food and habitat or through heavy predation of native sport fish eggs. Ruffe can very quickly become the most dominant fish in our local areas because of their rapid reproduction and growth rates. This puts pressure on native species and contributes to their decline.", "Those are just a couple of species that we have here already interfering with our ecological system.", "Let’s talk a little bit about species that are not here yet but which we’re certainly worried are going to be here.", "The mountain pine beetle is in western Canada." ],

The Asian carp, which is currently in many US waterways, must be stopped before entering the Great Lakes and our waterways. If the Asian carp becomes established in Ontario, they could potentially eat the food supply that our native fish depend on and crowd them out of their habitats.", "Bill 36 addresses the serious concern that invasive species pose to Ontario’s nature and economy.

Invasive species affect our economy, our wildlife and our ecosystems.", "I am proud that Ontario is creating a specific invasive species tool to combat this serious problem.

I am glad to be speaking to the Invasive Species Act today. We are talking about a very pressing concern for our natural sustainability today, one that has implications beyond rural and forested areas. The threat of invasive species is broad-sweeping, and the prevention of the spread of invasive species is of paramount importance. Once they’re here, they’re very difficult to be rid of, and it is very difficult to reverse their influence.", "Expanding the minister’s power to battle invasive species is something I think we should all support and encourage. Our forests and waterways are vital to our success as a province and as a country in more ways than as countable resources. They’re important for communities and characterize the most beautiful and prosperous parts of our great province.", "Coming from Clarington, and also representing the municipalities of Scugog and Uxbridge, I know very well the influence of beautiful and accessible forests, parks and natural spaces on those who are lucky enough to live in communities that house them. But invasive species threaten this balance. They threaten to invade our pine trees, eradicate our maples, sap our waterways of their diversity and out-compete our native plant life. In the grand sense of things, they threaten our way of life and the balance that maintains our environment.", "There are currently a plethora of provincial and federal acts that create a patchwork of legislation that tries to combat the spread of invasive species. In their conflicting implementation, they create holes where they may fail to achieve our preventive and proactive goals. None of this existing legislation has the specificity that is needed to effectively ensure that Ontario’s native species are protected from damaging competition and to keep the problem from spreading. What we need is a framework to ensure that we respond quickly and efficiently to new threats, that we’re better able to detect when a threat may be impending, and that can enable us to quickly come up with a plan to eradicate any species that threaten our native flora and fauna.", "This legislation will ensure that we as a government have those abilities. We would be able to respond more quickly, to make decisions earlier and to ensure that invasive species do not have the opportunity to establish themselves in Ontario. For those who may wish to trade in dangerous species, we would have the ability to impose sanctions and prohibitions, and we would have the ability to promote compliance through inspection and enforcement. These abilities are supported by many groups and sustainability advocates, including the anglers and hunters, the Invasive Species Centre and Ducks Unlimited Canada—a ringing endorsement of necessary legislation.", "Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to encourage the passage of this bill today, and to speak on behalf of the residents of Durham when I say that the protection of our natural resources is incredibly important, from the Ganaraska Forest to Darlington Provincial Park, to the shores of Lake Scugog, the Glen Major Forest and beyond.", "Mr. Speaker, sometimes on my way up to Peterborough I see signs talking about the emerald ash borer, which is in the riding of my colleague from Peterborough. The emerald ash borer was first found in Canada in Windsor, Ontario, in 2002. Since then, the beetle has spread across much of southwestern Ontario, Sault Ste. Marie and the Ottawa area. Once infested, the mortality of ash trees is nearly 100%.", "Ontario municipalities have spent over $71 million managing the beetle, and over the next 10 years plan to spend an additional $240 million. The beetle is a significant threat to our forestry. That’s just one single instance of what these insects can do to our forestry, to our communities and to the beauty of Ontario and the beauty of this country. Thank you, Mr. Speaker." ],

  "text" : [ "Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and good afternoon. I’m pleased to bring some remarks in reaction to the speed debating that we saw on the other side of the House. We had four members who used up 18 minutes to talk about a very important bill; that’s Bill 37, the Invasive Species Act.", "This is important to all corners of the province of Ontario. I come from Prince Edward–Hastings, and we have the beautiful Bay of Quinte, one of the great fishing destinations in Ontario, world-famous for its walleye fishing. I know they’ve had a serious problem for the last 20 years in the Bay of Quinte with an invasive species called the zebra mussel.", "The member from Northumberland–Quinte West was the first amongst the Liberal members here this afternoon to speak on the bill, and he did acknowledge the fact that the zebra mussel probably came in through the St. Lawrence Seaway back in the mid-1980s, at the bottom of a freighter on its way into Lake Ontario. It’s been there ever since, and it’s been causing a lot of problems. It’s an invasive species that clogs water pipes that come to and from our water treatment plants and our power plants, and it creates a problem there. It damages our harbours, it damages the boats that dock at our marinas and it does serious damage to a world-class fishery. It changes the environment. That’s just one example, at the south end of my riding.", "At the north end of my riding—I believe it was perhaps the member from Durham, who just spoke, who mentioned the fact about the beetles and the damage that they’re doing to our forestry sector. There are all kinds of examples of these invasive species.", "This bill takes some steps that are much-needed to guard against invasive species, but this bill doesn’t take a preventive approach. That’s one of the areas that we can improve on when we get this bill to committee, but for starters, Bill 37 is a step in the right direction. The Invasive Species Act will get support from the members of the Progressive Conservative caucus." ],

  "text" : [ "It’s indeed a pleasure to stand in place today and to make reference to the various members of the Liberal caucus who’ve spoken on the need for this bill. I agree. I remember, back in the 1970s or before, when we talked about the sea lamprey getting into the Great Lakes, that eel, that sucker that was destroying so many good fish. That was followed by the spiny water flea, the goby, the round goby, zebra mussels, purple loosestrife, and the emerald ash borer. You can’t tell me much about the emerald ash borer; I was on city council when we spent millions of dollars trying to eradicate it in our area and trying to replace so many ash trees that we lost. Phragmites and now the threat of Asian carp getting into the Great Lakes—major problems.", "Currently we have a patchwork of about 20 federal and provincial bills dealing with invasive species. This bill, at least, will consolidate the Ontario bills, the provincial bills, into one and under one ministry; that is long overdue.", "I guess the thing that troubles me about the bill is that, in order for it to be effective, you will need to hire more inspectors. You will need to send people out to monitor the situation and to do research. Instead, the ministry is one of the many under this government that is being cut 6% a year for the next three years. So how are we ever going to monitor, police and enforce this new bill without the people to do it? You can’t bring in something like this and expect the current staff to do it, because there’s so much work that needs to be done, so many more areas and jobs and jurisdictions that need to be monitored and researched. There’s just no money on the table for it.", "So I support the bill, and wish them luck in making it happen." ],

It’s a pleasure for me to rise today in the House and speak to Bill 37, the Invasive Species Act.", "A number of my colleagues on this side of the House and some colleagues on the other side have talked about some of the invasive species that are currently here in Ontario, including the zebra mussels and the emerald ash borer, which I may talk about later if I have a bit of time. But we’ve also talked about the ones that are not yet in Ontario; that is of great, great concern to myself, Mr. Speaker.", "There has been some discussion of federal and provincial acts that govern invasive species, but they’re not really designed for that. I’ll just outline a couple of them. The Canada Shipping Act is federal, and it manages the discharge of ballast water. The Plant Diseases Act is a provincial act that bans the transport and sale of diseased plants, which could include an invasive insect or pathogen. The Public Lands Act is provincial, and it allows landowners to remove some invasive plants from their shorelines. But what’s important is that this proposed legislation is going to help address some of those legislative gaps that currently exist, as none of these laws actually deal specifically and directly with invasive species.", "Some of the key elements of the act, that the Honourable Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry has put forward, would help the government by providing the powers to intervene earlier so invasive species do not become established here in Ontario. It would also give the government the tools to prohibit activities such as possessing and transporting certain invasive species, but it would also enable rapid response actions to address urgent threats.", "The member from Windsor–Tecumseh spoke about his involvement in 2002 with regard to the emerald ash borer. I can tell you, it has moved completely across the province into Glengarry–Prescott–Russell. As a matter of fact, we heat with wood in the winter now, and I was fortunate enough to have good ash trees, but unfortunately invasive species had killed them." ],

At the end of the day, after they clear-cut your forest on your own property—without discussing it with the landowner, because this bill says you don’t have to—they can just pass the bill on to the landowner and say, “Now you have to pay for it.” I think that’s a little risky. My say is that we’re moving from the Legislature into a bureaucracy which now is given the ability to enter anybody’s property, do what they want to that property and then make you pay for it. I think that’s dangerous ground, and I’d love to have someone from the government discuss that, but obviously they’re not interested in having a debate; they are interested in rushing this bill through. I’d rather we do it slowly, do it right, and maybe talk about an amendment to fix this problem, because I don’t know about you, but my constituents aren’t happy with that part of the bill.", "There are other parts of the bill, which I did talk about in my hour debate, that are concerns of mine. I have yet to hear them talk about maybe making this bill a little more preventative. This bill is reactive; we wait until the invasive species are in our province and then we deal with them. Why not deal with them before they get here? Why don’t we prevent them from entering our province?", "They don’t want to have this discussion. They would rather rush through their speakers and rush through the bill, and they are going to mess things up." ],

First, I’m sure most of you know that the member from Prince Edward–Hastings is my neighbour to the east. We cross jurisdictions in a lot of places. One of the things that people ask me when I’m in that middle ground is, “Do you folks agree on things at Queen’s Park?”, because obviously, if they watch the House, we seldom agree on anything. Today, I must say that we do agree on something, so it gives me something I’ll bring back to the residents.", "As far as the member from Elgin–Middlesex–London’s comment about how we need to speak longer on this, the opportunity is here. This is not a closure motion; it’s to debate. So I hope everybody gets to do that, to add to the debate. I’m glad to hear that generally we all support this, so I think we can make it happen.", "Speaker, in the last less than a minute, I didn’t mention during my speaking points that when it comes to looking after costs for these things—in my riding of Northumberland–Quinte West, in a portion of the Trent River, we had what we called a water soldier, which is an invasive species of plant that just destroys some of the habitat, some of the boating opportunities. I can thank the Ministry of Natural Resources. It had been growing for about two years and it was really, really spreading. Just last summer, through no cost to the local residents, the Ministry of Natural Resources looked after this. Biologists found that with proper treatment—I’m not sure if we eradicated it all, but 99% is gone. So I think when issues arise, we’re there as a government to try to deal with it.", "Again, thank you for the support from all sides of the House." ],

  "text" : [ "I appreciate the chance to address Bill 37, the Invasive Species Act. When this legislation is passed, as we know, Ontario would end up being the first and only province to have stand-alone legislation with respect to invasive species. This would be an admirable accomplishment, given the tremendous problems we’ve been hearing about during debate here in the Legislature, whether it’s phragmites or Asian carp or the emerald ash borer—it’s in our bush now. I won’t be able to cut up those trees fast enough as they die.", "But we don’t want this to be merely warm, fuzzy, feel-good legislation that really doesn’t accomplish anything, given the task at hand. Speaking with our critic, it’s very important that this goes to committee, where we can hear from outdoors men and women, farmers, people who work in the field who have studied this very, very complex issue and the variety of animal and plant species that are involved and lumped under the title “invasive species.”", "It’s got to have some teeth. It’s got to be designed to truly tackle some of the problems but not take an easy way out. There is concern among landowners that they would be targeted and held responsible if they end up unwittingly harbouring some of these species, as Jeff Yurek, our MNR critic, advocates.", "Prevention is also so important in having a comprehensive approach to what is a set of very serious problems across the province.", "I am guilty. I’m one of those landowners who harbours invasive species, not necessarily because I want to. Some have arrived—some have arrived courtesy of my wife, actually; she picked up stuff at a landscaper’s a number of years ago. She threw about a dozen goldfish in our pond; now we’ve got about 600 goldfish in there. However, that provides habitat for bittern and great blue herons. We’ve got a snapping turtle down there. Let me think now, there are a few other species that just love goldfish—kingfishers, for example. When you see a kingfisher with a goldfish, it looks like he’s got a gigantic orange bill. That’s the goldfish going down into the gullet.", "I’ll just relate my personal battle over a number of years with phragmites. This is the Norfolk reed, the pampas grass. It’s very high grass that replaces cattails, for example. We see them in the ditches. They first arrived down south of Windsor a number of years ago and spread their way on up through. If you drive down Highway 402 down to Sarnia, for example—courtesy of our Ministry of Transportation, we now have phragmites stretching across the province of Ontario. I don’t know whether Bob Bailey had anything to do with that but it’s something. We all work on some approaches to that. This is an invasive species that’s spread along government land.", "They’re hard to kill. They spread through the seeds; they spread through the roots. You can dig out your pond and dump it somewhere in a ravine, and then you’ve got phragmites down through your ravine. I certainly know that on my farm.", "When these non-native plants are introduced and established, it obviously disrupts the established ecosystem. It forces out the native species, and whenever you have a decrease in the native species, you have less diversity, less biodiversity. This, in turn, means less food and shelter for wildlife that have been dependent on those native plants, certainly since the last ice age, in this part of the world. It’s a ripple effect, and it cascades through the whole ecosystem.", "The challenge when they arrive is that there aren’t any native species that can serve as predation or control. In the ecosystem they left, over thousands of years, there would have been natural controls: insects, animals, diseases, fungus—things like that that act as a control.", "In my battle with phragmites in my pond, early on, I would cut them down in the winter. I would cut them down in the summer. Sometimes I would shave them off on the ice in the winter, and then I fell through one day, and there goes my BlackBerry. If you ever break through the ice in the winter, forget about your BlackBerry. I had my BlackBerry with me just in case I did fall through, so I could use my phone, but that was the first thing to go." ],

Goats love phragmites. Maybe we’ll put thousands and thousands of goats along Highway 402. Start at Bob Bailey’s house and work our way up to London and have a controlled experiment, opportunities for roadkill. There are all kinds of things that could happen there.", "Regulation is so important. We hoped some more good ideas, again, would come out through committee, but I do see the emphasis here is going to put the weight on the shoulders of landowners. Where are the tools? Where are the techniques for landowners to better deal with these kinds of issues?", "So the roads alone, I think, are one place to start with phragmites.", "As I’ve mentioned, MPPs Bob Bailey, Jeff Yurek—Monte McNaughton has done some work on this and put forward an idea. We’ve just taken the common milkweed off the noxious weeds act—that’s noxious; not obnoxious, by the way—so there’s a vacancy. Let’s characterize phragmites as a noxious weed.", "I’ll go back a few years ago to what I consider some success dealing with purple loosestrife. There doesn’t seem to be so much of a worry now with that particular invasive plant; it was tackled at the time. There was collaboration with OFAH, the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters, and the ministry, MNR. Crews descended on the worst concentration. Volunteers were involved. They were manually pulling them out of the ground. I obviously don’t see similar initiatives with phragmites. Forget about trying to pull them out of the ground; you almost need a backhoe to get those roots out. I know that from personal experience.", "Warrantless entry: I have concerns with respect to the provisions contained in this act allowing entry on land without a warrant. Obviously, I’m all for controlling these species, but I have never favoured warrantless entry in any of the pieces of environmental legislation that this government has brought forward over the last dozen years.", "I can see a case to be made, and I’ve talked to OFAH about this, with respect to the Asian carp. You are dealing with some pretty tough cookies who bring these carp in for food. Many of them get arrested, and they pay very large fines.", "So maybe we need some heavy-duty measures, but I don’t want us to go overboard on the enforcement end of it; hence, the importance of prevention, promotion and education to mobilize those who know a little bit about the outdoors, to deal with so many of these plants and animals.", "Again, with the trucking companies that bring in the Asian carp, my recommendation—I think the federal government has picked up on this—has always been to eviscerate the fish before they cross the border; to gut them, cut their heads off. The same applies in the United States or between states, and I have recommended that south of the border as well.", "Again, I think if, say, the owner of a wetland—say it’s five acres, much bigger than my pond—to what extent would they be responsible for spending thousands of dollars to remove phragmites? It’s something that has to be discussed. There’s obviously not a one-size-fits-all approach to this.", "The Long Point wetlands down my way are a very significant flyway for migrating waterfowl. My sister and brother-in-law have managed a duck hunting company down there for many years. My father worked for that company. I recall, going back to the 1960s, just thousands and thousands of acres of very healthy duck habitat, cattail habitat. Much of that now is being taken over by phragmites. A lot more research is needed, certainly, in that area because, you know, what are we left with? A monoculture in many cases, because this particular plant is so aggressive.", "There’s a lady in my riding, Janice Gilbert. She’s an independent researcher, part of a phragmites working group. They advocate adding that species to the noxious weed list, as we have seen other weeds added over the years. I think MPP Yurek is doing some work on that, and MPP Monte McNaughton, who is here, pushed for adding phragmites to that list. It still hasn’t happened.", "The OFAH supports that group. The group has six priorities for the phragmites:", "(1) A concerted effort to control along roads and agricultural drainage ditches, the municipal drains in Ontario.", "(2) Proper herbicides available for over water; I have discussed that.", "(3) Have the provincial government initiate and support an effective public education campaign which includes adding phragmites australis to the noxious weed list.", "(4) We need sufficient dedicated funds committed from both the federal and provincial governments. We need a 10-year planning window; we have to fund 10 years of work.", "(5) A locally driven effort calling on support from all three levels of government.", "(6) And, overarching, we need a plan. We need a management plan for phragmites, something that would do as well for so many other species.", "The periwinkle have survived the winter very well. They did a little better than the ivy on my black locust. All these species are invasive. I see all of these when I open the front door of my house. As I’ve made mention before, there’s a beautiful, gigantic maple in front of Queen’s Park when you walk out the front door. It’s a Norway maple. Nothing grows underneath it other than a bit of grass. It’s an invasive species, and there’s one probably just a hundred feet from the front door here." ],

Estimates are that invasive alien species have a $7.5-billion impact on our forest industry and on agriculture. The impact on ecosystems, as we’ve been discussing, is often not only severe but irreversible, and could be responsible for as much as 24% of the decline of species at risk across Canada.", "I wanted to talk about so many of the plants. Plants can be boring for some people, but they don’t get the attention that they should—obviously a very important part of so many species’ food chains. I did mention Asian carp. It’s become a bit of a media star over the last few years: the Asians, the silvers, that jump out of streams when there’s vibration or noise, say, from an outdoor motor. Again, if those things ever got into the Great Lakes, that would be devastating. I’m not necessarily worried about killer whales getting into Lake Erie. I don’t think that’s going to be an issue. We spend so much time talking about killer whales, but of course—the Mississippi River and the Missouri system. What kind of impact would that have on Ontario’s $7-billion sport fishing industry, let alone our commercial fishing—that’s a $234-million industry—our tourism industry, our restaurant industry? At so many of the great restaurants along Lake Erie, for example, you can get some fantastic perch dinners; certainly, if you go into towns like Port Dover and Port Stanley—and the Lancaster perch down in eastern Ontario.", "Again, I talked about gutting Asian carp as they come in. The federal government has taken the initiative on this. I thought maybe in Ontario we would see a bigger push from the province. Much of the concern is the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal. There’s a multi-billion dollar proposal to deal with that. It’s almost politically not possible and would take decades to accomplish, but I certainly laud the American people and their federal government for the initiatives they’ve taken on that. They are making some changes just downstream from Chicago and improving their technology as far as experimenting beyond electrocution and dealing with any movement of these fish north, up into Lake Michigan.", "Another real area of concern was Eagle Marsh, near Fort Wayne, Indiana, which was kind of a link between the Mississippi watershed and the Great Lakes watershed. They did have a steel-link fence there, which really wasn’t effective, and they now, as I understand it, have dredged or built a berm separating the two waterways. They built an earthen berm across that marsh. I certainly give the United States credit for going beyond rules and regulations and putting some money in and taking some direct action that benefits all of us on this side of the border.", "So there are, obviously, some signs of progress. The private sector has kicked in. Commercial fishermen Illinois–way have removed something like three million pounds of Asian carp over the last five years. That’s a short-term measure, obviously.", "I like to think that there are some chefs—I talked to people down in Louisiana, at these fantastic restaurants in Baton Rouge. They can cook just about anything that comes out of the water, and there’s some potential for them to put Asian carp on the dinner plate." ],

I’ve mentioned previously in this House that we in Windsor and Essex county were hit particularly hard. We warned other communities in Ontario that this thing was coming, and indeed, it is spreading to the ash trees right across the province. We had beautiful, tree-lined boulevards—unfortunately, ash trees. We had a lot of ash trees around our public parks. If you think of the damage that a dead tree—because these trees certainly die; in a windstorm or if anything hits them, they come down. They come down on houses and vehicles. We were really nervous, especially around the sports fields, that there would be children playing out there or walking down the sidewalk and the trees would come down. So our municipality spent millions of dollars taking these trees down before something really bad happened.", "The thing about losing a tree: Trees are the lungs of the earth. They clean our air. When you live in a community, as I do, where the prevailing winds blow all that pollution from the coal-burning power plants in the American states that border the Great Lakes, we need all the lungs that we can get, all the trees that we can plant and replant to make up for all the ash trees that we lost. It got very expensive for us.", "It’s the same with phragmites now. People look at the phragmites, and they think it’s the tall prairie grasses that used to be all over Ontario.

I think this is a very important piece of legislation for our environment and also for our future. What it does is, it allows the province to take an active role in now stopping new invasive species from taking hold in our province.", "This is really about protecting our plant life and our environment and making sure that it’s there for our children and for generations to come. This bill addresses the serious threat of invasive species and how they influence and impact our province’s economy and our natural environment.", "If passed, this bit of legislation would make Ontario the first jurisdiction in Canada—think about it, the first jurisdiction in Canada—with stand-alone invasive species legislation. This will make our province and the residents in this province really the leaders when it comes to protecting our environment from invasive species. I think this is exactly the kind of role that our province should be taking.", "Invasive species, as you all know, impact the lives of everyone in Ontario. In my riding of Halton, it’s really the phragmites that you can see. When you drive down any country road—and you’re nodding your head, so I know you know this—you can see them cropping up everywhere. They’re not just cropping up; they are actually choking out the rest of the plant life in the area, and they are growing to be huge. They are towering over me and over all the other plant life around.", "Invasive species, as we all know, cost Ontario tens of millions of dollars a year. We can’t afford this, and our children can’t afford this. This legislation will give our province the power to intervene early and ensure that invasive species don’t take hold in our countryside and in our environment. I think this is an extremely important piece of legislation that will benefit our environment, our society and our children for years to come." ],

Basically it’s a very long weed, sometimes as long as 20 to 30 feet long, and what it does is it provides a large canopy. It takes away the oxygen levels within the waters, and you find it very much populated along the shorelines, so when the boats come in, it chokes up their propellers, it ties into their trailers and just creates a very difficult environment, particularly in the marinas. They’ve been looking for years in regard to how they can remove those. There was a kind of water lawn mower that was used.", "I’m actually looking to meet up with the group on Friday, because there was a test piece of machinery that was used in the agricultural sector. What people were doing is they were just mulching and rolling over the bottom in the low waters, just eating it up.

Currently, as we know, invasive species are dealt with in sometimes disjointed groups of 20 different federal and provincial acts, which I can imagine would be difficult to navigate through. This bill now consolidates the provincial side into one act under one ministry.", "This sounds reasonable to me. It’s something that a lot of individuals have been asking for, particularly within the marinas and particularly with other groups, because I’ve found in the past when dealing with MNR that you discuss a particular challenge—I’ll use one that’s quite familiar to me, which is the walleye fish habitat rehabilitation program that is going on on Manitoulin Island, which I dealt with a couple of years ago with a group who were looking at establishing this program in Kagawong.", "The problem we were having was trying to move the project forward. We were dealing particularly with MNR on one particular issue. However, MNR being the left hand and MOE being the right hand, we found that they weren’t talking to each other. Whereas MNR can sometimes make certain decisions, they always like the comfort and agreement of MOE to back up that decision. However, it doesn’t prevent the project from going forward or the MNR to make that decision. With this particular walleye project, we were challenged and found it difficult to move the project forward because the left hand wasn’t talking to the right hand.", "The best way to deal with this, in my experience, is to bring both hands together to find out what they’re saying. It was very nice to see that, when you sit them down both together, you find out where the confusion lies. Once you got both hands joined together, the project was successful. We got it moving forward. The walleye project has been a success for the last two years, from what I understand.", "It just goes to show you that all these different ministries need a collaborative way to talk to each other so that we always know what one hand is doing as well as the other, so that we can benefit the organizations and the communities and the municipalities so they can move their projects forward.", "We can go on and on to talk about dredging programs or the shoreline programs as well. It doesn’t have to stop just with this piece of legislation—where we can consolidate certain issues so that we can deal with one particular act to move issues forward.", "This bill will now consolidate the provincial side into one act under the ministry. The bill will allow the government to ban the possession, sale, transportation etc. of invasive species designated as a significant threat. It would allow the government to respond quickly when invasive species are spotted, and it would give the government inspection and enforcement powers when something is prescribed as a likely host and facilitator of an invasive species.", "That has to be backed up with resources as well. It is so easy. I have talked with my friends across the way in regard to the difficulties that certain ministries are having because now they are facing cuts. If we’re not going to put the resources out there and target the funding that is going to be required, we’re going to be challenged in order to meet whatever proposal or whatever legislation or whatever course of action is going to come out of this bill. This needs to be backed up by a concrete plan and resources and individuals, not the firing and laying off of individuals. We’re actually going to have to hire individuals to go in and do the surveys, go out and do the testing, go out and make sure that we monitor and apply and charge individuals that are actually found to contravene this act.", "I think we can all agree that this bill is needed. However, we need to know what the actual regulations will look like. We need to make sure the act has real teeth.", "I had some great discussions last night with the group who had the wild game and fish reception and met with many friends from the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters, the Great Lakes Fishery Commission, the Canadian Sporting Arms and Ammunition Association and the Northern Ontario Aquaculture Association. Again, great organizations who have these particular issues at heart because a lot of them rely on these resources for their members, to make sure that the businesses and the boating institutions, the boating associations—the channels are open so that we can attract those very-much-needed dollars to our economies through tourism in northern Ontario and across this province.", "Really, it’s through lobby days like this that provide many of us with a face-to-face opportunity to hear from them about these and other issues. We share many of the same concerns. While everyone is in general support of this bill, we want to make sure that we get it right.", "This is a bill to start towards a solution and a strategy to deal with invasive species. I am fortunate enough to have the largest freshwater island in the world in my backyard, which is Manitoulin Island. I don’t know if many of you knew that. It is. It is a gem. It is a diamond, and some of these invasive species are putting a little tarnish on that gem. So we need to take the right course of action right away so that we can deal with it.", "Manitoulin Island hosts one of the most biodiverse areas in the Great Lakes. Manitoulin Island is unique in many ways. As I said, it is the world’s largest freshwater island. It has more than 100 inland lakes between its shores, and many of those lakes have islands on them as well.", "There are more than two dozen small settlements, First Nations and towns spread across more than 160 kilometres of boreal forest, lakes, rivers, shorelines, escarpments, meadows and alvars. Many people here and at home watching have travelled to Manitoulin Island and know what I’m talking about. The island is a beacon for hikers, cyclists, anglers and hunters, and everyone in between.", "This gives me a great opportunity to talk about our wonderful Owen Sound transportation system, the Chi-Cheemaun, which will be welcoming a lot of individuals to the island. I see my friend across the way, the Minister of Northern Development and Mines. I take my hat off to him for having worked with me and my friend from Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound on the delivery and the issues that we were challenged with with the Chi-Cheemaun last year. Having that operate brings $40 million to the island. That’s the impact that it means. The prompt action that we took in order to get the repairs done so that the boat can safely dock on the island—again, I’ve always been one to give flowers where flowers are deserved, and you certainly deserve a flower there, my friend.", "It seems as though invasive species have also come to the island over the years and are unfortunately causing grave concerns for people and organizations there. There are several groups on the island that are doing a lot of great work. Last night, I met with OFAH, which is one of the groups that have done really great work, making invasive species a priority in some of the work they do. Over the past several years, they have been funding an invasive species awareness liaison for Manitoulin Island to work in partnership with the Manitoulin Streams Improvement Association and Manitoulin Area Stewardship Council.", "Last summer—this is key—Eric Labelle was hired through the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters as an invasive species awareness liaison for Manitoulin Island. Mr. Labelle was a Fleming College graduate who had taken both the outdoor adventure skills and earth resources technician programs, and was returning to achieve his environmental technician diploma.", "Born and raised on Manitoulin Island, he was one of the lucky residents who could take advantage of the many outdoor activities the island offers. In enjoying these outdoor activities, Eric understood the importance of preserving our natural environment from invasive species for those of us enjoying the outdoors and wildlife now and for our future generations.", "As part of OFAH’s Invading Species Hit Squad on Manitoulin, it was Eric’s main goal to facilitate the awareness of invading species across Manitoulin Island, as well as inform the public on steps to take in order to mitigate the further reproduction and spread of these species.", "As Eric is the expert here, I am not even going to try to take some of his quotes. What I would like to do is read from his very excellent and detailed document that he produced, which is called Summary of Invasive Species Outreach and Monitoring Activities Conducted on Manitoulin Island, by Eric Labelle, under the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters, from June 16 to August 29, 2014, in co-operation with the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, Manitoulin Streams Improvement Association and the Manitoulin Area Stewardship Council." ],

It has been my pleasure to inform the public on invasive species and their effect on our natural environment here on Manitoulin Island as well as facilitating identification, mitigation, and proper reporting techniques.", "“The population of Manitoulin Island is approximately 12,600 people. However, this number increases by more than a quarter during the summer months as we are hosts to many seasonal residences. Around 200,000 people visit this island during this time, providing an excellent opportunity to inform the public not only from Manitoulin Island but from many places around the world on the hot topic that is invasive species.", "“There is a dire need to present a strong message to the public on the effects of these species and to put forth ways to stop or mitigate them in order to preserve the unique biodiversity of Manitoulin. Being bordered by Lake Huron, now host to over 185 invasive species, Manitoulin Island is facing serious environmental threat. Visitors to the island are still traversing to inland lakes without the knowledge of cleaning and draining their boats. Live bait is still being dumped in the water bodies, causing potential risk of introducing new and potentially harmful species. Firewood is still being brought to Manitoulin and subsequently off the island, even with the presence of the emerald ash borer,” which we talked about earlier, my friend. “The time to spread this message is now, and through this Invading Species Awareness Program I aimed to do just that.”", "Then he talked about this training that he received. “To be successful in this position, it was imperative to attend a two-day training session offered by the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters. It was conducted in the fishing heritage centre on June 5 and 6, 2014. All of their presentations and workshops provided me with a much greater in-depth knowledge base on invasive species. This workshop covered such things as identification, monitoring, reporting, prevention and mitigation efforts. The use of the EDDMapS,” the “Early Detection and Distribution Mapping System, program was well-presented as a useful tool for ourselves to use and to encourage the public to get involved in the reporting of invasive species. Useful training in workplace safety and workplace discrimination and harassment policies was also given. In completion of this training workshop, each of the students were given the tools needed to complete the work term, such as a wealth of species information material, samples and data containing all pertinent information to successfully complete all invasive species awareness initiatives.”", "Wow. There’s a lot here to say but I just want to get to his conclusion. I wish I had more time, but it seems like my time is being eaten up quite quickly. So I’ll go to his conclusion from the report that he had presented.", "Again, I would encourage you to look up the name. His name is Eric Labelle. His report that he put out is quite impressive. He has got a very nice invasive-species layout of identifying what those actual species look like. Very well laid out, thought out; a great piece of literature, very worthwhile to read. He has been published in many of the island papers and along Georgian Bay as well—a young man who is going places and who is quite knowledgeable through being provided with the opportunity to learn.", "His report conclusion is, “It was a tremendous opportunity to be part of this Invading Species Awareness Program this summer. All of the learning opportunities presented through this occupation will only aid in elaborating on many skills. Gaining experience in media exposure and public speaking, a particular weak point of mine, became a positive experience and it was a chance for me to work on this skills set.", "“The knowledge gained on invasive species throughout has only enforced the need for the preservation of our natural environment and has brought forth a very important ecological concern. It is my hope that this program continues to raise awareness on invading species in Ontario and that awareness turns to actions from the public and it will stop the spread of these species.", "“All of the outreach initiatives I have undertaken have all been met with positive, and eye-opening, feedback. Therefore, one can conclude that people are willing to take necessary action, such as boat cleaning and draining, not moving firewood, not dumping their bait buckets, and to look before they leave, to prevent the spread of invasive species.", "“Future outreach activities could concentrate more around media exposure through print, social, radio and television outreach. It would increase the number of people that would be exposed to this information. Continuing to deliver information to resorts, tent and trailer parks, motels, parks ... are great for making the information accessible to the tourism public. All in all, the summer work term went very well.”", "He goes on to thank a couple of individuals from Manitoulin Island. Special thanks go “to Seija Deschenes, Manitoulin Streams, and the Manitoulin Area Stewardship Council for having me this summer. Thank you to Susanne Meert and Calvin Crispo for working with me and helping to make this a very successful experience. As well, thank you to Alison Kirkpatrick and Matt Smith for all their support.”", "There is an opportunity to learn from this whole bill. We’ve already seen a young man who has learned from it. We need to challenge ourselves to learn from it. I’ll be looking forward to seeing this bill into committee so that we can have further discussion on it." ],

There have been several thoughtful speeches delivered this afternoon, both from members of the opposition and the third party. The speech that was just delivered by the member from Algoma–Manitoulin was a very thoughtful, very well-constructed speech.", "This is a very serious issue. My riding of Peterborough, the city of Peterborough, is right in the middle of the Trent Severn system. Over the years, we’ve had the milfoil weed, which was an invasive species that spread into the Kawartha Lakes and damaged the habitat of pickerel and large-mouth bass, and other recreational fishing opportunities within the Trent Severn system.", "But it’s interesting. The member from Windsor–Tecumseh talked about the emerald ash borer. It got into Canada because the emerald ash borer was embedded in pallets which came in through Michigan into Windsor and then cut a swath—Mr. Speaker, as you’d know, your predecessor, Pat Hoy, the member from Chatham–Kent–Essex, actually showed us pictures that were taken by MNR. You could see the track of the emerald ash borer from Detroit into Windsor through to Leamington and Chatham–Kent–Essex. From those aerial photos, it was like an army marching from west to east, with the destruction that it left in its wake.", "I know that decades ago in Ontario, Dutch elm disease destroyed all of the stately elms in many big cities and smaller communities right across Ontario.", "The other one, which is interesting enough when you talk about shrubs or bushes used for landscaping and ornamental purposes, is the purple loosestrife. That was really an interesting one, because it was an invasive species, but if you went to landscape supply businesses, they were recommending it. You know, you put a nice front on your house with the dimensional stone and the evergreen bushes and all the other plants. That was an invasive species that everybody was using.", "So the member delivered a very eloquent address to the Legislature this afternoon." ],

I look forward to seeing it.", "However, I’ll just go back to my main point. I have yet to hear the government speak about maybe changing this bill a bit to deal with prevention of invasive species entering Ontario. They talked lots today about the cost of dealing with invasive species. This bill sets it up to still accept invasive species and deal with it, so all they are doing is identifying them quicker, but they are still going to be spending hundreds of millions of dollars each year to deal with invasive species. Why not take a step back and try to have a prevention program like New Zealand, which has an excellent program that prevents invasive species from entering the marketplace? I think, at the end of the day, that would save our environment, it would save a heck of a lot of money for this government in dealing with invasive species, and I think it would put a lot of people’s minds at rest worrying about invasive species and how they get into our province.", "Hopefully, the government will see fit to start listening to the opposition on a few ideas. We do have ideas that make sense. We’re shut out quite a bit, because that’s the nature of this business. The majority rules. However, I think the people of this province would like to actually see them work with us in making things better and looking at the ideas that we have going forward with the Invasive Species Act. It’s a good time to start listening to the PC Party." ],

This bill enables you to appoint inspectors to make sure invasive species aren’t entering the province of Ontario. Does that mean you’ll be hiring new staff? Asking the Ministry of Natural Resources staff to take this on—what will happen with that? You say you’re going to make these positions exist on one hand, but—here’s the concern that I have, and I want my colleagues to listen to this—they want to cut the Ministry of Natural Resources budget by 6% on the other hand. Here’s what happens when you do that. Will you be laying off employees and then asking those who are left to pick up the slack? We know what happens. We’ve seen that happen in other situations.", "If you’re asking for an answer to the questions that I’m raising right now, you won’t find them in the bill, and that’s a concern for me. You may find it around the Liberal cabinet table, and that’s fair, or you may find it at the minister’s headquarters, but you won’t find it in the bill or at any committee around the bill, and that’s a concern.", "Debating what we have in front of us here: Do we support moving to ban invasive species from Ontario? The answer is easy. I think everybody here can say it: Absolutely. Do we support the stakeholders who are calling for this? Absolutely. Of course. Can we be sure how this will look when it’s implemented? Absolutely the answer is no, and that’s a big concern.", "When I look back at what has been quoted before—“The minister may appoint or designate persons or classes of persons as enforcement officers for the purposes of this act”— here’s the problem: a 6% cut at the ministry that will be overseeing this. Somehow the minister is going to be able to create jobs for people to stop invasive species entering the province.", "My time is up; I realize that.

  "text" : [ "I will be sharing my time with the member from Etobicoke–Lakeshore.", "In this proposed legislation, the government is taking action to address the serious threat of invasive species to Ontario’s economy and to our natural environment. In February, our government first introduced the proposed Invasive Species Act and reintroduced this proposed legislation on November 5, 2014. If the proposed legislation is passed, Ontario will become the first jurisdiction in Canada with stand-alone invasive species legislation.", "Invasive species impact the lives of every Ontarian and cost the Ontario economy tens of millions of dollars each year. They put resource-based jobs at risk; for example, the forest industry, the commercial and recreational fisheries, tourism and agriculture.", "Impacts that are already existing in Ontario from these species include the zebra mussels that clog the intake pipes of municipal water pipes and hydroelectric companies. They also interfere with the enjoyment of our lakes and our rivers. This can cost us anywhere from $75 million to $91 million every year to manage.", "Another is ruffe. They can seriously damage native sport fish populations such as yellow perch by directly competing for food or habitat or through heavy predation of native sport fish eggs. Ruffe can very quickly become the most dominant fish in local areas because of their rapid reproductive and growth rates. This puts pressure on the native species and contributes to their decline. Given time, they have the potential to spread to all of the Great Lakes and many inland waters as well.", "The emerald ash borer: The emerald ash borer was first found in Canada in Windsor, Ontario, in 2002. Since then, the beetle has spread across much of southwestern Ontario, including Sault Ste. Marie and the Ottawa area. Once infested, the mortality of ash trees is nearly 100%. Ontario municipalities have spent over $71 million on managing the beetle and plan to spend an additional $284 million over the next 10 years. The beetle is a significant threat to our forestry industry.", "Another one is the Asian long-horned beetle, an invasive forest pest with no natural enemies in North America that attacks nearly all broadleaf trees, with native maples being the preferred host. A potential decline in hardwood broadleaf trees could have major consequences for Ontario’s wildlife and biodiversity, negatively affecting future generations.", "Impacts from species that are not yet in Ontario are also a possibility. The mountain pine beetle, which is in western Canada, is an insect responsible for destroying millions of hectares of pine trees in British Columbia. There’s an increased risk of large fires with dead and dying trees creating a landscape of highly flammable stems. There’s also a loss of wildlife habitat, and it degrades the overall visual quality of our forests.", "The Asian carp, which is in the United States, has migrated through US waterways towards the Great Lakes. Asian carp prefer cool to moderate water temperatures like those found near the shores of the Great Lakes. If Asian carp become established in Ontario waters, they could potentially eat the food supply that our native fish depend on and crowd them out of their habitat. The decline of native fish species could damage sport and commercial fishing in Ontario, which brings millions of dollars a year into the province’s economy.", "We need this legislation, and our government encourages everyone to support this legislation. Currently, there’s a patchwork of more than 20 federal and provincial acts, none designed specifically to deal with invasive species. For example, the Canada Shipping Act, which is a federal act, manages the discharge of ballast waters; the Plant Diseases Act, which is provincial, bans the transport and sale of diseased plants, which would include an invasive insect or pathogen; and then there’s the Public Lands Act, which is provincial and allows landowners to remove some invasive plants from their shorelines.", "The proposed legislation would help address legislative gaps, as none of these laws was designed specifically to address invasive species. If passed, the Invasive Species Act would be the first stand-alone legislation of its kind in Canada." ],

Are you bringing any plant materials, any meat or any other agricultural products in?” So we’re all used to the concept that we have strong laws, that when people try to import organic products into this country, they have controls over that, because the impacts of that could be severe: on agriculture, on our economy and on our ecology. But yet we don’t have a sufficient framework right now to deal with some of the other invaders that might be brought in, not necessarily even by individuals coming into the country, but that will latch onto ships or onto containers or into products that are imported commercially into this country.", "As a number of my colleagues have mentioned, we have species like zebra mussels that come to this country on the sides of ships. We have the Asian long-horned beetle that came in on wooden pallets of industrial products being imported into this country. When these and other species arrive here, the impacts that they can have on Ontario—on our ecology, on our economy, on our agriculture and on our forestry—are severe. As has been recounted, a number of these species—zebra mussels can have a huge impact on the intakes for municipal water systems, or on the cooling for nuclear power plants, if the intakes for the cooling water for those are impacted by zebra mussels.

The tree canopy in our municipality was destroyed. The urban heat island effect that that creates, the economic impact on municipalities and just the pleasure of enjoying our natural environment are greatly affected.", "With other species, if they were to attack our forests or forestry industry, it could be decimated. The impacts on our economy, on Ontario’s ability to continue to create products, export products, have good-quality jobs, would be severely impacted.", "The impact on our agricultural sector could be severe with some of these species. Purple loosestrife is an example which chokes off a lot of the waterways wherever it takes root and prevents the flow of water to get into the land and pushes out other natural species. That has an impact.", "I’m certainly not an expert in these areas, but I do know that some of these species have already impacted this province. We need a strategy, a framework, legislation, that will give us the tools to combat these problems when they arrive in Ontario and give us the ability to protect Ontario’s natural environment and habitats.

It goes along somewhat with invasive species, but really when we were talking about washing out your bait pails and making sure you’re not transferring bait from island to island, I find it very interesting that the Ministry of Natural Resources here will use a bridge, an actual structure that people use to drive their cars over water, as the border between which side of the bridge you can take bait out and which side you can’t—because they’re saying that the bait have a disease in them—and rightly so: They should stop them from doing it.

It can decimate and choke out native plants that make up the habitats where fish, birds and animals feed and seek shelter.

I know that municipalities have contacted previous ministers to express concerns about invasive species and ask for greater assistance. However, addressing this problem doesn’t just require all levels of government; it requires environmental organizations, farmers, conservation groups, people who are transporting goods and many others to work together. You simply cannot get that level of co-operation and agreement unless you can demonstrate that the invasive species list is based on scientific data.", "Currently, the legislation doesn’t include a scientific process for determining which species are being added to the invasive species list.", "Mr. Speaker, we have seen this government’s non-scientific approach right now on the threat to our pollinators, and it could be putting our bee population at risk. The government is blaming all the bee deaths on neonicotinoids, without having the scientific data to really show all the causes. What if the neonicotinoids are only a small part of the problem? What if, as some people and studies have suggested, the larger threat to our bees is the mites or the chemicals that beekeepers have been using to treat the mites? What if the cause is the extreme cold winters we’ve been experiencing, and we need to look at better ways to protect our bees? The government’s knee-jerk political reaction may be causing hardship for our farmers without actually addressing the major cause of bee deaths. That’s why we need a scientific approach, both for our pollinators’ health and the invasive species.", "The Ministry of Natural Resources’ Ontario invasive species plan, released in 2012, mentions science 24 times. It talks about the importance of developing science-based standard monitoring protocols for priority invasive species, pathways and habitat types. It talks about Ontario ministries, including MNR and OMAFRA, participating in a variety of conferences designed to ensure ongoing science transfer. But that science-based approach doesn’t seem to have made it into this legislation. I hope that this is one of the things that can be corrected at committee.", "Mr. Speaker, one of our other concerns in this act is that it is reactive. It will add invasive species to the list when there is evidence that they have already caused harm. Our critic for natural resources, the member for Elgin–Middlesex–London, has proposed that we look at a pathway approach instead. This approach is proactive and would study potential invasive species, the harm that they could cause and the pathways that they could use to enter the province. This would allow resources to be focused where there is a potential problem and, importantly, where we can try to stop the invasive species before they enter the province.", "This approach was the focus of the Ministry of Natural Resources’ Ontario invasive species plan, released in 2012. In fact, that report said, “Preventing harmful introductions before they occur is the most effective means to avoid the risk of invasive species arriving in Ontario. Investments in prevention are cost-effective as they avoid the economic, environmental and social costs of invaders.”", "As I said earlier, for this legislation to be effective, it should be scientific, it should be proactive and, again, it should be fair. Part of that is ensuring that we are working with impacted property owners, not making them the enemy. I’m pleased that this bill requires a warrant for many searches, but I’m concerned that there is still an exception which allows enforcement officers access without a warrant or permission of the owner.", "While we support this bill, I think we need to be careful with any legislation that provides access to private property without a warrant, unless there is an immediate danger. I’m especially concerned when that authority is given to someone other than a police officer.", "Coming from an agriculture community, biosecurity is always a huge concern. Anytime we’re expanding the number of people who have a right to enter the property without the owner’s permission, I have a concern.", "I know that there are many people in this Legislature who haven’t been involved in agriculture, so I want to explain a little bit more. Unfortunately, in my riding of Oxford we’re dealing with an outbreak of H5N2 avian flu which was found on a turkey farm. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency took swift action to quarantine the farm and culled 45,000 turkeys to ensure that the rest of our poultry is safe. The farms are being disinfected, and other farmers are stepping up their biosecurity measures. One of the biosecurity measures they are taking is disinfecting the tires on feed delivery trucks to ensure that it isn’t being spread from farm to farm.", "On hog farms, we have biosecurity measures to stop the spread of PED. If the enforcement officer has to get permission from the farmer before entering the property, that gives the farmer the ability to put conditions such as disinfecting tires in place before the enforcement officer is allowed to enter the property. It gives the farmer the opportunity to ask questions such as which farms the enforcement officer has visited and to say no if the visit at the time would put animals at risk.", "Mr. Speaker, no one wants the spread of invasive species, but we need to ensure that we are setting up systems where people are working together and where knowledge and rights of the property owner are respected.", "I want to commend the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters for their work to raise awareness of invasive species. In1992, they created a partnership with MNR called Ontario’s Invading Species Awareness Program, which has been working hard to inform people about the invasive species and actions they can take. In fact, one of their recent publications was Landowner’s Guide to Managing and Controlling Invasive Plants. I think we need to ensure that we continue the approach of education and working with landowners.", "The minister talked about enforcement, but we need to ensure that the people being punished are the people breaking the law, such as those trying to import invasive species, not the property owners who happen to have an invasive species on their property and are trying to do the right thing.", "By definition, it’s difficult to stop the spread of these species. They don’t recognize property boundaries any more than they stop at provincial boundaries. The legislation should help property owners deal with them, not penalize them.", "Section 29 of this bill says the minister “may”—and it was mentioned earlier in the other speech. “The minister may authorize compensation” for a number of things, including the “loss of any building, structure, conveyance or property owned….” That concerns us when the word is “may.” That also implies that the answer could be “may not,” and I think that would be unfair. This section needs to be strengthened.", "We all understand that sometimes actions need to be taken for the greater good to stop the spread of disease or invasive species. Unfortunately, as I mentioned, we’ve seen that demonstrated in the last week in my riding when the H5N2 avian flu was found at the turkey farm. It’s obviously not an invasive species like we’re addressing here today, but the impact is similar to the type of situation that would be covered by this bill. As I said, the CFIA quarantined the farms and culled 45,000 turkeys to ensure that the rest of our poultry is safe.", "We understand that sometimes steps need to be taken to protect the greater good, but there has to be a recognition of that impact. But this act gives the minister and the inspection officers significant powers over private property, and with that power there should be some responsibility. The property owner shouldn’t be left to pay the price.", "There are different threats from invasive species across Ontario. It’s difficult to get this legislation right when we’re talking about so many different species—from plants to fish to insects—all of which travel in different ways, enter the province from different areas and pose different threats to our environment and our natural resources.", "One of the things that’s great about this Legislature is that we have members with such varied backgrounds and representing all parts of Ontario, people who can look at whether this legislation will work in their riding: people like the member from Haldimand–Norfolk, whose riding is along Lake Erie and who knows how devastating the impact of the Asian carp would be; people like the member from Niagara West–Glanbrook, who dealt with the gypsy moth in his riding; members from northern Ontario ridings who could talk about the dangers invasive species pose to the forestry industry; members who can talk about wetlands in their ridings that are being impacted; and people who work in industries that will be impacted.", "There are some people in this Legislature who probably wouldn’t have considered the biosecurity issues on farms created by this bill—and the people who have raised other concerns that we haven’t considered yet. It shows the value of debate that we have in this Legislature, Mr. Speaker. Recently it seems there has been a trend towards cutting off debate or government members using some of their time to complain that there has actually been too much debate. We’re seeing in the last few days a new tactic: We’re splitting up the time and everybody speaks in a matter of 20 minutes and nobody gets to say anything—and to move this through.", "I would hope that that won’t be the case with this bill because we need to hear from members from all areas of Ontario. If this bill passes second reading, it goes to committee. We need to ensure that it travels through areas that are being impacted or threatened, as well as to hear from residents and experts from those areas.", "I’d like to see us travel in southwestern Ontario to hear from farm organizations, to hear from other organizations like the Long Point Region Conservation Authority, which I know has been working on some of these same issues. They represent the area that the member from Elgin–Middlesex–London is from. I’d like to see the committee travel to northern Ontario to talk about the forestry industry and what they need to do to protect it.", "I was pleased to have the opportunity to speak to this bill to put forward some concerns and suggestions. I hope that the government has been listening to the debate today because I think a number of members have put forward real concerns and suggestions on how this bill could be improved.", "We agree with the need to identify invasive species, and not just those in Ontario. We live in a global society. Travel, trade and Ontario’s central location mean that we cannot ignore the invasive species that are impacting our neighbours. We believe that our approach should be proactive, to try and stop these threats before they cross our borders. We believe that the approach should include education and should work with landowners to address invasive species. I hope that the government will agree with our approach and work with us to ensure that this bill meets those goals.", "I want to thank you, Mr. Speaker, for allowing me to put a few thoughts on the record on this bill." ],

I’m pleased to rise again to speak about the problems of the Housing Services Corp. and the cost to Ontario’s social housing.", "Every dollar that the Housing Services Corp. spends is one that’s supposed to build, repair or operate social housing. Earlier today I brought forward a number of examples of housing providers who are being overcharged for natural gas and insurance by the Housing Services Corp.", "In his response, the minister failed to address these examples or the families that are still waiting for affordable housing because this money has been diverted. I want to mention a number of them again.", "In one year, CityHousing Hamilton reported spending $1.1 million more for gas because they had to purchase it through the Housing Services Corp., enough to provide rent supplements for 140 families.", "Peel region reported they paid an additional $200,000 for gas in one year.", "The Thunder Bay district social services board reported that they paid an additional $750,000 for natural gas over four years due to the HSC.", "This morning, I asked the minister how much buying through the Housing Services Corp. is costing Toronto Community Housing. We know the minister has met with them, but he didn’t answer my question. We know that there are thousands of families in Toronto waiting for social housing. We know that there are units that have been boarded up because the TCHC can’t afford to repair them. We know that Toronto Community Housing would save money and could help more people if the minister and his government would support my private member’s bill.", "Mr. Speaker, it isn’t just large housing providers that are paying too much due to the Housing Services Corp. Oxford county says the Housing Services Corp. costs them about $100,000 a year, enough to provide housing for 25 more families. As I mentioned in my question this morning, Bruce county, Hastings, Halton, Prince Edward, Lennox and Addington, if they weren’t required to purchase services through the Housing Services Corp., could all help more people who need social housing.", "Over the last two days alone, I have received support for my bill from the city of Owen Sound, the township of Northeastern Manitoulin and the Islands, the township of Alfred and Plantagenet, the township of Faraday, the township of Wainfleet, the township of Hudson, the town of Tillsonburg in my riding, and, incidentally, the city of Quinte West, which is of course in the parliamentary assistant’s own riding.", "Mr. Speaker, there are approximately 100 housing providers who are obtaining insurance from another company but are still being forced to pay the Housing Services Corp. for the privilege of doing so: 2.5% of their cost. That means their insurance volume isn’t required to get discounted rates for other housing providers, as the government claims. It means those 100 housing providers are paying a fee equal to 2.5% of the premium to the Housing Services Corp. simply because the HSC has a monopoly and can demand it. We have an opportunity to stop that from happening. Think of how much affordable housing could be provided with that money.", "Where is that money going? Some of it is going to fund the more than $82,000 the CEO has spent on travel, including $53,000 on flights. Some of it was invested in a corporation whose address is a lawyer’s office in Manchester, England. Mr. Speaker, we don’t know why the money was put in that corporation that doesn’t seem to have ever operated, but the money seems to be gone. The money also went into Innoserv Solar, a for-profit solar company that received over $1 million in loans from the HSC, most of which was written off as uncollectable in the same year it was given. The government’s review isn’t looking at this money, where it went or whether there is any way to get it back. Every dollar was one that was supposed to go to social housing.", "Mr. Speaker, this is not about political parties. This is about money being diverted away from vulnerable people who need affordable housing. That’s why I was so disappointed that the minister ignored my question this morning. The government says more accountability was needed at the Housing Services Corp. Clearly, there is still a problem. In 2012, the Housing Services Corp. entered into a partnership with another British organization.", "This Thursday, we have an opportunity to increase that accountability. We have an opportunity to stop public money from being wasted and ensure that it provides housing for our most vulnerable, as it’s intended to do.", "I hope that now that he has had a few more hours to reflect, the minister and the members of the government will support the Housing Services Corporation Accountability Act and stop the waste and misuse of social housing dollars.", "Thank you very much for this opportunity." ],

As a result of our reforms, HSC is required to provide an annual report to the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing, along with audited financial statements, within 180 days of the end of its fiscal year.", "Mr. Hardeman’s erroneous assertion that our government changed legislation to remove a requirement for HSC to report salaries on the sunshine list is simply not true. The changes to the HSA did not remove HSC from the disclosure requirements in the public sector disclosure act. In fact, the HSA included stronger accountability requirements by requiring HSC to include certain salaries in its public annual report.", "The HSC is only required to report for the year that it’s receiving funding from the government of Ontario of at least $1 million or government funding that is at least 10% of its gross revenues, and then only if that 10% is $120,000 or more. No funding has been provided to HSC by the ministry since 2011-12, and therefore it’s not required to report salaries for 2014.", "I’m increasingly puzzled by Mr. Hardeman’s ongoing campaign of misinformation around the HSC.

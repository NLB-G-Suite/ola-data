  "text" : [ "It’s a pleasure to join the debate today—kick off the debate, actually—for second reading of Bill 109, which is formally titled the Employment and Labour Statute Law Amendment Act, 2015.", "Before I get into the details of the bill, I’d like to take the opportunity to let you know that I’ll be sharing my time with the member from Eglinton–Lawrence, Mr. Mike Colle, the best parliamentary assistant anyone could have.", "I’d also like to take this opportunity on behalf of all in this province to express our sincere gratitude to the firefighters and all front-line health and safety workers who risk their own lives and their own safety to protect the lives of others every day. They believe in the concept of public service; they don’t do that work for the glory of the headlines. I don’t think that the heroism they demonstrate day in and day out has gone unnoticed or unappreciated by the people in this House. I—and I think all Ontarians, for that matter—cannot thank those men and women enough.", "This is one of the reasons we are proposing changes to three pieces of legislation which will, if they become law, provide increased fairness to all workers across Ontario by strengthening protections, enhancing compensation and ensuring that broader public sector transitions can go as smoothly as possible, while still balancing the democratic rights of workers.", "Speaker, if passed, this bill would amend the Fire Protection and Prevention Act of 1997; it would also amend the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act of 1997; and, finally, the Public Sector Labour Relations Transition Act of the same year, 1997.", "I’d like to talk first, briefly, about the proposed amendments to the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act. As I said previously, the member from Eglinton–Lawrence will go into further detail on the other two amendments to the other two acts—the Fire Protection and Prevention Act, shortly.", "Bill 109 is going to provide much greater safeguards to all workers in the province through making changes to the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act. Our first proposed amendment to the act being given second reading this morning is driven by our commitment to protect injured workers and their right to file a claim with the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board in this province. Workers in this province should know that it is their right to file a WSIB claim, and that their right will be protected.", "The amendments that we’re debating today would prohibit employers from taking any actions against any worker with the intent of discouraging that worker from filing a claim or influencing a worker to withdraw or abandon a claim for benefits for either work-related injuries or for illnesses. Those claims would be made with the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board.", "The proposed amendments would also enable the WSIB to prosecute and to impose administrative penalties when employers try to impede or try to suppress those claims. This would strengthen the WSIB’s efforts by legislating much stronger deterrence against employers engaged in any activities that would suppress or impede the right that injured workers have, in this province, to report a work-related injury or illness to the WSIB. The proposed amendment would also enable the WSIB to prosecute and impose administrative penalties when employers try to impede or suppress claims.", "Speaker, to make sure that our laws are respected and that workers are protected, we are proposing an increase in the maximum corporate penalties for conviction of an offence under the WSIA from $100,000 to $500,000. Not reporting a workplace incident or accident is a violation of the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act. The WSIB has a zero-tolerance policy and strategy that prevents claim suppression in this province. When a person commits an offence under the WSIA, the WSIB may then lay charges and prosecute.", "The bill would also mandate, by statute, that the WSIB board of directors appoint what is called a fair practices commissioner, and that would be an organizational ombudsperson for the WSIB. The fair practices commission is an independent, neutral and confidential resource for injured workers, for employers and for service providers. It should be noted that its services are free of charge. These services could include looking into individual complaints, tracking complaint trends, identifying system-wide issues within the organization and, finally, recommending improvements to the WSIB itself. By legislatively requiring a fair practices commissioner, what we’ll be doing is ensuring the commission’s stability and longevity over time.", "Mr. Speaker, Bill 109 would also enable the WSIB to calculate survivor benefits based on the average earnings of a worker who is engaged in the same profession as the one in which the deceased received his or her injury. The issue, really, addresses how the WSIB calculates survivor benefits for a worker who dies of an occupational disease who had no or perhaps low earnings on the date of the diagnosis because they had retired from work. This situation could arise because of the long latency period before the onset of many work-related diseases, such as cancer.", "Currently, in situations where a worker dies of an occupational disease and had no earnings at the time of that diagnosis, the board’s operational practice today is to calculate survivor benefits based on the average annual earnings of a worker engaged in the same trade in which the worker’s disease was contracted. Speaker, the proposed amendment before you today would allow the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board to continue the practice that is in place and enshrine it in legislation. I think it’s a fair amendment and one that is overdue.", "The proposed amendments would apply to payments for survivor benefits that are payable as of January 1, 1998, which was the date upon which the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act, 1997, actually came into effect. What we are doing with Bill 109 and the amendments to the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act is protecting in a much greater way the people of this province who work, and ensuring that they have the ability to avail themselves of the rights they have as workers in this province to obtain coverage under the WSIB without any interference or undue interference from employers.", "Speaker, the amendments are based on the principles of fairness, balance and justice, and, if passed, will be important changes to the legislation we already have in the province of Ontario.", "Speaker, Ontario is one of the safest places in the world to work. That doesn’t mean we can’t do better; it does mean that we will do better. From time to time still, Ontario workers are injured on the job or, in the awful instances that we hear of from time to time, they actually lose their life on the job. Often that takes place as a result of a traumatic injury. But it can also be an illness that is contracted and doesn’t appear for years; it just goes through a latent period and then the worker becomes aware that something has happened years back and they need coverage for that.", "These changes are long overdue. I hope they enjoy the support of all members of the House. We’ve tried to introduce them in a way such that I think all Ontarians will understand this is a fair way to do it, it’s a balanced way to do it and it’s a responsible way to do it. Certainly it has been formulated with much consultation with the WSIB itself, which is an organization that I think over the past few years has done tremendous things in the services it provides for injured workers and is also, I think, enjoying a good reputation with the employers of this province for providing good value, ensuring that workers get the treatment they receive, ensuring that they get it at the right time and ensuring that the unfunded liability that has plagued this organization in years past is reduced, as the Provincial Auditor asked that it be.", "Speaker, my parliamentary assistant for the Ministry of Labour, Mike Colle, will now speak to the other elements of the bill, which include further details, as I spoke of earlier, on the Fire Protection and Prevention Act, as well as the Public Sector Labour Relations Transition Act. I hope that all members of the House will see fit to support this bill when it comes to a vote." ],

  "speaker" : "Mr. Mike Colle",
  "text" : [ "Thank you to the minister for bringing this very comprehensive series of reforms forward for the people of Ontario, especially those who are injured on the job, and for those who have dangerous jobs, like our firefighters and our first responders. I know the minister is very proactive in listening and acting on recommendations brought forward by all the partners in labour in Ontario: the employers, the workers, the unions, all the experts who are out there. This is a culmination of all that ongoing discussion that the minister really takes a lot of time to do.", "So this came forward as a result of all these discussions and proposals put forward. Bill 109 amends, as the minister said, the Fire Protection and Prevention Act from 1997, the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act, and also the Public Sector Labour Relations Transition Act, which is a complex piece of legislation but is another needed amendment.", "I was talking to the executive director of the construction association of Ontario yesterday. He was saying that there’s just a time for all of us, whether we’re workers, employers or ordinary citizens, to slow down sometimes and ensure that we consider the safety aspect of work. All of us assume that buildings are going to be built, hospitals are going to be built, roads are going to be repaired, critical hydro infrastructure is going to be kept up to speed, and we all want it done yesterday. We’re in such a hurry to have this work done, we forget that the workers out there are sometimes in a very precarious situation. We must all put in our culture of work, I think, this big “S” of safety. Certainly workers know it is critical to work in a methodical, safe way, because they are risking their lives.", "I think there are 250 cranes in the sky in Toronto. Imagine how dangerous that kind of work is, the responsibility the company has that maintains the equipment, the workers who operate it, the workers and the public in the surrounding area. We just basically think that’s automatic. Well, it isn’t automatic. It’s just like the 1.5 million people who travel on public transit every day in Toronto, and probably another million in the greater Toronto area. The public transit alone—the buses, the trains, the GO system—is very technical, precarious work at times. We’ve got to ensure that our bus drivers, train operators, mechanics, maintenance workers—everybody—is given the proper support in ensuring safety. Safety, safety, safety: It is not automatic. That’s what this bill tries to support: the whole idea that people do get hurt on the job, sad to say, but they need protection.", "As the minister said, in some cases the injury is latent. I think of Johns Manville in Scarborough. All those workers worked for decades with asbestos. They didn’t know that they were basically contracting cancer, and the cancer didn’t appear till decades later. That’s what happens in many workplaces. You think the workplace is safe, but there may be an air quality problem, there may be some kind of work procedure that causes an injury that comes after the fact. That’s one of the things this act tries to change, to protect workers who receive these injuries after the fact. They could be retired.", "I know that firefighters have been bringing that forward for years. They’ve been saying, “We’ve attended all these fires. Sometimes they’re chemical fires.” Then, after a number of years, there is a frightening series of firefighters who have cancer, and they all say, “Well, listen, we didn’t know at the time. It could have been the result of those fires we had to deal with 10 years ago.” These are some of the protections we’re putting in place with Bill 109.", "As I mentioned in this reference to firefighters, whom we are further protecting in this legislation, in my own riding of Eglinton–Lawrence just this summer we had our annual Marlee-Ville Festival, on Marlee Avenue. One of the participants at the festival suffered a seizure. We think it was a diabetic seizure. Luckily, the gentleman didn’t hit his head on the concrete sidewalk when he collapsed. Right away we called 911, and the first responders there were the firefighters. They came 10 minutes before the ambulance. As a result of that quick response by our firefighters, through heavy traffic—it was about 5 o’clock—that individual was put on the ambulance, which came later, rushed to hospital and saved, I’m sure, a lot of grief going forward.", "We also had a massive, potentially dangerous, fire on Castlefield Avenue a year ago, when a foam mattress factory burned down. It was a multi-alarm fire. Firefighters were hundreds of feet up on their ladders trying to put out this fire to ensure that it didn’t spread. They did an amazing job. They protected the surrounding properties—the neighbourhood—and no one got hurt. It was a pretty complex, precarious fire incident. This is what is done every day, and these are the everyday dangers our workers face, especially our firefighters and first responders. This bill tries to remedy that with more protecttions.", "As we say, our ongoing efforts to help, especially workers who work in dangerous situations—and it could be any worker. It could be people who seem to have so-called inside office jobs; they could be in a dangerous situation. People who work in construction, people who work in mines—every day there are hundreds of thousands of Ontarians who need to be protected.", "According to the Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services, there are 11,000 full-time firefighters and 19,000 volunteer firefighters. That’s a lot of people who are out there trying to protect us every day. Our legislation here, Bill 109, would provide the Fire Protection and Prevention Act with new substantive procedural and enforcement provisions, so there are going to be new enforcement provisions in this bill. These amendments would bring the Fire Protection and Prevention Act into greater and more natural alignment with the Labour Relations Act.", "In other words, a lot of the workplace rules of safety and protection that the firefighters work under—up until this proposed bill, if passed—aren’t under the Labour Relations Act. What this bill is doing is taking a lot of those activities that come under the Fire Protection and Prevention Act and folding them into the Labour Relations Act. That’s a significant change. Therefore, what we’re really doing is putting a lot of the practices that normal workers enjoy under the Labour Relations Act, as also applicable to firefighters. Before, it was separate. That’s one of the most significant things that Bill 109 is doing.", "By doing that, what we are really doing, hopefully, is reducing the need to go to court to get remedial action. As you know, Mr. Speaker, courts can be very lengthy, very expensive, very complex and very adversarial. But by putting a lot of these activities in the Fire Protection and Prevention Act under the Labour Relations Act, we are going to hopefully reduce the need of appealing to our judicial system, which will save time, money and effort.", "The proposed amendments would enhance the Fire Protection and Prevention Act by adding very similar key legislative provisions already available to those covered by the Labour Relations Act. These are some of the key provisions where the Fire Protection and Prevention Act will now be covered by the Labour Relations Act:", "—unfair labour practice protections;", "—expedited grievance arbitration;", "—union security and related provisions;", "—religious objections;", "—Ontario Labour Relations Board authority to enforce all provisions under part IX of the Fire Protection and Prevention Act;", "—the power of an arbitrator to enforce a written settlement of a grievance, and the ability of the parties to file an arbitration decision in the Superior Court of Justice and have it enforced as an order of that court; and", "—the power of the Ontario Labour Relations Board to grant interim orders.", "All of these existing provisions in the Ontario Labour Relations Act will now also be folded into—or vice versa—the Fire Protection and Prevention Act. These are significant changes.", "As we all concur, in this province we all appreciate the incredible efforts of our firefighters in communities all across Ontario. I think these changes will certainly protect them even further in their workplace.", "The third element of Bill 109 consists of legislative amendments to the Public Sector Labour Relations Transition Act, which was passed in 1997. Under these proposed amendments, when an event in the broader public occurs to which the act applies, such as certain amalgamations or restructurings, if a prescribed minimum percentage of employees in the new bargaining units are represented by the same union, that union would be ordered to be the bargaining agent for the new unit without a representation vote.", "As happened in Toronto, we had the amalgamation of the six cities and boroughs into one; we had it done in Ottawa; we had it in Hamilton; we had it in the Lindsay area—Kawartha Lakes. When you bring those entities together, the workers and their contracts and their protections and union arrangements all of a sudden are affected by these amalgamations. What this amendment here does is try to accommodate the reality of unions so we don’t go through a long process of reconfiguring the associations that are already in existence. It just streamlines that so we don’t get these long, drawn-out confrontations when changes are made administratively by amalgamations in this province.", "We have been told, as the minister has said, that such a change would help to reduce time and disruption during events such as mergers. Speaker, as you know, our government is committed to advancing safe, fair and respectful workplaces. That’s why these amendments have come forward in Bill 109. We’re trying to increase the level of fairness by strengthening protections for all of these workers, and we will ensure that the broader public sector transitions go as smoothly as possible, while still balancing the democratic rights of workers.", "Strengthening protections for workers while supporting business is part of the government’s plan to build a stronger Ontario. As you know, Mr. Speaker, the critical thing is to have this partnership, this combined effort, whether it be an employer, whether it be workers, whether it be their unions, to make this province a province that works for people, provides services for people and protects people. So it’s not that the government can do this by itself. The government needs those partners to consult, to collaborate and to make improvements.", "It is not a static thing. The Fire Protection and Prevention Act was brought forward in this Legislature in 1997. It is an updating of that as a result of these ongoing consultations and suggestions made by workers, by unions, by employers. We’ve tried, with this legislation, to strike a balance. It is never possible, and the pages on their last day should know this: You could never please everybody. It’s just like your mother can’t please all the kids in the family, nor can government ever please everyone. But you try to be fair.", "I know that in Hamilton they tried to call themselves the “fair” city of Hamilton. In other words, you can’t give everybody everything they want but you try to give people everything they need to the best of your ability. In this legislation, whether it’s in Hamilton, whether it’s in Ottawa, whether it’s in Peterborough, we try to ensure, whether you’re a firefighter, you’re a factory worker or you’re someone providing a service, big or small, that there are these protections in the workplace safety act that will ensure that you get a fair shake. God forbid, if you are injured on the job, if you develop an illness—in this bill we also try to amend the procedures around survivor’s benefits. Those are very complex areas, because if that person, sadly—the partner or the husband or wife—passes away on the job, the survivor’s benefits pension is critically important. The way that’s handled could affect the life of that survivor, plus the family, so we need to do these things in a way that is compassionate, comprehensive and fair.", "That’s what’s in Bill 109. It is an area of legislation that has responded to the requests by various stakeholders, our firefighters, by municipalities, by employers, to try and update some of these acts that were brought in in 1997. I just hope that the members from all sides will come up with further ideas on how we can strengthen this, how we can take into account all the complexities and make this a good piece of legislation.", "I look forward to everyone participating in this debate, Mr. Speaker. Thank you." ],

Certainly I appreciate the opportunity to have met with some of the minister’s staff earlier this week for a briefing that I requested on the bill that I would have hoped might have been offered, but I had requested it and they responded and we’ve had a chance to begin the dialogue. Our caucus is very interested in Bill 109 and want to ensure that it’s thoroughly debated.", "I want to express my appreciation to the minister for his quick message of congratulations when I was appointed our party’s labour critic and his willingness to have a more comprehensive briefing, which we’re getting together to do this afternoon. So that’s forthcoming, and I appreciate that.", "But I would have to say that in neither speech did we hear any information about what this bill is going to cost. Surely there has been a comprehensive and detailed financial analysis of what impact these changes will have, particularly on WSIB premiums. As we know, employers pay the premiums, and that’s an ongoing concern of the business community. They want to make sure that they’re getting good value for their money and that the system is being administered well and fairly, but they are also interested in premiums. I know that the great work that has been done by the current chair and her management team at the WSIB has resulted in no increase in premiums in the last year or two, and that’s a good thing. But I would ask the minister in his response, or his parliamentary assistant, to explain to the House: What is the impact on premiums and/or what is going to be the impact on the unfunded liability of the WSIB as a result of Bill 109?", "Thank you, Mr. Speaker." ],

I appreciated everyone’s support for that in that discussion on protecting the victims of occupational disease.", "What I see in this bill, while some parts align, is that it’s only half of what my bill was intending to do, and I think we agreed that the spirit of that, we all were in support of.

When you look at other jurisdictions, where there are none or there are very few, people are at tremendous risk, so it’s really very important that we maintain those safe working conditions and that they move along with the different types of pressures, machinery, sites and things like that—chemicals, whatever—that increasingly become part of those safe working conditions.", "Like my colleague from Wellington–Halton Hills, I would assume that there has been some costing done of the details of implementation. Certainly the business community has to be looking at the balance between their ability to maintain and keep up with the changes and the cost pressures that those might include.

The unfunded liability of the WSIB continues to fall. We’re way ahead of schedule. We’re doing, I think, a tremendous job. That, we intend to continue. There’s nothing in these bills that would impede that in any way.", "Certainly, for the working men and women, for those people on the front lines who protect us, there’s something in this bill for everybody. It makes life a little easier for those who have been injured at work, it emphasizes the seriousness of committing an offence under these acts, and it also helps organized labour in the sense that they are able to conduct their affairs in a much more efficient manner." ],

I certainly appreciate this opportunity.", "As important as this bill is, and I believe it is a vitally important bill, I think the number one question at Queen’s Park today is who is going to be in the House at 3:37 p.m. this afternoon, when the first pitch is thrown down at the Rogers Centre, and who has baseball tickets. I have to say that I don’t have baseball tickets. I’ve received no invitations, alas. So I will be here participating this afternoon. Certainly, I wish the Blue Jays luck as they enter the playoffs. I think it’s going to be a very exciting month of October for the people of Toronto, all of Ontario, and indeed all of Canada. I know, Mr. Speaker, that really doesn’t pertain directly to Bill 109, but maybe there’s some connection there, nonetheless.", "I think that it’s important to talk about the fiscal context upon which all legislation is presented in this House because, obviously, the strength of the economy is very important to the well-being of the province and the people of the province. Certainly, the budgetary policy of the provincial government is one of the key components of economic leadership, so, again, I feel compelled to point out the fiscal context upon which Bill 109 is introduced.", "We know the government projects a deficit this year of $8.5 billion. That is, in fact, down marginally from last year, at $10.9 billion, so there has been some improvement in the deficit year over year. But, again, this is a projected deficit for the fiscal year that we’re in now, 2015-16. The fiscal year, of course, that we’re in now will end at the end of March of next year.", "It’s also important to point out that the projected provincial net debt is almost $300 billion in the province of Ontario today. It’s projected in the budget to go up to $298.9 billion. That is up dramatically from last year, year over year: $14.7 billion higher than it was last year. Last year, the net debt was expected to be $284.2 billion. So it’s a substantial—dramatic, in fact—increase in the debt, year over year.", "Provincial government spending this year is expected to be $131.9 billion. That’s up, again, year over year, up $2.4 billion. The government would lead us to believe that they’re holding the line on spending, but in fact spending is actually increasing by $2.4 billion. Last year, the spending came in at $129.5 billion.", "Another very important number is the net debt per capita. That is, in effect, the amount that each man, woman and child owes because of years and years of government overspending. The net debt per capita is $21,642. That’s up $870 from last year. Last year, the number was $20,772. That gives people a better understanding and illustration of what we owe as individuals, if you break it down. That’s just provincial debt, Mr. Speaker; that doesn’t include the national debt.", "Another important number is the debt-to-GDP ratio. Of course, that is a comparison of the provincial debt in relation to the size of our economy and the value of the goods and services that we produce. That is, of course, our gross domestic product. That ratio is 39.8%, up from 39.4% last year. Just to, again, put this number in some sort of context, before the recession in 2007-08, the debt to GDP ratio was 26.2%. Now, it’s almost 40%. This is a very worrisome trend that I think the government needs to acknowledge, and acknowledge that they’re going to take greater steps to reduce that ratio back to a more acceptable level.", "What does that mean? It means that interest payments on the debt are rising. This year we’re spending $11.4 billion on interest, up from last year. Last year, we spent $10.7 billion—" ],

  "text" : [ "I made absolutely no reference to the federal election campaign, Mr. Speaker, but apparently the member heard something else.", "The fact is, the interest payments on the debt, $11.4 billion—and maybe some of the government members are annoyed to hear this, but these are the numbers from their budget. I’m not exaggerating, As a matter of fact, they’re the government’s own numbers. The interest on the debt is the fastest-growing line item in the budget: 5.7% average annual growth out to 2017-18. So we see a financial picture that is very worrisome, and a budgetary policy that creates severe concern, certainly on the opposition benches and I think across the province.", "Certainly, workers and employers and employees, all of whom have an interest in labour law, are all concerned about this, too, Mr. Speaker, once they know the facts. We see a government that continues to engage in spending patterns that are unsustainable and unaffordable. So, yes, that is the fiscal context upon which all of the legislation that’s going to be debated today will be debated, including Bill 109.", "We see, with Bill 109, that the government is proposing to amend three specific statutes: the Fire Protection and Prevention Act, 1997; the Public Sector Labour Relations Transition Act, 1997; and the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act, 1997. There are three schedules in this bill, and they are intended to amend three acts. The bill looks like it’s 14 pages, and it is complex and detailed. Again, I think we need more clarification from the government as to what they’re proposing to do.", "For our part, as the official opposition, I would say that we support fair labour laws in the province of Ontario. We believe there needs to be a balance which respects the rights of workers and the needs of employers. We need to grow the economy and create new, good-paying jobs, and we need to strengthen Ontario’s competitiveness so that we can win in the global economy. We see, of course, with the trade negotiations that just concluded in recent days, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, that the government has participated in negotiating—the federal government, and the provinces have received some information about the details, I hope. I would hope that they will be consulted. The provincial government hopefully will have more details. Hopefully, as the details come out, we’ll have a better understanding of what has been discussed.", "I think, clearly, we have to be part of that trade negotiation, Mr. Speaker. This negotiation, which has taken place over several years, I believe, will have a significant impact on the world economy. Canada just simply couldn’t be left on the sidelines. I hope the deal is in the best interests of Ontario, in the best interests of workers, in the best interests of business and our farm community. I look forward to seeing the details, as well. But certainly we need to see more in terms of what has been decided.", "In terms of Bill 109, there’s an important component that affects the fire service in the province of Ontario. I would echo the remarks that were made by the minister in terms of his appreciation for the work that is done by our professional firefighters as well as our small-town—what we have always called the volunteer fire service. Of course, Mr. Speaker, in some cases, small communities are paying either an honorarium or an hourly wage to their part-time firefighters, as we call them. We certainly owe a huge debt of gratitude to our fire service, everyone that’s involved, and their families, too, because we know it can be a very dangerous occupation.", "Firefighters demonstrate enormous courage. They are highly trained, skilled individuals and professionals. Their courage is on display every day and they are prepared to risk their lives to keep us safe. Obviously, from our perspective as the official opposition, we support our fire service and all the individuals who are involved with them. We value what they do. We appreciate it very, very much.", "It’s my understanding, from what I’ve heard and what I’ve been told, that the changes to the Fire Protection and Prevention Act have been developed in consultation with some of our fire service, in particular, the Ontario Professional Firefighters Association. I would have to say that those recommendations in Bill 109 seem to be reasonable as they affect the fire service, from what I’ve seen so far. But I would also need to point out that the changes to the Public Sector Labour Relations Transition Act and the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act require additional public discussion. Our PC caucus has many questions, and we will be asking questions over the course of this debate. We would hope the government will respond. That’s really what debate is supposed to be all about around here. If we raise issues of concern, you would anticipate and hope that the government will address those questions during the course of the debate.", "But I also believe and anticipate that this bill will be going to a standing committee of the Legislature for public hearings. I think that would, obviously, be a necessity, allowing the groups and individuals who have ideas, concerns and suggestions to improve the bill, or if they have serious opposition to some of the provisions, that they be given an opportunity to do that.", "Of course, in the two-minute responses that we just had to the minister’s speech and his parliamentary assistant’s, my colleague from York–Simcoe and I both asked a similar question, which was, “What is this bill going to cost? What is this going to cost for the employers?” Because, of course, we know the employers pay the premiums for WSIB. Employers have an interest in that, and the employer groups, from time to time, express concerns about increasing premiums because it becomes a payroll cost. I wouldn’t say it’s a tax because the premiums are not a tax, but they are a cost to having employees.", "It’s a payroll cost that is not reflective of your profitability. What you have to pay is based to some degree on your safety record as an employer. But also there are, obviously, minimums that have to be respected. The reality is, employers have to be able to meet their payroll costs as the first order of business, I guess. Even if they are unprofitable and not making money, they still have to make those payments. These are very important concerns.", "As we know, over the years, the WSIB has had an issue with respect to its unfunded liability, meaning, there are more commitments, financial commitments and promises that have been made than there is a plan for money to come in the door to pay for them. I know, again, the current WSIB chair, Elizabeth Witmer, our former deputy leader and former colleague here in the Legislature, has done an outstanding job of addressing many of these concerns, working with employers and employees to address the concerns with respect to unfunded liability. Obviously, the injured workers have an interest in the unfunded liability as well, because if there isn’t enough money to pay for the pensions or for their benefits, then where is the money going to come from? They obviously share that concern and should.", "I would also say that the WSIB has made significant improvement in its unfunded liability, and it’s going in the right direction. I believe they have a long-term plan to reduce it—to eliminate it. I don’t have the details in front of me—the actual numbers—but from what I’ve read and heard, they are making good progress, and they deserve acknowledgment for that.", "That comes back to the basic question that we asked during the questions and comments: What is this going to cost? These changes to WSIB: What are those going to cost in terms of premiums or in terms of upward pressure on the unfunded liability? Again, valid questions—I think they’re valid. I would anticipate and expect that there has been a comprehensive financial analysis done. The government has yet to table it. We would ask them to do so. It has to come out at some point. I would hope that, during the course of debate, subsequent government speakers will address that question. If they don’t, we’re going to keep asking.", "Bill 109: schedule 1, the Fire Protection and Prevention Act, 1997, amendments. Bill 109 incorporates significant portions of the Labour Relations Act into the Fire Protection and Prevention Act, including unfair labour practices, membership in associations and expedited rights to arbitration. The bill will permit associations to require the inclusion of closed-shop language in a collective agreement, with features such as mandatory association dues, deductions and provisions requiring membership in the association, or giving preference of employment to members of an association.", "We understand that these powers are to be balanced by rights for the firefighters as well. For example, expelled or suspended members or those who have been denied membership in an association will be protected on certain grounds, such as in the case of reasonable dissent. This is a key issue for many small-town fire services, Mr. Speaker, because we have been informed that in some cases, this will allow double-hatters to continue their volunteer work without fear of reprisal.", "Bill 109 will also allow labour disputes, under this act, to be heard by the Ontario Labour Relations Board as opposed to an Ontario court. Of course, if the disputes don’t have to go to court, that frees up some of the court resources for other cases. Hopefully, it can be dealt with by more specifically trained labour relations hearings officers, who are more expert in labour relations law—and deal with these disputes in a more expeditious way, too, I would hope.", "Under Bill 109, firefighters will be able to opt out of union membership or even paying union dues if being a member conflicts with their religious beliefs. I am told the changes found in schedule 1 in some cases will apply retroactively.", "What we have been told is that this particular schedule incorporates the spirit, I guess, of the Labour Relations Act into the Fire Protection and Prevention Act, 1997. So some of the provisions of the Labour Relations Act and the spirit of it are reflected in the firefighters’ legislation.", "In 2002, a fire chief in my riding came into my constituency office to inform me about a concern that he had. It was with respect to something that he called double-hatters. Double-hatters are full-time professional firefighters who work for a full-time department, typically in the city, but who may live in a small town nearby. On their days off, they want to volunteer their skills and services to their small-town fire service in their home community. In some cases back in March 2002, we were told that the Ontario professional firefighters’ union was telling its members that they had to quit as volunteers or part-time firefighters in their home communities, and if they didn’t, they might be kicked out of their association or union; and if they were kicked out of their union, the collective agreement would place in jeopardy their full-time positions.", "I took this issue up, researched it thoroughly and brought a bill into the Legislature, Bill 30, to protect the right of small-town double-hatter firefighters to continue to serve in their home communities as well as in their full-time professional job in the city that they might commute to. This became a very controversial private member’s bill.", "In the end, we had extensive debate. I asked the legislative library to look into it. They told me that there were more hours of debate on this Bill 30 than any other private member’s bill in the history of the province of Ontario; they went back as far as 1950 and then they stopped looking. So I think it’s fair to say that this bill received more hours of debate than any other private member’s bill in the history of the province.", "Again, this was 13 years ago, but I remember it well. Our party was in government. In the end, I insisted on a third reading vote, and the government of the day allowed that to take place. The bill was defeated at third reading, but I was encouraged by the support of two thirds of our caucus at that time who were present in the House and voted for it—but one third voted against it. On the opposition side, of course, the New Democrats voted against it. The Liberals, in opposition at that time, most of them voted against it, but they were whipped. I know that for a fact: They were whipped to vote against it. I believe three of their members decided to support it, one of whom is here today, and I appreciate that very much, the support that he gave the bill at that time.", "I have always said I would continue to stand up for the rights of double-hatters to continue to serve their home communities as firefighters, and I have always done that. We’ve raised this in the House from time to time when we know there’s an issue, but the fact is, it’s my understanding that this Bill 109 is an attempt to provide a legislated solution to protect two-hatters, in some cases. I would have to say I express appreciation to the government for bringing this forward. If this is indeed the solution that we were seeking in 2002, we’ve waited 13 years to get it and obviously I very much appreciate it.", "There were extensive public hearings on Bill 30, as well. Again, this goes back 13 years. I do want to make reference to comments at the hearings by the fire marshal of Ontario. Because, of course, my Bill 30 was supported by the firefighters of Ontario, which are the volunteer firefighters in the province—essentially the small-town and rural firefighters. We heard from the parliamentary assistant, the member for Eglinton–Lawrence, that there are approximately—I think he said 19,000 part-time or volunteer firefighters in the province of Ontario and I think he said 11,000 professional or full-time firefighters.", "The fact is, my bill was supported by the Fire Fighters’ Association of Ontario, which is the volunteer fire service; the Association of Municipalities of Ontario, or AMO, which was expressing support for my bill; and the fire chiefs association of Ontario, representing all the fire chiefs across the province, including the big-city ones. Those stakeholders were supportive of the bill.", "I think it’s also important to point out, though, that the fire marshal of Ontario at the time, Bernard Moyle, who was the senior fire official in the province working within the Ministry of the Solicitor General at the time, came to committee, expressed support for my bill and suggested that it was needed.", "Here is what he said at committee. This was the justice committee on 21 October, 2002. He said:", "“In most full-time and composite fire departments, career firefighters are represented by local associations that are affiliated with both the Ontario Professional Fire Fighters Association and the International Association of Fire Fighters. The constitutions of both of these organizations prohibit career firefighters serving as volunteer firefighters. As a result, the OPFFA has periodically directed that members stop two-hatting or be charged under their constitution, which could result in being expelled from the association.", "“Expelling two-hatters is problematic because many fire service collective agreements in Ontario require their members to maintain membership in the firefighters’ associations as a condition of full-time employment. This common stipulation means that a full-time firefighter found guilty of a breach of the association’s constitution and bylaws could have their membership revoked and consequently be ineligible to continue their full-time employment. Understandably, career firefighters who are serving as volunteer or part-time firefighters would be under considerable pressure to resign if their full-time career was put at risk.", "“The conflict between the practice of two-hatting and the association’s constitutional provisions is producing tension and instability in Ontario’s fire protection delivery system. My office was officially notified of a potentially serious situation involving two-hatters by the chief of the Hamilton fire department on February 8, 2002. In addition to the letter from the city of Hamilton, a number of other letters and inquiries on this subject were received indicating that some career firefighters were receiving letters from their association requesting proof of resignation from their part-time employment within 30 days.", "“Information received by my office indicated that the scope of the IAFF”—again, that’s the International Association of Fire Fighters—“activity was not limited to Ontario but was also occurring in some areas of the United States. As a result, I established an internal working group to examine the issue of two-hatting and to determine whether there was a public safety concern arising from the OPFFA’s increased activity to enforce its constitutional provisions against its members who were two-hatting.", "“Under the Fire Protection and Prevention Act, the fire marshal has discretionary power to review and monitor municipal fire protection services to determine if they meet the mandatory requirements of the FPPA and if a serious threat to public safety exists. This was the authority we used to constitute the working group to review the two-hatter issue. Because of the scope and nature of this issue, my office proceeded under the potential serious threat section of the FPPA to review the impact of the OPFFA initiatives to enforce their constitution.", "“The” Ontario fire marshal’s “concern was that these actions had the potential to result in a sudden withdrawal of the services of two-hatters throughout the province. The right-to-work issue is not part of the mandate of the OFM and was not addressed in our analysis of the situation. In fact public safety was, and continues to be, the OFM’s single focus in this matter.", "“I would like to now review the steps taken by my office in attempting to reach a non-legislated solution.”", "The fire marshal went on, “A brief meeting was held with representatives of the Ontario Association of Fire Chiefs and the Ontario Professional Fire Fighters Association in mid-February 2002”—again, this meeting took place about a month before I was informed of the issue—“to informally discuss the issue. At that time, the OFM committed to working with affected stakeholder groups to determine if there was any common ground that could be used to arrive at a sustainable solution to the problem. The OPFFA and the OAFC”—that’s the chiefs’ association—“agreed to work with the OFM”—the fire marshal—“and other stakeholders. Moreover, the OPFFA agreed not to aggressively pursue charging their members until such time as the matter had been reviewed and discussed with the stakeholders. They also committed not to take any action that would jeopardize public safety.", "“A draft discussion paper was prepared by the OFM working group and distributed to the stakeholders for review and comment. The paper concluded that there was no immediate threat to public safety at this time, but a sudden or widespread withdrawal of two-hatter services would have varying degrees of repercussions to municipalities, up to and including a potential serious threat.", "“Formal individual discussions were then initiated to obtain the positions of the following stakeholders: the Fire Fighters Association of Ontario”—that is the volunteer fire service association—“the Ontario Professional Fire Fighters Association; the International Association of Fire Fighters; the Ontario Association of Fire Chiefs; and the Association of Municipalities of Ontario. The first meeting was held with representatives of the OPFFA and the IAFF on May 14, 2002.", "“On May 22, 2002,” the fire marshal went on, “MPP Ted Arnott introduced a private member’s bill, Bill 30. We now had the consultation process as well as a proposed legislated solution on the table.", "“The consultation process continued, and the first joint stakeholder meeting was held on August 1, 2002, to determine whether a non-legislated solution could be found. Several ideas were discussed and proposals put forth, one by the Ontario Association of Fire Chiefs which involved grandfathering existing two-hatters, and another by the OPFFA which involved the phasing out of two-hatters in a manner that would not jeopardize public safety. At the request of AMO, the parties were requested to provide more detail on their proposals.", "“The proposals were sent to all the stakeholders for review and comment. In response to these proposals, both the FFAO and AMO advised my office that they could not support the proposals and were supporting a legislated solution.", "“During the discussions, it was apparent that no mechanism existed to allow any of the parties to bind their membership to any agreement that may have been arrived at by the parties. For example, AMO could not bind municipalities”—it didn’t have the power to bind municipalities—“to an agreement reached with the OPFFA, nor could the OPFFA guarantee that their locals or individual members would adhere to an agreement. Certainly, all were in a position to influence their membership.” But they couldn’t compel them to agree.", "“Moreover, the parties appeared to be polarized in their positions related to phasing out two-hatters. For example, the FFAO, AMO and the OAFC do not support the phasing out of career firefighters who serve as volunteer part-time firefighters, which is the position of the OPFFA. There simply was no common ground for agreement on a non-legislated solution.", "“For the reasons stated above, it is our opinion that an enforceable and sustainable non-legislated solution to the two-hatter issue is not achievable.", "“In a letter distributed to members of the OPFFA on October 1, 2002, by Mr. Fred LeBlanc, president of the association, the moratorium on secondary employment charges was lifted, which could significantly increase the activity by the OPFFA membership and potentially impact on public safety.", "“It is my understanding that the OPFFA committed to the moratorium as long as constructive dialogue was taking place. This is no longer the case,” the fire marshal said at the committee, “so the moratorium was lifted. This is not intended as a criticism of the OPFFA, as they have a legal right to enforce their constitution. However, the lifting of the moratorium by the OPFFA will likely exacerbate the existing tension and uncertainty in both the fire service and municipal communities, and it is unclear to what extent and degree this action will impact on existing two-hatters.", "“The sudden or phased withdrawal of two-hatters from communities dependent on volunteer fire departments could significantly impact on their ability to provide an adequate level of fire protection and may in some cases pose a potential serious threat to public safety for the following reasons.", "“There would be a loss of experience, leadership and expertise in some communities. In fact, for that very reason, even a single two-hatter can make a significant difference in a small rural community. For example, some two-hatters serve as senior officers and captains and have fire prevention and training responsibilities, which are key functions in any fire department.", "“There may be a reduced capacity for providing adequate emergency responses during weekdays, when two-hatters are more readily available due to their shift schedules.", "“Increased response times may occur, at least until replacements can be recruited and adequately trained, if in fact replacements are available within the community. There may be an increased time in which to assemble an adequate fire attack team and a potential short-term reduction in fire ground effectiveness, resulting in greater fire losses.", "“The time required to recruit and train full-time, part-time or volunteer firefighters can be expensive, creating short-term delivery difficulties. In some communities there may not be a pool of potential candidates available to become volunteer firefighters and a community may not be able to afford hiring full-time firefighters, creating a potential public safety issue.", "“In a number of communities that have a heavy reliance on two-hatters, the sudden withdrawal of their services could create a potential serious threat to public safety.", "“In conclusion,” he said, “there is a provincial and public interest in protecting two-hatters who wish to serve as volunteer firefighters. We do not believe that a non-legislated solution is achievable or enforceable. As a result, without a legislated solution, the existing tensions and uncertainty in the fire service community will continue, and the high potential for two-hatters to resign as a result of OPFFA constitutional enforcement activities could well result in significant public safety concerns arising. It is my understanding that such protection is not uncommon in most jurisdictions in Canada and in the United States.", "“In closing, my office recognizes the importance of balancing interests where possible, but supports first and foremost the need to develop a legislated solution that clearly protects the interests of public safety. It is important that career firefighters who wish to serve as part-time or volunteer firefighters in their home communities are permitted to do so without fear of loss of employment.”", "Mr. Speaker, thank you for allowing me to read those comments from the standing committee on justice by the fire marshal of Ontario of the day, Bernard Moyle, explaining why he supported my Bill 30.", "I realize we’re getting very close to the time. Maybe this is a good time to let you pause now and recess the House so that we can resume this debate later on. I still have about half of my time." ],

I could have reiterated many of the points that I made in my second reading speech on Bill 30 in 2002, or my third reading speech on Bill 30 that I presented to this House, which took place, I believe, in December 2002. But I thought it was probably most helpful to take the words of the foremost expert in the fire service in the province of Ontario—the senior fire official in the province of Ontario of the day, the fire marshal—and allow his words to be brought into this debate today to indicate why we do need to support our two-hatter firefighters and ensure that they can continue.", "Over the course of this debate there will be more questions, but again, if indeed this Bill 109 provides protection for two-hatter firefighters, that’s a good thing for public safety in small-town Ontario, Mr. Speaker, and I would have to commend the government. It has been 13 years since I introduced my bill, and it’s pretty exciting if indeed the day has finally come when we are going to provide the legislative protection that the fire marshal argued was necessary in 2002 and that was encompassed in my Bill 30. If that day is finally here, then it’s a good day for public safety in rural Ontario." ],

  "text" : [ "I rise in the House today to open debate on Bill 96, An Act to amend the Election Finances Act with respect to third party election advertising. If you are a voter in Ontario who believes in free speech, a level playing field and an open and transparent political process, I’m confident that you will welcome what you are about to hear.", "I’d like to begin today by telling you that I alongside my PC caucus colleagues have a collective desire to see more citizen participation in democracy. We believe that elections must be fair, where everyone gets a fair shot. This is our commitment. But Ontario’s election laws offer no such guarantee today. What we see today is that the rules are not working very well.", "The principle of fairness is paramount and fundamental to engaging everyone in our democratic process. As such, my party has been raising this issue of fairness for years. We previously tabled a bill in this House, Bill 101, to provide a guarantee that everyone plays by the same rules, and that anyone, regardless of their financial status, is able to participate on an equal basis.", "Even though our proposal fell on deaf ears and was ignored by this government, its principle was supported in the last two reports issued by Ontario’s Chief Electoral Officer, Greg Essensa, as one of his top priorities. Now, Mr. Essensa, too, is calling on the government to make elections fairer by capping third-party advertising. I think his findings are important, as they speak to the serious trouble brewing in our election process.", "Just look at the evidence from our elections watchdog. In the 2007 election, $1.8 million was spent on third-party advertising, in 2011, $6 million; and in our most recent 2014 election, $8.6 million, a jump of 400% or a tripling since 2007. And none of these expenses include such things as Web-based campaign videos, telephone town halls or demon dialers.", "At the same time, voter turnout has been falling steadily too. Ontario used to enjoy a 65% voter turnout, but then, by the 2003 election, a 57% turnout; in the 2007 election, a 52% turnout; and in the 2011 election, a 48% turnout. The 2014 election saw a record high number of spoiled ballots; 31,399 Ontarians declined their votes in the last election, the highest rejection level since 1975. The largest protest votes hit the ridings of Brant, Etobicoke Centre, Kitchener–Waterloo, London West, Mississauga–Erindale, Oak Ridges–Markham, Ottawa South, St. Catharines, Windsor West and Thunder Bay–Atikokan.", "These patterns are alarming. In my opinion, it is unacceptable. I could have chosen to sit by and idly complain, or I could step up and try to right the situation. I choose to take action.", "I also believe we have a shared responsibility in fixing special interest spending and interference in elections, and re-engaging voters by putting a stop to that old adage of “No matter who you vote for, money always wins.” While self-serving political messages are part of our democratic system, the amount of money available to be spent nevertheless has to be capped, so that everyone is on a level playing field, regardless of how deep or not deep their pockets are.", "I am a prime example. I was raised in a small village, from a family of very, very modest means. I wanted to serve the people, and I gave up a very good-paying job with a full pension to run in the great riding of Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound. I did so with much risk, with no guarantees of winning or how long I might be given the privilege of serving as the people’s representative. And I did so with the understanding that I had a set amount of money I could spend during a campaign to try to win the seat, and an expectation that anyone who would compete against me would have to play by the same rules.", "If I had known a third-party group with virtually no limits and/or accountability or consequence could outspend me, at minimum 10 times, I’m not certain I would be here today. I have a concern that if this situation is not corrected, it might severely restrict who might run for office in the future. This could have profound consequences for the foundation of our democratic process in the future, not to mention the impact of a party that has basically unfettered opposition or recourse as a result of undue influence of unelected people and resources. Being able to buy your way to office is simply not the Canadian way. If democracy for the people and by the people is to remain functional and true in future, realistic spending limits must be put in place. If not, then the system can and will be skewed by those who have the most money.", "In the last election of 2014, the groups with the most money in the bag had the most influence over voters and election outcome. This influence was bought for $8.6 million, which is the total amount of money that special interest groups spent on partisan advertising during that 41-day writ period. There is no telling how high this influence will fly in the next or future elections when our laws don’t enforce caps on third-party spending. We do know that special interest funding will keep going up.", "As I mentioned earlier, third-party advertising spending has gone up by 400% since 2007, according to Elections Ontario. This means that unless we limit it, any special interest group, anyone with millions to spend, can and will try to buy an election and make it harder for everyone else to vote with their conscience. Subjecting voters’ opinions via an orchestrated, multi-million dollar attack campaign from special interest groups is, frankly, an affront to fair and free elections.", "This is precisely why I’m tabling this bill today to amend the Election Finances Act to make sure any special interest group’s election advertising is capped at $150,000 per election cycle, or $3,000 per riding, to reflect the federal rules and caps in other provinces and to reflect what a candidate is currently able to spend. To make the rules meaningful, I’m proposing that any groups found in contravention be deregistered from the next general election. If there is no consequence, those who wish to influence the outcome will continue to pour money in to ensure victory for their desired candidate or party.", "This proposal will ensure everyone plays fair in Ontario elections. As a PC MPP, I acknowledge that the current rules allowed any number of special interest groups to run negative campaigns during the election. It is not my intent to take away their right to participate, but to defend the right of everyone to do so on an even playing field, and for the voting public to expect, and accept, nothing less.", "I believe the amendments I’m proposing would protect free speech in Ontario elections, the very essence of our democracy. Most importantly, the proposal is in line with the recommendations from our election watchdog, Mr. Essensa, and what I hear from the general electorate. No one is accepting of an unfair balance in regard to open democracy. It would be my sincere hope that the Liberal government of the day and members of the New Democratic Party agree—and I suggest any reputable third-party group would not disagree—that an election needs to be open, transparent and fair.", "Now, I know the government has mused about reviewing advertising rules, but given last spring’s discreet announcement about changes to government advertising rules, I question their motive. Instead of tightening controls on the ability of the government to use public money for what is, in effect, partisan advocacy, this government is taking away the Auditor General’s power to vet their ads, which will allow them to use taxpayers’ dollars to pay for campaign advertising. Again, there must be accountability or there will be abuse." ],

It probably is an attack on that particular agency—although there are hundreds of individuals and groups who actually do third-party advertising during campaigns. The Working Families Coalition certainly is known for having been pretty hard on the Conservatives and their former leader in the last election, so that may be part of the reason for this bill.", "On the flip side, I just want to remind people of Bill 74. That was a bill that sought to help one singular company, EllisDon, a $2-billion-a-year company. I remind members that that bill was buried in an omnibus government bill at the time. The government was trying to fast-track it through the Legislature without full scrutiny or debate. It was a scheme between the Liberals and the PCs, at the time. Here we have one company that’s an enormous contributor to the economy in Ontario but certainly doesn’t need the help of this Legislature to increase their profit margin.", "There’s a long history of governments using taxpayers’ money to promote themselves during periods outside of campaigns and leading up to campaigns. The Harper government is cited as spending $7.5 million in ads promoting his economic action plan. Mike Harris’s government previously used hard-earned taxpayers’ dollars all the time, touting his own policies. Even when it wasn’t around legislation that was passed, he touted health care ideas, how to make government smaller and be “less taxing for all of us.” But what he didn’t tell us at the time was what the government cuts were going to be, how many hospitals beds he was going to close, and how many cities, towns and villages were going to lose their identity through mergers and amalgamations.", "On the other side of the House—the Liberal government’s paid advertising—similar questions are as important. In this spring’s budget, the Liberal government made significant changes to the advertising rules. The legislation, again, was buried in a massive budget bill and was fast-tracked, and the taxpayers, who pay the freight for this advertising, didn’t have any say in it.", "The Auditor General’s office calls these new criteria that were passed “a very narrow and limited definition of what constitutes partisan advertising.” I think the government is still doing partisan advertising under this new legislation. The Auditor General said it was actually a fatal blow to the law. It restricts the Auditor General from actually being able to consider factors that they had in the past, like political context, the use of self-congratulatory messages, factual accuracy and an advertisement’s criticisms of other political parties. She warned about the government using taxpayer dollars for partisan purposes.", "If we’re going to be drawing parallels, third parties are individuals or groups who actually spend dollars on advertising, but they’re spending their own dollars, unlike governments of the past—the Tories and the Liberals—who have spent taxpayers’ dollars for their own interests. We’ve seen this recently, this summer. The minister of—I can’t remember what her title is, but it was with respect to the ORPP. There was tons of advertising: taxpayers’ dollars used in a partisan way to advertise the ORPP. If that isn’t promoting partisan self-interest, I don’t know what is.", "Ultimately, New Democrats support a review of the Election Finances Act, but we would like to see a more nuanced and honest conversation about how to get to a fairer place with it." ],

Perhaps by coincidence, we’re dealing right now with a bill that’s called anti-SLAPP legislation. It’s a bill to prevent strategic lawsuits against public participation. In other words, if someone wants to speak out against a development or something going on out there—against someone who has deep pockets—what happens sometimes is that you speak out against it and that company decides to sue the person complaining: “You are trying to slander me. I’m going to sue you for $2 million or $3 million.” We went through that whole exercise recently, and what we saw was that there were people out there who suffer from this, and we’re correcting that.", "Again, I think what this member is trying to do would be the opposite: to create SLAPP legislation. Right now, we’re trying to limit the expenses of a third party. But imagine, next election, if a group comes out and is, let’s say, opposed to the changes in the sex education curriculum.

We don’t know: There could be another third party somewhere else that wants to get involved in the campaign and wants to advertise in the campaign. Should we shut them up too and say, “You can only spend so much money”?", "Here, we’re talking about one particular group that the member is basically trying to target today, but there are all sorts of other groups out there too that may want to speak in the future. It could be any group that wants to say something, and they would be limited to only spending a certain amount of money.", "I think this bill is really dangerous, in the fact that it limits third parties from getting involved in the democratic process, in advertising. As mentioned as well earlier from the previous member that just spoke, there may be other groups that want to get out there and speak, and to limit them to a certain financial amount is not really the right thing to do.", "Our party, the government, introduced or announced in June and in the 2015 budget that we’ll be strengthening Ontario’s rules on third-party advertising. We have committed to addressing the recommendations from the Chief Electoral Officer’s report on the 2014 general election. We will be moving ahead with these additional items. So it’s not buried away in some budget document; we are proceeding and we are committed to make the necessary changes regarding third-party advertising.", "We have rules in place already in the Election Finances Act which control third parties and make them register how much they spent and report that to the Chief Electoral Officer. We have stuff in place that will work. In my opinion, I think that this goes much too far the opposite way and creates an obstacle to freedom of expression and to allow people or groups to express their point of view. There could be many other ones out there that want to come out and speak on a certain matter.", "We’re all trying to enhance the integrity of the election finance system while at the same time protecting the public interest. What we can’t do is implement changes or restrictions that prevent people from speaking up as they choose. I think that captures a wider range of advertising than any definition that captures issue advertising elsewhere in Canada.", "Instead of regulating advertising that takes a position on an issue with a registered partner candidate, as has been the norm in other Canadian jurisdictions, this would mean that any advertising on any issue which the House is seized with would be regulated. I cannot stress enough how that would affect future groups that may want to get involved. Three years down the line, another group may come out and decide, “We want to spend so much money on a particular issue that’s of concern to us.” They may want to criticize us. They may want to compliment us, the government. They may want to compliment the opposition or they may want to compliment the third party, and say, “We’re going to support the position that’s taken by the opposition. We want them to get elected so we’re going to advertise on their behalf.”", "So I think we need to take a really sober look at this whole issue because it’s quite important to allow people, groups or organizations to speak at will in this province and across Canada." ],

How is that appropriate, to diminish our democracy?", "The Liberals voted against transparency in 2011 when the member for Wellington–Halton Hills put forward a bill to limit third-party collusion. They also voted against transparency when the member for Chatham–Kent–Essex put forward a similar proposal in 2013.", "The government already plays fast and loose with the rules when it comes to taxpayer-funded government ads.

We’ve heard the numbers and they are concerning. Between 2007 and 2011, the amount spent by special interest groups on advertising tripled to $6.7 million, and by 2014 that amount jumped to $8.6 million—money that is used to blur the lines and create uneven playing fields for what are supposed to be fair and democratic elections.", "Speaker, closer to my home, I think of the September 2012 Ontario by-election, when third-party interest groups spent nearly $1 million on advertising—almost four times more than the political party which eventually emerged victorious in Kitchener–Waterloo. These groups included well-known unions like the Elementary Teachers’ Federation of Ontario, which spent $846,000, according to returns filed with Elections Ontario in April.", "The fact is that third parties could have spent a virtually unlimited amount of money during by-elections or any other campaign because Ontario’s election laws do nothing to restrict interest groups in the same way as they restrict spending by political parties and candidates. This advantages deep-pocketed groups with political opinions and runs counter to democratic principles of fairness. We see that to the south, in essence, using Super PACs, America’s independent political action committees, which can spend an unlimited amount of money, so long as they do not donate to a political candidate.", "Again, Speaker, the concern remains that when we have Super PAC-like groups forming to promote one candidate or one party over another, it unfairly tilts the playing field, creating political advantages that, as far as I have been taught, are not the Ontario way.", "I know my colleague from Nipissing will finish up our last three minutes.

  "text" : [ "Thank you, Speaker. Since I was elected in 2011, I have made it my priority to speak for the municipalities I represent. Having served as a municipal councillor, I know that municipalities need to build, maintain and manage their infrastructure. They know what they need and when they need it. They know they are accountable to their residents. They expect the province to be a partner. They know that provincial dollars are limited, but they expect them to be invested fairly. They expect a transparent process, one that respects their staff time and their budget. Finally, they expect the process to be untainted by politics because no riding, no municipality and no taxpayer should ever be punished for their voting history or the political stripe of their MPP. These principles underpin my resolution. They should not be controversial, and that’s why I’m asking for all-party support.", "It’s regrettable, Mr. Speaker, that this debate is even necessary. It’s necessary because municipalities’ expectations of fairness are too often not being met. In my time today I will show examples. I will also mention some feedback that this resolution has received. No doubt the government will say, “We’ve invested so many dollars in Perth–Wellington and so many dollars in other opposition ridings. Doesn’t that show our generosity?” It will do no such thing. What matters is how people actually perceive this government and the way it operates when it comes to infrastructure and how it interacts with municipalities.", "In opposition, we can’t control the way they operate. All I can do is speak for the people I represent, making sure the government knows our needs and priorities. I’ve always sought to do so in a spirit of co-operation, working across the aisle because, at the end of the day, my constituents expect to see results.", "That’s why, on the day after the last election, I wrote to Premier Wynne saying, “I want to work with you on the priorities that matter to the people of Perth–Wellington. I intend to be constructive but persistent in speaking up for them.”", "I went on to identify some of the issues around our riding, including infrastructure, but this government rarely responds in kind. It rarely responds with constructive action. It rarely responds in a spirit of non-partisanship, and it’s a problem not unique to my riding.", "Just look next door at Huron–Bruce, a riding well represented by Lisa Thompson. Look at the Liberals’ decision to scrap the Kincardine hospital redevelopment. It’s obvious that it was needed and the government agreed when they approved it, but then they backed away when the former Liberal MPP was defeated and the electoral advantage of the project disappeared.", "Our leader, Patrick Brown, called it a “scandal of political partisanship and opportunism,” and he’s right. That’s why my resolution stresses the need for equal and transparent consideration in funding decisions. They promise billions for new infrastructure in Liberal ridings, even as they changed or scrapped the programs we rely on in rural Ontario, all without consultation.", "They’re selling off Hydro One, primarily affecting opposition ridings, to finance their expensive promises to their own ridings—again without consultation.", "Their funding priorities seem to change depending on where you live. The Waterloo region LRT is partially funded, while Hamilton’s LRT is fully funded. They scrapped the Connecting Link Program, which they finally promised to bring back, but with little details and at a fraction of what it used to be.", "OMPF funding is another example affecting nearly every municipality I represent. They’re squeezing municipalities, with no consultation, based on inaccurate information. They do it because they can get away with it. After all, we’re just opposition ridings.", "I also want to address the theme of transparency in this resolution. Here’s what Gary McNamara, the president of AMO, had to say: “Getting infrastructure funding is as unpredictable as winning the lottery. The status quo is not acceptable. We need a new arrangement.”", "I want to recount an experience from the county of Wellington, which I represent. In January, the government asked the county why they didn’t apply to the Small Communities Fund. Their response reads in part, “Wellington county has provided an expression of interest to the province on three prior application processes ... and were not successful in passing the initial ‘screening’ test.”", "It continues: “Putting together these applications requires significant staff resources. If our economic conditions and fiscal situation are going to preclude the county from being successful in future grant applications, we would appreciate the province letting us know this up front so that we can avoid wasting future staff resources and scarce municipal tax dollars in a fruitless fishing expedition in which we very well know that our chances for success are minuscule at best.”", "We hear this time and time again. The government sets up an infrastructure program severely, perhaps deliberately, lacking transparency. They compel municipal staff to waste countless hours jumping through hoops to apply for funding.", "Other municipalities have resorted to hiring professional consulting firms. These are small municipalities that don’t have tens of thousands of dollars to spend on consultants to fill out forms for funding they will probably never see. Others have even suggested hiring lobbyists to get their government’s attention.", "For years, we’ve told the government to fix the process. They haven’t done it. Instead, they play partisan games.", "In March, for instance, the Deputy Premier came to Perth–Wellington to meet with the mayors in our riding. Understandably, they wanted to discuss infrastructure. They wanted to know why the Liberals cancelled the Connecting Link Program, something the Deputy Premier apparently knew nothing about. They wanted to know why the province was starving them of OMPF funding without the promised offsets.", "Who organized and attended these meetings? Not the Deputy Premier’s staff—that job went to the unelected, former Liberal candidate, to whom the Minister of Agriculture must have given the day off.", "I later wrote to the Deputy Premier to reiterate the municipalities’ concerns, which I have been raising for a very long time. Of course, the Deputy Premier didn’t respond. But here’s the worst part: When the media asked the Deputy Premier about her meeting with the mayors, she said, “I just wanted to connect with them and hear what is top of mind for advice for the province. They had a lot of advice,” she chuckled. “We had a really good meeting,” she went on to say, and, “If John [Wilkinson] was still MPP here he would have a chance to have meetings like that.”", "I spoke to participants, and they couldn’t believe it. They were also surprised that she would invite the unelected Liberal candidate to the meeting, but not the elected MPP. When the Deputy Premier, with the former candidate, on the taxpayers’ dime, meets with elected mayors to discuss infrastructure, and when she says, in effect, that she would include a Liberal MPP but ignore an opposition MPP, she reveals her government’s true attitude. She confirms every suspicion that this government is playing partisan games with infrastructure. She confirms that this government is treating public money as Liberal money. She confirms that this government would be so partisan, they would actually punish municipalities in opposition ridings. That is shameful, Mr. Speaker, absolutely shameful.", "I want to move on to the final part of my resolution, that all MPPs be given fair and equal advance notice of funding announcements. This isn’t happening. Instead, the Liberals from nearby ridings are traipsing into opposition ridings to announce funding. In August, the member for Cambridge, PA to the Minister of Transportation, announced social service funding for my riding. The news release came not from the ministry, but from the constituency office in Cambridge. The office of the Minister of Community and Social Services told us, “We just give a bit of a heads-up to our members to share the good news.”", "In November of last year, the government didn’t even use an MPP. They went straight back to their unelected former Liberal candidate to announce public money. They were content to have the elected MPPs read about it in the paper.", "In Simcoe–Grey, the member was told he could not speak at an infrastructure announcement in his own riding. Instead, they sent a Liberal to take credit. Games like these reinforce the perception—" ],

What’s interesting is what people are saying off the record. One mayor, who asked to remain unnamed, said this: “I fully support your efforts and agree a per capita formula is more transparent and avoids the politics of government versus opposition members.”", "Another municipal representative said this: “I hope you’ll understand that we do have a few things ongoing with the province and don’t want to jeopardize this dialogue at the present time.” It’s a real shame that any municipal councillor, standing up for their constituents, would feel constrained from speaking publicly about this matter.", "To conclude, Mr. Speaker, this resolution is a first step to correct perception, often the reality, that this government is punishing opposition ridings for voters’ democratic choices." ],

I understand where he’s coming from.", "I recall the results of the last election. The Liberals held the one seat in London but were shut out in the rest of southwestern Ontario. It was a stunning defeat. The cabinet minister who represented Windsor West lost to Ms. Gretzky of the NDP. Within hours, the media asked the Premier what that would mean for the good people in Windsor and Essex county. The Premier didn’t bat an eye. She said that she wouldn’t forget about Windsor. She said that she wouldn’t forget about any part of Ontario where the Liberals no longer held a seat. She said that she was going to be the Premier for all of Ontario, not just for those ridings where the Liberals manage to get elected or re-elected.", "Let’s look at the wording in this motion. The member for Perth–Wellington—by the way, Speaker, Mr. Pettapiece’s roots run deep in Essex county; I think he’s related to half the people I know in the town of Kingsville—Mr. Pettapiece says: “That, in the opinion of this House, the government should guarantee that government-held ridings and opposition-held ridings be given equal and transparent consideration on infrastructure funding, and that when funding decisions are made,” and an announcement is planned within the riding, the government “should guarantee that all MPPs, whether in government or opposition, be given fair and equal notice of the official announcement.”", "The way I read the second part of the motion is that if a minister or parliamentary assistant is coming into an opposition-held riding to make a funding announcement, the opposition member holding that riding be given ample notice of the time and place of the announcement. Speaker, as a further courtesy, the opposition member would actually be invited to attend the ceremony or event when the announcement is being made. That’s pretty straightforward—at least to me.", "How many times have we, in this chamber, heard the Premier, her cabinet colleagues and the other members of the party say, “We are open and transparent in all that we do”? I would suggest that if you are open and transparent, or wish to be perceived as being open and transparent, then you have no choice but to vote in favour of this motion put forward by the good member from Perth–Wellington.", "Let me turn my attention now to the first part of the motion, “equal and transparent consideration on infrastructure funding.” In my part of the province, in the county of Essex and the city of Windsor, the perception remains that we’re not getting our fair share when it comes to the recent distribution of infrastructure funding. I’m not talking about the massive highway project that is nearing completion, leading to a proposed new international border crossing; I’m speaking of the requests that have gone in for funding assistance on smaller projects: an ultra-high-speed fibre optics network, better highway connections, expansion work on bridges, funding for an approved transit system, investments in social housing and the like.", "The president of the Association of Municipalities of Ontario, my friend Gary McNamara, is also the mayor of Tecumseh. He runs a tight ship, but believes his local community is being penalized for keeping its books in good shape while government grants are going to places where they’re not as good at balancing the books. AMO has long called for predictable and sustainable funding on a per capita basis.", "The mayor of LaSalle, my friend Ken Antaya, feels the same way. LaSalle, which is in Mr. Natyshak’s riding of Essex, has applied for 11 infrastructure grants in the past three years and has received only one.", "The Essex county warden, my friend Tom Bain, is also the mayor of Lakeshore, which is also in the riding of Essex. The county recently passed a unanimous motion of support for a more equitable system of distributing infrastructure funding from the government. They said it would be done in a fair and non-partisan way. They agreed with the member from Perth–Wellington—equal and transparent funding. Is that too much to ask for?", "Speaker, you know as well as I and the rest of us that when it comes to money collected for tax purposes in Ontario from all three orders of government, municipal taxes account for just 9% of the total. The province and the feds get the lion’s share of the tax money that comes out of your pocket. You may be surprised to know, as will the Toronto-centric members, I’m sure, that of the 444 municipalities in Ontario, half of them have to raise taxes if they need as little as $50,000 for an infrastructure project. Our smaller municipalities need financial help from the senior orders of government when it comes to infrastructure. Governments shouldn’t be playing favourites.", "There’s no excuse for not inviting the local member to attend a funding announcement in that member’s riding. That should be a recognized courtesy. It shouldn’t be left up to the minister’s discretion or the aide of a parliamentary assistant. That’s petty politics. That’s not open and transparent politics. That’s a slap in the face to the voters in this province who made a democratic choice at the ballot box and chose someone other than the candidate put forward by the party currently in power. Such direction shouldn’t be allowed. The Premier should send out a directive saying it won’t be tolerated, saying that all 107 members in this House deserve the same respect and all 107 ridings deserve equal consideration for infrastructure spending." ],

I’m doing the same thing. I want more infrastructure investment in my riding of Trinity–Spadina as well. You know, we have all these condo owners, and every morning they have to struggle to get on the streetcar to go to work. They have to wait for five streetcars to go by before they can get on one. We have these issues in the downtown core as well. So I completely share his intention, why it is so important for infrastructure investment taking place in his hometown.", "But I disagree with this motion because it implies that our government has not been investing according to the people’s needs. This motion is implying that there are some politics involved in the distribution of public funds. I think this motion would probably be better served at a federal level, in the House of Commons, because we’ve seen for the past few years—for the past 10 years, I should say—where the federal government has distributed their funds. Certainly it is not coming to Ontario. We have a fairness issue. We have a shortage of federal money here in Ontario when it comes to infrastructure investment. So I share the intention and I just feel it’s not equal when it comes to provincial versus federal intention to invest in infrastructure.", "I would also like to point out that when the Premier goes out talking about infrastructure investment on transportation, you know, she talks about $16 billion invested in the GTHA, the greater Toronto and Hamilton area, and $15 billion outside of the GTHA, for the very reason that we want to make sure the investment for our infrastructure in Ontario is kept in a fair manner when it comes to an urban and suburban setting versus a rural setting. I notice that every time the Premier talks about infrastructure investment and every time she talks about transit investment, she talks about roads and bridges for that very reason.", "I also would like to highlight the Ontario Community Infrastructure Fund, or OCIF. It’s another steady source for predictable and long-term funding for infrastructure projects in small and rural or northern communities. The OCIF provides $100 million per year to help communities build or repair bridges and other critical infrastructure.", "We have already allocated $50 million per year to 426 communities across the province, using a fair and transparent formula that recognizes that municipalities have different infrastructure needs and fiscal situations.

In the 2012 Liberal budget, the government reneged on a number of promises that were made in the 2011 election, four of which were in PC-held ridings. Again, apparently commitments were made for a new emergency room at the South Bruce Grey Health Centre in Kincardine—a $52-million emergency room, the first part of a $105-million hospital rebuild—promised before the election, but then axed after the election.", "A $30-million expansion of the ambulatory and mental health wings at Wingham and District Hospital in Huron–Bruce, promised before the election, was cancelled after the election—again, a riding that’s held by the member for Huron–Bruce, our member Lisa Thompson. The government has since offered only $3 million for upgrades and maintenance for a project that really requires $30 million.", "Projects at Brockville General Hospital’s mental health and St. Thomas Elgin General Hospital’s emergency, ambulatory and in-patient projects were both restructured to reduce government costs—again, promises made before the election and then axed after the election. After seven years of development and planning, the McGuinty Liberals cancelled plans for a $136.8-million rebuild of the West Lincoln Memorial Hospital.", "These are a number of examples. We bring them to the House today. We ask the government to respond. But certainly we continue to call upon the government to be fair to all ridings across the province, not to be so aggressively partisan such that they’re actually in some cases penalizing and punishing ridings for the way they voted or for their historical voting patterns.", "Certainly when there have been infrastructure announcements in my riding by the government, I have tried to, obviously, publicly thank the government for their support of these projects. In many cases they are projects that I have advocated for vocally in this House and will continue to do so. Certainly we appreciate the infrastructure investments in Wellington–Halton Hills, and I’m prepared to thank the government. Again, I would ask them to think about the way they’ve behaved in some of these other instances, in some of the other ridings held by opposition members, and pause for a minute and consider how petty it seems that they’re behaving in some of these cases. Excessive partisanship is not what the people of Ontario want or what the people of Ontario will be voting for in the next election.", "Again, I’d ask the members opposite to consider that and ask them to support this resolution today to show that, going forward at least, we’re going to have fairness in terms of infrastructure announcements and that, when announcements are made, there’s going to be an extension of respect to the elected members, whether they are government members or opposition members." ],

That group that did come in in 2011, from all three parties: I believe we have a special bond, all of us. We came in in a minority government and we learned very quickly how we have to work together. It was nice to be part of that group and I cherish every opportunity we have, when we do have a discussion together about various things.", "When it comes to this particular bill, I’m always one to stand in my place, and I try to always be positive. I’ve worked with members from my friend’s caucus here on several occasions. I see my good friend from Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound over there. We worked extremely hard, along with Minister Gravelle, in order to make sure that the Chi-Cheemaun ran when it needed to operate; that on the $40 million that could have been lost over the course of those periods, we dug our heels in, we rolled up our sleeves and we said, “We’ve got to get this done.” That is something that I can hold with great pride, that all of us did together.", "It’s funny—and I don’t know if I shared this with my friend. The day I was going to South Baymouth, there was a huge protest. The community members were frustrated that their request for help wasn’t being answered. I stood there, and I was going to say some maybe aggressive words toward the minister—and it’s funny, because in South Baymouth there’s not very much cell service, but he got me on my cell. He called me; he reached out. He said, “Hey, Mike, I want you to know we came through with it and we got it.” The whole tone of the announcement changed that day. I have to say, kudos to the minister. He gave me the opportunity to make the official announcement that the funding had come through; the boat was going to sail; the docks were going to be repaired. That’s a good-news story. You give credit where credit is due.", "I have to remember as well that on another occasion I harassed my good friend, who was then the Minister of Transportation and is now the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change. He took a personal interest in my issue. He actually came down to the riding in Espanola. We looked at the area of road that was of concern for the community of Espanola and also all of the municipalities that are on the island. He understood the need.", "I’m an MPP who believes that you need to touch, feel, taste and see in order for you to make that decision. I have to give a shout-out to him; he actually came out and saw it. The investment came through. The repairs were done just recently.", "Those are just a couple of examples, and I do have other examples where I’ve worked with my colleagues from the opposition party and with the government.

The government’s infrastructure spending is based on formulas to ensure fairness, and I think the member from Perth–Wellington knows that. In fact, no member of this House would need to look very hard to find examples of infrastructure investments made in every single part of this province.", "If the member for Perth–Wellington wanted to tally up lists of examples, I’m sure he’d find that opposition-held ridings are seeing considerable investment under this government. It’s interesting that he and several other members across the way have used the word “punish.” It was a word that I heard in Cambridge for a few years while the Cambridge Memorial Hospital expansion did not go ahead. I worked at the institution. I knew what was happening behind the scenes. Mr. Speaker, many people out in the community used to say the Liberal government was punishing Cambridge for being an unheld riding in not going forward. In fact, because the hospital unfortunately had to go under supervision, all of their expansion plans had to go off the rails for a while until a new administrator was found. They were able to come forward with plans that could be supported, and the Cambridge Memorial Hospital went ahead.", "When I was answering those people in the community—and this is before I was elected, Speaker—I would say, “Well, what about Woodstock?” They would say, “What do you mean, ‘What about Woodstock?’” I said, “They built a new hospital in Woodstock, an unheld riding, and it opened in 2011.” No punishment here; it was just the circumstances of those very, very individual communities.", "Last week, I went to Pelham in the riding of Niagara West–Glanbrook to cut a ribbon with the mayor—he actually stopped to kick the tires on the new transit bus—to be part of the MTO’s Community Transportation Pilot Grant. That community successfully got one of the pilot grants and started a bus transit in that pilot project. That is certainly an unheld riding.", "This summer, I went to many government announcements to help show our infrastructure investments in communities such as Leamington and Sarnia—and the member from Sarnia–Lambton was at that very happy announcement—Mount Forest and Woodstock. There were a number of different announcements that I was able to make throughout unheld ridings in the southwest—and definitely, those communities are not being punished by any stretch; they are actually fitting into the formula that Ontario has provided to ensure fairness for a number of different communities across here—funding announcement calls that I’ve done for the Southwestern Ontario Development Fund and other ministry programs all over the southwest region.", "In fact, 88% of the Ontario community infrastructure projects are in ridings held by members of opposition parties; 79% of those municipalities that receive funding have a population under 15,000, 65% have a population under 10,000 and 42% have a population under 5,000. I would challenge the members of the opposition: When they hear that some of the funding is coming to their municipalities, instead of complaining about it, I’d love to hear a thank you. Their mayors and their communities are asking for that.", "Another great example of the fairness we’ve been talking about, of ensuring we’re investing and making a real difference across our whole province, is the Small Communities Fund. We launched it as part of the Building Canada Fund, the first province in Canada to do so. Through that, we’ve provided $272 million that’s matched by our federal government, to support projects in municipalities with populations of fewer than 100,000.", "Here’s the thing, Mr. Speaker: Of the 86 projects we’ve nominated for federal approval through the Small Communities Fund, 39 are in PC ridings and 27 are in NDP ridings, which means 66 projects out of 86 are in opposition ridings. Our government understands that strong leadership means tackling our transit and infrastructure challenges in all.", "I’ll close by saying that the member from Perth–Wellington can’t criticize us for making infrastructure investments, vote against the budget that contains them and then come to cut the ribbon at these announcements. I challenge him to decide what side of the fence he’d like to be on." ],

In the end, it’s about the people, and when government fails to behave fairly and equitably to all the people it’s elected to represent, then government is not doing the job it was elected to do.", "I said it should go without saying, it should be a given; but, unfortunately, as we’ve seen time and again with the current regime, fair and equal consideration is continually ignored in favour of partisan behaviour that really falls well short of the principles we were all elected to uphold. The sad fact is that this government has become so arrogant and out of touch that they actually believe, when they hand out cheques, it’s their money to do with as they please, to shower over government ridings while only loosening the tap to drip onto opposition ridings when it suits their partisan needs, all the while doing their best to freeze out the local member in the process.", "Last week I informed the Legislature that I was writing the Integrity Commissioner following the most recent example of government arrogance and partisan promotion in my riding of Kitchener–Conestoga. I requested an investigation into the use of a September 1 private, invite-only Ontario government, taxpayer funding announcement in St. Jacobs by the member from Kitchener Centre and the Minister of Agriculture as a platform to promote the Kitchener Centre federal Liberal candidate, Raj Saini.", "Given the commissioner’s August 11 email to all MPPs relating to federal election participation, that “government resources should not be used for partisan purposes,” I was very surprised to see the federal candidate at the private, provincial taxpayer funding announcement, alongside the provincial Liberal members. Heck, I was surprised about the entire event itself, because in contrast to the focus of today’s motion, far from being given fair and equal advance notice of the official announcement, I was only informed of the 9:15 a.m. event in a quick email to my constituency office inbox at 8:51 p.m. the previous evening." ],

Well, it has gone too far, too long, and they can’t just keep using our resources to disrespect the democratic principles they are here to uphold.", "Even worse, when I did call them out for their partisan game-playing, the member for Kitchener Centre tried to play the announcement off as a public event, which even the grant recipient told reporters it was not. Worse than that, the member then tried to say I was invited to the event as a goodwill gesture. Twelve hours before an event that her federal Liberal friend was obviously well prepared for, I get an evening email to my constituency office marked “Event FYIs” for a taxpayer funding announcement to a company in my riding, and she calls that a gesture of goodwill? No.", "First of all, there was no goodwill about it. The late nature of notice was clearly intended to ensure that I was unable to attend. Second of all, this is a riding I represent. These are the people, no matter what political stripe, who I represent. In a democratic system of government, the elected representative, on behalf of his or her Ontario taxpayers, deserves to be given fair and equal advance notice of an official announcement. It’s as simple as that, and yet this government fails to grasp this simple concept.", "Goodwill has nothing to do with it, nor should it. When government makes investments into companies, they are doing it on behalf of everyone in the province and, more specifically, in the area riding. That’s a slap in the face of everyone in that riding, to play games in refusing fair and equal advance notice of official announcements.", "But again, this is nothing new for this bunch. There is a long and storied history of differing sets of rules being applied to funding announcements and infrastructure funding itself, as this motion speaks to.", "Let’s take a look at the wide array of transit announcements this government loves to repeat. For years now, we’ve had to watch as the Wynne Liberals pick winners and losers when it comes to the LRT funding. For instance, some municipalities get full funding, like Mississauga, Brampton, and now Hamilton; some, like us in my region of Waterloo, only get partial funding.", "Brampton, Mississauga and Hamilton are getting 100% full funding for their LRT; they have no skin in the game. And yet, in Waterloo we had to watch as the same government’s original commitment for two-thirds funding was slashed to only a third, leaving Waterloo region municipal taxpayers to pick up the province’s shortfalls. As I said at the time of the Brampton and Mississauga announcements, I guess, as the old country song goes, “They got the gold mine, and we got the shaft.”", "As we heard from my Perth–Wellington colleague, everyone pays taxes and should receive a similar quality of infrastructure and services, regardless of whose riding they live in. Provincial infrastructure decisions should be based on merit—full stop. Basing the use of taxpayers’ money on politics only further leads us down the rabbit hole toward more gas plant fiascos that cost us all while one party achieves their goals of partisan gain. It’s wrong. It has got to stop—" ],

We’re going to hit it out of the park with this one.", "So, with that, I want to talk about a very important element that I have been committed to my entire career. After University of Guelph, I worked for the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, after which I became general manager for the Ontario Dairy Goat Co-operative. That co-operative allowed me the opportunity to realize and continue my support for an organization called Ontario Agri-Food Education. This is an organization that has been around for a number of years—in fact, it evolved out of the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. Next year, in 2016, it will be celebrating its 25th anniversary. That anniversary is going to be special, because for 25 years they’ve worked hard to ensure that teachers who are interested in teaching about agriculture in the classroom, from primary through to the senior high school years, had the proper curriculum to base their teachings on.", "But we need to do better, and my motion is very, very important—I’ll get to that in a second—because while some might say that agriculture in the classroom is already happening, I disagree with that. I have to tell you that it isn’t happening consistently throughout the province. My motion is very specifically about ensuring that every single grade 9 and 10 student in Ontario is aware of the amazing job opportunities that they may want to consider.", "Food production, meaning farming, computer science, research and technology, food science, marketing, processing and mechanical engineering, which are just a few of the careers—I could go on; the list is truly endless. But what I really want to share is that this list, which is endless, underscores the importance of young people being aware, because I can tell you that we know the agri-food industry is an industry where there are jobs without people. We’ve known this for some time. In fact, I’m sure some of the members throughout the entire House will recall a few years ago when a report came out from the University of Guelph that stated for every new grad there were three or four jobs waiting for them. Clearly, there’s a gap here.", "My motion today, which has been strongly supported throughout the agri-food industry, is about closing that gap. My motion today is about all of us here in this House, all 107 members, working together so we can help the Premier realize a goal that she had.", "When the Premier was Minister of Agriculture and Food a couple of years ago, she challenged the agri-food industry to create 120,000 new jobs by 2020. It’s an aspiring goal, because we know this government likes to have aspirational goals—but we won’t talk about neonics today. We want to talk about helping the Premier close that gap and help people realize that there are amazing jobs out there. But they’ll only realize that if it’s made mandatory to teach about the amazing agri-food careers in the grades 9 and 10 career and guidance curriculum.", "I want to take a moment and reflect on some of the support that I’ve received over the last six months since I first introduced this motion during Local Food Week in June. For instance, Robert Gordon, the dean of the Ontario Agricultural College at the University of Guelph, said this motion “will support an improved level of awareness of the sector and the huge and growing opportunities that exist within.”", "Colleen Smith, executive director for Ontario Agri-Food Education, said, “OAFE is committed to supporting the economic success of the agri‐food industry in Ontario by helping students understand trends and themes occurring in the sector while at the same time motivate them to explore the diverse career opportunities that exist.”", "James Rilett, vice-president of Restaurants Canada, said, “Today’s consumers want to know where their food comes from, but they also want to know about the process. This understanding needs to start earlier. Including agriculture and food education in the Ontario curriculum is a great place to start.”", "Don McCabe—whom we all know and love in this House—president of the Ontario Federation of Agriculture, said, “OFA supports this initiative ... recognizing the importance of helping youth learn of the varied and growing opportunities available in the agri‐food sector.”", "Mark Brock, chair of Grain Farmers of Ontario, said, “Educating youth on the wide range of career choices that exist will help fill the gap the agriculture industry is currently facing.”", "Jim Goetz, president of the Canadian Beverage Association, went on to say, “To encourage more young people to get involved and excited about the agri‐food sector is beneficial for local communities and all Ontarians.” CBA supports “any future opportunities to promote growing this important sector of our economy and make Ontario a leader within Canada’s agri‐food industry.”", "Last but not least, Plamen Petkov, of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said, “Adding agri‐food education to the curriculum will allow younger generations to understand the options that are available to them.”", "That’s really what this is about. This isn’t about voluntarily having cute little segments about agriculture in the classroom. This is about making students absolutely, positively excited and aware of their future job opportunities.", "I share that, Speaker, because it’s important to recognize the significance that the agri-food sector has here alone in the GTHA. In December 2013, the city of Toronto announced that there were 1,149 food and beverage manufacturing establishments, employing over 51,000 people. They also went on to say:", "“Within Ontario, Toronto dominates the provincial food industry with more than half of all the food processing in the province taking place within the greater Toronto region.", "“About 47.2% of Ontario’s employment in the food and beverage sector was in Toronto.... The total annual sales ... were estimated to be $16.9 billion or 47.2% of Ontario’s annual sales of $35.81 billion in 2011.”", "Speaker, this is a huge industry, and we can’t afford to have good-paying jobs going without people recognizing an opportunity that lies there. I share that because, in speaking to people from Conestoga College, who have a wonderful foodservice program, they shared their dismay with me because they can’t fill the seats that they have dedicated towards food science. They don’t have enough students aware and interested in applying. When we want our young people to stay in Ontario, when we want our young people to grow their families in Ontario, we need to ensure that they understand the viable opportunities that exist right here in Ontario as well.", "As I mentioned before, the whole concept of agriculture in the classroom has been around for quite some time. Again, I’ve dedicated my entire career to ensuring that young people have an appreciation of agriculture but, more importantly, understand the future that allows this province to feel good about keeping our young people here in this province.", "It’s about economics, and we all know that the agri-food sector in Ontario is, some would say, second-largest to the automotive industry. But, as the president of the Ontario Federation of Agriculture points out, you can’t eat a car. So the agri-food industry is incredibly important to this province.", "I also want to share with you that teachers need to be comfortable in teaching agricultural content. My understanding is that the Minister of Education earlier today said, “This is already happening in Ontario.” Well, Speaker, the fact of the matter is, there are some areas of Ontario, primarily rural Ontario, that do, indeed, have high-skills major programs focusing on primary agriculture, which is excellent.", "But we have to do better. All Ontarians need to be aware of the opportunities, and we need to grow awareness about jobs in the agri-food sector. OAFE is the perfect partner. OAFE is an organization that has ex officios from both the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs and the Ministry of Education at the board table, helping guide them in the right direction, so every effort and every investment made in the curriculum is a fit.", "They also—“they” being OAFE—have an amazing program known as teacher ambassadors. So while there might be some teachers not comfortable with teaching content that they’re not familiar with, OAFE is there to support these teachers with their ambassadors. It’s a great program where young teachers who may not be able to get a full-time job or get on a supply list have an opportunity to hone their skills as teacher ambassadors and build up their tool box, all the while promoting the agri-food sector. I think this is just an amazing program that enables my motion to transcend into the Ministry of Education in a very smooth manner, and I’ll explain that just as I close.", "My motion is not about a new spend; it’s not about creating something new. This motion is about realizing what we already have at our disposal. We have an amazing not-for-profit organization that will be celebrating its 25th anniversary next year, and we can couple that with a curriculum that’s already in place by embedding agri-food careers into grade 9 and 10 curriculum. This is a win for everyone, and hopefully, by 2020, the agri-food sector will have created 120,000 new jobs." ],

I think it’s a great motion, actually, and I’m certainly going to support it. I only have about three or four minutes, so I’m just going to focus on the importance of agri-food jobs in my own riding of Welland and across Niagara.", "In fact, as a teenager, many, many years ago when I was 15 or16, I spent my summers working in the canning factories in Niagara-on-the-Lake, at Bick’s pickles in the Dunnville area. It provided a lot of jobs for youth. It wasn’t a pretty job. It was a very tiring job, where you’re on an assembly line, processing peaches, plums, pickles or whatever. But it certainly taught you the importance of getting a good education and moving on to something else in your life if you didn’t want to be doing that every year, over the seasonal operation.", "In my own riding, I attended a ribbon cutting for Niagara Peninsula Homes. Now, you’ll wonder what the connection is with agri-foods, but Niagara Peninsula Homes, which has been in operation for many, many years and manages and operates co-op housing and some non-profit housing across the Niagara region, also has what is called the Niagara Women’s Enterprise Centre and Niagara Presents. Niagara Presents actually has a business that sees women who maybe have fled their homes because of violence or they’ve emigrated from another country without a lot of educational skills. They work with farmers and produce all kinds of products in conjunction with Vineland’s Cherry Lane. They use a Niagara Presents label, and they sell these products. They make gift baskets with preserves and different sauces and things they’ve made, and the money they raise is used for other enterprises for women.", "In addition to doing that, Niagara Peninsula Homes does a property and maintenance co-op program. They provide housing support and property management. Most recently, they actually have a teen energy program where they take youth at risk and put them through their program. This group was actually responsible for renovating this new building, which was an old historic building in the city, and they now have all their programs under one roof.", "I would be remiss if I didn’t speak about our wine industry, which certainly falls under this bill. Certainly we’re very proud of our wine industry in Niagara. It’s hard to keep track of the number of wineries we have, because some of them have merged. Sometimes there are almost 200, and then the numbers may reduce as the wineries group together. But certainly the wine industry has produced hundreds of jobs for people in Niagara.", "The research station in Vineland, in the riding of the member for Niagara West–Glanbrook, Mr. Hudak, was created about 15 years ago to bring together grape growers, the federal and provincial ministries, the University of Guelph, Brock University and Niagara College: all those people who were starting to delve into winemaking and the training of winemakers. It, in fact, has created its own set of workers with value-added jobs in the whole research piece.", "I think this bill is very important. As I said, I’m going to support it, and I look forward to the end result here." ],

I always ask how we can better engage the public, especially young people, on the potential for them in agriculture.", "We also got a splendid showcase of the diversity of the agri-food sector at Glengarry–Prescott–Russell day just yesterday right here in this Legislature.", "In Durham, we have a vibrant and varied agricultural sector. Businesses both directly and indirectly related to agriculture make up a large part of our local economy, so I’ve had the great pleasure, since being elected, to be a touring guest on many of these farms and facilities. We have a lovely facility in Newcastle that produces a number of things—the best cider you can find anywhere. It’s right there in Durham.", "Family farms are a cornerstone of our lives here in Durham and also in Ontario in general, and they’re incredible economic citizens locally, provincially and internationally.", "What they want young people to know is that the tools and approaches to agriculture that they employ come from very diverse fields of study. Agriculture is truly a modern and constantly advancing industry, and promoting that message is key to sustainability.", "Genetics and biology, chemistry, physics and engineering: The sciences are very heavily engaged in the agricultural sector, working towards bio-durability of crops and livestock, sustainability of agricultural practices and much, much more.", "The social sciences are vital as well, with agricultural economics, labour relations, communications and beyond. You can name almost any field of study, and chances are it has a significant relationship with agriculture.", "I think it’s highly important that students are given the chance to see the opportunities before them, and that is why I think this motion is worth debating.", "I recently held an agricultural round table in Nestleton which was well attended. We had over 40 people from the agricultural sector in attendance—Nestleton is in the heart of our farming community—and we invited representatives from across the agricultural sector. This was a wonderful opportunity to hear their comments and concerns, and part of those comments were how we can engage young people to become involved on the family farm.", "This was a wonderful opportunity to hear their comments and to try to address their comments as best as I could by contacting the local college, which is Durham College, and asking about programs and the possibility of having programs in that community that would enhance the agricultural sector.", "I certainly hear about educating youth about opportunities in the field, but I also hear about the importance of food literacy and the impact that students make as consumers and local stewards in their communities.", "I am very supportive of having agriculture in careers classes in our high schools, and I think our government has already done quite a good job of giving schools the tools to spread this message.", "Our existing curriculum provides a variety of opportunities for students to learn about agriculture and food processing, and we have implemented the Local Food Act and encouraged 26 specialist high-skills majors in agriculture, but I think there’s always potential to go beyond.", "Ontarians should know what sort of choices they are making when they go to the grocery store and where their food is coming from. They need to be encouraged to ask about the journey their food has taken, the good people who have been involved in that process and how it affects their health and well-being.", "Agriculture in Ontario helps to combat food insecurity and inequity, and these topics should be encouraged for discussion. I think our government is doing an excellent job of advocating for more agricultural education, but for me, the sky certainly is the limit.", "Where we are in Durham is, like many parts of Ontario, a mix of urban and rural. The boundary brings agricultural activities almost to the subdivision fences. Having programs like this in the classrooms shows Ontarian students that their relationship with farmers and agriculture doesn’t end at the fence. It has the impact of promoting greater understanding of normal farm practices and creating greater harmony and civic knowledge.", "I feel very strongly that there is a need to make agriculture a larger part of students’ education in this province, and that’s why I am pleased to be supporting this motion today." ],

Agriculture in our province is not just a romantic idea of the past, but very much of central importance to our province’s future. Ontario’s agri-food industry contributes $34 billion annually to Ontario’s GDP and supports upwards of three quarters of a million jobs.", "Unfortunately, the agri-food industry continues to have a low profile in the job market. Despite the challenge to the sector that the Premier made herself, when she was the Minister of Agriculture, to create 120,000 new jobs by 2020, we’re obviously not there yet, and there is much work to do.", "Each graduate from an agriculture degree program in this province today has approximately three ag-related jobs available to him or her upon graduation. This bill supports providing students an improved level of awareness of the sector and employment opportunities that exist. Properly educating Ontario’s youth on the array of career choices can only help fill the gaps. I have spoken many times across the province about the need to better link education to employment, and this is an example of the type of sector where that would be so helpful.", "This bill will also help reinvigorate a sector understandably frustrated in recent years. A January 2015 survey by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business noted that 35% of farmers are discouraging their own children from carrying on the family farming business, mainly because of the endless red tape and regulation. This bill is an opportunity to highlight the opportunities that exist and how we all hope to make this sector great again.", "Adding agri-food education to the syllabus will help students make educated decisions about their future if they choose the agri-food industry. This foundation will better equip them to navigate the system in the future.", "I recall when I was young, prior to the age of 10, my family had a farm just outside of Midland. I remember speaking to neighbours; you remember things differently when you’re a child, but I remember very distinctly that there was pride. There was pride in farming. What I love about this bill is that it raises those possibilities to students. It raises those possibilities to young people and helps bring back an enhanced pride in the agriculture sector.", "Ontario is home to some of the best farmland in Canada, and we should celebrate that. We should celebrate the opportunities that exist, and that the people involved in this sector are some of the hardest-working people you could ever imagine. The Ontario PC caucus understands and supports our farmers. Cultivating a new and enthusiastic generation of agriculture will grow our economy, feed our cities and keep our families together, and carry on one of Ontario’s finest traditions.", "Today’s consumers also want to know where their food comes from, and want to know about the process. This understanding needs to start earlier. Including agriculture and food education in classrooms would be a great catalyst for this earlier start and for building a foundation of knowledge with young people.", "The OFA agrees greater education targeting young students is needed and is very important. Actually, this bill dovetails well with their lobbying efforts. The OFA is launching their own food literacy program, Six by Sixteen, to help guide young people to plan and learn and prepare six healthy meals by the age of 16. When I met with members of the OFA executive earlier this week, I talked about the member for Huron–Bruce’s bill, and they enthusiastically thought it was a great initiative.", "So I just wanted to say very briefly today why this is a great bill and why this would be of benefit to Ontario. I would encourage all members in the House to support it, but I’d really encourage the government to take the spirit of this bill and make sure that we add it to the school curriculum as soon as possible, and hopefully as soon as next year, because this is a step forward for Ontario.", "I thank the member for Huron–Bruce for putting all of her hard work and efforts into this." ],

As our member from Huron–Bruce has explained, an agri-food curriculum really is a proven way to introduce ideas and information, in this case to high school students, exposing them to farming, food and agri-business as a career choice, in this case by wedging ag into the existing careers curriculum.", "I have always felt that ag education is good news. It’s something I learned growing up on our farms. I studied agriculture in high school for four years; it was a full-blown course back at the time. I studied at the University of Guelph, did an MSc at the agricultural college, and I was fortunate to come back to a Simcoe county school and teach the agriculture program to grades 9, 10, 11 and 12—a 4-year or 5-year stream. It was a full-blown, year-long course for our students. Vestiges of this remain as a specialist high school major in agriculture, but not in enough schools, really.", "In the curriculum I taught, we ran a 50-foot greenhouse and we had a chicken barn. Of course, to maintain that as a high school teacher, you’re there until 5 o’clock every day with the students. That provided a lot of opportunities to kick around ideas, as well, after 3:30. Many of my schoolmates and many of my students picked up farming as a career; they took over the family farm, or they bought one, and worked hard. They did well in spite of some of the obstacles, and many of those obstacles are mitigated by ongoing education, ongoing extension—something that’s also very important.", "When we hear words like agri-food and ag literacy, oftentimes we think of farming alone, or segments of agriculture, and it really does encompass everything from farm gate to plate—the whole journey, really, and beyond, into manufacturing and retail.", "As far as careers, many of my students were from town. They get out of high school, and maybe for their first job they’re pumping gas. Most of their customers were farmers—farm trucks, diesel, delivering fuel to farms, tractors. Maybe they’re involved in construction. Again, there’s electrical and plumbing—their customers are farmers, and they could communicate the business of agriculture.", "I really feel we would do well, as with this motion, to re-evaluate what we’re offering in our school system and to take a look at our school system through a rural lens. It’s a bit of a sad state of affairs that today’s curriculum really doesn’t contain much with respect to traditional agriculture or traditional home economics, let alone present and future approaches to agriculture. It’s very important across Canada. Some 8% of our gross domestic product is driven by agri-business; 8% of the value of all Canadian goods comes from the system, and that comes in at about a $100-billion contribution every year, nationally.", "There is an abundance of careers in a variety of fields, not just “out in the field”: marketing, food science, research, development, plant and animal genetics, plant and animal biotechnology, microbiology, financial services, ecology—much of the ag course curriculum morphed into the environmental science program in the early 1970s; advertising and government work, because the odd farmer gets elected as an MPP. So there is a future in the business in one way or another.", "Much of the business continues to boom, in spite of the odds, and 12% of Canada’s employment—out of 2.1 million people, there’s a little over 300,000 people involved in just primary agriculture alone, whether it’s in a greenhouse, a tree nursery or working on the farm. But there’s a tremendous gap, a tremendous need for workers, as we know.", "I appreciate the support from all members of the House—this is quite heartening—and support from so many organizations. I’d like to quote an organization called Sustain Ontario: “Making food literacy part of the mainstream school curriculum is supported by 95% of Ontarians.” Those changes would provide students with “the necessary skills to make healthy food choices and increase their self-efficacy to prepare nutritious meals for themselves.”", "MPP Patrick Brown made mention of the OFA. The Ontario Federation of Agriculture launched a program, Six by Sixteen, with the tagline, “We’re serving up food literacy.” I know President Don McCabe is in the House today. There’s a website. You can go to sixbysixteen.me to learn more about this program. The plan is that by age 16, young people would have the ability to prepare, at minimum, six nutritious, comprehensive meals. There’s a website and there’s an extensive library of resources, videos, recipes, all kinds of advice.", "CropLife Canada: Here’s another organization. It’s a supporter of what they call Agriculture in the Classroom Canada. I’ve gone through their material. They have a terrific interactive website. They have set up a non-profit spinoff organization to push the knowledge and the understanding, again, focusing on grades 7 to 12.", "I fully support this. I saw how it worked through the 1960s and 1970s. It’s the way to go." ],

We’re very proud to support it. Agriculture is the cornerstone of this province. It’s the cornerstone of our society. A lot of people don’t appreciate how important it is, but even more people don’t appreciate how wide a variety of highly skilled jobs are in it. I think that’s one of the things that this motion is really looking to direct.", "There is a high degree of food illiteracy in this province, and that’s a problem in itself. But there’s also a high degree of agriculture job illiteracy. This motion speaks to that in spades.", "One of the reasons that I quit milking cows—quit dairy farming—is that I couldn’t find someone to manage my dairy farm while I was here. There is a demand for that. There is a huge demand for highly skilled jobs.", "I have two kids. Right now one is working full-time in the agriculture field; the other one soon will be. They’re not on our dairy farm or on our cash crop farm, but both will have highly paid, highly skilled jobs in agriculture, and that’s something we have to expose more children, more students and more young people to.", "Agriculture is a very fast-growing, fast-paced industry. A lot of people don’t realize that and we have to expose more people to that. I’m very proud to be a farmer here today, to be able to say that, proud to see the OFA, proud to see OAFE here and proud to have worked with Lisa Thompson, the member for Huron-Bruce, in my former life when I was heading the agriculture section at the plowing match.", "I remember when we did that, we had thousands of kids come. That part I kind of expected, but we had the superintendent of the school board volunteer, we had a lot of teachers volunteer, and I think they learned more than the kids did. That’s something that this motion speaks to, because when you educate the educators, it flows through the whole system. That’s what we need to do, because if we educate the educators about the opportunities in agriculture, we will become an even bigger powerhouse in that sector than we are today. Some people might say, “This doesn’t seem like a big thing.” If we did this, it’s a huge step forward.", "In my closing few seconds—and I know we’re all being very positive here, and I like to be positive. But one thing this government has to realize about agriculture—and I’m going to be positive. If you take the issue of certified crop advisers, they are certified, they have a code of ethics and they should be allowed to perform their job. It’s one thing to educate people—you have them educated, they’re qualified, and they say, “Oh, no, no, we don’t think you’re quite qualified enough,” that’s an issue. Those types of issues we also have to look at. I’m hoping to be able to continue to work with the government on those issues.", "I fully support this bill." ],

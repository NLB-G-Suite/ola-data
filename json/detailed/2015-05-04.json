The Gerbers’ story—and the stories of thousands of injured workers that were shared on April 29 at the National Day of Mourning—is a powerful reminder to all MPPs about our obligation to do everything possible to make Ontario workplaces safe. We need to ensure proper training and oversight; we need to hold employers to account when they fail to protect workers; and we need to provide workers who are injured on the job with the support and respect they deserve from WSIB.", "Speaker, as NDP critic for post-secondary education, I once again call on the government to address the lack of workplace protection for one particular group of young people; that is, post-secondary students who are doing a voluntary unpaid work placement as part of their program of study. These students currently fall through the cracks of the Employment Standards Act and the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act. If they are injured or killed during their work placement, they are not covered by WSIB. With Ontario’s high rates of youth unemployment, unpaid voluntary work placements provide many post-secondary students with their only opportunity to gain work experience.

I promise I’ll keep you awake.", "I am going to speak very frankly about the budget document and some of the contents in it, and I’ll get my shameless plug in very early: I am going to be speaking—in fact, I’m going to read to the Liberals—chapters of Focus on Finance 2: A Look Into Ontario’s Finances. If you want to read along, you can go to my legislative website, fedeli.com, and download a copy of the 106-page book. It is a shameless plug, but it’s “must” reading for young and old. The web address is fedeli.com, in case you missed it.", "Minister, did you enjoy it? Is it top financial advice to you?", "Last week’s budget, when presented—we could have seen the right thing done by the Liberals. They could have changed the path that Ontario is on. Over the last several weeks, our caucus certainly has stood here, sharing stories about the pain that’s being inflicted by the Liberal government on families throughout Ontario. We also heard from the rating agencies, the Ontario Chamber of Commerce and the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, but we especially heard from the Auditor General. They all warned us about the same thing: Our economy, and this government, is headed in the wrong direction. Actually, it started back with Don Drummond, who said, when he rang the bell very clearly, that you’re going the wrong way; you need to drastically change the direction we’re headed. The Auditor General told us that if you don’t change the direction, you’re going to start seeing the very services we enjoy in Ontario being, in her words, crowded out. That means there’s no room left for them because we’re busy paying interest.", "What does this government do instead, Speaker? More of the same: more spending, even more debt and yet another deficit. We are certainly one of the very few sub-nationals left in the world, especially one with an annual deficit of this size. This is a massive deficit. Speaker, this government continues to use the province’s credit card instead of using their debit card.", "The budget, if you look carefully at it as we did, merely announces more of the same. In many instances it’s a direct re-announcement—a cut-and-paste, if you will—from what we saw last year. A great example of that is the $130-billion announcement on infrastructure. If you look in the 2014 budget, it was already there, word for word. In fact, in the discussion of the $130-billion infrastructure budget, they took exactly the same words, plunked them in there and pretended it was some kind of new announcement. They’re out there trumpeting this great news, which is old news.", "The only thing that really makes you wonder what the game is that’s afoot is: In last year’s budget, if you look carefully, Speaker—I’ll even tell you the page. Page 45 of the 2015 budget talks about last year’s budget, the 2014 budget. Asset optimization: That’s the nice way of saying, “We’re going to have a fire sale of our assets.” If you look very carefully, last year they needed to sell, over four years, a total of $3.1 billion in assets to make it work. That’s $1.1 billion this year, $1 billion the next, only half a billion the further year, and half a billion the year after that. So their dedicated funds were $3.1 billion. But now, all of a sudden, in addition to the sale of GM shares, the sale of the LCBO headquarters and the sale of the OPG building, they need a $9-billion sale of hydro to make it work. In last year’s budget, they only needed $3.1 billion, but now, in addition to that, they need the $9-billion fire sale of Hydro One.", "They’re selling public assets to pay for what was already budgeted. This is a shell game, Speaker. They’re really using the money from the sale of Hydro One to pay off their mortgage. That’s exactly what they’re doing. It’s a shell game. It’s a little bit of a switcheroo.", "In the budget last year—this $130 billion that was announced—they needed $3.1 billion. Now that we have this new money coming in, they’ll take the money, put it into transit, but then take the money that already was in transit and haul that away. That’s exactly what’s about to happen here because they don’t know how to balance their deficit; they don’t know how to balance a budget. This money will be the money that will be used to get them down to the $8.5 billion. I almost want to choke over that amount. It’s still $8.5 billion. They’ll crow over how great that is—$8.5 billion; they still plan on spending more than they plan on taking in.", "Without that hydro revenue, Speaker—they’re going to take 100% of our hydro, hive off 60%, sell it for $9 billion, and then change the law that says you must use the revenue from the sale of hydro assets, and put it against the $27-billion mortgage that is held on hydro. Instead of doing that, they’re going to change the law. It’s in the bill already to change the law—that does not force them to follow the law and put the money where it’s destined. They’re going to use it to bail out their own deficit.", "So, Speaker, they’re going to take the $9 billion, put $5 billion against the mortgage, and $4 billion they’re going to use ostensibly for transit—but in reality, take the transit money that was already there and back it out and put it towards the fact that they don’t know how to balance a budget if their life depended on it.", "What’s going to happen now is, you’ve got $9 billion out of the system and you’ve got only 40% of that asset left to generate the revenue to pay off the mortgage, so they won’t have the revenue—right now, 100% of that revenue is available to pay off the mortgage. They’re not going to have that any longer. So how are we going to pay the hydro mortgage? Well, we know darn well they’re going to put their hands deeper and deeper into our ratepayers’ pockets and try to dig out even more cash to pay off the bill because they took that money and put it elsewhere. That’s exactly what’s going to happen.", "On Friday of last week, at 11 o’clock on Friday morning, May 1, the peak hydro rate went up exactly 15%. It went from 14 cents to 16.1 cents. I know they’re not good at math; I understand that. We’ve seen that in the budget. It went up 15%, a number they continue to deny. But it’s a fact: 14 cents to 16.1 cents; a 15% increase in hydro rates.", "On November 1, hydro rates will go up again, according to them, only another 10%. On January 1, when they take the consumer benefit away, hydro rates will go up yet again, another 10%. So 15%, 10%, 10%—all within eight months. That’s the reality of the hydro realm that these people have created. I don’t know why they continue to use our hydro to cover up the mistakes that they’ve made.", "Our team was very busy stripping away the numbers and getting to the real numbers. While we were doing that, they were busy stripping away all the transparency that is currently in the hydro sector.", "Speaker, let me tell you a story about what is happening with Hydro One. The moment a single share is sold, Hydro One will no longer be deemed a public asset. That’s in their bill. That’s what’s happening. What does that mean to the people of Ontario? Well, first of all, it strips the Auditor General of powers: no more value-for-money audits from the Auditor General. “Let’s not have that pesky Auditor General involved in Hydro One any longer.” They’ve seen to that. It’s in the bill. They removed the right of the Auditor General to look into Hydro One’s books. That’s gone, day one. They cut out the Financial Accountability Officer after six months. They can no longer begin new audits. It’s over: no more financial accountability of Hydro One. That’s in their bill. The Financial Administration Act is amended to limit our ability to obtain any information on Hydro One—gone. We’re stripped of that as well.", "What’s happening here is a wholesale stripping of any access to any information whatsoever about an asset that the people of Ontario own. There’s nothing open and transparent about that.", "Now, it’s very clear that the government doesn’t want us to know what they’re up to. We had to scrounge our files through the gas plant hearing documents, only to find that many were deleted. Speaker, they’ve gone ahead with this Hydro One sale and taken care of that. There’s no sense scrounging for anything anymore; none of the agencies have any authority over Hydro One any longer. Freedom of information is no longer available for Hydro One. We don’t get to know a thing—nothing, no freedom of information.", "Schedule 38 removes Hydro from the sunshine list. We don’t even get to see any of the details about their employees. This is one way to stop the flow of information: cut access; cut it all. This is their idea of being open and transparent: no more Auditor General, no more freedom of information, no more sunshine list disclosures—nothing, Speaker. We get nothing.", "Let’s take it a little further. Lobbyists don’t have to register any longer for Hydro One. My gosh, Speaker, what are they hiding from us? What are they attempting to hide?", "Schedule 23 excludes Hydro from oversight of the Management Board of Cabinet. They don’t even want to know what’s going on—just let it be.", "Hydro One is also taken out of the Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act. One of the biggest complaints we have in our MPP offices, and I’m quite certain over on the government side as well—they just don’t want to tell you about it—are all the complaints we get in our offices on Hydro One, the help that isn’t coming. Thankfully, it fell under the oversight of the Ombudsman, who had a scathing report and a revelation which helped families. Finally, families found some relief when this terrible activity at Hydro One was disclosed. Well, they have an answer for that, Speaker. The Ombudsman is no longer available to investigate Hydro One once the first share—one share—is sold. They saw to that in the bill. That is written into their bill.", "Speaker, if you could imagine the next one: the Integrity Commissioner gone from oversight over Hydro One. No integrity, Speaker; no integrity commission. But, as I said earlier, considering there’s no integrity left in the system, you won’t need any of those officers.", "At what point does shame kick in? It’s shameful that they have taken this most important public asset and hidden from us all of these oversight agencies, every single one of them. They didn’t miss a trick. No Auditor General, no Financial Accountability Officer, no Ombudsman, no Integrity Commissioner—no integrity, Speaker. No more freedom of information. It’s the last time that we are able to find out they spent almost $7 million—" ],

I’ll try to parse out the unparliamentary language that was used in the confidential advice to the Premier: “The path to balance was then drawn from there, assuming a straight-line trajectory of declining deficits.” So what they did is they had this number at the bottom, that they themselves call not a real expectation and a deliberate policy, and they need to get to zero. So they drew a straight line, and then filled all these in. That’s exactly what they did, and they admit it here. They say, “It was assumed that spending would be constrained to whatever it takes to hit these targets.” Somebody laid a ruler across, drew a straight line, and then filled it in and said, “Those are our budget deficit numbers. Now figure out how to make it happen.”", "But they also divulged, “Over the medium term, we have notional targets by sector that add up to the deficit numbers, but not yet full plans to deliver on them. For the extended outlook, neither sector targets nor plans yet exist.” Then they conclude with, “In order to hit the deficit targets, spending growth going forward has to decrease dramatically.” Well, we all know what happened after that—nothing. It did not flatline. It didn’t decrease dramatically. We saw it go up. In fact, spending is up $2.4 billion again this year.", "So they used that same chart, the one that we disclosed here in the Legislature. They used that chart again—the nerve. It’s quite funny; I guess they ran out of charts. They used the same chart again that we outed as a chart that they said was a complete fabrication. That’s what they decided to do. Again, they couldn’t even make a new fake chart, they had to use the existing chart that they had, which leads us to ask the question: Why do they continue to make life so expensive for Ontario families?", "The warning bells were ringing all around the minister, all around the Premier, all around the government that you need to do a drastic turnaround, a dramatic change. All of these outside financial organizations have said the same thing. They should have realized when Fitch downgraded Ontario’s long-term debt to AA- that maybe something is wrong, maybe the way we’re going about things here on the other side—maybe you should start to listen. They had to downgrade Ontario. Standard and Poor’s has a negative outlook on the province’s long-term debt—not a very admirable position to be in. Moody’s lowered their outlook from stable to negative. Again, after reading your budget, the two words that they came out with were “considerable risk.” Not their proudest moment.", "The fastest-growing expense item is interest on debt. It’s going to increase 7% over the next three years. They’re taking money that should be going into front-line health care, and they’re using that money now to pay the interest on their debt. They’re taking money out of health care and education, and using those funds to pay off interest on their overspending. It’s their financial mismanagement alone that’s doing that. It’s not the tsunami, as the former finance minister used to say, of the recession. The recession ended for everybody else but us, apparently. They continue to make it harder for Ontarians to pay their bills.", "Let’s look at some of the specific quotes from Moody’s. They acknowledge the fact that they’ve shown no progress whatsoever in decreasing debt. Moody’s told us that they continue to “see risks” in the province’s budget. They said that our “deficits have shown little progress in the past few years, and in fact”—now this was interesting, Speaker—“have increased from 8.1% of revenues ... to 9.2%” of revenue. It’s an interesting statistic from Moody’s that tells you where we really are headed. Worst of all, they say that “provincial economic forecasts have tended to overestimate growth.”", "They fluffed the last budget numbers, and only after four months. They presented the budget in July. Four months later, they had to come out and restate that their revenue was off by $500 million. In four months, their budget was wrong by half a billion dollars. Now we know why they’re selling assets, why they’re increasing taxes and why they’re raising hydro bills. It’s all about asking seniors and families to pay for their 12 years of financial mismanagement.", "Last week I asked a question of the Premier when she said, “We don’t believe right now that taking more money out of people’s pockets would be responsible.” Speaker, I was in the budget lock-up for seven hours, so I don’t know if the Premier has actually read her own budget if she thinks it isn’t filled with schemes to take money out of people’s pockets.", "There’s the new payroll tax, which was passed at 11:45 last Wednesday morning, going for royal assent tomorrow. The payroll tax is going to put a tax on businesses. I’ll talk about that a little bit more.", "A cap-and-trade tax: That’s a tax on everything. If I thought the payroll tax was the mother of all taxes, well, cap and trade, that’s going to be the mother of all taxes.", "They now have, of course, the beer tax. They have another instalment on the aviation fuel tax. Increased user fees, increased hydro rates—all of those are taking money out of people’s pockets. I don’t know which of those the Premier thinks is not taking money out of people’s pockets.", "Over the last few weeks, our caucus had five budget asks that were designed to make life better for those living in Ontario. We said to them, “Stop the madness. Do what all the other financial institutions, the rating agencies and everybody involved in caring about Ontario are saying: Stop putting a burden on people.”", "The first thing we said was “Stop your payroll tax.” Instead of stopping this payroll tax—which is going to be a huge increase in payroll taxes; we already have the highest payroll taxes in Canada, so this is going to put us into a new stratosphere—they rammed it through. Only days later, last Wednesday at 11:45 in the morning, our party stood here to put a halt to it. The Liberal government has passed that and, sadly, on January 1, 2017, taxes will go up for businesses. Businesses will lose employees. By the government’s own admission, it could be anywhere between 18,000 and 54,000 people who lose their jobs.", "We also suggested to them in one of our five asks that they cancel this foolish cap-and-trade tax as it hurts families by putting a tax on everything. We know what this is. This is the one that’s going to take all this money—three cents a litre for gas; all the other expenses that will go up; a tax on everything—and use that money to help pay their bills and lower their deficit.

There’s not a thing that these guys are doing that that will help.", "We asked them to fix home care by reducing the number of agencies that patients must deal with. Did they listen? No. In fact, they went exactly the opposite way. They are spending now $750 million on yet a new level of bureaucracy between the patient and their health care. Instead of the CCAC and the LHINs, we’ve now got these new health links. Sixty-nine of them are being formed to keep you away from your valuable medical services. Speaker, that’s $750 million for more bureaucracy.", "The fourth was to ask them to make hydro more affordable. It has chased away business. It has caused families to choose between food or fuel, to decide whether to heat or eat. That’s what we have in Ontario today. Speaker, you and I did not grow up in an Ontario that made families choose between food or fuel.", "I’ve told this Legislature on a few occasions: All three parties went to many cities in the pre-budget consultations. We all went to Ottawa and we heard from Jennifer, an ODSP recipient who sat in front of us. It was heart-wrenching. She talked about the fact that she had to shut off her power from 6 o’clock every morning until noon and again from 3 every afternoon until 7 so she could afford to pay her hydro bill. Speaker, have you ever heard of anything like that in the province of Ontario, the once proud province of Ontario? We have become a have-not province with our hand out now, and we still can’t give a leg up to Jennifer to help her with her hydro bill. She has to put extra sweaters on and shut her power off to be able to have enough money to buy food. What an awful scenario that is for the province of Ontario, which once had the lowest cost of energy in North America. With all of their failed plans, we are now the highest-cost jurisdiction, chasing companies out of Ontario one by one.", "Think about it, Speaker. When you have companies like Heinz or Caterpillar or Kellogg’s or General Mills or Wrigley’s—Caterpillar is still making earth-moving equipment, just not in Ontario. Heinz still makes ketchup, just not in Ontario. They’ve gone to lower-cost jurisdictions. Ours is the highest-cost jurisdiction in the country—the highest energy rates in North America, the highest payroll taxes, strangling red tape that is costing businesses. This is the Ontario that this government has created.", "The last ask was to present a serious, credible and detailed plan to balance the budget by 2017-18. All we got, again, was a series of fluffed-up numbers and old charts that we presented before as being fake charts. I don’t understand what it will take for this government to change their ways, to stop making it so hard for Ontarians to pay their bills.", "Like most MPPs, we go home on the weekends. I head up to my hometown of North Bay. Not this weekend but the weekend before I ran into a guy—I’ve known him for years—who has owned a manufacturing shop in North Bay for decades; a great, young business guy, a hard worker. I asked him, “How’s business? What’s happening?” He’s in the construction field. He said that if things don’t pick up he’s going to close and leave the province for other work. It’s not just in our community; it’s the province.", "When you think about the WSIB tax that this government brought in and what it has done to the small contractors throughout Ontario, it’s part of what it has done to hurt the contractors throughout Ontario.", "I was at a community dinner, and a municipal councillor joined my wife and I at our table. I asked him, “How are things? What’s happening in the region?”", "He said, “It’s like the air is coming out of our economy.” That’s the reality of what’s out there.

I have to tell you, it was heart-wrenching to see building after building, these former manufacturing businesses from when we were the powerhouse in manufacturing, boarded up, one after another after another, all the way to Fort Erie. We all went together. All three parties went together. We drove down to Fort Erie for pre-budget consultations. On the drive back, I was ashamed. I was embarrassed. I was ashamed of what our province has become. I think of those families that put their life savings into those businesses.", "Not only was it Fort Erie; we also went to Fort Frances, and I took a side trip. I landed in Thunder Bay and drove throughout the north as part of the campaign. If I was embarrassed and ashamed for the people in southwestern Ontario, from Niagara Falls to Fort Erie, with all those boarded buildings, I’ve got to tell you, Speaker, it ripped my heart out to be home in the north. Eight out of every 10 lumber mills, logging firms, pulp and paper, anything to do with the forest—eight out of 10 are gone, because of high electricity rates, high payroll taxes, all of the things that this government is doing to cripple Ontario. Speaker, 63 of those firms are gone. Many of them will never open again. They’ve torn the facilities down.", "Of course, when I went up to northeastern Ontario, more my neck of the woods, I drove to Iroquois Falls, where the plant is shut down now. In its heyday, it used to have more than a thousand employees—far more than a thousand employees. The remnants were there when I visited a year ago. They were struggling, hanging on. They’re gone today. They’re gone, Speaker.", "I drove a little bit west of that, and I visited the former site of the largest power user in all of Ontario. This is the classic example of what the Auditor General told us. Under the Green Energy Act, that failed Green Energy Act that crippled our businesses and hollowed out our manufacturing sector, the Auditor General told us that for every one job created, two to four would be lost elsewhere. I found where he’s talking about. When I was in Timmins, there was this big brownfield. It used to be Xstrata Copper. It used to be the single largest user of power in all of Ontario. Bigger than any car plant, bigger than anything, was Xstrata Copper in Timmins. It’s gone today.", "Don’t forget, the Auditor General, in December, told us that we have paid Quebec and the United States—paid Quebec and the United States—$2.6 billion to take our surplus power. When these guys brought in the Green Energy Act, the previous Auditor General told us in the Legislature, in November 2011—they didn’t know what they were doing. They brought in the Green Energy Act without doing a business plan. There was no idea what this would do in Ontario. They had no idea, as Environment Canada has told us—if you look on OSPE, the Ontario Society of Professional Engineers, they have a paper out on the damage that wind power has done to Ontario. On pages 8, 11 and 12, they will tell you that wind power predominantly makes power at night. Well, they didn’t know that, when they put the Green Energy Act in. So we take this power and we pay Quebec and the States to take it. The Auditor General told us: $2.6 billion, we’ve spent.", "So Quebec has all this cheap power now, that they were paid to take. That’s not even cheap; it’s negative cheap. They knocked on Xstrata Copper’s door—70 kilometres from the Quebec border, if you know your geography—and they lured them across. “Why don’t you cross the border? Come on over for cheap power.” And they did. They crossed the border. They went 115 kilometres and reopened there, and terminated 672 men and women in Timmins, all because Ontario has the highest energy prices in North America and Quebec has amongst the cheapest. It was a no-brainer for them. They popped over, and off they go. They’re at work there now. The 672 men and women no longer have jobs here. That’s what has happened in Ontario.", "We asked, in one of our asks, to lower power rates. What do we get instead? A 15% increase last Friday, 10% coming on November 1, and 10% on January 1. This is what is happening. People are suffering all around. We’ve presented five solutions, and this government didn’t take any of them into account. In the budget, they could have done the right thing. They could have changed the path that we’re on.", "All of the financial institutions warned of what’s happening. They pleaded with them—they begged them—to do the right thing. The Conference Board said they couldn’t balance the budget without spending cuts. What do they do? They increased spending by $2.4 billion.", "In the report from the Ontario Chamber of Commerce—I think the title of the report, should pretty much give you an idea, Speaker. It’s called How Bad Is it?—referring to our economy. They say, “Ontario’s fiscal situation is becoming increasingly dire....” That’s not very nice. They say it’s “likely to reach a state of crisis unless the province cuts spending and changes the ways it does business.”", "You don’t know about this report? Don’t your guys feed you the information? This is just a few months ago. I know they give you talking points, but you should start reading a little bit on your own. Google “How Bad Is It?” They’ll tell you how bad it is, Speaker. They told us only a few months ago how bad it is: It’s dire, a crisis. These are not good words to read in a report from the chamber of commerce.", "After reading their budget, experts now talk of a “deteriorating financial position.” Their financial mismanagement all boils down to the pain they are about to inflict on seniors and families. That’s what is coming: more pain. Again, they continue to make it difficult for Ontario families to pay their bills.", "Speaker, look at the budget deficit this year: $10.9 billion—again, going the wrong way. It was working its way down, albeit terribly slowly. It hits $9.2 billion as a budget deficit one day. They’re crowing about that. Only a Liberal would brag about having a deficit over $9 billion. From there we see it go to $10.5 billion under their tutelage. Then it goes to $10.9 billion. Speaker, it’s going the wrong way. They do not understand what every financial institution in Ontario is telling them: Change the way you’re running the province; you’re running it into the ground. “Dire,” “critical,” “dramatic”: These are all words that financial institutions use.", "Again, they talk about the $130 billion in infrastructure. We know that it was an old announcement: cut and paste, cut and paste.", "Speaker, the ORPP, the Ontario registered pension plan, the new pension tax they’re bringing in: If you look at their own once-secret document that we got in the gas plant scandal hearings—luckily we were able to go through the 300,000 documents and find one particular document that was confidential advice to the Premier—it told her that with the new payroll tax, for every $2 billion you take out of the economy, you lose 18,000 jobs. So if this is a $6-billion program—the one that was passed by the Liberals last Wednesday—that’s 54,000 job losses that the Ministry of Finance predicts we will lose. I’ve used this example several times in the Legislature.", "I was in London several months ago. I ran into a guy I know who has a business with 15 employees. He said, “Vic, let me tell you: When this pension tax comes through, I’m going to fire one of my employees. I’m going to take their salary, and I’m going to use it to pay my 1.9% of their tax. I know that my employees can’t live on an almost 2% wage reduction, so I know they’re going to have to ask for a raise. I’m going to have to top them up as well, so I’m going to have to pay their share as well. Now I’m paying a 3.8% increase. I’m going to fire one guy, use that money to pay the 3.8% tax that’s coming off of me and my employees and tell them that they’re going to have to work harder.”", "That’s the reality: There is no more money in the pockets of businesses, Speaker. It’s just not going to happen.", "But this doesn’t just hurt businesses. It hurts charities, as well. It hurts vital organizations. Think of something like the YMCA, as a good example. All of a sudden, now they’ve got to dig deep into their pockets and into their employees’ pockets to come up with the money for this pension tax. So it’s not only going to hurt business, hurt families, hurt seniors; it’s now going to hurt our charities, it’s going to hurt our volunteer organizations. This is going to just hollow them out like they’ve hollowed out the manufacturing sector in the Green Energy Act.", "Speaker, when you look at some of the numbers here, you can see that our revenue continues to increase—$118 billion this year, $124.4 billion budgeted next, $129.4 billion, $134.4 billion. We don’t have a revenue problem in Ontario. There’s nothing wrong with our revenue. We have a spending problem here. We have a spending problem in Ontario. We tax and we spend.

He’s always a very entertaining speaker and really kept us engaged for a full hour, so that’s to his credit.", "There is one point that he made that I have a fundamental disagreement with, and that is about where the problem is in this budget. He challenges the government and says that the fiscal problems are on the expenditure side, not the revenue side. We disagree. The fiscal problems with this government are on the revenue side. What we see in this budget is nothing to address the lack of quality, affordable child care for children; nothing to address the fact that post-secondary education in this province is more expensive than any other province in Canada—we see university students now paying more than half of university operating costs—nothing to address the shortfalls, the cutbacks in elementary and secondary education. We see program expenditures well below inflation, not being able to take into account population growth across our communities.", "The only solution that we see from the government to deal with the revenue problem is to sell off Hydro One. This has huge repercussions for all Ontarians. It is a huge concern for people in my community. I am receiving overwhelming numbers of emails from constituents who are really concerned about the implications of the privatization of Hydro One and what this is going to do to their hydro bills. We know that electricity in this province is already skyrocketing and is leaving many people feeling more and more challenged and more and more unable to pay the bills." ],

  "text" : [ "Thank you so much, Speaker. I’m happy to focus my 20 minutes on the budget on some of the priorities that are within my portfolio. I will focus my talk on how the budget addresses the pressures in our health care system here in Ontario.", "Just to put it into context, the health budget is the biggest budget of any ministry within our province and it stands right now at close to $50.77 billion. It’s a huge budget. The budget itself has seen an increase of 1.2% compared to last year. This is one of the smallest increases in the health budget that we have seen. Just last year was really tough with an increase of 2.6%. This year is going to be even tougher with a 1.2% increase.", "To put that into context, the CPI, the consumer price index, will increase by 1.2%. That means that any pressure that comes from population growth—and we know that Ontario grows by about the size of PEI every year; maybe 125,000 more join the ranks of Ontarians every year. That is not covered.", "We also know that we have an aging population, which adds a little bit of pressure on our health care system. We usually cost that at about 1%. Sure, the price index will be covered with the 1.2%, but the pressure for population growth and for an aging population—none of that is taken into account.", "If we start with one of the biggest pieces of the pie within the health care system—look at hospitals. Our hospitals have lived with three years of base budget freezes. That is, for the last three years, the base budgets of our hospitals have stayed the same, and this budget announced that we are in for at least one more, and probably two more years. You’re looking at five years of frozen base budgets for hospitals. What does that mean? It means that although the money coming into our hospitals stays the same, the pressure going out continues to go up.", "If you look at things such as drugs: Hospitals do have to have medications to care for the people who go there. The average cost of drugs for hospital drugs goes up between 8% to 10% each and every year. They have to make do with cutting someplace else.", "I’m sure you’ve all seen your electric bill. The electric bills have been skyrocketing. The electricity in the hospital is just as expensive, if not more, than it is in your home. Here again, pressure is going up on the expense side but the revenues are staying the same.", "The cost of wages: Most of the expenses in the hospital—they don’t fabricate widgets; they provide care. Care is provided by people. People need to be compensated for the work that they do. This also puts the pressure up.", "You can see where the expense side of the ledger continues to go up but the revenue side stays flat. What does that mean? That means that the difference between what they take in and the inflation of what they put out has to be balanced.", "How is this balanced? It’s balanced for the first two years of the flat base budget for hospitals. I must say that our hospitals stepped up to the plate. They really looked at, “How can we do things better?” They reinvented many ways of providing care. Some of them struggled from the beginning, but a lot of them were able to bring upon savings in the way that they operated through economies of scale, through streamlining of services, that allowed them to balance those pressures. Although there was no new money coming in and the cost of doing business was going up, they were able to balance that, except for a few.", "Come year 3, which is the year we just ended, 152 of them—every single one of them—had a hard time balancing their budgets. They had such a hard time that they had to start to look at programs and services, as well as personnel. We saw more and more programs that used to be provided within our hospitals—our hospitals that have layers of accountability, oversight, transparency, ombudsmen, patient services—all of this that is part of assuring quality care to patients had been transferred into the community. There is nothing wrong with moving services into the community if the community is able to provide the high-quality care that you put in place, those layers of oversight to ensure quality, but none of that was done. We transferred programs and services into the community, most of the time, in a for-profit environment.", "Those private, for-profit clinics—almost all of them have user fees. What does that mean? That means barriers to access. When you think about medicare, medicare is basically hospital services and physician services for free. They are available to Ontarians based on need, not on ability to pay. But the minute you move it into the community, you are not covered by medicare anymore. You are now into the private realms, and a lot of extra cost creeps in.", "All of a sudden, for your colonoscopy, you will need to talk to a dietitian, and that will cost you $45. And for your cataract surgery: “Well, that scan is not covered, but you really need it. That will be 200 bucks.” “Those lenses are not covered, and they’ll be 300 bucks each.” What would have been a free-to-you, based-on-care—not on ability to pay—service in the hospital is now delivered in the community, but you have to pay. If you have the money, I figure it’s not that bad. But for a lot of people, it is a barrier to access.", "All of a sudden, our health care system, which we are so proud of, is being dismantled brick by brick, private clinic by private clinic. This budget does nothing to change that trend. This budget brings flatlined revenue to our hospitals while their cost pressures continue to go up.", "The efficiencies that could be found have been found. We are at the point where we are cutting programs, we are cutting services and we are cutting staff. We are now at over 250 nursing positions alone that have been lost to the system.", "I raise my hat to a lot of hospital corporations that understand how important it is to have good nurses. They have gone out of their way to make sure that they issue as few pink slips as possible and that they keep their staff. I’m really happy to see the amount of respect that most hospitals have shown the nurses and the other people who work within the hospital walls, so that nobody would be kicked to the curb—although some of them were.", "But what’s really happening is, the minute that somebody retires, moves to a new job, goes on maternity leave or is sick and the positions become open—they do not backfill. What ends up happening is they open positions that are casual and on call. There are lots of jobs for nurses, all right. There are lots of jobs that work weekends, statutory holidays, Friday nights and Saturday nights, and the rest of the time you sit by the phone and you wait for that phone call—not good care, not good jobs. This has been going on throughout our hospitals. We can foresee that for the next two years, the same thing will be going on.", "But I’ve gone way too long just on hospitals.", "The next thing in the budget that is being cut is drugs. We know that the budget has identified $200 million per year in savings on drugs. I call that a $200-million cut to the drug budget, although I can’t understand, because this year alone, if you look, we spent $93 million more on drugs than we had budgeted for, and now in the budget we say that we will cut $200 million. In my mind, that’s really $293 million that we will cut from what we spent in the last year, and this will come by changing coverage and reimbursement of certain products. Well, I’ve been a politician long enough to know that means that some of the drugs that are covered now won’t be covered anymore.", "Who will be the winners? Who will be the losers? I don’t know. But I can tell you that Epilepsy Ontario sent out a five-star alarm last week because there are serious shortages of some of the drugs that people with epilepsy need. As well, Ontario sort of stands out right now, with people having to pay out of pocket for oral cancer drugs if they are taken in their homes.", "That was rather surprising, because we had a Minister of Health who is eloquent as to the need for pharmacare. We are housing here in Ontario the pan-Canadian group that looks at drug purchasing. All of the research coming out is telling us that if we were to have pharmacare—that is, the cost of drugs would be covered like a visit to a physician or a visit to the hospital—it would actually save the system, and the calculation, kind of middle of the road for Ontario, is close to $1 billion. In the worst-case scenario, we would break even.", "We have the resources here in Ontario to look at this, but did we see in the budget something positive to move our health care system forward? Not at all. We saw the opposite. We saw a $200-million cut to the Ontario Drug Benefit Program that is already $93 million in the hole, so not going in the right direction.", "When we look at laboratory services, it is a $50-million cut that is in the budget for lab services. This is always worrisome, given that most diagnostics are often based on lab tests. If those lab tests are not available anymore, it becomes more and more difficult to do diagnostics.", "If you look at the Assistive Devices Program—this is if you need a hearing aid, a walker, an electric wheelchair, a communication board or any kind of assistive device—they are planning a $20-million cut in that program. This is also worrisome, because as the population ages, one of the ways to support them in their houses is through assistive devices: Make sure they don’t fall, make sure they have grab bars, make sure they have the support around so that as they age and become frailer, they can stay in their homes safely. But we’re not looking at improving that, Speaker. We’re looking at cutting $20 million, and in the budget it says specifically for mobility devices. This is a problem. But we had the opportunity to do better.", "If you look at colostomy patients, they have had the same amount of reimbursement since 1993. If anybody can figure out a way to pay 1993 prices for colostomy supplies, please let us know. I can tell you that I have shopped around in my community to find the cheapest, and none of them are the same price they were 22 years ago. That was an opportunity to change, but here again we are seeing it go in the opposite direction, with a cut of $20 million in that program.", "If you look at home and community care, there is some good news there. In home and community care, they are making a $750-million investment. The investment in home and community care is really focused on complex care. What we do in Ontario is that we leave elderly people in their homes with very, very little support. The typical scenario is that they don’t eat properly, they don’t take their meds properly, they are very isolated, they get dizzy, they fall, they break a hip and they end up in the emergency department. From the emergency department, they get admitted into our hospitals. The hip gets fixed all right, but then they need a ton of support to go back home.", "If you look at what Quebec does, Quebec invests less money than we do in home care, but they do this up front. The minute you turn 75, you get a friendly visit that comes to your home. They look around as to, “How do we make sure you take your medications properly, that you eat properly, that you are supported, that you have the grab bars and walking aids to make sure you don’t have a fall?” It’s a whole lot cheaper to do that kind of upfront prevention with older, frailer people than it is to pay to support them.", "If you look at where the $750 million will go, it goes with a patient with complex care needs. It goes to 69 community health links. I have no problem with community health links. They are there to look after people who have very, very high needs. But you see the trend, Speaker. The trend is that we don’t invest in basic disease prevention and health promotion for elderly seniors. We wait until they get into trouble to start to support them. A little bit of support ahead of a traumatic injury or a traumatic turn of events in their life would go a whole lot further in keeping them happy and safer. After a fall, they are always—we’re human beings. You’ve fallen, you’ve hurt yourself and you ended up in the hospital. They will be fearful, and this is wrong. A lot of this could have been prevented with a little bit of health care dollars focused on prevention, but it is not there.", "My God, 20 minutes goes by fast, eh, Speaker?", "I also see that for the PSWs, there had been a promise of $4 more an hour. Everybody understood that. Last year, they were getting $1.50, this year $1.50, and next year $1, to make a total of $4. Now, when we push a little bit, it’s like, “It will be $4 over three years, but we don’t really know when the next $1.50 is going to come.” When we don’t really know, I will assume that it’s because it’s not coming this year, and God knows when it will come.", "We talk about—there is still lots. I wanted to talk about primary care. Primary care is the door that opens the door. It’s the people that you see when you need care. They are family physicians, nurse practitioners, either in an aboriginal health access centre, in a community health centre, in a family health team, in a nurse-practitioner-led clinic. Those are all different models of primary health care.", "Well, the family health teams have been put on hold, with a trickling of replacement workers in there, and God knows where they will go. They’re supposed to go to areas of high needs, but those areas have not been shared with anybody. It’s causing a lot of grief with new physicians that have trained, that are ready to join teams. This is what they want to do. This is what we want them to do. Now there are no positions opening up in those family health teams because the government has put a moratorium on them.", "If you look at the community health centres, family health teams and nurse practitioner-led clinics, there’s a wage gap disparity that is just unbelievable. A nurse-practitioner-led clinic first started in Sudbury, right next to where I was working. We are really proud of them. They do a very good job. But they can’t recruit and retain a stable workforce because they are the lowest-paid nurse practitioners in the entire system. They can go to the hospital, they can go to the CCACs, they can go to the LHINs—they can go pretty well anywhere—and make $20,000 to $30,000 more to do pretty much the exact same job, and, I would tell you, in some cases with a whole lot less responsibility than when you have your own caseload. This needed to be addressed. There’s not a peep about this in the budget.", "Unfortunately, I still had lots more to say about the cuts to health care but I’ve run out of time. Thank you for listening to me." ],

Those are people who do not have direct access to a primary care provider. The number is actually staggering when you think about it: 35,000. With our investments since 2003 continuing in this budget—the health care budget again going up—the number of people now referred to as orphan patients in our area is down to 13,000 or thereabouts. It’s not my number; that’s an OMA number.", "There has been significant progress made on this front, primarily due to the hiring of new doctors—5,600 more doctors than in 2003—24,000 more nurses working than in 2003, the opening of nurse practitioner clinics for the first time in the history of the province of Ontario, family health teams, and expanding our community health centres. A variety of policy initiatives have helped to bring that number down significantly. There is still more work to be done, but great work being done so far.", "As well on infrastructure—I mentioned this briefly last week—the plant in my riding, Bombardier, when we were elected, had 200 to 250 people working in it. That plant is now up to 1,400 people, an increase of 1,200 people being employed in that plant, directly connected to our investments in infrastructure. The previous government was not committed to it. That was their policy choice. That was fine. We came in. We have made a series of massive investments in mass transit infrastructure. That has led directly to 1,200 more people working at the plant in Thunder Bay, having a huge, positive impact on the economy of Thunder Bay and the surrounding area." ],

In fact, this past week I was at meetings with long-term-care health professionals in our riding who can’t find help or can’t afford to pay them, which is something that the member mentioned. A lot of these health care workers can go to agencies that have been set up by this government and they’ll automatically receive $20,000 or $30,000 raises for doing much the same work. So they’re in a real conundrum right now.", "Also, we have health care workers, as we have just found out in my riding, who had full-time jobs and are now being cut back to three days a week, in some cases, in our hospitals. It has nothing to do with not wanting to give the quality of care that they wish to give; it’s about the government’s flatlining of the monies that they give to our hospitals in the last year. It’s going to continue on, certainly with this budget.", "Hospitals share the same things as industries do; certainly energy costs. Energy costs have risen, and they are carrying all these other costs. I believe the member mentioned that pharmaceuticals are going up, yet the health care system is flatlined. So how are these CEOs of hospitals and other institutions to balance their books? They start laying off people or they don’t hire people or they cut wages or they cut them back to part-time instead of full-time.", "I can understand the frustration that the member from Nickel Belt showed in her comments, but again, if we hadn’t had the mismanagement of our finances over the last number of years like we’ve had with this government over here, certainly we might have been looking at a different situation." ],

If you’re only putting $10 billion or $11 billion over 10 years—and I’ll have to check with the member from Essex, but I believe the cost of the proposed new hospital, the mega hospital in Windsor, is close to $1.5 billion—and there are 40 projects out there, obviously there’s not going to be enough money to finalize all of these projects that are in the pipeline at one stage or another.", "We all know that with an aging population and outdated hospitals we need more facilities, and you save money in the long run when you build new facilities. You give them all different flooring, geometric—you get them all set up so that you can handle more patients with fewer staff and you don’t have to pay as much for air conditioning, heat and all of that.

I will be sharing my time with the members from Mississauga–Streetsville, Etobicoke–Lakeshore and Ottawa South.", "It’s my pleasure to rise in the House today to speak about Bill 91, the Building Ontario Up Act. Our government has always been committed to putting Ontarians first and ensuring that the future of our province is as bright and prosperous as possible. This is why we have moved forward on unlocking provincial assets to support the largest infrastructure investment in Ontario’s history, and it is why we are building Ontario up by investing in priorities that raise Ontarians’ standard of living by creating jobs, expanding opportunity and growing our economy.", "The positive reaction and feedback from many individuals and organizations across our province regarding our budget goes to show that people not only understand, but respect the decisions we are making to help Ontario thrive. In my riding of Burlington, our mayor, Rick Goldring, had the following to say about our budget, “We are especially pleased to see the commitment to renewing and expanding public infrastructure. The investment in transit, particularly the planned electrification of GO Transit trains and 15-minute service on the Lakeshore West line in the next five to 10 years will benefit our residents, as well as serve as an added attraction for business investment in our city. The budget also reaffirms the province’s commitment to the redevelopment and expansion of Joseph Brant Hospital.”", "Over the past year, I’ve had the opportunity to speak with a diverse range of stakeholders in our community about what kind of city we want and how, working together, we can bring that to fruition. Whether speaking with our business community, youth or seniors, these conversations have all underscored a common theme: the need for investments in transit and transportation infrastructure in Burlington and the greater Toronto and Hamilton area.", "When we look at how to best attract jobs and investment, how to move goods to market and how to connect communities, investments in transportation infrastructure, including investments in transit and active transportation, are front and centre. We know that people who live in communities where they have a choice of travel options, including transit and active travel, as I mentioned—these communities and their citizens not only enjoy health and environmental benefits from increased exercise and cleaner air, but they also enjoy increased economic stability and productivity.", "Recently, I had the opportunity to hear from transit users in our community at a local forum organized by Burlington for Accessible Sustainable Transit, or BFAST. Residents shared their transit experiences, including some of the things we’re doing well in Burlington, as well as areas of needed improvement. We heard from seniors, youth, daily commuters and people with physical disabilities about the importance of continued access to and investment in transit and active transportation options likes cycling and walking. This was a rich opportunity to engage with citizens in Burlington, and it underscored the ongoing need for transit investments in our community.", "This budget puts forward a comprehensive plan to make an unprecedented investment of more than $130 billion in public infrastructure over the next 10 years—an overdue investment indeed. This includes increasing the dedicated funding for Moving Ontario Forward to $31.5 billion over 10 years and investing $16 billion in transit projects in the GTHA. This increase is made possible by our higher target from the province’s asset optimization plan and means that residents in Burlington will benefit from improvements to services across the GO Transit network, including a transition to electrified regional express rail and moving service on the Lakeshore West GO line to two-way, all-day service every 15 minutes.", "This will help members of my community get to work and school, and get them home sooner. It will also serve to reduce the number of cars on the road, reducing traffic congestion, and since 20% of GHG emissions come from the transportation sector, this will also serve to mitigate the impacts of climate change.", "Health care is another topic of frequent conversation with my constituents. Ontario is investing in our province’s and in Burlington’s future by committing $11 billion in hospital capital grants over 10 years. Construction has already begun on the redevelopment of Joseph Brant Hospital. I am so proud of that, because this is the first investment in our hospital in 44 years. This will include a new seven-storey tower and renovations to existing space to accommodate expanded in-patient and ambulatory services, with completion in 2018.", "Attracting jobs and investment to Burlington includes a focus on our young people. I know this is a preoccupation for parents in my riding. Ontario students are key to our province’s economic future. Investments in education lead to a competitive workforce that responds to labour market demands.", "The government is investing $20 million to launch Experience Ontario, a new pilot program that will support graduating high school students to better identify future goals, choose the most appropriate post-secondary education and succeed once they enrol.", "When it comes to our economic security and vitality, Ontario is on target to balance the budget by 2017-18 as a result of sound fiscal management, controlling spending and a relentless focus on finding smarter and better ways to deliver services. This year marks the sixth year in a row that program spending is expected to be lower than forecast. In fact, Ontario has the lowest-cost government per capita in the country.", "In closing, investing in infrastructure and in the skills of our greatest asset, our people—and in particular our young people—while at the same time managing a careful review of our assets, as well as a prudent review of how we invest taxpayer dollars, requires leadership and a steady hand.", "Ontarians elected us to build Ontario up and that is exactly what we are doing.

Since 2011, CAA Insurance has been offering a winter tire discount to its policyholders. These chances not only provide drivers with an incentive to equip their vehicle with four matching winter tires, but it will help to keep Ontario’s roads and road users safe during the winter season.”", "On the health care front, the Registered Practical Nurses Association of Ontario has said, “RPNAO supports a number of the health care initiatives put forward by the provincial government, including its continued funding for mental health and addiction services, and additional support to improve the quality of palliative care in Ontario. We’re also encouraged by the government’s commitment to have all categories of nurses work to their full scope of practice, reflecting the understanding that RPNs are highly skilled professionals that are part of the solution to the challenges facing health care. These are all positive steps that we applaud.”", "Earlier this afternoon, I had the privilege of attending a Transport Futures conference, just down the road, and to be part of the panel with my colleagues from the Progressive Conservative Party and the New Democratic Party, as well as a member of the Ontario Green Party. That panel was to discuss P3s. Mr. Speaker, you’ll be pleased to hear that all panel members—from every party—agreed that there is an infrastructure deficit and that we need to continue to invest more in infrastructure.", "You will be pleased also to hear that, in fact, my colleagues from across the floor also indicated that P3s, alternative financing and procurement, is a suitable way to build this infrastructure. There was remarkable agreement. There are some challenges, and there is some disagreement about precisely how we do it, but there was agreement that we need to build infrastructure and that the government is on the right track to build the infrastructure and to create the services that Ontarians need.", "I’m happy to yield the floor to my colleague from Ottawa South, Mr. Speaker." ],

How do we ensure that our children and our children’s children have some retirement security?", "I appreciate the commentary, but I do have to say that I really don’t want to leave the environment to our grandchildren.

It meant more than half a million Ontarians didn’t see their careers torched. It also meant that Ontario emerged from the recession, by which I mean recovered all of the jobs lost during the recession, more than three years ahead of the United States.", "What are Ontario’s options in this budget to stay competitive with infrastructure? There aren’t that many. Let’s look at some of the ones that have been discussed in this Legislature.", "Number one is to do nothing. That’s what the parties opposite would have us do: Just ignore the problem.", "Number two: Raise taxes.", "Number three: Borrow more money.", "Number four: Disassemble health care and education. We’re not interested in that.", "Let’s just quickly look at those options.", "Doing nothing doesn’t mean that things stay the same. It means they get worse as roads and sewers, transit, electricity generation and transmission, public facilities, all of those things that we need, decay from neglect and become more expensive to either build or renew, and also are used by millions more people as our population will increase. Yet this is what the PCs and the NDP would have Ontario do. Doing nothing is an irresponsible non-starter.", "Raising general taxes and borrowing money are also non-starters. Though Ontarians pay some of the lowest taxes in North America and in Europe, your price of good government can’t be out of sync with the neighbouring states and jurisdictions here in North America. They are now low, and Ontario will not give away that competitive advantage.", "Similarly, the extra borrowing that enabled millions of Ontario families to stay afloat during the worst recession since the Great Depression also means that Ontario needs to return to the type of structural surplus that this province had in 2006, 2007 and 2008, on a Liberal watch, to bring down our accumulated debt.", "Finally, cannibalizing what Ontario has made viable and world-class to build what Ontario currently needs is a zero sum robbing of Peter to pay Paul.", "That’s why this budget approaches investing in transit in the way it does. It means southern Ontario won’t choke on its traffic. It means Ontario will balance its budget on time and again resume paying down the accumulated debt. It also means that public services rebuilt so painstakingly in the last 12 years will be preserved. That’s the Ontario that we expect." ],

We were just on a panel on the value of P3s and the questions that are out there. Obviously, the Auditor General raised a lot of questions, and so this conversation has been very welcome for us.", "At the panel, though, I did raise the issue of the lowest bidder, because this is a huge concern, I think, and I raised the issue of qualitative bidding for the province of Ontario. We have so many examples of how the process is not working, how this province is not making the sound financial decisions going forward. That’s because they’ve really accelerated a privatization agenda which is not serving the people of this province.", "I look at the most recent Auditor General’s report, the winter highway maintenance—this just came out last week. On this one particular issue around procuring the lowest-bidding contractor: It can cost more in the long run. It’s right there in black and white. I really hope that this government is paying attention. She notes, “We noted one case where the second-lowest bidder for a contract had a much greater equipment complement than the lowest bidder, which won the contract. Specifically, for an annual contract price of only $700,000.... ” But then it turned out that they didn’t have the equipment to do the job, and it ended up costing the ministry $1.7 million for 13 additional pieces of equipment. So the due diligence, the financial oversight, was not there.", "It’s a growing trend. Actually, this Auditor General’s report builds on the last AG report, where we found out that we paid an extra $6.5 billion in financing costs. The province should not be borrowing money at credit card rates when we can borrow money at the lowest interest rates in the history of the province.", "So I really do urge the government, in the face of this budget, to look at their processes and their practices of contracting out and privatizing." ],

The thing that has been most interesting to my constituents, and actually, I think, to your constituents, Speaker, as well, is that included in that transportation and transit infrastructure budget is the funding to complete the four-laning of Highway 7 between Kitchener and Guelph. That’s a project in which there’s a lot of local interest, including in Wellington county, which is getting quite fed up with all the traffic over county roads trying to avoid the current congested highway. So this is welcome in both your constituency and mine, Speaker.", "The other project, of course, that has gotten a lot of attention in your riding and mine is the GO service along the Kitchener route. With this budget, we will be increasing the number of trains on that route. The travel time will actually get shorter because some of the improvements that are being made on the east end of the route from Bramalea—once they actually get to Bramalea, it will be express service. I don’t know about you, but one of the things I’ve heard from folks in Guelph is that while they love having the trains, they do take a long time when they have to stop at absolutely every stop. So the fact that it will be express partway in will really shorten the trip.", "The next time I get a chance to comment, I’d love to tell you about the infrastructure in the Minister of Education’s budget.

I’m going to continue to try to bring the things of this budget that were challenging for me, and more importantly, challenging to the people that I’ve been given the privilege and honour to represent in this House. We did not see any reduction in hydro rates. In fact, with this fire sale of Hydro one, we believe, at the end of the day, the taxpayer, the senior on fixed income, most of our utilities, those administrations like hospitals and schools are going to be paying even more. The small business owner, who is the engine of our economy, is going to be paying more. The senior on a fixed income, the people from Community Living, those less fortunate people across all—as critic I have the privilege of representing community and social services and long-term care and seniors. They are going to be paying much more in hydro rates because of this fire sale.", "We did not see a reduction of the debt. I’m going to say this at every opportunity I get to stand in this House and speak: $11 billion a year is spent by this government on debt and interest payments. That has not come down. We had to see something in there indicating that number was going to come down because people are not, then, getting the services they deserve and have paid into, things like the least fortunate—I had a group of parents come to me and ask me to attend a meeting of theirs. They are parents of children, mostly adult children that are in community and social services, particularly in Community Living. Up until this point in their lives, they’ve been able to stay at home and live with them and they’ve been able to provide care for them. But they’re advancing in age, and they’re starting to worry, “Where will my child go if something happens to me?” We’re all going to get to that same destination, so it’s a very valid point. They ask me, “How can a government stand here and spend $11 billion on interest payments but not give me some assurance that my son or daughter is actually going to have a facility and programs and services to provide long-term care for them?”", "I have seniors coming to me every day, saying, “I cannot afford to keep my hydro on because I just don’t have the ability to pay those bills.” It saddens me to tell them that on May 1 they actually just incurred another 15% increase. Again, I believe my colleague from Nipissing said we’re going to have another 10% in November and yet another 10% in January after that. That’s 35% interest just in hydro, which we all have to have.", "We talk about health care and schools. These hydro rates are going to have significant impacts on places like our hospitals, because if the hydro rate keeps going up there, they’re on fixed income and they have to balance the budget, unlike the Ontario Liberal government that does not believe in balancing a budget. They keep purporting they will. Almost every agency out there suggests that that’s probably not going to be the reality.", "I really struggle with where they’re going. The budget certainly didn’t address a lot of the concerns that the people of Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound talked to me about.", "They did not reduce their addiction to overspending. Again, this budget, even after the last time we told them we can’t support you spending more than you take in. No family, no individual, no company in my riding can spend more than they bring in each year and stay in business or stay in their home. You have to make the mortgage payment.", "We had lots of reaction from industry, and I’m going to quote a couple of those. “The potential damage of the ORPP to youth employment must be a priority. This tax on jobs will hurt youth first, at a time when youth unemployment is already high....", "“While we applaud the government for being the first to make changes, there is limited benefit to our industry. Major brewers will still be able to gouge our members with higher-than-retail prices, with only low-volume licensees escaping their grip.”", "That was James Rilett, vice president of Restaurants Canada, a group well-known to us.", "The Ontario Chamber of Commerce: “The government has implemented or announced several new initiatives that will have a direct impact on business, including the introduction of a cap-and-trade system and the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan.", "“The OCC calls on government to consider the negative impact that the ORPP could have on job creation, foreign direct investment, and the economy in general.”", "The Canadian Federation of Independent Business: “Instead of stimulating job creation and growth in small and medium-sized businesses, the province is hurting independent business owners and employees by moving forward with its pension plan, a disguised payroll tax.”", "Dr. Ved Tandan, president of the Ontario Medical Association: “The government’s budget continues to drastically underfund health care—that’s a problem for patients and it’s a problem for doctors. There are 900,000 people in this province without a family doctor”—900,000 people—“and the population continues to grow and age—this budget ignores both that growth and that unmet need and that’s unacceptable.”", "Finally, Donna Rubin, CEO, Ontario Association of Non-Profit Homes and Services for Seniors: “Clearly, long-term care was far from a priority in this budget. It’s particularly disheartening because this is by no means a new need. This is the same target recommended in the government-commissioned Sharkey report on long-term care in 2008, and that same report recommended that 4.0 hours of care be achieved by 2012. The target was right then, and it is right now, yet we are still not there.”", "A sad state of affairs, Mr. Speaker.", "The government likes to talk a fair game about government accountability, openness and transparency, but the fact that they never really embraced these tenets is why this administration is in the deep trouble it is today.

Mr. Speaker, it’s a bit of pixie dust at the very best.", "They spent $7 million on consultants who advised them that they were broke and they need to start selling public assets to keep afloat. How can they justify that to a person who can’t find mental health and addiction services? How can they justify it to the people who come in to my office with children who need special services, and I have to tell them, “This government, the Liberals, will not be able to provide those because they spent $7 million on consultants”?", "Just even in my own critic role, again, we’ve had the rollout of SAMS. We were told in estimates committee that $240 million would be the top dollar that would be spent; that would be the total. We’re now at $272 million and counting, and guess what, Mr. Speaker? They hired yet another consultant to tell them.", "Last week, I stayed here on Friday to hear that report come out. They’ve admitted that it has been a failure, but still no recourse for the families. They have 19 recommendations. Well, recommendations don’t pay the hydro bill. They don’t put food on the table for those poor families who can’t afford both of those necessities in life.", "I’m not sure where they dreamed up half of this stuff. I’m not certain I trust. We’ve been asking them for a fully laid-out business plan of where this is going to work and how the numbers are all going to work. In my three years, we’ve asked for that on a number of projects and never received that, so I’m not certain that the people of Ontario are really going to buy it.", "A number of my constituents are certainly not in support of the plan to liquidate Hydro One and send their hydro rates through the roof yet again. It should be noted here that legally today—the law was written that if you were to sell an asset such as Ontario Hydro, 100% of the money is supposed to go to pay off the debt of that asset. In this case, there is a $27-billion debt, and they’re going to take $9 billion—what they’re estimating for a sale price—and hive off $4 billion to pay for transit.", "Certainly transit is a huge issue and something that needs to happen here, but the law is the law, and they can’t continue to break the law. At the end of the day, they need to abide by the laws of our province. They have four unprecedented investigations by the OPP into certain illicit behaviours that have been alleged against them, and yet here they are again—blatantly, in a budget document—breaking the law. It simply isn’t acceptable.", "I’m going to quote a resident, Michelle from Meaford in my riding: “I have yet to see evidence of any benefit for Ontario residents” in regard to the sale in that situation.", "Kyle Hun from Hanover said, “The Liberals must undertake a consultative process and provide all of us with an opportunity to express our concerns.” We’ve seen that with a number of issues in here, Mr. Speaker: that there has typically been very little, if any, consultation with the stakeholder. I certainly hope they’re going to do that again, but I am not certain.", "I received a call the other day from a fellow by the name of Al Diggins, of the Excellence in Manufacturing Consortium, a good friend. One of his board members is Jim McCoubrey, who owns Troy Life. They install sprinklers across the country. They were very particular in their concern with changes that are going to impact manufacturers in the industry in regard to apprenticeship programs. They’ve reduced it from $10,000 to $5,000 and from four years to three years. They’re saying, “How am I going to entice new apprentices into this business,” when you’re going in the opposite direction from where they believe, as an industry, it needs to be going? The hikes that they’re also concerned about in regard to hydro are going to leave them in the darkness.", "Rate increases are also forcing cuts, as I’ve said earlier, in classrooms, hospitals and long-term-care homes. At the end of the day, there’s only so much money. Salaries, benefits—all of those types of things which those people who work in those facilities deserve; they’re hard-working, very caring individuals. You have to pay your utilities, and at the end of the day something has to give, because they, again, have to balance budgets—something a bit foreign to this government.", "Some 60 families in my riding of Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound had their utilities disconnected in the fall of 2014 because they could not afford these Liberal energy rates. Your sale of Hydro One is doomed to drive rates a lot higher. So what is the Premier’s advice to low-income families, frail seniors and public institutions who can’t afford the rates anymore? Where exactly should they cut to make up the impact of their hydro increases?", "Many, many years ago, when you were on the side of the Ontario public, your party leader said, “[Premier] Ernie Eves may be poised to sell off Hydro One in a desperate bid to get cash so he can throw money at the electricity crisis he has created.” Who knew that only six years later that same Liberal leader would pour billions of dollars into misguided efforts to create an alternative or green energy industry in Ontario and, as a result, let rates soar so high that they forced some of Ontario’s families to have their power turned off because of the unaffordability?", "Let’s not forget last week: General Motors is not stopping making cars; they’re just stopping making them in Oshawa. I believe we also have a firm in eastern Ontario, Goodyear, that is leaving as well, 1,000 jobs in, I believe, my colleague Randy Hillier’s riding, Lanark-Addington-Lennox—I can’t get all of them. It’s very sad, Mr. Speaker.", "We continue to see money wasted, we continue to see overspending and we don’t see them changing tack very much at all.", "This afternoon, very interestingly, I introduced a private member’s bill, An Act to amend the Election Finances Act with respect to third-party election advertising. It was interesting, as part of the notes I created there, that in the budget there is a section—by the way, I want to assure that this isn’t just something Bill Walker has dreamt up. The Elections Ontario officer has asked for this in two reports. He sees it as a glaring concern to ensure that democracy is in fact respected here.", "I have asked the government to put laws in place that will put a $150,000 spending limit and $3,000 per riding, and that anyone in non-compliance with that law, if it was to be enacted, would actually not be able to participate as a registered lobby group or third-party interest group in the next election. We have to ensure that it’s a level and fair playing field.", "I’m going to quote from the budget. This is their line: “Informed by the report of the Chief Electoral Officer, the province will also move to strengthen rules around election-related, third-party advertising to protect the public interest.” I’m challenging the Premier and her caucus members to actually vote for my bill to ensure there is fairness and that all people can participate in democracy in a fair way.", "Interestingly, on the same page, page 223 of the 2015 Ontario budget, the government started to do things in regard to government advertising. What they suggest they’re going to do—if you read their words, it doesn’t really say this, but what it really means is that they’re again taking ability away from the Auditor General to be a watchdog in regard to election advertising. They’re going to tweak some words that allow them to bring someone from the community and purport how well the government is doing.", "It’s an abuse, in my opinion, and it shouldn’t be something that should go through. It’s something that I hope they will actually look at with true openness and accountability and respect of democracy in our great province, and vote for that budget bill at the end of the day—sorry, not the budget bill but my private member’s bill.", "This budget has continued to concern me in a number of ways. The Financial Administration Act makes it so that new accounting regulations cannot be imposed on Hydro One. How can this be in the spirit of accountability, openness and transparency? How can they think this going to allow the public to have greater trust in them? The Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, schedule 13, exempts the ORPP Administration Corp. and Hydro One from freedom-of-information requests.", "This government has doubled the entire debt of our great province in their 13-year reign of experiments and terror. They have a debt and a deficit level that are unprecedented, and yet they want to actually put in a pension plan, and they want people to believe, “You can trust us as the financial gurus of the country.”", "What they’re failing to tell the good people of Ontario—they have kind of tried to use one-liners that say everyone deserves a pension. What they maybe should be is frank with the people and say when this pension will be payable. At very best guess it’s probably 30 to 40 years down the road, and that is if they were to manage it properly.", "I would suggest, too, that there is a lot of doubt in the community—certainly in my community of Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound—that these folks can manage any kind of finances. At the end of the day, it will be yet another boondoggle. They’re trying to build another revenue source for themselves so they can continue their addiction to their spending ways.", "I want to go back to some of the things, in my last couple of minutes here, and just recount. We wanted to see a reduction in hydro rates. We wanted to see a reduction of debt. They spend $11 billion on interest. That gets us nothing at the front line for our seniors, for low-income folks, for people on fixed incomes and certainly for people from Community Living, who again have come to me almost in tears asking what is going to happen to their adult children when they pass on.", "Our health care and our schools are going to be impacted, not to mention small businesses. Small businesses across my riding are suggesting, “You’re going to add a payroll tax to me. You’re going to add in the pension tax. You’re going to add in cap-and-trade,” or carbon, whatever tax you want to call it. They are at the end of their limit. How do we do this? Particularly the hydro rates that are going to double and triple again over the next four years—we’ve seen no ability for them to actually honestly step up and say, “We’re going to stop overspending. We know that we have to cap—”", "They have a fiscal plan, so they say, in this budget, but again, Vic Fedeli is very clear when he says they pulled that out of the air. There is no plan. They just pulled some numbers and want the great taxpayers and citizens of this province to believe that they are good managers of money. We all know that’s not the fact; that’s not certainly the case in their 12 or 13 years. At the end of the day, they have taken a lot of accountability, they’ve taken a lot of transparency, and the people of Ontario, I think at the end of this budget, are going to be worse off, which is hard to believe after last year’s budget.", "I started my remarks by saying it’s Groundhog Day. The same old, same old: They’re going to spend more, they’re going to tax more, and at the end of the day, the people of Ontario are going to continue to pay through the nose for their inefficient and misguided direction." ],

It was the worst thing that ever happened to our city, Stoney Creek.", "We also created all of the middlemen. We had the guys who would—transmission, storage and all these other things. Well, guess what, folks? In my last hydro bill that I got from Ontario Hydro, the transmission, storage and delivery was more than my usage. I never thought I would see the day, but that’s where it’s at now.", "Is Hydro in trouble? It is in trouble. Did they have to do something? Yes, they had to do something; however, to put it in the hands of privatization is not a good thing because I saw that in the 1990s. We had all these middle companies step up to the plate, and these companies have been a disaster. Now, what these people are doing is handing it over again to the private sector—only a percentage, according to them, but that 60% will end up having the vote over the 40% eventually, and we’ll end up with no say.", "I’ll tell you right now, folks, mark my words—you heard it here first: Hydro will not go down in costs. Expenses are going to go up in the private sector for us. We’re going to pay probably the highest hydro rates in North America by the time this fiasco is done. Give it five years; give it six years. You can go back to this speech and remember me saying this, because I said it in the 1990s when they did it, and look where we are. That’s going to happen, trust me. I could say a lot more about this and I will later on if I ever get to speak to this. But I’ll tell you right now, history is a good teacher, and obviously people are not paying attention to history." ],

I know we have issues in my riding as well. The member from Newmarket–Aurora was quoting a number of those people who were applauding the budget.

Their infrastructure is in a real mess. What they basically said was, “No, no, no. Tough luck.

It’s interesting that this government—sadly, I don’t see the person here today who probably wants to answer to these.

It’s called Building Ontario Up, and I think that is a contradiction in and of itself, because there are measures contained within this budget that will have a long-standing negative effect on the economy of this province, on the people of this province, and ultimately on the social fabric that all of us, I think, care about.", "Because the major thrust of it obviously is built around privatizing a strategic public asset in Hydro One, a lot of my comments are going to be focused around why that decision is the wrong decision. I certainly hope that the government side is listening, because I’m going to challenge the math on that deal.", "I’m also going to be talking, of course, about the ORPP Administration Corp. and the concerns that we have around how the government is moving forward in potentially creating a private-public pension fund, which is not what they promised, obviously, in the last platform.", "I’m going to be talking about the Taxation Act and some of the cuts to the tax credits, which will have a negative impact on some of the things that are actually going well in the province of Ontario. It shouldn’t all be about negativity; it should be about trying to find some consensus.", "The major thrust, though, that I have to bring to this discussion is the feedback I have received around the sale of Hydro One. I know our leader, Andrea Horwath, was in Kingston this last weekend and travelling around southeastern Ontario. I think the feedback that she got is that a lot of people did not know the full impact of this decision, if they knew that it was going to be happening. I think there is a responsibility that we all share to ensure that people have the right information going forward.", "Certainly with Bill 91, the main thrust, as I said, focuses on treating Hydro One and its subsidiaries as non-public entities. The implications of this, I’m going to get into in a little bit. But I think one of the major problems for us as New Democrats is that the decision to sell Hydro One will have long-standing impacts on the revenues that the province brings in from that public asset. It will obviously affect the reliability of service. If we can learn anything from the past, the decision to sell off the 407 has had a drastic impact. It still resonates with people each and every day. When they drive it and they get their bill, it obviously is a tangible thing that connects—they often say that an enraged electorate is an engaged electorate. I’m sure there are a lot of people on the 407 who are avoiding the infrastructure deficit in the province of Ontario. That is an issue; there’s no doubt about it. But to have the government stand up, day in and day out, and say, “We’re going to do something about this” after 13 years of being in this place is a bit of a slap.", "We are definitely concerned with why the sale of Hydro One is being accelerated. It is being accelerated. There are some schedules in this bill which actually fast-track the lack of oversight over Hydro One even before it is sold.", "I think I’m going to that one first. I’m going to take on this growing trend by the government to remove oversight. I understand sometimes why they’re so concerned about that increased scrutiny and oversight into these public institutions and public assets. One has only to look at the Auditor General’s reports that have come forward, from the last AG and this current AG, on the way infrastructure is funded—she has raised some serious concerns; you may not like it; those concerns are shared by a lot of people in this province—and the AG report most recently on road maintenance.", "The role that independent officers of this Legislature play in exposing inconsistencies and, quite honestly, sometimes incompetencies of the government of the day, regardless of who it is, is so important. I think the fact that this budget has schedules which accelerate the lack of oversight—there’s no other way to put it. The moment even one single share of Hydro One is sold, Hydro One will not be deemed an agency of the crown any longer, and schedule 3 strips the Auditor General of powers. No more value-for-money audits over there. We will not have that oversight, as individual legislators, nor will the people of this province.", "Schedule 10 cuts out the Financial Accountability Officer after six months. It really is unfortunate. We just finally got the FAO hired. He’s just got nicely settled, and he’s also been told to move already. We just got him here. The first budget, after two months—he’s only been here for two months. In the first budget, the government removes his oversight over Hydro One. That’s schedule 10.", "In schedule 11, the Financial Administration Act is amended to limit our ability to obtain any information on Hydro One. So even though the government says, “We’re not privatizing; we’re still going to have a majority of the shares,” we are essentially losing complete control of this public asset. What’s happening here is really the wholesale stripping of access to any information about an asset that the people, currently, are the largest shareholder of. That is not being open; that is not being transparent.", "It’s so strategic. We see it so blatantly, so openly, that this government is running away from accountability and oversight. Once Bill 91 gets royal assent, those changes are effectively happening, and not even when the IPO comes into effect. It is shocking.", "There’s a little bit of a ripple effect, actually, out in the province of Ontario. My own local hydro, Waterloo North Hydro, is having its AGM this upcoming week. Through the grapevine, we’ve heard stories that they’ve got this new proposal to modernize. Any time I hear that word now, I think somehow the people of this province are going to lose, and that’s definitely a concern for us in Waterloo. But the government has been actively suggesting, and perhaps providing taxable incentives for local hydros to sell off. Those municipalities rely so heavily on that revenue.", "It was also disturbing, the way that the whole—the lock-up was most unfortunate, the lock-up on beer and the sell-off of Hydro One. We’ve never seen anything like that, and we’ve never been locked up over a banker’s report. It just has never happened. It was not even commercially sensitive; they had leaked most of it already, prior to it.", "But certainly that day, there was this very shiny bauble over here of beer and this big, big issue of selling off Hydro One. I think my local paper actually summed it up very nicely. I just want to share the editorial from that day. It said, “Beware of Ontario Liberals who tinker with the marketing of beer while selling off most of the province’s energy transmission system. And beware, especially, when they announce both initiatives on the same day.", "“In what could be described as not just a smokescreen but a suds screen”—which is quite witty, I hope you will agree—“Premier Kathleen Wynne last Thursday trumpeted her plan to let selected grocery stores sell six-packs of beer—though never more cheaply than the Beer Store. To a large extent, this was a sideshow, an intentional distraction to the Liberals’ real agenda.", "“As beer lovers gleefully shouted ‘Hallelujah,’ too little attention was paid to the day’s truly revolutionary change—the impending sale into private hands of 60% of Hydro One. Lots of people like beer. But everybody needs electricity.”", "I think they pretty much nailed it there. It’s a beautiful thing in the province of Ontario when people see through a suds screen, like what happened on that day.", "They have also raised the same concerns as we did. There’s nothing to stop the private investors, who will collectively own most of Hydro One, from joining forces and ganging up on the government. In fact, that was probably one of the biggest issues that we raised in our financial briefing: The bill, as it’s crafted, does not protect the government or the taxpayer from collusion. So you are leaving the door open to full privatization. I hope that it’s not with full intention, I hope that it’s just a little glitch, but you can’t blame us for raising that red flag.", "This editorial goes on to say, “Let’s not delude ourselves. The driving force behind this sell-off is not the Liberals’ desire for a better transmission system. It is, instead, this debt-strapped government’s hunger for money.” I think they’ve nailed that. As I said, it’s good to see that folks really got it.", "What is also very surprising is that there’s this premise that the Premier sort of brings to this House every day during question period: “People knew we were going to sell off Hydro One.” People did not know that you were going to do this. They have not had an opportunity to voice their concerns over this proposal. They did not know that you would get to the point of such desperation that you would be willing to sell off a strategic public asset, a quick cash settlement for purely political purposes. They did not get that, and I hope that you will understand that.", "There are certainly some other media sources, obviously, who have accurately summarized what will happen. This is from James Laxer: “Not only will the sell-off draw in the funds to pay off the utility’s debt, it will bring in the capital to underwrite much needed investments in public transit in the province, according to Ms. Wynne.", "“In truth, the big losers will be Ontarians. They will be reduced from owners of the system to its tenants and they will pay out extra billions to the new owners over the decades to come.”", "How can you not see this? I mean, I am friends with some of you on that side of the aisle. I have great respect for some of you on that side of the aisle. I understand that you are in a fiscally challenging position, and I also understand that by many of the decisions you have made, you have put yourself there. But there is no good reason to sell off this asset, and you do not have a mandate to do so.", "It is a disturbing trend. It’s a disturbing trend around short-sighted fiscal decisions which seem great at the time, but have long-term negative impacts. We’ve seen this on several privatization experiments, if I can put it that way, in health care, in the IT sector, in the contracting out of labs results. We’ve seen it in road maintenance. We have the proof; we have the evidence, Mr. Speaker. It is here. It is unfathomable that a government like the Liberals, who are well into this majority government and who have—in year one of a four-year mandate, this is the time to be courageous. It is not an act of courage to sell off a public asset which generates so much income.", "Mr. Laxer goes on to make the point that keeping hydro public is such a pivotal part of our history as a province. He actually mentions Mr. Adam Beck. He says: “Selling 60% of Hydro One stands this historic model on its head. Yes, the province will gain a one-time hit from the sale. But the new owners will make returns on their investment that are far in excess of the cost to the province if it chose instead to borrow to invest in public transit. Bay Street and private investors, not to be confused with philanthropists, are already jumping up and down at the prospect of tapping into an assured profit stream going on into the indefinite future. And, of course, consumers will pay more for their power.”", "This is the one thing that we know for a fact: The Premier and Mr. Clark have not been able to make any guarantees around rates going up. They have not been able to do that. We’ve seen from the history of the deregulation and privatization, which was started by the PC caucus just over a decade ago, that energy costs, the costs of hydro, have tripled, because when profit drives the agenda, profit wins—" ],

The government should know better. What we’ve seen, as well, is that, aside from the lost revenue—and I want to challenge the government on some of their assumptions around where they’re going to get the money from. I also want to remind people that Hydro One is a very profitable company.", "It was really interesting that Mr. Clark challenged the premise that governments are not in a position to self-finance infrastructure. The interest rates right now in the province of Ontario are at a historic low. Governments can borrow money at as low as 3%. It’s not like they can pick up and leave—although I’ve joked that I’ve seen some of the members across the row who would like to pick up and leave. But the fact of the matter is that Mr. Clark’s assumptions were wrong on that.", "I also want to point out the fact that the estimated sale value of Hydro One right now is estimated at $16 billion, but Hydro One earns a net income of about $800 million a year. That’s a return on investment of 5%. That’s pretty good.", "Meanwhile, interest rates have fallen to next to zero. A benchmark 10-year Canadian government bond has a current yield of less than 1.4%. The government’s return on its Hydro One assets has been getting bigger since 2009. This is an asset that is actually improving on the revenue side of the House for the government. This is something that’s actually working. And yet, this government seems determined to shut the door on something that is actually benefiting the people of this province and bringing much-needed revenue into Queen’s Park.", "As I mentioned, the return on Hydro One assets has been getting bigger since 2009, corresponding with a decrease in borrowing costs. If debt interest versus lost income is the question, then every year it makes less sense to sell Hydro One, not more. Follow the money on this. This is not about ideology; this is about a revenue stream that is coming into the province’s coffers that is reliable, that is consistent.", "There’s one other thing that I want to challenge. Mr. Clark’s report also has a questionable claim that this sale will result in private sector discipline, which will deliver huge benefits for the government and consumers. I have to challenge that. There is no precedent for that at all—except that elsewhere in the report, Clark is reassuring us that the government isn’t really giving up control, despite only retaining a 40% stake. If the other stakeholders have 60% and the government has 40%, the last time I checked, that is not a majority of control.", "In other words, Clark thinks government discipline will prevail at Hydro One. He does. He thinks discipline will be the overarching factor that’s driving the so-called innovation and profits of Hydro One. The only thing that is going to actually drive the way that policy is created at Hydro One is profit. That’s what the shareholders want. Then, the people in this province come second.", "Aside from the beer-and-Hydro One show that came out, and the fact that obviously this government is committed to going through with this—and what a lack of consultation on the Hydro One deal. Long-standing Liberals have called. I had this one conversation with an 87-year-old on Friday, because I do constit calls. I call them up because they’ve called the office—especially seniors, because they know. They’ve seen the evolution of public power. They know. One fellow told me that when it first started, he was paying one cent a kilowatt. That’s how old this fellow was. But for the first time, this 87-year-old constituent has come down to my office, he has the petition, and he’s going around his apartment complex and getting signatures, urging this government not to sell Hydro One. As I said, an enraged electorate is often an engaged electorate. It shouldn’t take that, but we do have people in this province who fully understand what is at risk.", "It doesn’t make sense that this Premier is so committed to doubling down on a gamble that has proven in other sectors and in our own province’s history not to pay off. We are losing oversight. We are losing an important and consistent revenue stream. Our rates will go up—and we have the highest rates, obviously, in the country. This will have a negative impact on the manufacturing sector, who have long been lobbying for an industrial energy rate so that they can improve their productivity, so that they can hire more people, so that they can actually stay in the province and not pick up and leave. And yet, what are they having? This is so evident to so many people. One has to wonder who will win. If it’s just about politics, then it’s a sad day in the history of this province. The high rates, the reliability and the loss of revenue: Those are sound arguments not to sell off Hydro One; they truly are.", "There are so many other people who have weighed in on Hydro One, and I do feel it’s necessary to put it on the record, because I think they’re committed to going forward with it. I think that the decision has already been made. I think that they have already made the commitment of the funds, and we’ve actually seen that with the power workers. The funding is supposed to be dedicated for infrastructure, and yet there’s no mechanism in this budget to ensure or guarantee that that money will actually go to transit and infrastructure. It’s not there. If they were truly committed to making sure it got to the Trillium Trust, then it would be there, but it’s not—just like they have not protected around collusion around the shareholders in the membership.", "This is from Sheila Block; I read her often. She goes on to say this plan obviously “includes fully privatizing part of Hydro One and selling off a majority stake in what remains.", "“The government is trying to position this sale as an ‘asset swap’....”", "We are challenging that assumption. This is not an asset swap, because you have already proven that you’re not fully dedicated to selling off Hydro One for infrastructure, because you’ve already used the proposed money that you don’t even have yet to settle a collective agreement with a union. That has to be challenged—but in doing so, the government is ignoring its own previous expert advice.", "This is another thing: I love the fact that the Liberal government have these special committees, they have these round tables, they commission these select committees on everything from mental health to infrastructure, but the previous expert advice—one was from Metrolinx and one was by Anne Golden—none of those reports ever suggested selling off vital public assets.", "This government had to go and find a special individual who would do his so-called pro bono work to give them a report that told them to do what they already wanted to do in the first place. That’s essentially what happened here. Mr. Clark said that he was working pro bono. We found out that they spent $7 million on consultant reports. It’s incredible. To your friends and your family—it’s the friends and family program here at Queen’s Park. If you can get in, you’re good to go. You’ve just got to generate a report that the Liberals want to hear, that they want to pay attention to. What a shame that that happened. We had to FOI that in the interest of transparency and accountability. We did so, but we wanted to see the actual reports. We wanted to see what the consultant said because the taxpayers paid for it. We’ve never seen the details. I think there were eight individual consulting firms that were paid a good sum of money to do some sort of analysis around the sale of Hydro One and six-packs of beer in a Walmart store. We, to date, have not seen any of that.", "Back to Sheila Block and the five major reasons why you should not privatize Hydro One: “Privatization would be a bonanza for Bay Street but bad news for Main Street.” So far, if you follow the money, there are going to be certain people who have already benefited, actually—the $7 million.", "The second is, “The province’s finances will suffer if it privatizes Hydro One.” I’ve already sort of made that case, I think, as have others.", "The third reason: “A review of similar privatization schemes in Canada and internationally suggests that privatizing Hydro One will very likely increase rates.” I don’t think anybody is challenging that. “Nova Scotia, which privatized its electricity system a generation ago, now has the highest electricity prices in Canada. We know that a private operator will likely borrow money to pay for the purchase and, later, pass that cost on to customers. Because a private corporation is profit-oriented, it won’t discriminate between high-income and low-income hydro consumers—everyone will pay more while receiving fewer public services because of lost revenues to Ontario.” That pretty much sums it up; it really does.", "There’s this premise that Mr. Clark sort of drums up that privatizing part of Hydro One will increase innovation. I strongly challenge that premise and so does Sheila Block. She says, “Innovation will suffer. Ontario Hydro has been used with modest success as a public policy tool to promote industrial development, to cushion the impact of rising rates on consumers, and to green our economy. For example, in recent years Hydro One has been directed by government to prioritize the infrastructure investments required to enable renewable electricity sources. A profit-driven ... entity would not have made these green choices when other infrastructure investments would have offered higher return on investment.” Profit will be the driver of policy. That will happen. That has happened already in the history of this province.", "Then, of course: “Ontario’s track record with partial privatizations doesn’t inspire confidence.” I should not have to stand in this House and remind this government that the “eHealth scandal resulted in $16 million of untendered contracts going to consultants, along with extravagant pay hikes and bonuses. The Ornge ambulance scandal was accompanied by enormous salaries, corruption, and failures in delivering vital public services.”", "Instead of actually taking a stand in this first year of a four-year mandate, the Premier has chosen to make a serious policy decision with long-term consequences and short-term gain. It is genuinely surprising to people, it really is.", "I am thinking back during the election when the Premier visited Walkerton, for instance. She did a political tour and stood up in Walkerton and talked about the risks of excessive privatization without the appropriate levels of oversight and accountability.", "She went there and it was a political hit. Some people criticized her for doing so, and yet she’s living this today as the Premier of this province because she was the transportation minister for a long time and she started the whole process of the privatization of road maintenance. So when we got this Auditor General’s report last week and we found out that there is a lack of oversight on this important public service—it is Canada. The businesses that secured the contracts from this government should have the proper equipment to clean a road of salt and snow. They should have the appropriate skill set. What did they find? They said that “the procurement process did not adequately factor in contractors’ ability to deliver required services.” They found that procuring the lowest bid and contractor can cost more in the long run—this is a recurring theme here at Queen’s Park. We found that the audit targets were not being met. We found that there was overreliance on contractors self-reporting their performance—self-reporting: “Yes, I’m doing a very good job today. Thank you very much.”" ],

Obviously, we have grave concerns about this.", "Just on that same theme, I’ve had the privilege, really, of asking the Premier directly about the changes around advertising here at Queen’s Park. Once again, these concerns come from the Auditor General. She came out specifically—I mean, the day that she raised the road maintenance report, thankfully, she also said there is a section in the budget which changes the definition of “partisan.” How partisan of you to change the definition of “partisan.” The Queen’s Park briefing actually did a really good job of doing an overview, and they quoted the AG; but at the end of the day, these changes step over the bounds of what is reasonable for her as an independent officer of this Legislature.", "She goes on to say that the changes to government advertising rules in the budget implementation bill could allow taxpayer dollars to fund partisan advertising and turn the Auditor General’s office into a rubber stamp. This is what Bonnie Lysyk says: “The government could flood the province with self-congratulatory and self-promotional advertising that would be of little practical use to the citizens paying for it,” she said at Queen’s Park last Wednesday, where she was releasing this report. “Equally significant, these amendments would transform the role of the Auditor General into that of a rubber stamp because they would oblige us to approve an ad submitted to us as being in compliance with the amended requirements even though, in our opinion, it was clearly partisan.” The current rules have been in place since 2004 and were particularly aimed at stopping the kind of taxpayer-funded advertising that took place under the former Premier.", "The Government Advertising Act now prohibits certain aspects, like ads that include the name, voice or image of a member of the executive council or a member of the assembly, and the proposed rules keep the restrictions on using the name, voice or image of an MPP, so that is still in place. However, the language around fostering a positive impression of the governing party or promoting the partisan political interest of the governing party is taken out.", "Well, isn’t that convenient? This morning I asked them if they’re changing these rules to sell the sell-off of Hydro One, because, as I mentioned, so few people actually know how drastic this plan is, but they may be hearing it very quickly from this government in their own ads, which now the Auditor General is not going to have oversight of.", "She goes on the say that if the budget is passed unchanged, she will recommend her office no longer review government ads and the responsibility be placed with the ministry instead. So basically she’s saying, “I’m not interested in rubber-stamping partisan ads.” She has said that. She has raised this concern with the government.", "Of course, that day the Treasury Board president was responding. She said that the amendments are necessary because the Auditor General was rejecting too many ads that should have been legitimate. In the opinion of the Liberal Treasury Board president, she wasn’t able to get her ads through the Auditor General, which is really interesting, because the AG’s office said that it only rejected less than 1% of 7,200 ads. So that 1% caused this massive change around oversight around partisanship in advertising from the government. You can’t stand up in the House and say you’re truly committed to accountability and transparency and, at the same time, be changing the rules of engagement for advertising in the province of Ontario.", "Ironically, the ads that were turned down by this government were actually not reviewed by this AG. So they don’t want to hear it. There are new rules of engagement here at Queen’s Park, and I just want to say publicly, because you haven’t heard it that much, but I just want to thank the Auditor General and encourage her to keep up the good work. She certainly is keeping us busy on this side of the House." ],

This is schedule 44. The Trillium Trust Act excludes Hydro One and its subsidiaries. If Hydro One sells a qualifying asset, the proceeds do not have to be transferred to the Consolidated Revenue Fund to then be paid to the Trillium Trust. There’s no guarantee that this money is actually going to get into the Trillium Trust.

They have already set up, they have already booked their sites, they have already hired a huge number of people with varying skill sets, all the way up and down. I think that people don’t even understand how complex these industries are.", "When they found out that there’s a reduction in the tax credits, it totally blindsided this industry. They have said on various occasions that this is the difference between picking up productions and moving. They can do that quite easily, especially if they can make the financial case for it, because they had no idea that these tax credits were going to be altered in such a drastic way.", "The other issue that I think caught all of us by surprise—we heard pre-budget that there were going to be some great incentives around apprenticeships. There’s $23 million listed in the budget for apprenticeships this year. However, Mr. Speaker, they’re reducing the tax credit for the industry. So you’re encouraging people to enter into apprenticeship opportunities, but then you’re shutting the door on their opportunity to actually access that information. It makes so little sense.

Those local bargaining conversations are so frustrating, because there’s a definite lack of leadership at the provincial level. That has always been a challenge for school boards, especially with the centralized power around education that the Liberals have embraced here at Queen’s Park. Although they say they respect school boards, sometimes it’s pretty hard to see that respect play itself out.", "When you look at the overall budget, there are little bits and pieces—really small pieces that work towards making some stakeholders happy and then there are these big, poorly-thought-out policies, as I said, though, on the employment side of the revenue stream, which is really missing. That’s why the tax credit reduction, the Apprenticeship Tax Credit reduction and the youth employment strategy reduction of $245 million—they’re nickel-and-diming these industries, who actually have a very strong record of creating jobs in the province, particularly the Ontario film industry for Toronto.", "On the employment stats, there were 27,500 full-time jobs lost last month. In total, there have been 317,500 manufacturing jobs lost since 2000. The government has admitted that they overestimated job creation in budget 2014 by 67,000 jobs, so you have to go back and look at the math on that. What is happening?

We should have, because it’s 2015, and the tsunami of aging Ontarians is here. We don’t have to talk about it coming anymore; it’s actually happening in our communities.

It is hard to imagine, really, especially after attending this P3 session earlier today with my colleagues, how the $130 billion is actually going to be sustainable, because when you sell off Hydro One for a quick cash grab, you’re actually shutting down a major revenue stream for future infrastructure and transit investment. That is a fact.", "Ultimately, we clearly see on this side of the House that the people of this province are going to pay the price for those decisions.

Certainly, decisions and promises are sort of moving targets in this province, I’d have to say.", "Selling off Hydro One for $4 billion, which would only pay for half of the Toronto relief line, is incredibly short-sighted.

They’re very well meaning, but let’s be frank; let’s be clear: They’re very wrong.", "I want to focus on three things she said. She spoke at length about the Hydro One sale, so I’d like to address my comments to her comments there, particularly her comment to “follow the money.” If you follow the money, this is the right deal to do. An $800-million recurring revenue stream is what makes this an asset to sell. Based on a $15-billion evaluation, that’s about a 5.3% return. As she has acknowledged, the bond rates are down to less than 2%. So at 5.3%, if we sell 60%, that’s a $9-billion—not $4 billion, as she mentioned—increase in our capacity. What if the markets were actually prepared to take a 4% return on this money? A 4% return would value the company at $20 billion, and at 60% that would be $12 billion in our coffers—$5 billion towards the debt and an additional $7 billion towards building infrastructure, which is so important to this province.", "She also talked about, “It’s a fact that rates will go up.” Had she done her due diligence on how the OEB works, she would know that you cannot use capital expenditures as a justification for a rate increase. The money that was spent to acquire these shares cannot be used as part of a rate increase. The way that the private sector makes money as a return on their investment is by efficiencies, by going through and doing innovation and finding new ways of doing it.", "Finally, if anyone holding shares should operate in such a fashion that they exercise more than 10% control, subsection 48.2(1) ensures that Hydro takes steps to remove any kind of such collusion. Ten per cent is the maximum, and we stand by it." ],

It’s a debt that’s supposed to be paid off by the money Hydro One would make by selling it off. Again, the question is: Now that this money, 60% of it, will go to the sell-off, in my view the debt will increase, the debt will balloon, and so will the price of electricity for homeowners, for businesses and for industry. Industry has choices in the province of Ontario and other states like North Carolina and Ohio.", "The fact remains that electricity prices to date have tripled. The top-end price has tripled. Under this Liberal government, when they came in, the rate was 4.3 cents a kilowatt hour. Business knows this. I don’t think we’re going to see any alleviation of rates under this majority sale. This budget does not guarantee any savings in electricity. They’ve removed the oversight. It’s surprising that, so recently after those Ornge hearings, they would remove oversight over a major agency like Hydro One—and Ombudsman oversight and oversight by the Auditor General. And they have removed that public oversight with respect to the sunshine list.", "In contrast to what was said, there are some cases for privatization and there are some good reasons to do that, but not just to get some money for this government to bail out their wasteful spending." ],

C’est un plan d’avenir audacieux qui prend le leadership sur plusieurs enjeux difficiles, tout en prenant soin des Ontariens et Ontariennes les plus vulnérables.", "anniversaire de la présence française en Ontario et en allouant 5,9 millions de dollars pour célébrer ce moment historique, notre gouvernement continue dans sa longue tradition de soutenir l’épanouissement de la communauté francophone de l’Ontario.", "Whether I worked as a nurse, a lawyer, a municipal councillor and as an MPP, I always have the same goal: Work together to make Ontario the best place to live for every Ontarian, from childhood to retirement. This budget is another step towards this goal, and I am very proud of that. Some may have doubts and say that this goal is too big to reach, but I don’t think so. I believe our only true strength as a province is our people, and if we invest in people, make sure they have the right opportunities and try to remove as many obstacles as possible out of their way, I know Ontarians will continue to be the driving force behind Ontario’s greatness.", "I heard speakers from the two opposition parties talking about Hydro One. Listening to them, we don’t have the mandate to sell a part of it; we don’t have the mandate to privatize part of it. But out there in the community, they’re very interested. This weekend, I kept responding to phone calls from people in my community who wanted to invest in Hydro One. They want to be part of it. They want to invest in it. They want to see how they will be able to share the ownership with this government.", "We need infrastructure. We need to build infrastructure, and we believe in it. That’s why we have announced $130 billion for the next 10 years. We would have liked to have a partner working with us. We would have liked to have the federal government working with us, but do you know what they did? They announced in their budget—they’re balancing their budget on the back of Ontario—$720 million for the whole of Canada, starting in 2017. Imagine how good that will be to build Ontario and build the rest of Canada.", "The Canadian association of municipalities has said very loud and clear that we have a deficit in infrastructure and we need to rebuild infrastructure, and in order to do that, we need partners at the table. I hope that the MPPs on the other side will give a call to their counterparts at the federal level and make sure that they do invest in infrastructure.

Of course, we’ll be sharing our time with our colleague from Kingston and the Islands momentarily.", "As always, I sincerely enjoy the spirited and passionate debate that takes place in this Legislature, particularly around items like budgets. As many will know or remember, I did have the opportunity to serve for a couple of budgets—budget 2013 and the first version of budget 2014—as the parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Finance, our current Minister of Finance. If there’s one theme I have seen first-hand as the PA at finance and now in my time as Minister of Transportation, it is that we have a consistent and concerted plan to make sure we are building the province up. You see that right in the title of the bill itself: Building Ontario Up Act. It speaks to all that is the very best of what is included in this year’s budget and this year’s road map for making sure that we move the province forward.", "I have stood in this place and had the opportunity to talk many, many times, thinking at a global or macro level, about what these investments in infrastructure mean for the province. I could go through this list, and I may just take the opportunity to mention a few things, because they are certainly important. But then I want to try, with my time, to bring it back to what is important to me locally, not as the Minister of Transportation but, in this case, serving proudly as the MPP representing the community of Vaughan.", "In this budget book, opposition members and those watching at home will find a multitude of clear examples of projects in the infrastructure realm that support health care through hospital construction and renewal. They will find support for crucial infrastructure, again, in the post-secondary world.", "They will certainly, in my own portfolio, find support for a number of important highway projects. I know we had the chance this afternoon, both myself, the member from Kitchener–Waterloo and others, to add spirited debate to this notion of how important it is to proceed with the widening of Highway 7 from Kitchener to Guelph or from Guelph to Kitchener, Highways 11 and 17 from Thunder Bay to Nipigon, Highway 401 improvements in the London area, Highway 417 in the Ottawa area—this list does go on.", "I heard a discussion earlier—I didn’t have the chance in my two-minute response to talk about high-speed rail. Last November—I believe it was November—I had the privilege of being in London, a wonderful community so ably represented here in this Legislature by our Deputy Premier. I had the opportunity to be there to launch the environmental assessment for high-speed rail, which is a project that, when complete, will link, via high-speed rail, Toronto, Kitchener, Waterloo, London and Windsor. That’s an EA project that’s now under way. The Ministry of Transportation is leading that, and that work will take place over the next few years.", "Of course, again in this budget book we see an ongoing commitment to our support, provincially, for dealing with the expansion of Maley Drive in Sudbury. We see the $1-billion commitment that we have consistently put forward to support all of the economic development and job growth potential for the Ring of Fire.", "And, of course, not that many days ago I had the opportunity to be in Sault Ste. Marie, standing alongside the Minister of Government and Consumer Services and the Minister of Northern Development and Mines, to announce that because of this Premier—our Premier’s vision and her ambitious plan to build the province up through the Moving Ontario Forward plan, that $31.5 billion that we will invest over the next decade—we were able to reinstate a stand-alone Connecting Links program. Starting with funding in 2016, once we have completed the design of the program, working with our municipal partners, we will be able to support nearly 80 communities—about 350 kilometres of Connecting Links roads that exist here in province of Ontario. Again, that’s because of the commitment that this Premier has to making sure that all of Ontario benefits fully from that $31.5 billion.", "Of course, you will all know that I talk proudly, and I think rightly so, about all of our transit investments that we see not only in the greater Toronto and Hamilton area—though there are many that will help fulfill some of those transit ambitions that we have in this region, to make sure that we continue to successfully fight gridlock—but also to see our support for phase 1 of the Ottawa LRT. A phenomenal day not that many weeks ago, or a couple of months ago, when I was in Ottawa with all of our Ottawa colleagues to see what we called the unveiling of the mock-up for that LRT with Mayor Watson and so many other people—such an exciting day for Ottawa. And because of our commitment, along with the municipal and federal government, we are moving that project ahead.", "We were at the table—in fact, I believe we were first to the table for the funding for phase 1 of the Ottawa LRT, and we will be back at the table, as a result of Moving Ontario Forward, for phase 2, a commitment that was a little bit fuzzy or unclear during last year’s election campaign from Tim Hudak and the Conservatives.", "Of course, Kitchener–Waterloo: I’ve already talked a little bit today about ION, phase 1, an AFP project with support from the private sector, helping us build out that crucial infrastructure. We were there at the table for the funding and the construction of phase 1, and again because of Moving Ontario Forward, because of our Premier’s vision, plan and ambition for this province, we’ll be there for phase 2, potential support for a BRT in London and so much more.", "Not that many weeks ago, I was in Durham, and then again in a more easterly part of Durham, at the edge of the wonderful community of Peterborough, to announce the $1.2-billion contract being awarded for phase 2 of Highway 407 East, a significant project that will help unlock so much economic development potential throughout Durham and leading into communities like Haliburton, Kawartha, Peterborough, Lindsay and so many others.", "In fact, phase 1 of Highway 407 East will actually come into service later this year. By the end of this year, cars will be driving on Highway 407 East, phase 1, and the West Durham Link, or I believe Highway 412 is the accurate number. So, an exciting time for that particular part of our region.", "I’ll say very quickly as well a number of transit projects that we’ve been able to announce in the last couple of weeks: the Finch LRT here in the 416, a $1.2-billion LRT—much talked about over a number of years. We are proceeding with construction, which will start next year. Of course, I had the real honour to be in Etobicoke North, at Humber College, to announce that particular project with my colleague from Etobicoke North, my colleague the minister responsible for seniors’ affairs. But importantly, when you think about that $1.2-billion LRT, that is a transit project that will unite, will connect two post-secondary institutions: Humber College at the west end, and it will arrive right at the edge of York University. Importantly, it will run through two what we call priority neighbourhoods. I mentioned that day that as Metrolinx proceeds with that $1.2-billion LRT, there will be a community benefits plan put in place to make sure that we help spur economic activity in those two communities.", "The week before in Peel region, $1.6 billion for the Hurontario-Main LRT: That’s 22 kilometres of rapid transit that will be flowing north-south in that community, connecting people in Brampton and Mississauga to GO regional express rail, something that I know Mayors Jeffrey and Crombie were delighted to hear about.", "Speaker, I mentioned GO RER a second ago. Let me just say, the week before the Hurontario–Main LRT, to be standing alongside our Premier and the MPP for Barrie to announce the very ambitious, very exciting and transformative GO regional express rail plan—$13.5 billion over 10 years, positively impacting every single one of our seven GO corridors.", "We will have a frequent, rapid and ready regional service along all of our corridors—hundreds of new trips on each corridor over the next five years. Over that next decade, on a number of our corridors, fully electrified two-way, all-day GO service at up to 15-minute intervals, including—and this is important; it’s important for the member from York South–Weston and the member from Davenport, the member from Trinity–Spadina and so many others, including the member from Etobicoke North—the Union Pearson Express. A number of us had the opportunity to be on that train to see what it looked like and felt like first-hand not that many days ago.", "After many years of planning and many years, again, of involving the private sector to build the western spur for the Union Pearson Express, starting this June 6, well in time for the Pan/Parapan Am Games, as we committed, that Union Pearson Express will come into service.", "Speaker, I mentioned all of these projects. I’m not going to get the chance to talk specifically about my community, but this is why it’s so important to support our plan, to support our Premier, to support our government, but most importantly to support this province. Thank you very much." ],

This fund will improve productivity, competitiveness and access to global markets. It will also encourage strategic partnerships and empower the next-generation industries.", "We all know that despite the side of the House that we speak from, no economy, no government can generate growth without investing in infrastructure. I therefore applaud the bill’s unprecedented $130-billion commitment to renewing and expanding public infrastructure and transportation over the next 10 years.", "I’m referring to the new roads, bridges and transit that will link communities and move goods and people around this province faster and more efficiently. It’s well known that congestion and pollution cost the economy billions of dollars directly and indirectly. These investments are absolutely essential to the long-term growth and sustainability of our economy, and they benefit all of us. I support that vision.", "During my pre-budget-tele-town hall consultation, members of my community identified more jobs for young people as one of their top priorities. Through Bill 91, we are increasing incentives for businesses to train and employ young Ontarians. Through Ontario’s Youth Jobs Strategy, through trade apprenticeship and entrepreneurship opportunities, we are helping to connect more youth to the job market after they graduate, and we’re mentoring and inspiring Ontario’s next generation of leaders.", "The many post-secondary students in my riding, at Queen’s, St. Lawrence College and Royal Military College, have been pleased to learn that if this bill passes, their OSAP loan limits will be higher and a vehicle and part-time work will be exempted from their assessment.", "Kingston and the Islands’ mix of leading health care facilities, such as Kingston General Hospital, Providence Care and Hotel Dieu Hospital, excellent social services and stunning geography has made it one of Canada’s destinations of choice for retirees. So I was delighted by the increased funding for seniors.", "I am also delighted about the maintenance and increase to the Seniors Community Grant Program. This great program encourages inclusion, health education, volunteering and community engagement of our seniors. I would strongly recommend all members from all sides of this House to apply for that fund and make sure that you serve your seniors in the best way that you can.", "Increasing customer convenience and choice on how beer is sold in Ontario is also extremely important for smaller craft brewers across the province.

I had the opportunity to go to the last community council meeting for the Brockville campus and really got a great overview of the good things that are happening at that campus.", "But I am worried, Speaker. I am worried about this budget and the direction it’s taking. Certainly she talked about health care. I know that the Kingston hospitals do serve part of my riding, but I do see this government’s cuts to health care playing out in the hallways at the Brockville General Hospital. I’ve seen it last year in last year’s budget with now one less post-secondary educational facility in my riding, that being the closure of Kemptville College. So while I applaud my neighbour, I can see that the regionalization of eastern Ontario has started. I’m very concerned with this eastern Ontario growth plan that’s being discussed in the budget. I fear that plan will be a one-size-fits-all planning plan for our community. I happen to have faith in my local mayors and local councillors that, in a rural riding, they can make those growth decisions for my constituents. I have faith in them, and I wanted to make sure that, before the end of the day, I put that on the record, Speaker, so thank you for giving me that chance." ],

I do appreciate him, in a very considered and thoughtful way, putting forward his comments, and also, at the outset, his comments with respect to perhaps some of that partisan jabbing that occurred here this afternoon. I hope that the member from Leeds–Grenville, who I have a great deal of regard for, will forgive me for what’s about to come.", "I think there’s a reason that there is so much energy here this afternoon. When I listen to that member or, at least this afternoon, most of his colleagues—and I certainly have over the last number of weeks—I feel the anguish and the pain that is emanating from that particular caucus. Of course, to have to go into next weekend and choose your fourth leader in the last 12 years must be very troubling. I get that. I feel that pain.", "But fundamentally, the presence of that pain and discomfort and anguish that you feel, notwithstanding all of your collective performances over the last 12 years that have been so strongly rejected by the people of Ontario, not once, not twice, not three times, but four times—that’s no reason to not support this budget, because it builds your communities up, as well—" ],

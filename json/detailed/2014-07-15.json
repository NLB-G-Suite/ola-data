I will be sharing my time on this motion with the member from Etobicoke Centre, the member from Beaches–East York and the member from Northumberland–Quinte West.", "Our government believes that midnight sittings are essential to allow the Legislature to strike committees and pass the budget in a timely manner, in keeping with the Premier’s commitment to Ontarians. Speaker, as you are aware, the Premier, during the election campaign, spoke very forcefully and strongly about the need to ensure that the progressive plan that we have put forward through the budget be passed in the Legislature as soon as possible. Therefore, the Premier committed to call the Legislature back within 20 days of the election, if elected, so that we could get on with the work of the people. In that regard, that’s exactly what she did. After the election, and after being given the opportunity by Ontarians to be their elected government, the Premier called the Legislature that came into place on July 2 with the election of the Speaker, followed by a speech from the throne on July 3 and the budget that was tabled just yesterday.", "Speaker, we feel that in order to achieve the legislative agenda, and particularly the passage of the budget, the House would need to sit from 6 p.m. until midnight for a number of weeks to move forward with our progressive plan. I don’t take joy in the fact that we may all have to sit here for the next couple of weeks until midnight to get the work done. I am disappointed that we have to take this step, but it is necessary, unfortunately, because the opposition parties have rejected striking the committees in keeping with the long-standing convention in the Legislature, instead advocating for a committee structure that has no precedent in Ontario.", "I enjoy a good working relationship with the other House leaders, and we’ve been in constant conversation to ensure that we can reach some sort of an accommodation. But we also need to make sure on this side of the House that, when it comes to getting things done, when it comes to making sure that the budget that was presented by the Minister of Finance yesterday gets passed—we need to take this important step because this budget is perhaps one of the most important budgets being tabled at this juncture in our economy.", "This is a budget which, as you know, was a result of the election. It was first presented on May 1 in the previous Parliament. The opposition parties, as you may recall, decided to vote against the budget; hence the election that took place. At the core of that election, at least for the government, was our plan around the budget, making sure that we are making important investments in our communities across the province, be they urban, suburban or rural communities, small towns or big cities. We’re making the necessary investments to grow our economy, to create good-paying jobs, to ensure that we are building public transit and transportation infrastructure across the province, and also protecting hard-working Ontarians who may not have a workplace pension, through the creation of the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan.", "All those key elements that were so central to the campaign were part of the budget yesterday. Clearly, on June 12, Ontarians spoke. Ontarians spoke by voting in support of a progressive, positive plan that focuses on building Ontario up. They re-elected 58 Liberal members of provincial parliament, elected a majority government, to ensure that that work gets done. It is a very clear mandate that has been given by the people of this great province.", "If I can speak about my community of Ottawa Centre, it has been a great honour for me to represent my community for seven years now; I was first elected in 2007. I’ve had an incredible opportunity to serve my community, from Glebe to Centretown to Carleton Heights to Carlington, the great neighbourhoods of Westboro, Hintonburg and Wellington Village. All those communities have been growing and evolving over the last several years. I have been very fortunate to be part of all that incredible growth and progress, working with my constituents every day on issues that are important.", "One of the things, Speaker, that I’ve doing over the last seven years, something that I took the opportunity to talk to you about, is that, for the last seven years, I have been knocking on doors almost every weekend. I’ve had the opportunity, before getting into the election, to have knocked on almost every single door in my riding of Ottawa Centre to be able to engage in conversations with constituents on issues that are important to them. Those conversations resulted in us getting things done for our communities.", "When members of my community in the Westboro area told us that our schools in the urban core needed more investment, needed rebuilding, needed renovation, we worked together, and we were able to secure funding to rebuild Broadview school. Broadview school was built in 1926. There are several generations of members of my community who have gone through that school. Clearly that school needs a rebuild. We worked hard together. We were able to secure funding from the provincial government to rebuild the school, not to mention build an addition to another much older school, almost 100 years old, in the Glebe.", "Similarly, one of our big focuses has been investments in community health, making sure that we keep seniors at home, making sure that we continue to invest in things that make the lives of our seniors and those who may be vulnerable in the community healthier.", "There are three community health centres in my riding: Centretown, Somerset West and Carlington. All three of those community health centres are going through a major expansion. Why? So that we can provide more services to my constituents, making sure that we’re not only providing community care but we’re also focusing on things like social services.", "These, Speaker, all—" ],

So congratulations on that particular role.", "Speaker, I was highlighting some key accomplishments in my community for the fact that they’re very much tied to the plan that we have put forward, the plan that we articulated to Ontarians during the election campaign. Those are the kinds of things that I was speaking of to my constituents, day in and day out, to make sure that we are continuing to move forward. That plan has been put forward.", "When I was out in my community, knocking on doors every single day, my constituents sent me a very clear message: They wanted to see our budget approved. They wanted to see our budget passed as soon as possible so that we are making those important investments, investments like in the Ottawa River Action Plan, which is part of the budget, so that we prevent the flow of raw sewage into our beautiful Ottawa River, which is the spine of my city. That commitment is within that budget, not to mention the $29 billion over 10 years for the transit and transportation infrastructure plan." ],

We need to work hard as much as we can at the outset so that we can debate this budget, so that we can debate the budget motion and we are able to pass this budget before the end of summer. Again, as I mentioned, Speaker, we could have worked together to make sure that the process was expedited, but, if not, we have to resort to evening sittings so there are opportunities for members to be able to speak about the budget, to talk about why the budget is important to their respective communities, and to talk about what they heard from their communities during the campaign as it relates to the critical investments in our hospitals, in our schools, in our community health centres, in roads and bridges and public transit, like the Ottawa light rail transit, phase one of which is under construction.", "That’s why, Speaker, we have this motion in front of us: so that there is the opportunity for us to be able to debate this budget and pass this budget according to the wishes of Ontarians that they clearly articulated through the outcome of the election, because what we need to focus on, at this juncture, is to build Ontario up. We need to make sure that we are making those critical, important investments in Ontarians, in things that we value, in public services that we rely on.", "I am particularly very proud of the fact that we are making investments, through this budget, in our personal support workers. These people work very hard—some of the lowest-paid workers in our community. But these are individuals who look after our loved ones, our parents and grandparents, at their homes. We need to make sure that we pay them based on their skill sets and give them a much-needed pay raise, which is very much part of this budget.", "Pay increases for early childhood educators are also very important.

We need to make sure that our workers who work in that sector, who have a very difficult job on their hands—they look after some of the most vulnerable members of our communities—get the pay raise they deserve so much.", "All these things are part of this very important budget that is going to help shape our communities, that is going to help grow our economy, that is going to help create jobs in our respective communities. Ontarians have asked us to implement this plan, and, as the Premier has said, we will deliver on that.

This came somewhat as a complete shock to me. I had seen the introduction of the budget, and as a Liberal observer I was very delighted with how the budget was playing out. I thought that this budget brought us back to our progressive roots as a party. There were tremendous investments in infrastructure, tremendous investments in education, in health care, in transit—the $29-billion infrastructure transit fund, $15 billion of which would be invested in transit in the GTA. These were very, very important considerations. As a Liberal observer, I watched and I thought, “Great. I’m happy to support that.”", "But then, the day after, the election was called because members hadn’t supported it, leading us to a position today where we’re now in a procedural motion, trying to move forward. The day after was Saturday, May 3. I was at an event with a friend of mine, Dennis Mills, a great mentor and the federal member for Toronto–Danforth. I know many here would know Mr. Mills—a tremendous mentor and a personal friend. He had a call from someone in the party, in organizing, who said that they didn’t have a candidate for Beaches–East York in the election and the writ was to be dropped imminently. He suggested that I should run. It wasn’t something that was on my list, but he said to me, “Don’t say yes now. If you say yes and you’re elected, you may be speaking to some kind of a procedural motion when you should be doing an inaugural speech.” He said, “Please, don’t say yes now. I want you to go home.

I thought I would be waving the flag for the party, helping them out, getting their message across—because Mr. Prue was a very formidable opponent.", "I had always thought that my opportunity to run would be against the member from Toronto–Danforth. The member from Toronto–Danforth and I ran against each other 20 years ago in 1994 for city council. Let me say that it was a tremendous, spirited campaign. He went on and continued on in politics and I went on to be a consultant, but I enjoyed that opportunity, I enjoyed that exercise, immensely.

He had been an MPP here for the last 13 years.", "He was a good retail politician. I repeatedly heard people say at the door, “I like Mr. Prue. He’s helped me out. He’s a good guy. I would vote for him.” I had to convince them that I, too, was a good guy, and we had to see what our policies were, because the policy we were running on, of course, was the budget, and the budget is what we have to debate here, and we have to get it passed. Now we’re in a procedural motion in order to get this budget passed, which will keep us here from 6 o’clock until midnight in order to resolve the committee structures.", "Having run, I was reminded of Stephen LeDrew the day after the election. Mr. LeDrew—I had the pleasure of running his mayoralty campaign when he ran against Mr. Miller for the mayor of Toronto many years ago. Mr. LeDrew was on TV at CP24. He interviewed me shortly after the election, and he asked me, “Were you shocked and as surprised as all of us at winning?” Frankly, I wasn’t shocked and surprised, because on the street we heard very early on that the people of Beaches–East York were looking for change. We had already discovered—we’d had an inkling—that the NDP vote particularly was going to come to our side of the table, because they should have passed that budget. They should have passed the budget that we’re debating today. It was a good budget. It was a progressive budget. It invested, as I said earlier, in transit and infrastructure. Now we find ourselves in this position of having to debate a procedural motion in order to bring in the budget that the people of Ontario clearly spoke in favour of adopting.", "Notwithstanding that the Leader of the Opposition has said publicly that it wasn’t the budget that elected our government but it was the campaign that was run by the opposition parties, well, I tell you, in Beaches–East York that just wasn’t the case. It was a two-person race. It was between me and Mr. Prue. There was a Conservative candidate and there was a Green candidate, and the other two candidates were just—well, there were a few others, the Marxist-Leninist Party and some others—but between them, they were simply going to split the vote. It was a two-horse race between Mr. Prue and myself, and who knows to whose benefit those vote splits would have gone?", "The budget was the plan. It was a great piece of literature that I was able to go door to door and talk to people about. That is why I’m so confident that it’s the budget that the people of Ontario want us to pass. They want us to get through this procedural wrangling. They want us to get past these petty squabbles about committee makeup and recognize the absolutely important principles that have been established in the past about representation on committees.", "What allowed me to get elected was in fact a confluence of fairly significant events. There was a tremendous change sentiment in my riding. I had the unique opportunity of running for change in Beaches–East York, change both at the provincial level—because with Ms. Wynne we had a new leader of the party that was taking us in a very progressive direction. The budget signified a significant change from the way the party had established itself in the past. It did take us back to our progressive roots as a party that cared about people, that cared about public support workers, that cared about educators, a party that cared about trying to fix the crumbling infrastructure that over the years had been falling apart. We needed to invest in this infrastructure. That’s what the budget plan was telling us to do and that’s what was helping us at the door.", "But I also campaigned on change at the local level. As nice a guy as Mr. Prue was, he had been the finance critic for the NDP in the creation of the budget. He had gone across the province, door to door, at pre-budget hearings. He had helped fashion the budget that was ultimately put forward in this House on May 1. It was a surprise and a shock to all of us that his party did not support a budget that he helped craft. It was, as I say, progressive. I know that, door to door, people talked to Mr. Prue about that: “You should not have put the funding of Toronto East General Hospital in jeopardy. You should not have turned down increased wages for support workers, for educational workers, for working with people in homes that have children with autism.” These were important dimensions of the budget. More to the point, we were looking at a poverty reduction strategy based on the recommendations of the Lankin-Sheikh report.", "Ms. Lankin also had been the representative for Beaches–East York. She’s a tremendous asset to this province and continues to be so in the work she does advocating for the poor, advocating for policies of social justice. Our government had retained her and used her and Mr. Sheikh to develop some policies that we are getting so close to implementing.", "With this budget, we can implement those policies, Mr. Speaker, and we very, very much look forward to doing so. We will do everything we need to do as a government. We will come here and we will work from 6 o’clock to midnight every night until we pass the budget that we promised the people of Ontario. That’s what this procedural wrangling is all about. We want the members to recognize that the people have spoken.", "Now, Ms. Lankin offered up her seat 13 years ago to Mr. Prue in a by-election; she had another opportunity to go to, and he won the seat in a by-election. I was shocked to know that Mr. Prue could not support the budget that implemented the recommendations of the person who gave up her seat so he could run and represent the people of Beaches–East York in this House. He did not support that budget. What I heard at the door repeatedly is that he should have supported the budget, and that had a lot to do with why he wasn’t re-elected, notwithstanding that he is a fantastic guy. I’ve been drinking beer with him for 25 years, since I knew him at city hall. He’s a great guy and he did some great things at city hall and in the province.", "But Ms. Wynne had been an incredible asset for us going door-to-door in this campaign." ],

Ms. Minna is still thought of as the local representative. People in Beaches–East York continue to come to her, and I go to her.

Mom said to me, “Your father, when he ran in 1963 for the Liberals and again in 1967 for the Liberals”—in the area where we lived, which was south Rosedale, very much similar in many ways to Beaches–East York because it encompassed all the much poorer neighbourhoods south of Danforth, south of Bloor Street, and the more affluent neighbourhoods north of Danforth.

But this is more important. This procedural motion is important, because it’s really about whether we’re going to continue to sit here and work and do what the people of Ontario sent us here to do, which is to get this budget passed.", "Now, I have to say that when I was in my community canvassing throughout the campaign, I heard about a lot of issues. I heard a lot about the need to continue to create jobs, to build on our track record. I can say that, having been out in my community, there’s a lot of support for the work that the government has done over the past 11 years, since 2003, and a lot of progress has been made. We have created over 460,000 new jobs, but, at the same time, there are many people out there in the community who are struggling to find work.", "I can tell you, for example, that I met a young woman when I was canvassing, who opened her door to me. I introduced myself, and I said, “I’m the candidate for Etobicoke Centre,” and she said, “Well, tell me about your credentials.” I told her a little bit about my background, that I’m a management consultant, that I teach at York University, that I have a finance background, that I have an MBA. She said, “You know, I also have an MBA,” and she said, “I’m struggling to find work. Can you help?” We talked a lot about some of the things that the government has done to help her find work and some of the many more things that are in this budget that will help her do that. So when I think about some of those things, I think about the investments that we’re making in infrastructure; I think about the things that we’re doing to make post-secondary education more accessible; I think about the things that we’re doing to make sure that we’re attracting businesses here to Ontario, by keeping taxes low and regulations down. When I think about this motion, Mr. Speaker, I think about how important it is that we pass this motion so that we can get this budget passed, because when I think about this woman, I think about this budget and how important it is to her and how much she would want us to pass this budget expeditiously.", "Some of the other things that I heard in the community were around health care. In my riding of Etobicoke Centre we have one of the largest percentages of seniors of any riding in the country, so we have a lot of folks in our community who rely on the health care system. Again, they appreciate the good work that we’ve done in a number of ways, in terms of improving access to care, expanding home care, long-term care. The investment that will be made in this budget to help raise pay for personal support workers is one of the things that is particularly important in my riding of Etobicoke Centre, because so many of my constituents rely on those personal support workers every single day. The quality of care and access to care is critical. When I think about this budget, I think about how important it is. Again, I urge the members here to pass this motion.", "I heard a lot in my community about education and the quality of education. One of the things that they appreciated about our platform—and that platform was built from the budget—is the work that we’re going to do to continue to keep class sizes down, the work that we’re going to do to continue to invest in education for special-needs children, the things we’re going to do to make sure that we continue to strengthen some of those core skills that young people need so they can get into university and succeed post-graduation.", "As someone who teaches at a university, I know a little bit about and understand some of the challenges that young people face, very frankly. Some of those skills that I’m talking about are things like creative thinking, like math skills. Those types of skills are the kinds of things that young people are going to need to succeed in the new economy.", "I can tell you that when I teach at university I often help young students who are searching for work in the private sector. A lot of times they’ll come to me or they’ll send me an e-mail or they’ll give me a call. I’ll sit down with them over coffee and we’ll talk about some of the challenges that they face in finding a job. I’ll give them advice on anything from how to write their resumé to how to network and other things like that, and where they might be able to find employment and the kinds of careers that might be a fit for their skill set. One of the things I sometimes hear from young people is that they’ve graduated, they’ve earned a job, but they’re not working in their particular field; they’re struggling to find work in their particular field. That’s one of the areas where I know we have work to do and that’s one of the areas where our government is committed to continuing to do work, to make sure that young people have access to that quality education and that we continue to strengthen it.", "So the math skills, the creative thinking skills that we’re talking about in school are some of the things that are going to allow them to succeed and graduate. I look forward to seeing those students come through as they graduate through high school into university and into my class and are then able to therefore succeed and get those jobs that we’re talking about.", "Some of the other things that are important in this budget and in our platform were around expanding guidance programs for young people. I think one of the challenges that young people face, and I experience this every day in my work as a teacher, is that young people, in looking for work, sometimes just don’t know how to look or where to look. That’s an important element of this. So education is critical. There are other aspects to education that are important in this budget, but that’s some of it. I would urge the members here to pass the motion so that we can get this budget passed. Because again, those young people, if we don’t pass this budget expeditiously, are presumably going to turn to me and they’re going to say, “What happened? You got elected on this platform.”", "Some of the other things that I heard in the community were around transportation and infrastructure. Transportation affects our daily life, whether it be our economy and how it supports growth in our economy or whether it be the quality of life that we enjoy. When I think about this morning, I was able to get on a bus quite quickly and get down here in a reasonable period of time, but there are many mornings where that’s not necessarily the case for a lot of folks. Those are the kinds of things—transit and transportation—that we need to invest in, because they touch us every single day. We’re doing that in this budget. So there’s infrastructure spending that’s been allocated, about $130 billion. Of course, about $15 billion of that is allocated to transportation within the GTA. That’s one of the things that I think is so, so critical, that we show Ontarians—all members of this House, no matter what side of the aisle you’re on—that we heard the people of Ontario. They voted overwhelmingly in support of this budget, overwhelmingly in support of this government’s platform. So again, for the sake of my constituents in Etobicoke Centre who rely on transit, who want to continue to see gridlock relieved, that’s the kind of thing I hope we take into consideration as we think about this motion.", "Another thing I heard at the doors a lot was the need to continue to manage our taxpayers’ dollars wisely. I’m thrilled to have the opportunity to be working with Minister Matthews, who’s President of the Treasury Board, as her parliamentary assistant. I think this is one of the issues that is so, so important—one of the issues that I heard about at the doors in my community. I’ve been working with Minister Matthews, and it’s a true honour to work with her, but I look forward to working with her more in the weeks and months to come as we make sure that we get maximum value for taxpayers’ dollars.", "My background is in management consulting so I do this type of work for private sector clients on a regular basis. We’ll be asked to come in and identify opportunities to find more value for the dollar. That’s one of the things I’m looking forward to working on with Minister Matthews.", "Mr. Speaker, as I think about this motion, it’s something that would send a strong message to my community, to other communities across the province, that, as legislators who have been recently elected, many of us here for the first time, we’re really committed to moving ahead with the agenda that Ontarians endorsed.", "One of the things that I think is incredibly important as part of this is the fact that this budget has a 10-year economic plan. One of the things that it does is it helps us compete better for global investments. To help secure these investments, we’re going to maintain, as I said earlier, a competitive tax system. We’re going to work on reducing energy costs for business, and cutting red tape. We’re creating a new Jobs and Prosperity Fund, which is critical. It’s a really important strategic tool, I believe, to attract businesses to our province.", "I also think that lowering energy costs is something we hear from both sides of the House on a regular basis as an issue that’s important in our communities. Again, we’re introducing a new five-point energy plan to give small and medium-sized businesses the tools they need to conserve energy, which I think is also critical. I have a lot of people in my community who are business owners; I have a lot of people in my community who are entrepreneurs. These types of things are critical to them, and I heard about them during the election campaign.", "One of the things that’s also important—and I mentioned this a little bit earlier, but I think one of the things I heard in the community was that they want us to continue with the track record of investment in infrastructure, particularly in transportation. Like I said, since 2003 we’ve invested about $100 billion in hospitals, schools and other infrastructure, and I think we need to continue with that.", "One of the things that’s also important is that we continue to increase support for those who are most vulnerable. There are many people in my community who rely on support, and we need to continue to do that. One of the things in the budget is that we’ll be increasing the maximum annual OCB per child to $1,310. That’s going to enhance the incomes of about half a million families. We’re also expanding low-income health benefits and developing a new program to reduce electricity bills for low-income Ontarians. We’re also going to increase social assistance benefits and expand the student nutrition program so that more children in school have access to a healthy, balanced breakfast to start the day. We continue to make steady increases in the minimum wage, which, again, is a critical element of the budget and critical to supporting those who are more vulnerable.", "As I mentioned earlier, one of the things that I heard at the doors—many members of my community are seniors, as I mentioned, but many members of the community in Etobicoke Centre are also part of that so-called sandwich generation. They are middle-aged families who are in a position where they’re caring for their elderly parents but they’re also caring for their children. One of the things that I’m proud of in this budget is that we’re continuing to take the steps to make sure that we try to help these families as much as possible—not just help the seniors by helping them in terms of improving the quality of care and access to care, but by helping the families that are bearing the burden of caring for them.", "I can tell you that my mother cared for my grandmother for many, many years, and her ability to do that was unique. She was fortunate enough to have the flexibility and the financial resources to do so, but not all families are able to do that. Continued support, particularly through home care, is critical but other forms of care as well. We’ve committed to continue to work in that area.", "It’s interesting. My family was actually supposed to be here as well and, unfortunately, they weren’t here, but I know that if they were, my mother would certainly be supportive of the kind of work that we’re doing in this budget. She’s an example, but there are many people in my community of Etobicoke Centre who are examples of folks who really need that support.", "When I think about some of the things we’re doing in health care—wait times, for example. Since 2003, we’re now best in Canada for surgical wait times. We’ve invested $1.7 billion to fund over three million more medical procedures. We used to have the longest wait times in the country. Now we have the shortest, and we’re going to continue that good work.", "I know one of the priorities that I heard a lot about from seniors, from families, frankly, in Etobicoke Centre, was how important it is to make sure that we’re providing access to doctors and faster access to doctors. A lot of folks need specialist care particularly. So one of the things that we’ve committed to in our platform and, through that, in the budget is to continue to work in that area, to make sure people have access to specialist care.", "I can tell you that a lot of my constituents have raised this issue. They appreciate the progress that has been made. Many do appreciate the progress that has been made, but there’s so much more work to do. I think we on both sides of this House would all agree to that. That’s another issue.", "One of the things that I’d like to highlight also is the issue of mental health. Mental health is an issue that we’re going to continue to hear more and more about, and rightly so, because the growing challenge for us. Of course, since 2003, we launched a comprehensive mental health and addictions strategy focused on children and youth in the first three years. That’s helping 50,000 more kids and their families access the supports they need. We’ve hired more than 770 new mental health workers in schools and community, which has already helped 35,000 kids and their families. We’ve added 5,000 more doctors. We’ve hired about 20,000 more nurses since 2003. Again, these are the kinds of accomplishments and this is the kind of track record that I think people in a community, like mine, where health care is an important issue, value, and they’d like to see it continue.", "When I think about this budget and what’s in this budget for health care, I think about the increasing community services funding by 4% over the next three years, increasing front-line care by increasing the wages of PSWs—we talked about that—and maintaining critical repairs in-hospital to provide better high-quality health care to patients. We’re providing funding of almost $700 million over the next 10 years for that.", "These are the kinds of things that are going to impact people on the ground, and these are the kinds of things that, frankly, Ontarians voted for when they elected us to this Legislature. I would urge members on both sides to support this procedural motion and, supporting that, help us debate this budget and move it along.", "Now, if I may, I’d like to just briefly talk about education. When we think about the progress that has been made in education, it’s the kind of thing we need to continue and we plan to continue through this budget. We’ve committed to continue these investments in education. Test scores are up. Graduation rates are up. The graduation rate in 2003 in Ontario was in the high 60% range, about 68%. Now we’re in the low 80% range, and I think that’s something we can celebrate. That’s not to say that there isn’t more work to be done. There is more work to be done. That’s, in fact, why we need to continue that work and why we need to pass this budget.", "We brought in full-day kindergarten, which of course gives kids the best start in education. Study after study that I’ve read has shown the value of early childhood education on outcomes later in life. Earlier in my remarks, I was talking about the importance of math skills and critical thinking skills in high schools. Well, this is another example of the kinds of investments that we’re making strategically to strengthen our education system and make sure that young people have the skills they need, so that when they do work their way through the system, and for those who choose to pursue graduate studies and university studies and those who move on to the trades or other forms of work, that they have the fundamental skills they need to succeed. I think these are critically important. So full-day kindergarten is critical.", "We’ve invested $4 billion in 23 major post-secondary expansion projects and have added 161,000 student spaces. When I think about student assistance, 370,000 students receive $1 billion annually, and our post-secondary attainment is the highest in the OECD—almost double the average. Again, as I was referring to earlier, there are individuals, certainly, who face challenges graduating, but the overwhelming majority do have access to higher education and are able to succeed and move on into their careers and prosper as a result.", "When I think about some of the other things we’ve done in education—I’m a management consultant. I used to work for a company called the Boston Consulting Group. There’s a company, a competitor, called McKinsey and Company. They had a chance to appraise our education system and they said that we are one of the world’s most improved school systems and we keep getting better. That’s an endorsement, if I’ve ever heard one, of the kinds of things we’ve done in education, and we certainly want that work to continue. Minister Sandals has been doing excellent work and we want that work to continue. So it’s important that we move this budget along and get it passed, and I would urge the members to pass this procedural motion.", "As someone who has a finance background, a business background, and someone who spends a lot of time thinking about how we can grow our economy and how companies can maximize growth in our economy, I’m particularly proud of our attainment in terms of economic growth. We’re third in North America now for foreign direct investment. Forbes named Ontario the top destination for foreign direct investment in North America. Foreign direct investment is a critical measure of success because it means we’re outcompeting other jurisdictions for investment, that we’re a more attractive jurisdiction to do business in. That’s a compliment to the people of Ontario, because they’re highly educated, they’re hard-working and they have a lot to contribute. I think we want that work to continue, Mr. Speaker.", "We have the second-largest financial services industry in North America. I happened to work in financial services for some time. I think this is an area that offers tremendous opportunity, and we need to continue to ensure that that’s the case.", "We’re first in Canada—a major player—in mining. I know that’s an issue not just in my community but particularly for our communities to the north. That’s a track record we want to build on.", "So as I think about this budget and I think about the things we’re doing—we’re investing in infrastructure, we’re investing in education, we’re investing in people, we’re keeping taxes down, we’re keeping regulations low—these are the kinds of things that are going to continue to grow our economy. We’re going to continue to invest in education, and through those investments we’re going to be able to ensure we continue to strengthen our education system and prepare our young people for the jobs of tomorrow. The other investments that we’re making in many other areas are critical, but we’re going to do all this while managing taxpayer dollars wisely. That is so, so important.", "Mr. Speaker, I would urge the members to pass the motion before us." ],

I think the government House leader has talked about why he felt that he needed to do this and the fact that this sets the table for possible night sittings.", "I want at the start, before I make my argument, to say how very proud I was that our interim leader, Jim Wilson, has given me the opportunity to sit in this role as House leader for the official opposition. I had the opportunity to serve as Mr. Wilson’s deputy when he was the House leader. I actually find that the House leaders’ meetings are quite fascinating. Periodically it’s mentioned in the House that, “This matter was referred to the House leaders,” or, “This matter is a decision of the three House leaders.” It almost makes it like it’s this mystical committee that meets every week and makes decisions." ],

  "text" : [ "Well, the member notes publicly that he provides a nice lunch. In fact, the first meeting that I sat on as the opposition House leader, we sat, and I know that the government House leader would have preferred the meetings to be kept confidential and that the contents wouldn’t be discussed in the media. I have to admit that I did talk about my frustration when it came to setting committees. But I do want to publicly state a couple of points that I made in that first meeting.", "One of the first things—in fact, the first thing—that I said was that it certainly wasn’t our intention as an opposition to unduly hold up the budget. I felt, based on the amount of sitting days that we had in July, that we should have been able to come to an agreement to have the budget go through the normal process and not unduly delay the Legislature.", "I also brought up a couple of issues from the last session of Parliament. The issue of the Select Committee on Developmental Services, which, as you know, was within a whisker—probably all they needed was to hit “print” to have the committee report printed. This was a committee made up of all the three parties. It was a consensus committee where all of the groups represented from all the parties sat, had hearings and made recommendations. I felt that that report should be tabled in the Legislature without having to be delayed by the establishment of the committees.", "I also felt that the report from the public accounts committee, the Ornge report—again, all it needed was for the committee to convene and ultimately the report would have been received and referred to the House. I didn’t feel that that report should be unduly delayed as well.", "But what happens in House leaders’—it’s a very interesting dynamic when issues come up, because when I bring these issues up, the parties sometimes will say, “Do you know what? That’s a very interesting point. We’ll think about that. We’ll talk about that next week,” meaning that there will be a decision next week. But you know what? What happens sometimes is, the other party may say, “We did discuss it. Maybe we should defer that to the following week.”", "So you have this—I call it an interesting dynamic, for lack of a better word. People think we make these decisions, that we sit and make decisions. I have to tell you—I’m sure you can hear it in my voice—it’s a bit frustrating to sit with the other two parties when I do see that, in the minority Parliament, albeit it was a rough ride in some cases for the government, there were some things that we were able to move forward, like the Select Committee on Developmental Services.", "I wanted to put those on the record just at the start, as the opposition House leader, because it’s not this milk-and-honey committee where we all seem to get together and agree with each other on the rules of the House. In fact, if you read some of the words in the throne speech, you’ll realize, I think, what the government intends to do. I’m referring to the justice committee and the fact that there were witnesses that were to appear the week after the House ultimately dissolved for the election. The words in the throne speech were, “Let the justice committee write its report.” I think that that was something that struck me.", "We’re here because—the government mentioned committees this morning. We’re at odds, between the opposition and the government, on the composition of the standing committees here at Queen’s Park. Again, the government House leader indicates that it’s holding up the passing of the budget, a budget that, I had indicated at our first House leaders’ meeting, I didn’t want to unduly delay.", "We believe that the standing orders—and the government House leader is using the standing orders today as the reason for the debate. I think the standing orders are very clear. In fact, the standing order that we’re putting on the table regarding committees is standing order 113(a), which says, “No standing or select committee shall consist of more than nine members and the membership of such committees shall be in proportion to the representation of the recognized parties in the House,” whereas the government believes that they should have an absolute majority. I think you heard the government House leader this morning, Speaker, talk about the Chair being separate from that. That’s certainly not what I read in the standing orders. It was reinforced by the Clerks. I apologize that I somehow dragged the Clerks into it by referencing them in my letter that I brought forward.", "It is what it is, and I used the information that I had to make the decision based on the seats that the government and the opposition parties had at the end of the election. As we all know, the government had 58 seats, we had 28 and the NDP had 21. If you use that in a percentage format, it works out to 54.21%, 26.17% and 19.63%. You apply that to standing order 113(a) about the nine-member committee, and it works out, as I said in question period last week, to five members for the government, two members for the Progressive Conservatives and two members for the NDP.", "In every committee I’ve ever been on, Speaker—and I’ve been on committees since I was in my 20s—in every nine-person committee I was on, in every single one, without fail, five outvotes four every time. I can’t say it any clearer than that. I’ve never been on a committee where four members have outvoted five members. Maybe I’m wrong; maybe I just haven’t run in the same circles as the government House leader, but it seems to me pretty easy and democratic.", "The government continues to argue that the impartial Chair cannot be factored into the equation, and they want the committees to be struck as six, two and one. It’s going to ensure that they have five voting members, no matter who is in the chair. I disagree, because I again go back to the standing orders. To me, based on the standing orders, if you want six seats on the committee, you’re going to need 68 or 71 seats. Maybe between your seats and their seats, that gets you your 68 or 71; I don’t know if that’s what you’re thinking. If you look at 2003 to 2007, the government attained those percentages; they had the six seats. I was elected in a by-election in 2010, and that certainly was the case on the committee I was on, the general government committee. That was a committee that was comprised like that.", "Again, there were some times, like 2011, that that didn’t happen, when the minority Parliament—in that case, the government had the minority of members, and we—in terms of “we,” I’m using “we” as the opposition—had the majority. Again, the dynamic was different, depending on who was in the chair. When we were in the chair, you had that dynamic where the Chair allowed the debate to continue. In fact, if you look at what was able to be accomplished during the minority Parliament, I think there were some great things that happened under that committee structure.", "In fact, I still don’t understand—I still believe quite firmly that if the government adhered to my suggestions, the Legislature wouldn’t grind to a halt. The Legislature would not impede the government legislation to the degree that perhaps some of the members opposite would suggest. I happen to think, using our existing standing order 113(a), that we’d be able to work it out, just like we worked it out in the minority Parliament situation. I’ve never been told by the government House leader that under that suggestion—", "Interjections." ],

He was just 17 years old when he signed up with the Essex Scottish. He was sent from Windsor to London and ended up in the RCR, the Royal Canadian Regiment. He was paid $1.10 a day; half of that was sent home to his mother for food. He got shipped to Italy and ended up in an elite combined American and Canadian commando unit known as the First Special Service Force.", "He was trained on the ground as a paratrooper but never actually jumped out of an airplane. One time, Ralph spent 99 straight days in combat on the front lines. During night patrols, these commandos blackened their faces with boot polish and slipped behind the enemy lines armed with V-42 combat knives to take out enemy sentries and patrols. They would leave behind calling cards which read, “The worst is yet to come.” They became known as the Devil’s Brigade or the Black Devils. Hollywood made a movie about them.", "Because he never jumped, Ralph refused to wear his paratrooper wings—until a couple of months ago, when, at the age of 92, Ralph Mayville jumped with a skydiving instructor from 14,000 feet. He says it was so beautiful he never wanted it to end.", "I know Ralph as a gentleman, a man of honour, a man who never wore his wings until he felt he deserved them.

Our government has made a commitment to keeping the auto insurance system fair and more affordable.", "In August of last year, we announced our cost and rate reduction strategy, which is targeting an industry-wide average of a 15% reduction in authorized auto insurance rates within two years. The measures proposed in this bill would move forward on our strategy by helping to reduce costs in the system and continuing to fight fraud. Auto insurance rates are directly linked to claim costs. Reducing cost and uncertainty in the system would help reduce rates for Ontario drivers.", "One of the cornerstones of this legislation is a proposal to transform Ontario’s auto insurance dispute resolution system to help ensure that injured Ontario drivers settle their disputes faster. This legislation would create a new framework for disputes by moving the administrative responsibility and its adjudicative process from FSCO, the Financial Services Commission of Ontario, to the Ministry of the Attorney General. The move would help resolve disputes faster by making the process more effective and efficient while ensuring it remains accessible for accident victims.", "If passed, the changes we’re proposing would expedite the resolution of disputes as well as reduce financial administrative pressures which can increase costs and cause rates to go up. Transforming dispute resolutions would help reduce uncertainty, create long-term stability in claim costs, and provide claimants with faster access to the statutory accident benefits that they require.", "In addition to streamlining dispute resolutions, this bill also proposes measures to protect Ontario consumers and continue cracking down on auto insurance fraud. We’re proposing to establish consumer protection specific to towing and vehicle storage, and also give the government stronger enforcement powers. The proposed changes would provide authority to require towing and storage providers to publish their rates, provide an itemized invoice of their listings of services, accept payments by credit card, tell the driver that their vehicle is being towed for repair or storage, and give the consumer access to his or her towed vehicle to remove personal property.", "Lastly, we’re also proposing to amend the traffic act to remove the exemption for tow trucks under MTO’s commercial vehicle operator’s registration system.", "The new legislation would allow us to set qualifications and standards governing the operation of tow trucks, including driver certification, training requirements and prescribed penalties to violators.", "As well, we’re also helping to protect drivers by authorizing vehicle storage to protect consumers as to when their vehicle can be stored after an accident, accruing charges, and doing so without notice to the owner. This will, again, enable them to save without having abusive storage practices to remove associated costs from the auto insurance system.", "We’re modernizing licensing and disciplinary hearings for insurance agents and adjusters as well. If passed, this means FSCO would have the authority to revoke or immediately suspend the licences of agents and adjusters who act improperly and put the public at risk. This is just another much-needed measure to help reduce rates and help protect Ontario consumers.", "Lastly, the bill would implement measures to reform the prejudgement interest rates for general damages and again reduce costs by protecting and expediting matters more quickly for claimants. This rate, actually, hasn’t been updated since 1990. Linking the rate to current market conditions would help reduce the cost to bodily injury claims and auto insurance systems while still ensuring fairness for consumers.", "As mentioned, higher costs in the system translate to higher insurance premiums, and we’re fighting fraud by lowering those costs.", "We had introduced this back in February. Unfortunately, it was delayed, so we recognize that by expediting it quickly today we’ll be able to act on the very things that consumers require, and that’s to reduce the rates as quickly as possible." ],

I’ll be sharing my time with my colleagues the members for Nipissing, Haldimand–Norfolk and Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound.", "Last month, we lost another 33,900 jobs. It was the 90th consecutive month that our province’s unemployment rate has been higher than the national average. That’s seven and a half years—unbelievable. Liberal policies have made our energy rates the highest in North America. Liberal policies are driving business and investment out of Ontario and putting the squeeze on hard-working families, especially seniors on fixed incomes. Our debt rating outlook has already changed from stable to negative, and soon the government will be underfunding more vital services, like they already are with home care and physiotherapy services for seniors, to pay for higher interest costs on their irresponsible debt.", "The government is clearly living far beyond its means, and instead of taking the time to present a responsible budget with solutions, the Liberals reissued rash and irresponsible promises without a plan to pay for them.", "At the same time that the Liberal government is being absolutely unrealistic and irresponsible in how they spend our money, they had the nerve to tell Ontarians that the government doesn’t trust them to plan their own finances, especially finances in the future. It’s just arrogant and hypocritical for the government to scold Ontarians for not saving enough for their retirement when the Liberals are responsible for increasing the cost of day-to-day living in Ontario: HST on everything they buy, rising government fees, eco taxes, spending more on gas because commutes are longer, a health premium that doesn’t exclusively go to health care and skyrocketing energy bills. If Ontarians aren’t saving for their retirement, it’s because there is no money at the end of the month after they’ve paid for all the essentials. Docking more money from people’s paycheques for the government’s pension scheme will just further squeeze hard-pressed families and lose even more jobs, as the government’s own finance officials have warned.", "This budget is political instead of practical. The government originally presented it last May for the partisan purposes of forcing the NDP to either support a budget that could have been written by former NDP Premier Bob Rae, or create a rift within the NDP by voting against it. The budget is no more credible than this government’s previous claims that the gas plant scandal would cost only $40 million when the real cost, we found out, was at least $1.1 billion. How much more pain will yesterday’s budget inflict on all of us?", "Again, the Liberals achieved their partisan goal of piling on the NDP with the May budget. But now, after an election, they could have taken the time to craft a budget that addressed the needs of Ontario families and businesses instead of Liberal self-interest.", "We asked them to take their time. We told them we would not hold them to their rash political promise to rush this budget through. Instead of thoughtful policy, Premier Wynne decided it’s more important to continue her vendetta against Andrea Horwath, the leader of the NDP, and her party, and everyone has to shoulder the consequences. Higher taxes, cuts to front-line services and more job losses are coming down the road because the Liberals will increase debt by spending $12.5 billion more than taxpayers have already given the government.", "We’ve already seen front-line cuts: 40 nursing positions cut in North Bay; 90 nurses put out of work in Ottawa; cuts to nurses, 34 of them, in Windsor; and cuts to teachers in Windsor.", "Norman Levine, the managing director of Portfolio Management, said this budget makes both debt and unemployment worse. He warned, “What’s going to happen is once the budget comes out, rating agencies are going to downgrade them, and there will be more than one downgrade because they’re showing no plans to address it, so they’re going to be downgraded multiple times.”", "That leads me to the response to a question in question period about future downgrades on our debt and skyrocketing costs to service that debt. The Premier was quite selective in choosing to only put forth in the response that the Dominion Bond Rating Service had reaffirmed our rating. But if you actually read their press release—and I’ve asked the library to send me the entire report—it’s really quite negative. I’ll just read it to be fair to the government: “DBRS acknowledges that the medium-term outlook has somewhat weakened since last year, owing to a combination of slightly lower revenues and higher program spending projections, raising doubts that the government will have the fortitude to make difficult decisions required to adhere to its original targets....", "“Overall, while the recent erosion in fiscal outlook is manageable, the province remains vulnerable given the extent of fiscal effort needed amidst below-potential economic conditions. This remains a concern for DBRS and highlights the risk of stretching the return to balance over an extended period of time and relying on improving economic conditions to restore fiscal soundness.”", "I just know from my experience running rather large bureaucracies in the past that when the bond rating agencies say they have concern, it’s a code word for “watch out.”", "And it goes on. It’s actually a very negative comment on the government. They don’t believe, as I said, that you have the fortitude within the next three years to actually stop your wild spending and give us all a break and balance the books.", "I just want to reiterate, Mr. Speaker, and then wind up. A credit downgrade has tangible consequences since a 1% increase in the interest Ontario pays on its debt will cost as much as $3 billion more annually—$3 billion that we will be borrowing, by the way. All Ontarians will pay the price for higher borrowing costs that will take billions out of priority services or billions out of everyone’s wallet in new taxes.", "To this day, the finance minister and Premier keep telling us to trust them. Somehow they will find a way to balance the budget within three years even though they’re spending more money. Somehow they will introduce new programs and operational spending while paying billions more in debt interest. Somehow the additional billions in debt servicing costs won’t have an impact on front-line services. No wonder media have dubbed this budget a “fiscal fairy tale.”", "As I’ve said, it’s immoral to give people false hope with a budget that media have rightly dubbed a “fiscal fairy tale” only to have to take away services and programs when the lenders put a gun to the Liberals’ heads and say their line of credit has dried up. It happened to Bob Rae, and it will happen again.", "How can the finance minister and Premier keep a straight face as they preach the impossible? While they blame taxpayers and the economy for not delivering as much revenue as they expected, they refuse to admit that it is their own bad policy decisions that have made a mess of our economy. Other governments, both provincial and federal, in this country are well on their way to balancing their budgets. What’s the difference? Well, Mr. Speaker, I’m looking at it across the aisle.", "You should be ashamed, for having driven Ontario’s economy into the ground, for destroying our manufacturing sector, for devastating the horse racing community, for forcing seniors to decide between food and hydro. You should be ashamed, for causing a generation of eager college and university graduates to lose hope of finding a good job in Ontario and move westward.", "We’ll be voting against this budget, in support of the people and businesses and jobs across Ontario—the businesses that can’t afford to have their future mortgaged by bad policy decisions and the 33,900 people who lost their jobs last month alone. We will hold the Liberals to account, on their behalf, for their unrealistic and unaffordable budget. We will do that each and every day of the week." ],

I’m going to talk a little bit about my local riding and the things that I don’t see for my riding, and I’m going to talk about the big picture for Ontario.", "We know this government is going to spend—if there is one thing that they do well, spending is probably it—so we know there’s going to be money. But part of our job as the official opposition is to ensure, on behalf of the taxpayers—the people paying the freight—that every dollar is spent wisely and effectively and, most importantly, for the benefit of the people who are actually paying.", "So I was pleased to see, particularly with my recent critic portfolio, that there’s money earmarked for social services and long-term care and wellness. However, Mr. Speaker, in reviewing the budget a little bit last night, I noted the actual interest payment that is made on our debt is more than the whole social services sector. There are people out there who need programs; there are people out there who need services. We’re spending more on interest payments than we are on those most fragile, those most needy, those who need a hand up. There are 21,000 people currently on developmental services wait-lists across our province. That’s horrible in the great province of Ontario.", "We are hoping, but this government does not have a great track record of producing when they say they will do something. What they do promise, and break, are things like, “I will not raise your taxes.” We all remember the health tax a number of years ago, so I’m fearful that, again, we’re going to find those same situations.", "This government is spending $3 billion more than it brings in in revenues. Your home budget can’t take it. The people watching and listening at home, their home budget can’t take that and continue to go down without losing the home. We were hoping to see some fiscal restraint. We were hoping to see that they would have actually learned the lesson. Sadly, that’s not the case.", "The interim leader, the great member from Simcoe–Grey, has been here for 24 years, I believe, and served this province marvellously over those years as health minister and as energy minister in past PC governments. He expressed that we are now a province that is in a debt situation, and this government is doing nothing to pull us back out of that. And yet, miraculously, even though they’re going to spend $3 billion more this year than they bring in in revenue, they’ve committed to balancing the budget in 2017-18. I’m not certain, without voodoo economics, how they’re going to be able to do that. You can’t continue to overspend and deliver all the services and not make cuts along the way somewhere.", "When I was out on the election campaign trail, people were asking me that very question: “How will the Liberals do this? They’re promising. They have made commitments to us.”", "That brings me to my local area. This is supposed to be the infrastructure budget, one of the biggest infrastructure spending budgets in recent history in our great province. Yet in my riding of Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound, we have a number of long-term-care and aging nursing homes that need help—not one word in there, not one dollar allotted to those. Again, those seniors who have built this great province and to whom we owe what we have today—nothing in there to address their needs.", "Hospitals were supposedly in this budget. I’ve referenced in this House, at every opportunity, the Markdale hospital. Twelve years ago, the government of the day, the Liberals, promised and committed, and challenged the people of Markdale and area to raise money for their hospital: $12 million. In fact, it’s now $13 million with interest, because it has been sitting in the bank for a dozen years, doing nothing to help the people it was intended to help. Not one thing is in there about that, Mr. Speaker, not one commitment.", "Now, in fairness to the minister, I did raise the question last week, and he has agreed to a meeting, but that meeting means nothing if there’s not action behind that.", "There was talk in the budget of schools. Again, I went through the list looking for John Diefenbaker Secondary School in Hanover—a commitment the government made to that great community, to our Bluewater District School Board—but nothing was in there, Mr. Speaker.", "So you can understand, I hope, and I hope even the people across the aisle can understand, why I have a slight degree of concern. I wonder if I can trust them, because they’ve made these promises to the people of my riding, and they have not come through. They have not delivered.", "What they have delivered is the highest debt and the highest deficit in the history of our great province. We carry more debt today than the rest of the provinces combined. Ontario should be the economic engine of this great Confederation. It’s now accepting handouts. It’s actually embarrassing, I think, for most of us to even admit that this government of 10 years, this Liberal government, has run us into the ground. They’re borrowing from those young pages in front of you, from the young kids out there. That’s who I care about, Mr. Speaker: the next generation. What are they going to do if this government doesn’t soon turn things around?", "I’m concerned that there’s going to be more waste and more scandals. In my two and a half years, I’ve watched things like the gas plant billion-dollar boondoggle; I’ve watched eHealth; I’ve watched and learned of Ornge and the money that has been wasted in all of those projects and programs. Again, every single dollar that is spent on those boondoggles, on those scandals, is not going to the front line, to the people most needy: those seniors out there who have seen their hydro bills double and triple in the last three years. We’re being told already by this Liberal government that you can expect those rates to increase again and double in the next three to four years. People are coming to my office every day saying, “I can’t afford my hydro bills”—nothing in there to address that.", "Now, they did talk about taking the debt retirement charge off, I think in 2017 or 2018—", "Interjection." ],

I’m going to quote from here: “If the Liberal government sticks to this budget, there will be pain. There will be hard choices.

They’ve made some very poor decisions. They’ve made decisions that are hurtful and painful to the people of this great province, and we were hoping to see that they would acknowledge that and step back and say, “You know what? Even with a majority we understand that we have to make a change of direction. We have to do that.”", "It’s not a practical budget. Yes, there’s going to be some spending and yes, that hopefully will ensure that there are some jobs created out there, but you can’t continue to spend more than you bring in and not raise taxes somewhere down the road. That’s probably going to come at us, and we just need to make sure that the people of Ontario understand that.", "The other thing I heard loud and clear at the door—from small businesses, medium businesses and large businesses, as well as the employees—was the pension plan.

It’s great to think that you’re going to get a pension, but at some point people have to pay for this pension. It’s not right to tell people that you’re going to take 1.9% of their existing paycheque to do something that they may wish not to do. At the end of the day, a lot of the people were telling me, “I don’t have money at the end of my budget, with the increased hydro costs, with the increased cost of consumer goods because of this government, because of the gasoline prices. I don’t have any money, or I would be putting it into an RRSP.” If they don’t have it and they didn’t have it, how are they going to have it today, miraculously?

It’s a good way to show that we can work together. I’m glad to see that he has actually taken on full-time responsibility, because before we had a part-time ag minister. So that’s a step in the right direction. I think that the minister is sincere in what he’s saying as he’s prepared to work on that file, as is the Minister of Health for my Markdale hospital. But at the end of the day, words don’t help people. What we need to see is action. We need to see a budget that is actually going to deliver. They’re going to spend, as I’ve said at the very outset, more than any other province in our Confederation. We want effective use of dollars, we want to make sure that they’re accountable, and we want a government that, when they say, “I’m going to do this,” at the end of the day have done it. In many cases, that isn’t the case.", "A number of years ago in their budget, they had $40 million earmarked for nurses. A couple of years after, 1% of that had been spent on actual hiring of nurses and providing front-line care. So again, I’m a little bit reticent to believe there has been a massive change in their thought process. I have concern that they’re going to deliver on those types of things and they’re not going to create more administration, more bureaucracies like the LHINs, like the OPAs that we’ve been talking about here for two and a half years. The OPA went from six to 12 people to 300 people.

We need to be thinking about those special-needs folks out in all of our communities. Social services, as I say, is my critic portfolio now. Those people have not received increases since the 1990s. There are more people needing the services and yet we’re not doing much to help those most needy. We’re not lowering prices for the people who are out there struggling from day to day and paycheque to paycheque, while yet we are imposing things on them like this RPP.", "We need to ensure with every single budget, every single dollar and every single line item of this budget that there are people at the very forefront of every thought process we have, and if it’s not helping people and providing better and more services, then it shouldn’t be there.

We’re losing, again, between 300,000 and 600,000 jobs in our province. For 90 months now, I think, we’ve had the highest unemployment in the country. That’s deplorable, Mr. Speaker. You’ve had huge hits in your great riding. We need to be turning this around and creating the environment so that businesses want to remain in Ontario, first and foremost. We certainly want those in Ontario to expand. We want them to hire more workers. And we want to look attractive to other companies that would locate to our great province of Ontario. As our interim leader alluded to, the concern of the bond rating agencies could actually trigger higher interest rates. If that happens, why are you going to come here as opposed to another province?", "I spoke on this at length on the campaign trail with people. We’re spending half a billion dollars a year with 0.5% interest. Some say it will go to $3 billion if we go up one percentage point. That’s $3 billion that would not be going to seniors, to home care, to special-needs children, to people for their drugs. We’ve heard in here over and over of people with need of special drugs for their ailments, and yet the government typically says no, no, no, and they find some bureaucratic, administrative reason why they won’t do that, as opposed to trying to find a way to move forward.", "And yet this budget, again, was a bit of pixie dust, saying, “We’ll be all things to all people.

I teach my two boys, Zachary and Benjamin—Zach’s going to be 20 shortly and Ben just turned 17—that there is no free lunch in this world. You’ve got to go out and earn your living. You’ve got to live within your means. You have to spend within practical realities. They all want, as we all do, nice, new, shiny, glossy things. My son keeps telling me he wants new golf clubs, and I say, “I want a golf course, but that doesn’t mean I get one tomorrow unless I’m going to go out and work hard and find a way to buy that.” So, similar to him: Go out and work hard.

It’s deplorable that we would say that. It’s larger than the whole sector of social services. Community Living folks, children’s aid societies.

You need to be making decisions, strategic decisions, decisions with compassion, absolutely, but decisions that get this province back on the rails to success, that ensure that we’re creating jobs and we’re creating the business climate in which companies want to create jobs so we actually have more people coming to Ontario than leaving.", "Right now probably the biggest industry out there is the Liberal moving vans, moving people out of this province. There’s a mass exodus of people heading west into other provinces. We have to turn that around. The only way to do that is to either lower your spending or increase your revenues. They’ve said, although I’m not certain again we can trust them, there will be no new tax increases. Well, then, the only other alternative, if you’re not going to do that, is to lower spending, and we didn’t see that in this budget.", "So, yes, I do have misgivings about the budget. I hope to see some benefit from some of the spending that they’re going to do, because no doubt they will spend. At the end of the day we need to make sure we stop that, we turn this train around and we become, again, the leader of Confederation.", "With that, Mr. Speaker, I’ll finish and turn it over to my colleague, the duke—Haldimand–Norfolk." ],

  "text" : [ "Further to this budget motion debate, a few days ago I had an opportunity to rise in question period, with a question to the Premier. In three years this government is predicting a zero deficit. However, the hand-picked economist hired by this government, Don Drummond, is projecting a $30.2-billion deficit in three years. Again, my question to the Premier: How do you square a $30.2-billion discrepancy? To me, that’s the essence of this July budget debate: a $12.5-billion shortfall today and three years down the road a $30.2-billion shortfall.", "So Drummond says $30.2 billion in the red three years down the road; Ms. Wynne says it will be zero. Speaker, I find that really quite a spread.", "To date, the Premier, her finance minister and the Treasury Board president have really presented nothing by way of a plan, yet alone any specific measures to halt the deficit spending that we’ve been seeing of late using borrowed money, the deficit spending we’ve been seeing for close to 11 years now. Now we hear talk of asset sales—nothing too concrete on that as well. I don’t object entirely to that kind of a notion. It’s something you do when you have to pay down, for example, a very large debt. You don’t sell assets just because you can’t meet your operating expenses, or you don’t sell assets to try and lower your deficit. We’ve seen asset sales in my riding. Both Haldimand county and Norfolk county have sold their power authorities to Hydro One. We see a situation now where the province may sell part, or some of the assets anyway, of Hydro One.", "There are some assets that have been built over many, many decades courtesy of people’s electricity bills. You’ve got to pay those bills. I don’t think people were paying their bills on the understanding that the Ontario government, once it gets in trouble with its operating expenses, at minimum, let alone the debt, would be selling off what has been built up over many, many years. That’s certainly not the way we prefer to see people run their family finances.", "However, we do recognize that governments, like families, have to pay interest on the money they borrow. That’s something you have to do. At the end of the year, this debt, we know, is going to come in at something like $289 billion. The interest on that debt: $11 billion this year alone. Again, as we’ve heard during this debate, that’s $11 billion that’s not going to health, to education, not being allocated to the most vulnerable in our society. I might point out the debt was half that amount when this government took power back in 2003. Hence that oft-quoted phrase “Dalton the Debt-Doubler” comes to mind. That’s the legacy of Mr. McGuinty.", "Now, Speaker, time will tell what interest rates, or what the debt servicing charges are going to be on the debt three years hence, when we hear the projection of a zero deficit, when we hear a projection of a $30.2-billion deficit. The projection for the debt in fiscal year 2017-18 is $411.4 billion. That’s the debt we’ll be looking at. That’s the debt that coming generations will be looking at as well.", "Back to my question to the Premier. The President of Treasury Board responded, acknowledging that the deficit in three years will be $30.2 billion if nothing is done. I’m mindful, and I would be quoting King Lear, as I recall, “Nothing will come of nothing: speak again.”", "We need more information. We, in the opposition, continue to ask for that information. We’d like to know—this just came up from the last speaker—will it be asset sales? Will it be jacking up taxes on the middle class? Will it be cutting spending? That means cutting government programs. That means cutting government jobs.", "Either way, in that final year—and three years is not very far away—you have to take a $30.2-billion deficit down to zero. I don’t think you’re able to do that, personally.", "Moody’s Investors Service have downgraded the outlook for the province of Ontario’s debt from stable to negative. They gave a reason: “After several years of weak to moderate economic growth, and higher than previously” indicated “deficits projected for the next two years, the province is facing a greater challenge to return to balanced outcomes than previously” indicated.", "According to the 2014-15 budget, Ontario’s net long-term debt will increase—just over the course of this year—from $269 billion to the $289-billion deficit I mentioned earlier. The budget indicates the government will be paying $11.271 billion in interest on that debt. But when you hear about a credit rating downgrade—I gave the example of Moody’s—that would suggest to the lenders that higher interest rates could be in order, and indicating that higher interest rates on, for example, $250 billion in provincial debt securities.", "So if the interest rate increased to 4.9%—that would be a 1% increase—the province would need to pay roughly not $11 billion and change, but $14 billion and change on interest payments on the debt, an increase estimated at $2.89 billion. That’s just in one year, Speaker.", "I mentioned earlier today that interest on the debt is already the third-largest expenditure of the Ontario budget after health and education, just before all the money we spend on social services. Secondly, these interest payments on the debt are the fastest-growing expense of this provincial government, growing by 8% a year.", "During question period, MPP Ted Arnott, the member for Wellington–Halton Hills, pointed out that over the next three years, debt interest costs will go up 8% each and every year. Again, the average citizen in Ontario does not accrue that money, that $11 billion a year that is being paid out.", "So here we are. We’re on the heels of a credit rating downgrade. The speech from the throne touted 10 years of $130 billion in public infrastructure spending. They had a quote to justify this, a quote from the former Bank of Canada governor, David Dodge, that “with low interest rates, it is the right time for governments and the private sector to invest in infrastructure.”", "David Dodge left the Bank of Canada, I think, in 2008. There are people predicting, certainly in the United States, that the low interest rate bubble may well burst. Here’s an opposing opinion, another opinion, from economist Jack Mintz—that “if interest rates which have been at a 20-year low, rise, that” debt “burden would become significantly heavier.... [I]f interest rates rise to historical norms, each point increase in interest could add a minimum of $3 billion in annual interest payments.” Jack Mintz goes on to say, “That would severely cripple Ontario’s ability to deliver services.”", "With respect to today’s economic status, the fiscal status of this government is reflected in the budget we just received, and without attempting to be melodramatic, I do suggest that many of us lie awake at night wondering, is this province approaching the edge of an economic apocalypse? We saw this before; we saw this in the Bob Rae days.", "I kind of summarize this as the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse—in this case, debt, taxation, energy, of course, and red tape. They’re all galloping in tandem. They’re under a four-horse hitch, if you will, of wasteful spending and scandal. Now, we traditionally think of famine, war, pestilence and death as the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. These have occurred, obviously, over the past 9,000 years of recorded history. I feel people in the province of Ontario have little concern with these issues right now, but I do particularly consider the province’s debt—again, in my view, caused by wasteful spending—as the first horseman, looming over several generations of people in Ontario.", "This is debt not caused by lack of government revenue. We do not have a revenue problem in the province of Ontario; we have a spending problem—a wasteful and irresponsible spending problem. We now know this government plans to add $12.5 billion to this government debt in this fiscal year alone. At this rate, we’ll probably surpass Don Drummond’s prediction of a $411.4-billion debt in fiscal year 2017-18. At some point—and I think many have done this—you’ve got to sit down with your kids and explain some of this stuff to them, because they’re going to inherit these kinds of problems.", "The second horseman is big taxes. Big taxes fund big government. Big taxes fund big government public sector unions. This year’s budget is projected to hike taxes by $3 billion. Again, high taxation rates inevitably are correlated with high spending rates, much of it in that wasteful spending category. Over the past 11 years I have witnessed, first of all, the largest income tax increase in the history of Ontario; secondly, the largest consumption tax increase in the history of Ontario—all of these from a gentleman, the Liberal leader of the day and then the Premier of the day, who came on our television screens, looked us square in the eye and indicated to us, “I will not raise your taxes.”", "Interjection." ],

Energy prices, in particular electricity, have brought Ontario’s consumers and industry to their knees. Electricity-intensive industries are closing up shop. Homeowners who heat with electricity, many of them down in my riding, are burning an awful lot of wood in the winter, and they’re not using their air conditioning in the summer. For this reason, I consider, in this case, the highest energy bills, the highest electricity bills in North America as the third horseman of our economic apocalypse—again, no help in sight. This budget did not seem to dwell on the price of electricity.", "As with debt and high taxes, much of the reason for the high electricity bills is overspending by government agencies—we think of OPG; we think of Hydro One. Large electricity consumers in this city, Toronto, pay twice what people pay in Montreal, Winnipeg and Chicago. In the United States, energy prices are falling because of shale gas. Yet, in Ontario, the government says that prices will rise yet another 46%. So there’s something wrong here as well, Speaker.", "The fourth and final horseman of Ontario’s approaching economic apocalypse, in my view, comprises the myriad rules and regulations, the forms that one has to fill out, forms and red tape—bureaucratic red tape, unnecessary red tape—that suffocates farmers and suffocates business and consumers alike. There are so many regulations, I think many have lost count. There’s, again, quite a range in the figures. The government estimates something like 365,000 separate regulations. I know the Toronto Star, several years ago, ran a story indicating 500,000 rules in the province of Ontario. Again, unnecessary bureaucratic red tape is, by an accounting definition, wasteful spending. The Canadian Federation of Independent Business tallies the cost, again, at something like $11 billion a year just for the private sector.", "Obviously, it’s time to pull in the reins on wasteful spending and on the four horsemen, as represented in my view, by debt, taxes, high energy costs and red tape. The alternative for Ontario and our coming generations will not be pretty. Again, we need look no further than jurisdictions like Greece; Sacramento, California; or Detroit to see where our future may lie.", "I’d like to close with talk about deficit and the debt. It’s something I feel we do need to repeat almost endlessly. Deficit, as we know, is a net addition to the debt in one year. The debt is how much we’ve borrowed over the total of many, many years. Essentially, the debt is nothing more than accumulated deficits. I wanted to mention that because people lose sight of that on occasion. Just a bit of history: It took 23 Premiers and 136 years to accumulate a debt of $139 billion. It took Dalton McGuinty, along with his successor Kathleen Wynne, only 10 years to double the debt to $289 billion by the end of this year. Simply put, we continue to see budgets, as with the one we heard yesterday, that spend far more money than they take in. I’ll wrap up by saying—and I think every family and every business in Ontario knows this—that that situation is not sustainable." ],

I want to thank my House leader for his creativity, if I can.", "I am pleased to rise this afternoon, on behalf of New Democrats, to lead off our debate on the 2014 budget motion.", "Speaker, I think it’s clear that the people of Ontario have heard quite a bit about the budget in the last number of days. They’ve heard quite a lot about the budget. A lot of things have been said by many people over the last couple of days about this budget—in fact, probably over the last couple of weeks and maybe even over the last couple of months we could say that the people of Ontario have heard about this budget or at least bits and pieces of this budget, depending on who’s talking about it, Speaker, of course. They’ve heard the Premier read her list of promises, as we like to call them, and they’ve heard the Liberals come up with all kinds of ways to describe their various plans. They have told us that of course their budget is a progressive budget. Ontarians have been told by the Liberals that this is the most progressive budget that has ever been tabled in this Legislature ever on earth, and it’s something Liberals crow about constantly. They been told that this is as good as it gets, that this is the only kind of budget you can have in Ontario. It’s as good as families could ever hope for. It’s the best thing since sliced bread, and it’s sliced bread with the word “progressive” all over it.", "A budget is about more than just spin, and what we’ve heard over the last number of months—since May, probably—is really good spin by the Liberals about their budgets. Budgets are more than spin, however, and they’re more than just a first glance. They’re more than just a surface kind of picture. They’re actually much more important than that, and it’s more than just the story that the Liberals choose to tell. It’s more than just the tale that Liberals choose to weave for the people of Ontario. The budget is as much about the fine print, Speaker, as it is about the headlines. In fact, I would submit to you, the members of this chamber and the people of Ontario that the budget is in fact far more than just the headlines. In fact, the budget isn’t even the headlines. The budget is definitely about the details, and we all know what’s in the details. The devil is in the details, and likewise with this budget.", "This budget is definitely in fact, not this budget but any budget is about setting out priorities and choosing amongst priorities. It’s about presenting a plan that either addresses the biggest challenges of our province and our families or fails to address those challenges. When you look at this particular budget, and when you take a real hard look at this budget, you see that there’s a big difference between the Liberal spin or the Liberal weave and the fine print.", "As the Globe and Mail wrote just today, and I quote, there is “a very wide gap” between the Premier’s rhetoric “and the actual budget itself.” This isn’t a surprise to New Democrats. We’ve known this for some time, but it’s good to see that there’s finally some clarity around what this budget means for Ontario families. This is not a budget that puts families first or makes life more affordable and more fair for the people of this province. Not at all, Speaker. To quote today’s editorial in the Globe, despite all the hot air about this being a progressive plan, again the quote, this “is an austerity budget.” Scratch below the surface and this budget doesn’t look progressive after all. Scratch below the surface and you find some pretty concerning plans at the heart of this government’s roadblock.", "Interjections." ],

I would advise the Liberal members to read their budget and actually acknowledge for the good people of Ontario that in fact the job of opposition is to actually shed light on the plans of government, and that’s what we are doing: We’re shedding light on the plans of this government that are contained in that budget. In fact, when you open that drape or unshroud the budget from the rhetoric that Liberals have painted it in—that red paint, I guess you would call it—you’ll see a budget that is not in fact progressive at all, and that’s something that is quite worrisome for New Democrats.", "This is a budget that includes plans for a complete fire sale of public assets, and it aims to fork over new giveaways to the biggest corporations in our province. It’s a budget that delivers on a private pension plan, a Harper-style private pension plan, this year. So this year, Ms. Wynne found her way to buddy up with Mr. Harper when it comes to making sure that banks and insurance companies are happy about retirement income of Ontarians that they can get their fingers on. They’ve said, “Yeah, sure, we’ll open the doors in Ontario to that kind of pension plan, and guess what? It’s so important, it’s the first thing we’re going to do when it comes to retirement savings for Ontarians. We’re going to make sure that the banks and the insurance companies get first crack because we’re going to buddy up with Stephen Harper and we’re going to make sure PRPPs, private pension plans, come to Ontario sooner rather than later.” Those wishes of Stephen Harper and the big banks are being fulfilled by the Premier and her progressive team of Liberals over there. But what it also does is it leaves people waiting for a public pension plan and wondering if they’ll ever even see that public pension plan in their lifetime.", "Let’s just get an idea here of what we’re talking about. Banks and insurance companies that want Stephen Harper pensions are getting them this year. People who can’t make ends meet now and who have no hope of making ends meet when they’re in their retirement years are going to have to wait to some point in the future for a public pension plan that actually respects their savings and doesn’t gouge them with all kinds of administrative fees and costs. That’s something that’s going to have to wait to maybe 2017; I suspect much later than that, seeing the track record of Liberal promise-breaking that we’ve seen over a decade in office that this government has shown the people of Ontario. But we will wait and see.", "I think the important thing, though, is to acknowledge that today the priority for Liberals in their budget is PRPPs, Stephen Harper-style pensions, as opposed to public pension plans, which are kicked down the field to 2017.", "What else? This budget forecasts cuts that are cuts we have not seen in the province since the days of Mike Harris. I have watched many times the Liberals across the way stand up in their space and rue the days of Mike Harris and talk about how terrible those days were and talk about how they’re doing everything they can to take us to a place where those cuts are no longer felt here in Ontario, to kind of make up for that time when that party was in office under that leadership.", "In this very budget, Speaker, this Liberal government is primed to bring forward cuts that we have not seen in this province since the ones we saw when the Harris government was in office, cuts that put front-line public services and good jobs at risk. It’s a budget that promises to make it back to balance at some point but refuses to tell us what will be sold off and which services will be contracted out and how many jobs are going to be cut and lost to actually make that balance happen. It’s kind of like a magic act, I guess: “Oh, yes, we’re going to reach balance, and just you watch; we’re going to wave our magic wand and that balance is going to occur.” Well, everybody knows that’s not the case. The government itself—both the Premier and the finance minister—has said straight out that cuts are going to happen, that pain is going to happen. They’re just not being honest with the public about what that pain is going to look like. They’re just not detailing that particular list of what the cuts and the layoffs or firings are going to look like in this province.", "It’s a budget that is silent, absolutely silent, when it comes to any real action to address some of the very serious challenges that are facing our families here in Ontario, whether it’s soaring hydro bills—and I know other members have talked about this already—or the loss of good-paying jobs for Ontarians to be able to make ends meet. This budget provides no relief to families that are struggling to make ends meet, families that desire a better future and a better job. None of that is in that budget, Speaker. In fact, I think what I’ve said in the last few minutes overall is that this budget is not at all what it appears to be—not at all.", "Today, I’m really glad to have another opportunity to talk about this Liberal government’s plans because they aren’t plans that put the people of Ontario first and because our job as New Democrats is very important and very clear. We are going to spend some time explaining our concerns and our problems with this budget. The people of Ontario deserve to know what the Liberals have in store for them over the next little while.", "New Democrats know that, over the next little while, we have some important work to do. The people have sent us here to do a very, very important job. The people of Ontario know exactly what it is that New Democrats are very good at doing. We’re very good at holding governments to account, and we’re very good at wading through the Liberal tall tales to get to the facts of the matter. What we are going to do is make sure that we are reassuring Ontarians that New Democrats are here to stand up for them in the Legislature. We are standing up for them, we are going to be putting them first, because that’s what we always stand for as New Democrats. We have not moved from that place, and we certainly won’t move from that place with our new role here in the Legislature. We stand up for what is right, Speaker, and we stand up for what is fair.", "Ontarians have given us that very important job to do: the important job of taking a hard look at the numbers, reading the fine print and holding this government to account. We will do our job each and every day: looking out for families, advocating for families, defending the public interest and making sure that the tall tales told by the government across the way are translated—let’s say it that way—into a real picture for the people of Ontario. We’ll stand up for front-line services, as New Democrats do time and time again. We will stand up for front-line services for the people of this province, and we will stand up for accountable public spending that puts the priorities of the families of this province first.", "That’s why New Democrats are speaking out about this Trojan Horse budget, Speaker, where things are not actually what they first appear to be. Why is this a Trojan Horse plan for Ontario? As I said, it looks like one thing on the one hand. It puts on a real good show on the one hand and it comes across as something that it is not. But inside this Trojan Horse budget are all sorts of surprises that the Liberals want to keep hidden, that the Liberals would rather us not talk about and, furthermore, that the Liberals would rather not have the public, Ontarians, know are in that budget. They’re tucked away in the backrooms of this building, in the backrooms of Bay Street. That’s where they want that information kept.", "You scratch below the surface of this Trojan Horse budget and you find regressive plans—regressive plans—that will not work for the people of Ontario. Start asking some direct questions, and the government tries to change the subject and refuses to give a straight answer. I know that my NDP caucus colleagues have been with me in question period for the last couple of days. I cannot get a straight answer from the Premier and we cannot get a straight answer from the finance minister. In fact, when we leave this chamber and we walk out those doors, we go to the media scrums, and I watch as the media tries to get the answers from the Premier, or at least from the finance minister. Again, Liberals refuse to come clean. They refuse to be upfront with the opposition and with New Democrats, and they refuse to be upfront with the media, about what is in this Trojan Horse budget.", "The Premier refuses to even repeat what it is that she put in her platform. She refuses to tell us how much she is counting on getting for selling off assets that belong to Ontarians and refuses to tell us what all the items are that are on that chopping block.", "In fact, they tag a number in the budget but refuse to say where that number comes from—$3.15 billion. Apparently, it’s what the Liberals are going to get from selling off assets. But have they told us which assets are going to be sold off? No. When I asked, straight out here in the Legislature to the Premier, which assets were going to add up to that very precise number of $3.15 billion—it wasn’t $3 billion; it wasn’t $3.5 billion; it wasn’t $4 billion; it wasn’t $2.5 billion. It was $3.15 billion. It sounds like a pretty precise number to me, and yet we have no idea because they refuse to answer our questions and they refuse to tell Ontarians. They refuse to be upfront and honest about where that $3.15 billion is coming from when it comes to asset sales. That’s not right. It seems to me that that’s not right. It seems to me that the right thing to do is to be upfront with the people when you’re selling a plan to them called a budget. That’s something that’s quite disconcerting for New Democrats, because we believe that people do have the right to know and should have the right to know what their government has in store for them when it comes to selling off some of the most important assets that we have.", "I think it’s sad that we have a Liberal government that actually believes that burning the furniture to heat the house is the right thing to do. Even the Harris government that they moan about so much—that I moaned about so much, frankly, because I thought they did some pretty bad things. But even the Harris government wasn’t prepared to do the sell-offs that the Liberals are talking about in their budget.", "The last time I looked under “progressive” in the dictionary, the fire sale of assets to heat the house wasn’t in there. I think that that’s not a progressive thing and I know that’s not something that progressives actually believe in. I think the Liberals are having a bit of an identity crisis over there because they like to talk about progressive things but they certainly don’t put progressive things in their budget.", "It’s a budget that’s built on hidden costs and hidden cuts. They’re basically putting forward a budget that’s got all kinds of hidden nasties inside of it.", "New Democrats oppose these hidden costs and these hidden cuts. New Democrats oppose the mass sell-off of public assets owned by the people of this province. The deep cuts that are coming to front-line public services, New Democrats oppose. The new corporate giveaways that aren’t guaranteed to create any jobs at all, or at least not here at home, necessarily, here in the province of Ontario—New Democrats oppose that. We oppose the cuts to public health care that we’ve seen as hospital budgets have been frozen, year over year, the elimination of hundreds of child care spaces in communities across the province. The last time I looked, having a healthy child care system that people can afford, that’s licensed, that’s available, that’s appropriate for the people of this province and the families of this province is a pretty progressive goal.", "Liberals instead are shutting down child care centres in at least 18 communities around this province. That is not a progressive thing, not a progressive thing at all. In fact, it was the Liberal government, through its ill-thought-out implementation of their full-day learning program, of their all-day kindergarten program, that created the crisis in the child care sector in the first place. The Liberals have plugged their ears and closed their eyes to the mess that they made in the child care sector, and now the chickens are coming home to roost.", "We’re being told by the President of the Treasury Board that small communities and rural communities and communities in small-town Ontario are just going to have to buck up. They’re not going to have a hospital anymore and they’re not going to have child care anymore. They’re not going to have most public services anymore because Liberals don’t think it’s progressive to have those kinds of things available to Ontarians all across the province. New Democrats actually disagree with that in a big way. We think that’s the wrong way to go. We think it’s shameful that the Liberals have gone in that direction.", "Another thing that we oppose: the willingness of this government to put private pension plans and the profits of big banks ahead of real retirement security for Ontarians. I spoke about that already. It’s something we’re opposed to. We do not think that PRPPs are the right way to go. We don’t think that Harper-style pensions are the right way to go. Apparently, the Liberals do. The last time I looked, no progressives across this country think that PRPPs are the right way to go with pensions, but somehow Liberals think that this is progressive. I think they need to do some research as to what is and isn’t progressive when it comes to retirement income.", "There are hidden costs and hidden cuts, and I’ve just talked about some of them in this Trojan Horse budget, Speaker. There are costs and cuts that do not serve the people of this province and that New Democrats, frankly, cannot support.", "Take the Premier’s plan to sell off a wide range of public assets. Yesterday, her Minister of Finance talked about unlocking the value of OPG, Hydro One and the LCBO. These are very profitable assets that help to pay the bills in this province, year over year over year. They’re assets that work for the people of our province and that help to fund our health care system, our education system and the public services that all of us rely on time and time again.", "But once in a while the Liberals forget that they should be serving the people of this province first. They seem to forget Mike Harris, for example. I’ll use Mike again as an example. I hope Mike’s not watching. He’s going to be mad at me for this, but that’s okay. We’ve never been friends, and so it wouldn’t make a difference. They forget Mike Harris and the disastrous sell-off of the 407. You know what? I’m an MPP, like all of the MPPs in this chamber, and to this very day I get calls in my office in Hamilton complaining about the debacle of the 407. This government, this Liberal government, is about to head down that road—excuse the pun—again with this very budget.", "Dalton McGuinty got that very same urge, that very same Liberal urge to burn the furniture to heat the house. He proposed a super corporation—do you remember that? Do you remember the super corporation that they proposed, him and Dwight Duncan?—that could be sold in bits and pieces to the highest bidder. So throw everything into the pile and then sell it off in bits and pieces, almost like an auction. Well, the problem is, of course, that once you sell everything off, it’s no longer providing the benefit to the people of Ontario. But that’s what they thought they could do: Sell it off to the highest bidder, piece by piece, and literally tear apart the fundamental fiscal foundations of this province in terms of revenue generation.", "He wanted to raid the best public assets that we own together—the assets that we own together—the assets that all of Ontario owns, that the people of this province own collectively. He wanted to take those assets, raid them and sell them off, auction them off to the highest bidder. And lo and behold, he’s back in town and he thinks things are looking pretty darn good these days. But New Democrats didn’t let Dalton McGuinty get away with that fire sale of assets and we are not going to let this Premier get away with her own plan to sell assets out from underneath Ontarians. It is the wrong direction for this province and will not happen under our watch.", "Now, we know this is her plan, regardless of what she calls it. The fine print in the budget tells us very clearly that this fire sale of public assets is one of the cornerstones of the Premier’s plan. We’ve asked her day in and day out in question period. We’ve asked her over and over again to be frank about that. We’ve asked her to tell us how much the Liberals have already cashed in and slotted into the fiscal framework for these assets, because their own platform showed that this government is planning to raise money from asset sales—more money from asset sales than Mike Harris was able to earn with the sell-off of the 407. It was a bad plan then, Speaker. It was a very, very bad plan, and it is a bad plan now. Whether it’s a Conservative plan or whether it’s a red-washed Liberal plan, it is still a bad plan to sell off Ontario assets, and New Democrats are opposed to that 100%.", "But we’re going to keep asking the Premier, regardless of her refusal to answer, about this issue, because it’s one more hidden cost in their budget that the government refuses to talk about, because they know that it’s not progressive. The real underlying pieces that make up this budget are anything but progressive, because a fire sale of public assets does not serve Ontarians. And it’s not the only hidden cost in this particular budget.", "The Premier likes to talk about front-line services. She likes to talk about them a lot. But while she’s talking about them over here, she’s doing the old bait and switch. She’s talking about those great public services over here, but her budget is preparing for the biggest public services cuts since Mike Harris. That is a fact, Speaker. That’s the old bait and switch, that’s the old Trojan Horse. “We’ll talk a good game over here, and while you’re not looking, we’re going to cut all kinds of services out from your communities and the ability of Ontarians to get the public services that they need.”", "According to Bloomberg News, this budget foretells “the deepest freeze in two decades”—the deepest freeze in two decades. According to Bloomberg, “the Liberal government would drop spending by the most per person since former Premier Mike Harris won election on deficit elimination in 1995.” Now, that’s interesting—would drop spending by the most per person since Mike Harris.", "This government talks a lot about how much on the cheap they’re already doing things. Isn’t it this government that always talks about the fact that they have the lowest per capita program spending in the world? They talk about that all the time. A government that brags so much about already having the lowest per capita program spending in Canada is now talking about making it even worse. This budget is going to be like limbo—how low can you go when it comes to program funding for the people of Ontario? I don’t think Ontarians voted for an austerity plan, but they sure as heck got one with this Trojan Horse budget—cuts that will rival Mike Harris’s cuts. Behind the spin, that’s exactly what this budget has in store for Ontarians. And I have to say it again: That is not progressive, Speaker. That is nowhere near progressive, but that is exactly what is below the surface in this particular plan. Even though Ontarians voted against one plan to cut 100,000 educational assistants and teachers and firefighters and personal support workers and others who serve in this province, throughout all the communities; even though Ontarians said no to 100,000 jobs being cut; even though Ontarians said no to austerity, this Liberal plan has exactly that in it.", "According to the Liberals’ own hand-picked economist, Don Drummond—the very same Don Drummond who was tasked to independently verify this budget’s revenue assumptions—the Liberals will likely slash the very same jobs that the PCs planned to cut. That’s what Don Drummond said. He’s the guy who verified independently the numbers in this budget, and in the process of that verification, he let it slip that, “Oh, by the by, I wouldn’t be surprised if a couple of years down the road, we see 100,000 fewer public servants’ jobs in the province of Ontario.”", "It seems to me that that’s exactly what the people of this province rejected, but that’s what’s inside this Trojan Horse budget. You don’t have to take it from me; you can take it from the Liberals’ own buddy, Don Drummond, their favourite economist whom they like to task with all these little jobs. Now, they’ve actually shown themselves for who they are, which is quite interesting. By 2017, Don Drummond wouldn’t be surprised, as I said, if over 100,000 front-line public service workers in ServiceOntario, in our schools and in our hospitals are gone.", "Yesterday, the finance minister said, “We will continue to cut where we can.” When he was asked over and over and over by the media how many job cuts were coming, he wouldn’t answer the question. He refused to be up front with the people of this province. But cutting the public service is no way forward for Ontario. It is not how we build this province up; it’s in fact how we tear it down, which is why Ontarians voted against that and why New Democrats are opposed to this budget, which is not progressive.", "It’s about time this government actually came up with a real jobs plan for the people of Ontario. It’s shocking that this budget does nothing different when it comes to a jobs plan. It’s not in this budget at all. There is no plan whatsoever for a jobs strategy. You can’t build this province up if people don’t have a job to put a roof over their head. It doesn’t make any sense. There is no jobs plan whatsoever in this budget. You can look and look, but all you’ll see are more corporate giveaways and the handouts that the Liberals love to give to their friends, even though they should have learned their lessons by now. No-strings-attached corporate giveaways simply do not work. They haven’t worked up until now, and they’re not going to work in the time frames of this budget that is before us.", "Last month, 34,000 people in Ontario lost a job. We’ve lost 300,000 good-paying manufacturing jobs in this province, Speaker. Employment in our manufacturing sector hit its lowest point since 1976. I was shocked that the Premier joked about that the other day in question period. But what does that mean in real terms? That means that we had the worst performance for manufacturing in nearly 40 years in this province because the Liberals, over the last decade, have done nothing to maintain our manufacturing jobs, to keep them here or, in fact, to attract more manufacturing to Ontario.", "They like to say fancy words about advanced manufacturing, but we know that 300,000 manufacturing jobs are gone. They are gone, and that includes the couple of thousand advanced manufacturing jobs that we may have actually gotten. The fact of the matter is, Speaker, they don’t have a plan, and it’s by sheer luck that we have any investment whatsoever that comes into this province.", "When I pointed it out to the Premier, that crisis in manufacturing and that it’s at the lowest point since 1976, here’s what she had to say. She actually had the audacity to say, “Believe it or not, a lot has changed in Ontario since 1976.” What’s that supposed to mean? Do you know what has changed since 1976? In 1976, my father had a manufacturing job. We had a great living. We had a roof over our head. We had a good standard of living. We could go on vacation with our family from time to time. We had to count our pennies, yes, but we had a decent quality of life.", "Go to Windsor, Speaker. Go to southwestern Ontario. Go hang out in London for a while. Take a little bit of time in Chatham-Kent. Go down to Sarnia. Go to some northern communities and some eastern Ontario communities. Ask them. Ask them whether they have good-paying jobs. I was shocked during the election campaign, when I was in Peterborough, to find out that their unemployment rate was sitting at 14%—14%, Speaker. I nearly fell off the bus—unbelievable. The government is proud of that record? They think that’s a way to build Ontario up, by allowing the good jobs to leave and having no plan to bring new, good jobs to this province? That doesn’t build Ontario up, Speaker; that actually makes people very, very worried about the future. That’s what I heard when I was talking to families across this province.", "But in this budget, the government does nothing to change their ways. They’ve done nothing at all except to show their arrogance, frankly, with those kinds of comments that the Premier made when I brought her attention to this issue recently. For sure, I believe that good jobs don’t have to be a relic of the 1970s. Liberals might think good jobs have to be a relic of the 1970s. They have certainly done nothing to ensure they are not a relic from the 1970s.", "As much as ever, all Ontarians deserve and expect the dignity of putting in a hard day’s work in exchange for a decent living. That’s what Ontarians deserve, that’s what they expect, and that’s what we should be trying to deliver for them. All Ontarians deserve and expect to be able to work hard, to pay the bills, to help their kids and to get ahead. That is not too much for people to expect in a province like Ontario. It’s not too much to ask of the government, and it’s not something that a Premier, frankly, should be mocking, Speaker.", "Today, there are 300,000 fewer manufacturing jobs than there were in 2003, when the Liberals first came to office. That’s their track record in 11 years: 300,000 fewer manufacturing jobs. The sector has shrunk by over 30%. In communities across Ontario, the unemployment rate remains stubbornly high. In Peterborough, Niagara, Windsor and across northern Ontario, unemployment is stuck at or near double digits, depending on which community you’re in. Hundreds of thousands of families have lost good-paying jobs, and they can’t find any work. They can’t find any job, any single job, that will allow them to support their kids and pay the bills and start rebuilding their lives after the downturn.", "That’s not the whole story, Speaker. Young people are a whole other story. They are a whole other story, and they’re having a pretty darn rough time, too. It’s harder and harder to get into a new career or to get that first lucky break and start climbing the ladder. But somehow, some way, this government seems to think that the status quo is just good enough for the people of Ontario.", "The government’s job record is nothing to be proud of at all, Speaker. In fact, it’s a record that tells you that something needs to give, that something needs to change, that something needs to be done differently. It’s a record that tells us very clearly that the Liberals’ policy of corporate giveaways that they have had in place for years now has simply not done the trick. This is what the Liberal policies of no-strings-attached corporate giveaways have left us with: an Ontario where people are more likely to be out of work. But does this budget contain in it a real jobs plan? Does it contain in it a different direction, a way to actually say to the people of Ontario, “We have found a way forward that will help us to get good jobs back in this province”? Nope. No plan to create new jobs; no plan to turn the ship around; no plan to do things differently; just the same old, same old—corporate handouts, giveaways to their friends.", "A real jobs plan would start by recognizing that the handouts have not worked, and they’re not even prepared to do that. They’re stubbornly sticking behind a plan that has devastated Ontario, that has failed Ontario, year over year over year. A real plan would turn the page on corporate giveaways and corporate tax cuts that were never fair and that haven’t worked. That’s the big theory, right? You just keep cutting corporate taxes, and the jobs are going to come. We’ve seen that that doesn’t work, Speaker. We’ve seen time and time again that that doesn’t work. Yet the Liberals—I don’t even think that’s progressive? Do you guys think that’s progressive?" ],

In fact, he wanted a four-year sunset rule on all future business support programs to ensure that they demonstrate their worth, not a new 10-year fund to do the exact same thing that hasn’t worked for the last 10 years.", "So, he, Don Drummond, finds it “ironic” that this government is adding another new plan to a “hodgepodge”—his words, not mine—of business supports that he didn’t find to be working well at all in the first place. At the very moment when families and communities need targeted job creation, this government is offering more of the same and somehow hoping for a different result. We all know what that means, Speaker.

Now here we are in 2014, and we still have an unemployment rate above the national average here in the province of Ontario, and it is because of the shameful unwillingness of this Liberal government to do anything different on the jobs file and simply allow Ontarians to continue to be underemployed and unemployed and unable to make ends meet. New Democrats oppose a budget that does nothing to create jobs and opportunity for the people of Ontario.", "Another hidden cost in this government’s budget is health care austerity. The last time I checked—and I seem to get this feedback pretty much every day when I talk to people about the election that took place about a month ago—people didn’t vote for austerity. In fact, people voted against austerity. But this government has frozen hospital operating budgets for three years in a row now.", "Every day our team comes into question period, and every day there’s a bit of a competition about what questions are going to be asked of the government, because people want to get their questions in. They want to speak to the issues in their communities. They want to speak to the issues in their critic portfolios. They want to let Ontarians know about the good work that they’re doing on their behalf here in the Legislature. I can’t tell you that a day has gone by where someone in our caucus is not making a pitch for a question about health care cuts, particularly the mess in our hospital system. Pretty much every day something comes up where there’s a real concern, a real problem, with our hospital system being identified by our MPPs here.", "If our MPPs here are getting that from their communities, then I’ve got to tell you, the other MPPs across this province must be getting the same kind of feedback. What does that feedback look like? Ambulances lined up a dozen deep that can’t offload the patients because the ERs are full and people who can’t get through the hospital because there are no beds available because, on the other end, there are people who probably should be in long-term care or at home with home care supports. But those things aren’t in place either, so the hospital becomes unable to meet the needs of the patients coming in.", "How long have we heard that story? Man, we’ve heard that story year after year after year after year, and the Liberals still haven’t fixed it. But instead of dealing with it, we’re seeing the same kind of situation in this budget. The Liberals are going to keep an austerity plan in place for the hospitals. So what are the hospitals doing? We see beds closing. We see them try to get patients out sooner than they need to. I don’t know how many communities I’ve been in where people tell me about the revolving-door syndrome, where a patient has had surgery, or they’ve been in the hospital for something quite serious, the hospital needs that bed, and so they get that patient out. The supports are not properly arranged or don’t exist in the community, and within a couple of weeks, that patient is back in the hospital sicker than they were when they left the week or two before. That’s no way to run a health care system in the province of Ontario.", "They lay off nurses. They give new nurses a six-month contract and then, guess what? We train the nurses, and they’re heading to other provinces and other countries to provide their good nursing skills to people elsewhere because they can’t get a decent full-time job here in the province of Ontario. That’s the health care system that the Liberals have given us. They’re saying, “We’re going to do more of the same.”", "When we say, “Get the home care system up and running; get it fixed so that we can actually have a decent home care system for people,” they throw a whole bunch of money in the home care system, and it goes—guess where?—to the administrators. It goes to the executive directors of the CCACs.", "How does that make sense? When you put money in a system, it should go to front-line services. It shouldn’t necessarily go to the salaries and bonuses of the top administrators. How is that going to help the person who is waiting for home care, who has been on the waiting list for three or four months? It’s not. That’s the answer: It’s not going to help them. But that’s the Liberal way. That’s how they prioritize the squeezed money in the health care system.", "Three years of flatlined spending has meant cuts to nurses, higher user fees—oh, there you go. That’s another one, another big one. As hospitals are trying to figure out how the heck they’re going to make their budget, they’re doing all kinds of things. I talked about closing beds and laying off nurses and laying off all kinds of other folks. They’re also jacking up parking fees so that patients or visitors of patients in the hospital are actually being gouged when they park their cars so that the hospitals can make their budget bottom lines. It’s ridiculous, Speaker. It’s kind of like health fees through the back door. Right? It’s health fees through the back door. We’re charging people for health care, but instead of actually paying it directly to the hospital, you pay it to the parking meter outside the hospital; that’s your health care fee. That’s what we have here in the province of Ontario: more fees to park your car, fewer and fewer services that are actually being provided in public hospitals, and more and more moving out to private clinics—many of those private, for-profit clinics. Speaker, that’s not progressive and it’s not something that New Democrats can support.", "That’s another one of the reasons why we do not support this budget. New Democrats stand up for health care. We stand up for a health care system that actually meets the needs of the people of this province. Whether it’s home care, whether it’s emergency room wait times, whether it’s proper access to mental health supports, you can’t provide better access to services by starving the system and carving out a bigger chunk of that system to private clinics, which is exactly the wrong-headed direction that the Liberals are taking the province of Ontario in. New Democrats will not support a budget that erodes our public health care system, and we will not support a plan that does not address cuts to child care spaces in communities across the province.", "New Democrats fought to increase child care spending because we know how hard parents have to struggle to find a safe place for their kids. I don’t want to list off the tragedies we’ve seen in this province where people didn’t have safe child care for their kids. We know what that looked like, and we sat here in this place horrified by the examples of what happens when a government does not ensure that there is adequate, affordable, licensed child care in this province. And yet this government has gone backwards on that file. They have made it even harder for families to get that kind of child care.", "It does nothing to stop the cuts in those 18 communities that I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks—18 communities that are losing their child care centres. Where are those hundreds of families going to go? What kinds of solutions are they going to have to turn to when their child care centres are closed? How many more of those tragedies are we going to have to learn about in this House because the government does not support child care in the province of Ontario? That’s a question that I have, Speaker.", "This is an austerity budget. Beneath the surface and the spin, it is not progressive—it is not progressive at all. It is an austerity budget, through and through and through. But beyond all of these regressive plans that New Democrats oppose, beyond the fire-sale of public assets and beyond the worst cuts to public services that we’ve seen since Mike Harris, this is a budget that fundamentally fails to address the real needs of families in this province. It’s a budget that fails to put families first—because you can’t address the challenges facing our province by ignoring the realities that our families face day in and day out.", "It’s not just the hidden costs that we oppose in this budget; we also oppose the government’s failure to act on the issues that matter the most. Every month, folks are seeing their costs go higher and higher. Every month, when their auto insurance bill arrives and when they open their hydro bill, families are floored by how fast costs are going up. Across this province, people are finding it hard to keep up, never mind get ahead. The bills pile up, and lots of families breathe a deep sigh of relief if they manage to even balance the books at the end of one more month. It’s a real struggle for folks out there, and too many families just cannot make ends meet anymore.", "At a time when too many older workers are losing their jobs, when younger workers are finding it harder than ever to enter the workforce, and when costs are climbing up and up and up, a government has to take those families seriously. Even while life is getting more expensive for people, the government is making perks on Bay Street more affordable. People are being told, “We’ve got nothing in the cupboard for you. The cupboard is bare. Your costs are going to go up. You’re going to pay more in auto insurance. You’re going to pay more in electricity costs. Your bills are going to continue to skyrocket. We have other priorities, and those priorities are making sure that new tax loopholes for CEOs and big corporations on Bay Street”—well, they’re going to get what they want. They’re going to get what they need, Speaker, because of course they’re more important than everyday families.", "Lots of families wish they could afford to take their kids to a hockey game or a baseball game, but for some reason, the Premier thinks that the priority should be letting CEOs and wealthy corporations write off the HST when they go to a corporate box. Gee, I don’t think that’s fair, Speaker.", "It’s our job to actually listen and respond to the real needs of Ontarians, and what Ontarians are telling us is that their concerns should be addressed. Their concerns should be at the top of the list. That’s why New Democrats stand up for families who are being squeezed out of the middle class, and that’s why we cannot support a budget that does not tackle the very high cost and rising cost of everyday life. It does not take strong steps to get hydro bills and auto insurance rates under control, and it leaves families on their own, literally treading water, month in and month out. It leaves hydro bills going up, killing jobs and hitting families very, very hard. Hydro rates have climbed 300% in this province since 2003 when this government first came to office, and they’re set to rise another 42% within the next five years. But the government takes a back seat, content to leave families struggling.", "No matter how often the Liberals insist that this is a progressive plan, no matter how red in the face they get trying to spin their story, anyone can see right through this budget. And if you aren’t listening to families and you’re not addressing the actual challenges they’re facing, then you aren’t nearly as progressive as you insist you are.", "I have to say that putting a priority on opening new corporate tax loopholes when it comes to the HST that help these big corporations on Bay Street write off things like box seats at sports games, chauffeured limos and those kinds of things, losing close to $1 billion in revenue annualized, just for that—I’ve got to tell you, that close to $1 billion in revenue annualized would provide a hell of a lot of health care in this province and it would certainly save those 18 child care centres from closing in Ontario. I think a progressive person would actually spend the money on the child care and make sure families have safe, decent, affordable child care for their kids, rather than give another CEO another opportunity to write off his HST or her HST on their corporate box seats in a stadium or at a sports field. That’s what New Democrats believe.", "But let’s talk about transit for a minute if we want to talk about progressive versus not progressive. Congestion is costing families and businesses more than $6 billion a year here in the GTA. We hear this all the time. Businesses are racking up extra costs, and families are losing precious time together because mom or dad is stuck on the road. Transit improvements are needed and they’re needed now, and I think everybody agrees.", "The planners, in fact, at Metrolinx and at the TTC and at the city of Toronto and in the government’s own Transit Investment Strategy Advisory Panel have set out what the priorities should be for that transit investment. Beyond the quick wins and the immediate improvements that are needed, it’s time to prioritize the downtown relief line here in Toronto." ],

All of these things will create jobs throughout the numerous regions of Ontario, which is what we need to see.", "Every time I’m in the Niagara region, it’s depressing, frankly, to see the amount of job loss that those communities have suffered. They are resilient, wonderful people in the Golden Horseshoe. I come from Hamilton; it’s technically part of the Golden Horseshoe. I know that families in Niagara Falls, in Welland, in Thorold, in Fort Erie, in Niagara-on-the-Lake and in St. Catharines—people in those communities have suffered a great deal from job loss. For some reason, the Liberals aren’t listening to them when it comes to the importance of having year-round GO service to their communities.", "I know that the minister of—" ],

It’s something I just can’t fathom. How is it that, in this day and age, in 2014, the Liberals are building a dirty diesel train to take people from the airport to downtown? It’s a disgrace. It’s an embarrassment. They should be ashamed. Guess what? Dirty diesel is not progressive. New Democrats don’t support this budget. We don’t support dirty diesel trains. We think it’s shameful that Liberals think that it’s okay to pollute the neighbourhoods along the route of the air-rail link with disgusting diesel fumes. It’s shameful, Speaker. We need real timelines and real deadlines for the electrification of that line to make sure that that diesel does not poison the families and the children in those neighbourhoods.", "We need accountability, first and foremost, for the dollars spent. But instead what do we see in this budget? It doesn’t set out any of these transit priorities. Yes, it makes a new pool of cash by taking gas tax money from health and education and adding over $3.15 billion from the fire sale of public assets, but it doesn’t make any commitment whatsoever to fund or deliver a downtown relief line. All it says about Scarborough transit, Speaker, is that an environmental assessment will begin soon. All it says about regional express rail is that the idea will be studied. It says nothing about the Premier’s promise to deliver bullet trains within 10 years not only to Kitchener-Waterloo, not only to London but apparently all the way to Windsor, which we think Windsor deserves. But I think it’s a bit of an interesting target that they’ve set up. Not one word and not one dollar to back up all of that chatter about the bullet train. That’s another example of a promise that is not backed up by this budget, a budget that is filled with hidden costs, hidden cuts; in fact, a Trojan Horse budget, Speaker.", "I’m going to wrap up my remarks here, Speaker. A Trojan Horse budget is not what this province needs. It is not going to create the new jobs that our province needs. It is not going to help families get costs under control. It is not going to restore fairness to our corporate tax system, but it is going to do tremendous damage by selling off public assets, by cutting services and by slashing jobs. That’s the really story behind this budget. This is a plan that leaves Bay Street better off but leaves folks on Main Street out of work and out of pocket.", "Beneath the surface of spin, this is not a progressive plan at all. In fact, it is another Liberal budget that promises the world but delivers something very different. The Liberals have chosen it as their Trojan Horse plan, but New Democrats will not support it, and each and every day we will do our job, the job that Ontarians sent us here to do. New Democrats will stand up and hold this government to account for the costs and the cuts that are hidden inside this Trojan budget plan." ],

By bringing together young people with small businesses in my community just last fall, 20 young people found jobs connecting them to the youth employment fund.", "Mr. Speaker, our investments in schools, hospitals, transportation and infrastructure have made Ontario a great place to work and to live, but we have to move forward in Ontario to reduce congestion, to invest in roads, in bridges and in transit, to invest in all parts of this province—in our northern communities, in our rural communities as well as in our growing cities.

Several studies have shown that, unless action is taken, many of today’s workers may not be saving enough to maintain their current lifestyle in retirement. This is a problem that will grow worse over time as our population continues to age. This is why we plan to introduce the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan to build on the strengths of the CPP. We will combine the CPP payments with the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan so that people will have a more secure and comfortable retirement in Ontario.", "The ORPP would provide a predictable stream of income indexed to inflation and paid for a lifetime in retirement, providing comfort and security when people need it the most. It would be mandatory for the more than three million Ontarians without a comparable workplace pension plan, and it would be required to be fair and equal in terms of its contributions from both employers as well as employees, to a maximum of 1.9% each.

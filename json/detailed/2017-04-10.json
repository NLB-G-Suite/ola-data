We think, rather than an arbitrary minimum number of hours or staffing, which in fact was investigated by Shirlee Sharkey several years ago—and she did not advocate for that approach—she felt, and others have felt to this day, that it’s most appropriate to recognize that long-term-care homes in one part of the province may have a completely different population than in another part of the province. Some arbitrary staffing number is not nearly as helpful or important as ensuring the development—which they’re required to do by law—and the implementation of a human resources plan that reflects the needs of those patients who reside in that residence." ],

It lists Noelville, which is 30 kilometres away, and Sturgeon Falls, which is even further. To motorists, it looks like you have to drive at least 30 kilometres before you can buy food or gas. That’s not the case.", "RDH Mining, which is an international mining equipment manufacturer, wrote me to say, “It was hard enough to get customers to find our location as it was. Now, with this omission from the new sign to our community, it will be an even greater challenge.”", "Right now, many businesses, from mining to forestry to restaurants, grocery stores and lodging, are all losing business in Alban because of the made-in-Toronto sign policy that makes no sense.", "This needs to change, Speaker.

  "text" : [ "It’s my pleasure again to rise to speak to Bill 114, An Act to provide for Anti-Racism Measures.", "Before I begin my remarks on behalf of the Progressive Conservative caucus and my leader, Patrick Brown, if I may, I assure the members of the Coptic community here in Ontario that our hearts are with them at this time, and so are our thoughts. In particular, I would like to reach out to my own Coptic Christian community in Nepean, at St. Mary Coptic church, which is just around the corner from my home. Yesterday, as you’re aware, there was a terrorist attack in Egypt that affected these Christians who were praying. It gives me great pain to know that those who go into a place of worship may never come out. You’ll recall this happened in Quebec not too long ago. I just wanted to put that out on behalf of our caucus and, I’m sure, all members of this assembly.", "It gives me great pleasure once again to speak on behalf of Patrick Brown and the Ontario PC caucus regarding anti-racism, anti-Semitism, anti-Muslim bigotry and, of course, the systemic discrimination of Ontario’s indigenous population. As I’ve stated many times in this assembly, hate is hate. All kinds of hate need to be condemned, whether it is vandalism, violence or even the subtle digs and/or strange looks those who are racialized experience.", "I can tell you, I’ve seen at recent events that hate in all of its forms exists. We’ve seen it on university campuses. We saw it in swastikas that were spray-painted in Hamilton just weeks ago. We saw it in my own city of Ottawa when all forms of religions were vandalized at their places of worship. That type of fear that people would place on others who are just simply trying to go about their way of life is very troubling to me, Speaker, and I think that’s why it’s very important that we have conversations.", "As you know, when we spoke to anti-Muslim bigotry in the Legislature just a few months ago, I talked about the fact that when it comes to race, religion, sexual orientation or creed, whenever we talk about hate because people are afraid, we have to take it right down. We have to talk about what we agree with each other on and what our similarities are, and we have to build from there.", "I know in this Legislature today—we all go into our communities and we talk to people. We talk to people who are different from us. At the end of the day, we all realize that they are always struggling with something. We all do, whether that’s paying your bills—your heat, your hydro; whether your child has mental illness or addiction issues; whether you have a frail parent who needs care at a long-term-care facility. If we can’t have that conversation, recognizing that the person we’re communicating with, the person we see who may be different from us, actually has the same struggles, then we’re not doing it right. So I think it’s important that we have this conversation in this assembly about making sure that we erase those systemic barriers for people who are just like us but who may look different, may pray differently or may love differently than we do.", "I know that many in this assembly will recognize that all members of this assembly have had a long record in defending human rights and standing up against racism, bigotry and hatred. I would like to point out that my Progressive Conservative caucus also has a strong and proud legacy when it comes to that. We in the Progressive Conservative caucus support measures that advance racial equality. As a Legislature, we have frequently condemned hate activity against Ontarians, sometimes generally, other times more specifically, through nonbinding motions or through private members’ legislation. Today, we have Bill 114, An Act to provide for Anti-Racism Measures, which talks about all races and all religions in the province of Ontario. The PC caucus has in fact been a leader in defending citizens who have been targeted from bigotry, harassment and hate. It is our duty as legislators to lead our communities through debates of humanity, inclusion and tolerance.", "Speaker, just last month, on March 20, I held a day of humanity, inclusion and acceptance in my constituency, at the Ottawa Torah Centre. That synagogue is brand new, recently built, and has a wonderful rabbi named Rabbi Blum. He is a true community leader and a true Canadian. He espouses such a kind way of dealing with the community. I want to talk a little bit about it in the context of making sure that, as we grow—and I’ll talk about statistics in a little bit, but as we grow in Ottawa as a city and in this province, as we welcome people from all around the world, it’s important that we have that debate. I want to tell you a little bit about this day, Speaker. I know I spoke about it earlier on when I was able to have an opportunity on this bill, but it started in the morning, when Rabbi Blum and his dear friend Dr. Aisha Sherazi, who is a hijab-wearing woman, came in. They ran a workshop for all of us to get to know one another for what’s inside us rather than what we appear to be. The workshop was quite fascinating. In fact, it was very popular, so much so that my local imam said to the rabbi—Imam Delic said to Rabbi Blum: “I need you to come to my mosque to put this on.”", "The day only got better from there. We heard from Ottawa immigration support. They came in and did a presentation. I’ll use some of their statistics in a little bit. Then we had Imam Delic at the pulpit of the synagogue giving a talk about what it means to be a Canadian. After that, we had Brian Lee Crowley from the Macdonald-Laurier Institute come in and talk about what makes Canada great.", "We actually forgot what other people looked like and how they prayed and started thinking about each other as Canadians. We became more patriotic about what a great nation we are. We had a wonderful elder, Annie from the Algonquins. She gave us a wonderful blessing. We got to talk to her, and it was incredible.", "What really was incredible for me was the afternoon, when we met survivors of genocide, survivors who fled their country to come to Canada. We had a wonderful little old lady. She is a Holocaust survivor, but she has been an advocate. She spoke to us about fleeing Germany—sorry; I believe she was Austrian. We had a Rwandan genocide survivor who told us that she was shot in the head and in the leg. Her parents were murdered. She had seven or eight brothers and sisters, all of whom died except for one baby girl. She had been sent to Canada, but she wanted desperately to go back to find her family. So she went back to Rwanda and built a park with some of the people who had also survived the genocide. She said that it was only then, after she found her one remaining sister and she had built this park with others, that she truly felt that she could come back to Canada and start her life over. I can tell you, Speaker, that that was one of the most impactful things.", "We also had a man from the Yazidi genocide. As we’re all aware, the Yazidis right now are suffering a terrible genocide in Syria, a world away. Sometimes we dim it on our television sets, but at the end of the day, we must never forget that these atrocities are happening. It is genocide. Then we had someone from the Armenian genocide. Rabbi Bulka, my dear friend, was the moderator of that.", "By the end of that, we were spent, as you can imagine, from hearing from people who had suffered through atrocities. You may ask, “What does this have to do with here, in this Legislature? What does that have to do with this piece of legislation?” It has everything to do with this piece of legislation. It has everything to do with this debate that we are having on making sure that there is racial equality in this province. That is what’s very important.", "As I said at the beginning, it’s our duty to lead our communities through debates of humanity, inclusion and acceptance. I can say that I was very pleased to support, on many occasions, members of my own caucus as they put forward legislation over the years to ensure that that happens.", "For example, my close friend and colleague MPP Gila Martow succeeded in the Legislature having rejected the BDS movement in an important gesture to Ottawa’s vibrant Jewish community.", "I’m very close with the Jewish community. Of any group in Ontario—and I will get to these statistics later—they are the most likely to experience hate. The Toronto police suggest, as well as Statistics Canada—the numbers do not lie—that our Jewish population in the province of Ontario experiences more hate and has recorded more hate than any other group in the province of Ontario.", "Gila Martow’s motion, which I was proud to speak to, was an important gesture to our Jewish community, to reject that BDS movement. It was anti-Semitism at the root of this movement, and for us to condemn it was the right thing. As a Legislature, we did the right thing, the moral thing.", "I always tell this story. For anybody who has ever travelled to Israel—I have, and it was one of the most amazing experiences of my life, spiritually, and obviously to learn about world affairs. There was fighting in Syria at that time, in 2014, and some of the shelling, actually, across the border into Israel. When we were at the Golan Heights, we did see that activity. I heard the guns all night, and I woke up to the little birds.", "But that’s not what I want to talk to you about; it’s about Yad Vashem. If you ever have the opportunity to go to Israel, go to Yad Vashem. It’s the international Holocaust memorial. One thing that stuck with me when I walked through there—talk about emotionally draining. When you get toward the end, there is a glass floor, and when you look down, there are these little black slippers, like ballet slippers. There are thousands of them under this floor. You realize at that moment—you don’t need a tour guide to tell you—when you are walking on that glass floor, that the shoes that are under there are from people who perished in the Holocaust. You don’t quite ever get over a visit to Yad Vashem. I think it’s important to do that.", "That motion that was brought forward by my colleague Gila Martow was so important. It spoke to the world atrocities that have been experienced, but it also spoke to the reality of anti-Semitism in the province of Ontario and how we must move beyond that.", "My colleague MPP Todd Smith also crafted Ontario’s law for Tamil Heritage Month. And last week he spoke to a motion by Harinder Malhi from Brampton–Springdale with respect to hate and violence against Sikhs. My colleague Todd Smith has travelled the province, working with the Indo-Canadian community, and I’m quite proud of that. He knows that the face of Ontario is changing.", "When I came here 18 years ago, Speaker, it was mostly people coming from different parts of Canada to find a job—which is why I am here. I wanted to work on Parliament Hill, and that’s why I moved to Ottawa. Eventually, I got elected, and I’ve now been here for four terms. Most people come here for that reason. But in the last decade or two, that has really shifted.", "The changing face of Ontario is—the fact that we do have people coming from around the world, different cultures, different ethnicities. In the city of Ottawa alone—and I’ll talk about this later—we have 70 different ethnicities and over 100 languages that are spoken. That’s incredibly important.", "I want to congratulate my colleague Todd Smith for making sure that he is reaching out to those communities and engaging them. He has done a wonderful job. I’d also be remiss not to acknowledge the great work of my leader, Patrick Brown, in doing the same and making sure that we are changing the face of our own particular political party. I think that’s incredibly important.", "One of my close friends in this assembly is MPP Ted Arnott. In fact, he’s one of the longer-serving members of this House. Ted has been a wonderful mentor to me over the past 11 years, and I really value his friendship. It’s Ted Arnott who was responsible for the Emancipation Day Act, recognizing Ontario’s role in helping the enslaved and the oppressed. And he was really instrumental in Lincoln Alexander Day. He has preserved the late, great Lincoln Alexander’s memory not only here in this House, but throughout the rest of the province of Ontario.", "In fact, we recently had black heritage month, as the minister had mentioned in his remarks to this assembly. I had expected, as the anti-racism critic, that I would be able to give that speech, but no; Ted’s deep and abiding relationship with Ontario’s black community supersedes that. It was my pleasure to cede the floor to him for him to be able to speak to it, because that is a great passion for him. Again, I want to congratulate my good friend and colleague MPP Ted Arnott.", "Finally, I just wanted to acknowledge my former Progressive Conservative leader, Tim Hudak, and my former colleague MPP Peter Shurman, who were both very passionate about defending the State of Israel. Tim had a similar motion on anti-BDS before he left this assembly, and spoke, too, quite openly and candidly and passionately—but also Mr. Shurman, who was successful in having the Legislature condemn Israel Apartheid Week. I remember speaking about this when I was first elected—the hate directed toward Israel and the hate directed toward the Jews of this province. Again, I cannot state enough that the most targeted group according to Toronto police as well as according to Statistics Canada is our Jewish population. Therefore, it is my opinion that we must continue to stand up for them very vocally and very proudly.", "Other members of the Progressive Conservative caucus have been instrumental in legislation aimed at Ontario’s diversity and ending race-based hate. It is our firm belief that all Ontarians should feel safe and secure in their province, regardless of their religion, race, language, sexual orientation or gender. We will look forward to debating this bill, but also consulting with the race-based communities.", "We expect that the government will hold substantial public hearings into this legislation because I think it’s important that all of those voices are heard before this becomes law, and that they have their say. It’s one thing to do it in public consultations in communities—and I applaud the minister for coming to the city of Ottawa—but I think it’s also important that sometimes these conversations get put on the public record. I’m very big on making sure that that’s in Hansard to live on so that we remember what has been said and we remember why we are doing it. My appeal to the minister, obviously, is to perhaps let this bill travel a bit. I would welcome him to the city of Ottawa, but also to ensure that there is ample time to give to these communities—who have, for so long, been voiceless—a very prominent voice in the province of Ontario by coming to this assembly and making sure it truly is a people’s place.", "I told you, Speaker, that I wanted to talk a little bit about the statistics—about the changing face of Ontario and why it’s important for us to start this conversation of deeper understanding at this time. The Ottawa Local Immigration Partnership—which I always get wrong, but its acronym is OLIP, which is just something we’re very used to here. We had a wonderful presentation, and we were provided with a wonderful road map of where the city of Ottawa, where I live, is going in terms of our diversity.", "Some of the statistics are important because when we have this debate on acceptance, anti-racism and—I don’t want to use the word “tolerance.” I really don’t like that—because I could tolerate you, but I’d rather accept you. I think I’d like to have that changed in our language.", "I think she provided us with some interesting statistics. One of the statistics, according to Statistics Canada, is that immigrants and second-generation individuals will represent nearly one in two people, or almost 50% of the population in Ontario. Think about that. In the near future, 50% of our population will either be first or second generation, meaning they’ve come from somewhere else, and possibly they may be racialized. It’s more than likely they will be racialized. And that’s just in Canada. Sorry; I thought that was in Ontario.", "In Ontario today, that number is higher. We’re actually 60% either first generation or second generation. That’s quite remarkable when you think about it. People want to make this land their home, and they want to because of the same values, I’m sure, that brought me to this province when I graduated from university.", "You know you’re going to get good public services. I’ll criticize the government from time to time, but I will, broadly speaking, say that in the province of Ontario that I came to, I had good hospitals and good schools and I knew you could get a job. Those might be a little bit debatable these days, but at the end of the day, our values are the values that have beckoned people from around the world and across Canada to come here to start their career, start their family, buy a home and possibly buy an automobile if they live in the suburbs, or even downtown Toronto. They believed, as I did, that you could retire here comfortably.", "Now, again, I can debate other matters that would be off-topic, about some of the criticisms I have in terms of the direction we have politically, but the reality is that at the end of the day, when we step out of this building, we are all Ontarians. We can be Caucasian, we can be black, we can be indigenous, we can be South Asian, but at the end of the day we all walk out of here as, simply put, Ontarians. That’s what I think is really important about this legislation.", "And it’s very important that we always keep up with the statistics that we are given by Statistics Canada. In the same report, some 26% to 30% of the population will have neither English nor French as a mother tongue.", "Last week I talked about how my favourite Prime Minister is our founder, Speaker; 150 years ago he had this dream and he had this vision, and we are now today 150 years strong as a country. Yesterday, we commemorated the Battle of Vimy Ridge. We were a very different country at the Battle of Vimy Ridge. We only had eight million people living in this country at that particular point in time, but my God, we outranked ourselves in terms of heroes. I want to just quickly acknowledge those heroes at Vimy Ridge who we commemorated yesterday.", "I think that’s important, but I want to go back to 150 years ago, because Sir John A. Macdonald, a proud Scot, just like me, who came and made Ontario his home, said this, and it’s my favourite quote: “Let us be English or let us be French ... but above all let us be Canadians.” Now, 150 years ago, that was relevant. It didn’t include, for example, the indigenous population, and we have been getting a little bit better—not entirely better in this province and in this country yet, but we are going to get there, because we believe in truth and reconciliation.", "The other thing, though, is that we have people here in this assembly whose parents’ mother tongues might not have been English, French, Mi’kmaq, Algonquin, Cree or whatever languages were spoken 150 years ago. Today we have people coming from all around the world who speak so many different languages. And, Speaker, I’ve got to tell you something: That makes me so proud.", "There used to be a time, when I was a little girl, when I wanted to know at least one person from every single province. That, to me, was a sign of success. As a Canadian, if I knew somebody from each and every province and territory, then I would have made it in the world. Now, today, my daughter doesn’t have to have that dream, because she does know lots of people from different parts of Canada. My dream for her is what I get to experience as an MPP, each and every single day: that she gets to know people from around the world—different cultures, different ideas—that she gets to experience that.", "I’m going to depart from my script right now, Speaker. My staff are well aware that I often will depart from my script for a bit. I want to talk about what it’s like. It’s very hard to be a mom in politics, especially when you have to travel, but the benefit that I’ve had over the past 11 years with my little girl is that she celebrates Chinese New Year, and it’s normal for her. She loves it. She loves the colours. She loves the little red pouches she gets. She is experiencing something I never would.", "I took her on Saturday—it’s always about the food with these kids—to the opening of Ottawa’s first Filipino restaurant. She was so excited. I said, “Victoria, we have to leave. We’ve got to go see Dad.” My husband chairs the national capital region of St. John Ambulance. It’s excellent work that they do. We had to go see him, and she said, “I don’t want to leave. I never want to leave. The food is so good. Can I come back here tomorrow and order spring rolls?” I thought that was interesting, because she got to know the Filipino community, who showed up in droves for this new restaurant.", "A couple of weeks ago, we were at an Indo-Canadian event. I think I mentioned this last week, but Speaker, what’s incredible about our new High Commissioner of India to Canada is that he actually wrote Slumdog Millionaire, the book. He’s incredible. It was amazing to be there with him. I told him at the time that I came from this small town, New Glasgow, Nova Scotia, with 10,000 people, and our only two spices were salt and pepper. He had a good laugh, because there are slums in India—and I’ve been to India—that have millions of people, not 10,000. We had this wonderful conversation.", "I wanted to go, and I said to my daughter, “Do you want to come?” She said, “Will there be butter chicken?” I said yes, so she came, and she was dancing Bollywood. It’s incredible, the things that we get to do together when we share our ideas.", "I may have mentioned this last week, but we went to a traditional Kenyan wedding over the summer, which was very interesting. I’m Scottish, Speaker, as my red hair and my freckles and my last name probably give away, but one of the cool things that I think unites all cultures and religions is our love of food and our love of dance and our love of family. I think that that’s incredibly important and one thing that I did want to mention here because that’s really important.", "We had talked about the number of people who are coming to our province and we talked about the number who have neither English nor French. I want to just talk about the fact that the proportion of the population with visible minority status could rise from 31% to 36% in the province of Ontario. Religious diversity is also expected to increase as we welcome more people to our country.", "Now, this is a statistic that I think is very, very important in this debate: According to Statistics Canada, 70% of newcomers to our country are racialized, which is why it’s important for us to have this debate in this assembly. I obviously am partial to what is happening in the nation’s capital. That’s where I’m from; that’s where I love. In our population of almost one million, 23%—or 202,000 people—were born outside of Canada. So, of almost one million people in the nation’s capital, nearly 20% belong to a visible minority or racialized group, and that is expected to grow to 36% by 2021.", "In Ottawa alone, there are more than 100 ethnicities, with more than 70 languages spoken. Can you believe that the world has come to us? I know the wonderful thing that is happening in our city, Speaker. We get to benefit more than anybody else over Canada’s 150th because we are the federal seat of Parliament and most of the wonderful things that have happened in our country constitutionally have occurred in our city. But what is remarkable is that in this 150th year we have set up a secretariat inside the city of Ottawa to celebrate Canada’s 150th, and in so doing we have these wonderful events like Red Bull Crashed Ice. There’s going to be dining between the twin cities of Ottawa and Gatineau.", "One of the coolest thing is that we are home to all the world’s embassies. I think there are more embassies in Ottawa per capita than anywhere else in the world. What we are doing is, we are opening Aberdeen Pavilion at Lansdowne Park, and different countries are bringing their cuisine and their culture into an event each week. Because we do have so many different people from so many different places in the world, obviously attached to each embassy is a community that they would continue to work with; for example, India, China, the Philippines, Kenya, Liberia. That’s what’s happening in the city of Ottawa. That’s an incredible thing that makes me so proud, and it makes me happy that my daughter gets to experience all that and gets to see other people.", "I want to now turn to Ontario’s largest city. I indicated today in question period that although we might only be the second-largest city in Ontario, we have the best hockey team. That would be the Ottawa Senators. We’re very happy that the Senators made the playoffs, but we are equally happy that our friends from Toronto—the largest city in the province, our largest city—also saw that their hockey team, the Toronto Maple Leafs, made it. So we’re congratulating them. I can tell you something: It doesn’t matter where you come from and it doesn’t matter where you are going; if you love hockey, there’s always an exciting little battle between our two cities.", "I want to turn to the city of Toronto. According to the city’s website, the 2011 census showed that 49% of those living in Toronto—that’s over 1.2 million people—identified as a visible minority—1.2 million people in this city are a visible minority. Thirty-eight per cent of those living in the rest of the GTHA and 19% nationally identified as a visible minority. The region of Peel, however, has the highest percentage of visible minorities in the GTHA, at 57%. More than half of the population in the region of Peel is a visible minority. The world is changing from when Brampton Bill was the Premier of this wonderful province.", "The top three visible minorities in Toronto were: South Asian, 12% of the total; Chinese, 11%; and black, 9%. Meanwhile, the city of Toronto website also indicates that the census showed 76% of those living in Toronto identified a religious affiliation: 54% of those living in Toronto identified as Christian; 8% identified as Muslim; 6% identified as Hindu; and 24% had no religious affiliation. So you see that there’s a growing diversity there from what our roots would have been predominantly when this country was founded, which would have been Catholic and Protestant.", "In my own community where I grew up, there were the Scottish Presbyterians and the Scottish Catholics. My parents married in 1973. I shared this last week. When my parents married, there were people who would refuse to go to their wedding because they were of “mixed race.” How stupid is that? They were both Scottish. They came over on the same boat, I’m pretty sure, and one was Catholic and one was Presbyterian. My, have the times ever changed. I shared that one with my daughter as well.", "I wanted to also point out that there were almost 20,000 people living in Toronto who identified as aboriginal; 67% were First Nations, which means North American Indian; 25% were Métis; 2% were Inuk or Inuit; and 1% had multiple aboriginal identities.", "I want to expand on this. “In 2015,” according to the National Post, “Statistics Canada said that the black community were targets of 22% of hate crimes in 2013, remaining the most likely target of hate crimes in Canada as part of a racial community; meanwhile, Jewish Canadians are the most likely target of religion-motivated hate crime, with 16% of all hate crimes of all types targeting Jewish” communities.", "Finally, I have a passage that I want to read from the Toronto Police Hate Crimes Unit, and it says, “The three most targeted groups since 2006 have been the Jewish community, the black community and the” LGBTQ “community. In 2015, the Jewish community, followed by the LGBTQ community and the Muslim community were the most victimized groups. The three most reported criminal offences motivated by hate/bias in 2015 were mischief to property, assault and criminal harassment.” Think about that. The three most reported—and that’s just reported, Speaker. It doesn’t mean that that is what has happened the most; it means it’s the most reported. The most reported were mischief to property, assault and criminal harassment.", "I recently watched a video—I had a group from the Muslim community come in and meet with me two weeks ago. They had been working on an ad. It left me in tears. They told me that it had actually happened. The family had been out for the day. They drove in the driveway, and it said, “Go home.” I can’t imagine driving into my driveway, with my child in my vehicle, and seeing that scrawled on my home. But that happened, and that’s wrong and we have to condemn it. We should not, and cannot, allow that to continue. We’ve got to make sure that we understand that mischief to property may not invoke bodily harm, but mischief to property and vandalism—putting a swastika or calling someone the N-word or whatever it is will harm, the feeling of safety and security that we expect all of our residents in this province to feel. I wanted to put that out there.", "I want to get into the meat of this bill. The Liberals will be formalizing the Anti-Racism Secretariat and its three year anti-racism strategy that is the compendium to this bill. If you read this bill, Speaker, you see a lot of legalese, but what it’s really doing is, it’s going to ensconce the government’s three-year anti-racism strategy within the bill. There will be a lot of reviews, which I’ll talk about.", "The strategy intends to eliminate racism, to advance racial equality and to measure the strategy’s effectiveness, in particular for the indigenous and black communities within Ontario public service organizations which are funded over $1 million by the province of Ontario. The minister will prepare progress reports. Every five years, there will be a review of the strategy, in consultation with stakeholders whom the minister deems appropriate.", "I have a question on how the minister deems who is appropriate and who is not. That is a question that I will have for the government, and hopefully the government will come back to me and let me know who they deem is appropriate. There are many different organizations out there, and I’m sure they would all like to have their say. I hope the government is open to all of these different organizations so that they can all have their say.", "The minister will establish data collection and monitor systemic racism throughout the public service, in consultation with the Information and Privacy Commissioner.", "When I was briefed on this piece of legislation by the minister’s office, that was a concern that I had—to ensure that this information was going to be properly protected, that personal information would not be compromised, and to ensure that we are following appropriate laws with respect to that. This is a concern I have, and I hope I can be confident, if this bill is to pass, that this personal information’s privacy will be protected.", "Presently, personal health records are exempt from this data, and an amendment will be forthcoming. I don’t know when that will be forthcoming. Will it be forthcoming during deliberations when this goes to committee, during clause-by-clause? Or will it be coming down the road? My understanding, speaking with ministerial officials, is that this could take up to six months. Therefore, that means it would not be included in this round. So I think it would be important to provide that information as well.", "Public service organizations may disclose data to researchers if there is an application in writing and if the research has public or scientific benefit and is approved by a research ethics board.", "This was another area where I questioned the minister’s staff, just to ensure that people’s information wasn’t going to be given out. They have assured me that due to algorithms and different protections, that information would not be compromised. I still have to be convinced. It has nothing to do with this bill, but I have been here long enough to see some very big challenges this government has had with data. Remember, we are talking about the same crew that bungled eHealth—a data system—and this is the same crew that decided they were going to shred documents and evade the privacy commissioner and, finally, wipe out hard drives. They need to be very clear with me on how this is going to be protected, so people’s personal information is not compromised.", "It does say that breaches of FIPPA and MFIPPA, which are the information privacy act and the municipal information privacy act, would come with a fine of up to $100,000. That’s good to hear.", "The minister will establish an anti-racism impact assessment framework which assesses racial inequality and reviews and revises policies and programs to remedy or prevent inequality. This will include public notice and reporting. Public reporting will be published on the government of Ontario website.", "So there is a level of transparency and accountability, but let me assure you of something, Speaker. I’ve been here—this is not my first rodeo. I remember that the government had promised they were going to do a review of the LHINs, and it took forever. So can we naturally assume or trust that they will follow through with this? What if the minister changes, and one minister is really invested and then the other minister isn’t? These are some questions that must be asked and must be answered.", "I’m now at the point where I’ve laid out what is in the bill. I’ve laid out, I believe, the context of why we need to have this conversation and the debate in this assembly, because of the changing face of the province of Ontario, as well as some of the systemic issues that we all rightfully acknowledge.", "Speaker, the previous Speaker was in here when I first spoke to this, but you will be happy to note that I talked about your contribution to the black community in the province of Ontario with respect to the Emancipation Day Act. I think—and you would probably agree with me; I think most members would agree with me—that as times change, we also have to change. We can’t continue to use old thinking and old approaches. I think we need to think about the changing times and what those challenges mean to us, and those demands placed upon us.", "As I said, I have never seen a piece of legislation be perfect—except for, of course, Rowan’s Law, which I put forward. Speaker, I’m just teasing. I’ve never seen a piece of legislation be perfect. I’ve never seen a piece of legislation that didn’t have an amendment. I’ve never seen a piece of legislation that, after it was passed, was never amended. I think we always have to be open to that.", "The plan does focus a lot on the black, indigenous and Muslim communities, but it is very weak on the protections for Ontario’s Jewish population, which both the 2011 census and the Toronto police hate crimes unit say is the community which is most targeted by hate in the province. We know anti-Semitism runs deep and should be acknowledged, along with other targeted groups, in a similar vein in the three-year plan. I realize that we are not going to be voting on the three-year plan, but I realize as well that this is an important piece. I want to see the Jewish community incorporated in this.", "I would be remiss not to say, Speaker, at the very beginning of this debate last week, I was to have shared my time with my colleague Mr. Cho from Scarborough–Rouge River, but he has his own 20-minute rotation. I wanted to put that on the record for the Clerk’s office. He will be up after me in a bit.", "I just wanted to say, the three-year plan also mentioned specific tables for certain communities and changes to our education system, which are not explicitly mentioned in the legislation, which, again, excludes the Ontario Jewish community. Again, I’m having a rough time with this. I spoke with representatives from a couple of different Jewish communities in the last week, and I think this is something they would be concerned about. They have reached out, I know, through the press. I saw a couple of articles in the newspaper after I had spoken with them.", "Actually, I used the old Google this weekend and just said, “Okay, was there any coverage on this when it came out?” Indeed, members of Ontario’s Jewish community are concerned and, rightfully, there are other groups that are included in this. I don’t take away from that, but I do take exception to the fact that the Jewish community is not either explicitly mentioned in this legislation or more in the government’s three-year plan. It took nine pages, in fact, to use the word “anti-Semitism.” So I do have a significant concern there.", "I have been to mosques, synagogues and churches where individuals have chosen not to report some of the hate, the graffiti and the vandalism they have experienced, in order not to scare others. So when I look at what’s most reported, I recognize as well that’s not exactly what’s happening. I said that a little bit earlier, but I wanted to put that on the record and be very clear that there does need to be more protection for our Ontario Jewish community, which is vibrant and which has done a great deal of philanthropy and good in this province.", "Finally, I just wanted to say I do have a concern with the privacy measures outlined throughout the bill itself. Perhaps they can be allayed when I have a greater conversation with the minister and he can assure me that people’s privacy will not be breached. With the collection of private information on race-based incidents, the government must take great care to ensure there aren’t any privacy breaches. The Ontario PC caucus is most interested in learning how the government intends to protect these from breaches.", "That said, I think it’s important that we do track this, particularly in our public services. It’s important that we have actual facts and data and statistics as we move forward because the best way for us to address racial inequality or hate based on religion is to know it exists, that it continues to exist, where it exists, and what type of it is existing so that we can best address it, whether that is through our public services, through our education system and our health care or with our police. I think that’s important.", "I’ve read a David Reevely column; I don’t have it with me at the moment, but, in essence, at the end of his article, he said that it’s about time we’re starting to do this. Perhaps I should have brought that down with me.", "That’s where I believe we have some deficiencies, but perhaps the government can let me know that they are working on this or they are addressing it or that I could be allayed in any of those ways.", "Again, it is a pleasure to rise on behalf of the Ontario PC caucus and our leader, Patrick Brown. In 2017, 150 years after the great Sir John A. Macdonald founded this country, 150 years after we started meeting in places like this—well, we were already meeting in places like this, but as one federation—150 years after the great Prime Minister said, “Let us be English or let us be French ... but above all let us be Canadians,” there is no room for hate. This country was not founded on hate. This country was not founded for any other reason but for hope and prosperity, so that people around the world would consider this their home. This country was founded on equal opportunity.", "Let me say this, and I’ll say it to the pages—I’m getting a little grey, okay? But here’s the thing: Not everybody was equal when we founded this country. Not everyone had the opportunity, even though that was the desire at the time. Our indigenous population was not considered equal. Women didn’t have the right to vote. Slavery existed in this country. The earliest known slave was in the 1600s. So as glorious as we are and as proud as we are as Canadians; as much as we’ve liberated the people of France; with the wonderful work that we’ve done to ensure that little girls in Afghanistan get to go to school; as wonderful as we are at passing legislation and all of us having the abilities that we do today, Canada has a history—some of it’s not all that great, but most of it is. So when you leave here after your three- or four-week stint, I want you to go back to your communities as proud Canadians and proud Ontarians. I want you to know that you’ve become friends with people who are different than you and come from different places.", "Let me just say this—I have four minutes left, and this really doesn’t have much to do with the bill other than that it talks about diversity. We come from 107 different places in this province—well, some of us come from more places; I come from Nova Scotia originally. We all have 107 different ridings, and our ridings are very different. My colleague from Parry Sound–Muskoka, who’s right behind me, represents one of the most picturesque places outside of Ottawa in all of the province of Ontario. He would have a greater indigenous population than I would.", "I represent the nation’s capital, the city of Ottawa. I represent one of the fastest-growing communities of anybody in here, and I represent people who come from all over the world, a more diverse population than my colleague.", "I have other colleagues here. My colleague France Gélinas from Nickel Belt represents a very large, very rural riding. It’s so big—I’m not sure how big it is, but I can tell you that there are a lot of francophones in her community. I’ve been to it and I’ve visited it with her, and she has a large francophone population, but she also has a large indigenous population.", "In the place where we are right now, in this Legislative Assembly, we are debating with one another. We all have shared experiences, but we also have different experiences.", "I see my colleague Harinder Malhi. Her dad was a federal member of Parliament, and here she is today in his footsteps. She and I are very similar in the sense that, like Laurie Scott—and, I’m sure, others in this assembly—our fathers were the first ones to get elected, and then we followed our dads’ footsteps. Our grandmothers might not have had the right to vote when they were our age.", "So we are a country of great possibilities. We are a country that was founded with the best of intentions. We are a country that has made some mistakes along the way, but who hasn’t? We look around the world and we see that there are major atrocities that we want to stand against.", "We stood against the Holocaust. My grandfather went and fought in that war. I can’t ever understate the importance of the men and women who went to Afghanistan to liberate little girls. That’s so important, that they can go to school today.", "We see what’s happening in Syria, and we are welcoming refugees into our country. My daughter’s school alone has 120 kids who came from Syria. We are a country that responds to our own internal challenges but also to world challenges.", "So if I could say one thing to our dear friends who are about to leave us on Thursday to go back to their respective communities, it’s to stay in touch, hear the other side and always know that if you make a mistake, it’s never too late to say you’re sorry and to try and fix it.", "With this legislation, I’ll cede the floor, but not without first saying what a pleasure it is to have a conversation on how we can reach more people and how we can be positive in our communities rather than always talking about things that are negative. That is why I think this is an important hour for me to have had and why I think it’s important for everybody else to be part of this discussion.", "But that doesn’t mean that we have to fundamentally agree on all aspects of everything. So I’ll leave you with this: We must not necessarily accept other people’s points of view, but we always must respect them." ],

We need to look at it in the education sector; we need to look at it in the social service area; we need to look at it in the health sector.

The secretariat would be composed of six or fewer people appointed by the Lieutenant Governor in Council on the advice of the chief commissioner. Under the direction of the chief commissioner, it would research discriminatory practices on the basis of race and make recommendations to prevent and eliminate those practices. It would develop public information and education programs.", "Bill 107 attracted strong criticisms from many community-based organizations working with people with disabilities and racialized communities. It shifted toward a system that placed the onus on individual victims of discrimination to investigate and prosecute their own cases, from a system that had been based on public investigation and enforcement of human rights. Despite this criticism, the Liberal government used its majority to abruptly stop the legislative hearing process and pass the bill without further public consultation.", "In 2015, the NDP called for a new anti-racism secretariat to be created and that a task force be struck that would examine issues of systemic racism in the province. In commenting about the Premier’s response to that call for an anti-racism secretariat, one person said in the Share newspaper: “The concept of systemic racism exists because the people who create policy, for example, do not realize or recognize the barriers that are in-bred in those policies. In my mind, one of the duties of the secretariat would be to establish a consistent anti-racism lens through which policies would be screened—how would this policy affect racialized persons/families?”", "In February of last year, the Anti-Racism Directorate was established by the government.

I put it to you that the conversation on Bill 114 cannot ignore the conversation that is currently happening on Bill 89. I hope that it is helpful that the same minister has carriage of both bills because they inform one another. How we address the issues faced by today’s children will inevitably have a significant impact in the years and decades to come.", "We have heard from representatives of our First Nations communities and our African Canadian community. These communities are particularly concerned because their children are dramatically overrepresented in the child welfare system. In Toronto, 8% of those under 18 are black, yet 42% of children in care have at least one black parent. That is five times their representation in the general population. Statistics Canada has reported that 48% of all children in child welfare systems across Canada are indigenous children. Here in Ontario, the Council of the Federation reported to Canada’s Premiers in 2015 that 21% of children in care were indigenous, yet they make up only 3% of Ontario’s child population. Those are numbers that have been gleaned from various sources because there is nothing in the Child and Family Services Act that allows for the collection of information that would give us the true, full picture. That is something that Bill 89 seeks to address—the collection of information—although the Information and Privacy Commissioner has also spoken to the committee, raising several concerns about the wording currently in the bill.", "These numbers tell a very important and very worrying story about what puts children who are subject to systemic racism at such a severe disadvantage. As we can see from the previous short history I gave, this is not a new phenomenon. It has been happening for years, and people from those communities have been telling us about it for years. The question is, have we been listening?", "Let me read from the submission of the Association of Native Child and Family Services Agencies of Ontario:", "“ANCFSAO notes that while Bill 89 proposes some amendments that may improve the ability of its members to effectively serve indigenous children, there remain numerous profound obstacles for our members under the CFSA in developing and implementing best practices. In its 2015 submissions regarding the CFSA, the ANCFSAO made several recommendations for amendments to the act the adoption of which would, in our view, materially improve the quality and effectiveness of services provided to indigenous children by all societies in the province. The most important of these recommendations appear to have been ignored in the provisions of Bill 89.”", "The Ontario Federation of Indigenous Friendship Centres made a submission—which followed on from A Collaborative Submission Regarding the Child and Family Services Act—to the 2015 review of the Child and Family Services Act.

This is an organization that represents a network of over 400 organizations, professionals, residents and allies who are united in a mission to promote equity-focused systems change and community empowerment through advocacy, community organizing and development, leadership development, and community education and research. Here is part of what they had to say in their submission:", "“Although the bill presents an historic opportunity to transform youth services and promote greater equity within the province, the current version fails to address critical issues for African Canadians.”", "They continue to point out: “African Canadians face a unique context of systemic anti-black racism in Canada, reflected by a history of enslavement, racial segregation and marginalization, the major over-representation of African Canadian youth in child welfare and youth justice systems, as well as inequities in employment, education, housing and other domains of well-being.”", "As I mentioned, Speaker, it is informative of the work that must be done to tackle racism.", "Sadly, we are all too aware of racism in our communities. A few weeks ago, we had the protracted case of the York region school board trustee who directed a racial slur at a parent. That situation continued for weeks as the trustee refused to step down. Not surprisingly, the parent wanted the trustee removed from the board, but as an elected official, there was no avenue for that to happen. Eventually, the trustee resigned from the board after a lot of pressure from many sides.", "The parent in that case, a mother of three young children, has now launched a human rights complaint about what she calls “deeply entrenched systemic barriers that parents face when they seek to challenge racism” at York Region District School Board.", "This is the type of situation we would hope that an anti-racism strategy would seek to address and correct.", "A few weeks ago, a home in Port Colborne was vandalized because the daughter of the homeowner was dating a classmate who happened to be black. We know the reason because, in addition to the other damages, the vandals painted “N... lover,” with the N-word spelled out, on his daughter’s bedroom wall. That was another shocking example of racism in our communities.", "On March 31, Justice Michael Tulloch presented his report on the Independent Police Oversight Review.

For some communities, particularly black and indigenous communities, historical realities have led to a distrust of the police, a distrust that sometimes extends to the oversight bodies” as well.", "“In my view, developing cultural competency is crucial to address systemic issues that have hindered positive indigenous engagement with the oversight bodies.", "“Understanding the context of indigenous-police relations is essential....”", "His point about developing cultural competency is crucial to any anti-racism strategy and is most definitely not limited to police oversight. It is true for every government department.", "Justice Tulloch points out that this should not just be about learning about indigenous peoples. It also is about recruiting and developing indigenous staff, and it requires applying a culturally competent approach to service delivery.", "He said this in relation to indigenous peoples, but in our multicultural society it is important to be reflected for other marginalized communities as well.", "With regard to his consultation process and the review, Justice Tulloch said this: “To me, context is always of critical importance. Accordingly, it was very important for this review to include the voices of as many people as possible. I therefore committed to holding an open, extensive, and accommodating consultation process.”", "How very true that is, Speaker, when we are trying to understand and correct systemic racism. Systemic racism doesn’t exist because people are bad; it exists because those making or changing the rules don’t understand how the rules affect some people. It exists because of rules made in years gone by and carried forward without an appreciation of the damage that they have done in the past.", "We definitely know that racism has existed in our province and in our country for many, many years. Unfortunately, in the last couple of years we have seen that heightened to an extreme extent. We have a newly elected president across the border who has, I believe, stirred an underbelly of racism right here in our very own backyard.", "In Hamilton, which is my home city, as you know, several issues have happened. We have women who have been verbally attacked for wearing hijabs. We have had mosques that have had fire thrown at them and caused damage—thankfully, minimal.", "We have seen rallies of people from the Canadian Coalition for Concerned Citizens, thinking that they’re going to put together rallies in front of city hall to fight against Islam. Thankfully, the people in my city stood up to that and countered that rally by more than doubling their presence and just washing them out on our steps of city hall, ensuring that people know that racism is not going to be accepted in my city. I’m really proud of the work that has happened in my city.", "We have the Hamilton Centre for Civic Inclusion, which was born right after 9/11. At that time, a Hindu Samaj temple was burned to the ground by people who didn’t realize that they weren’t burning down a mosque, as they thought. They were counteracting 9/11, and it was absolutely awful. But out of that has come good work in our city.", "I know I’m running out of time, but I know I will have a couple of minutes after, to talk about some of the things that happened there.", "Something very important that I want to point out is that Statistics Canada data—this is from 2015—showed that Hamilton was Canada’s second-highest city for hate crime per capita. That’s a scary statistic. I’m so thankful for the many people who fight racism in the city of Hamilton, and I’m going to touch base on them just a little bit after the comments." ],

That shows the power of data. Therefore, the provisions of this bill around data standards for the collection, use and management of information are critically important. We know, for example, that the Toronto District School Board and People for Education have done research about the impact of streaming on racialized young people in our schools. One of the findings of People for Education’s research is that for a black youth in a Toronto high school, taking one applied-level course in grade 9 means almost no chance—no chance at all—of going on to university. And we know that the students who are being streamed in grade 9 into taking applied-level courses are overwhelmingly more likely to be black and indigenous students.", "When we are able to collect that kind of data, those statistics, we understand the systemic barriers that limit opportunities, that limit potential for black children, black families, black people, indigenous families and youth across this province. That’s why we need to have this mechanism. It is important. But what’s more important is what is done with that data once it is collected. We need to have the full involvement of indigenous and black communities in understanding how to use that data." ],

Last year, our government created the Anti-Racism Directorate to bring an anti-racism perspective to government policy, programs and services. Since its establishment, the Anti-Racism Directorate held 10 open meetings between July and December 2016, where we heard first-hand the painful realities of racism experienced by people across Ontario. More than 2,500 people attended the ARD public meetings between July and December 2016 in Toronto, Hamilton, Mississauga, Scarborough, Sudbury, Kitchener, London, Thunder Bay, Windsor and Ottawa. An additional 2,000 people participated in the public meetings via live streaming online.", "People shared stories that spoke to the devastating impact of systemic racism—and I agree with my colleague from Nepean–Carleton about that commercial where the Muslim couple is pulling into their driveway and the mother starts to cry when she sees the racial graffiti on their garage door. That kind of thing should never happen here in Canada.", "The people at the consultations talked about the barriers that they face in schools, at work and within the child welfare and justice systems. They talked about the need to establish the Anti-Racism Directorate in law. This legislation was born out of those meetings. We heard that anti-racism legislation was the number one priority for many of the community partners. The proposed legislation was influenced by the Colour of Poverty–Colour of Change’s draft anti-racism bill. The measures set out in the proposed legislation align well with those set out in the COP–COC bill, and facilitate the government’s ongoing commitment to supporting anti-racism across a range of public sector organizations.", "Public input from community meetings, along with recommendations and reports from over the years are at the heart of our provincial strategies to fight systemic racism. Battling systemic racism is no small task, as we all know, but by working together, we can build an Ontario where everyone is able to succeed and prosper and equally participate in and contribute to society. Let’s hope that we all become like those two little fellas that got the haircut—not that I want my hair cut.", "The proposed Anti-Racism Act is a significant step towards advancing the goal of racial equality in Ontario. And why it’s important: The legislation would embed the Anti-Racism Directorate into law. Embedding the Anti-Racism Directorate into law would ensure the future of the province’s anti-racism work beyond political cycles. This is extremely important to the people of Ontario.", "Ontarians saw the Anti-Racism Directorate dismantled, as the member from Hamilton Mountain said, by the former Progressive Conservative government, and they stated very clearly in public consultations that this cannot be allowed to happen again. This is why we are here today proposing to embed the Anti-Racism Directorate right into law. We need to rebuild community trust and confidence. The government is committed to long-term solutions to address the disparities and unequal outcomes related to systemic racism. We have started our work through A Better Way Forward, the province’s three-year strategic plan to address anti-racism, and through the proposed Anti-Racism Act. We want to do this right. That means being transparent and accountable to the public and especially the communities most affected by systemic barriers.", "I have to say that over my many years of teaching—I think I’m number one on the seniority list for all of Simcoe county teachers; yes, I’ve been around a while. I’d have to say that when I first started to teach in Barrie—actually, I started in Milton—there were no people of colour in any of the classes that I taught. The last classes that I taught at Terry Fox all had about 25% of people of colour in them. Barrie has changed. All of our communities are changing. That is good. We need to make sure that the changes and progress we make are here to stay.", "The plan leverages the work of other ministries and takes a whole-government approach to working towards racial equity. The ARD has partnered with many of the ministries. One of the biggest criticisms I hear is that many of the ministries have been siloed and that there is no crossover. I think this bill will do a lot so that all the ministries can work together to approach this bill and make it an excellent legislative bill." ],

I’m very pleased to be able to rise and speak in support of Bill 114, which is An Act to provide for Anti-Racism Measures.", "This bill does a number of things to combat racism. But, in my opinion, one of the really important things that it does is that it actually embeds the Anti-Racism Directorate right in the law. The legislation talks about the creation of the Anti-Racism—or at least the existence, because it’s already been created. It talks about the existence of the Anti-Racism Directorate, talks about the work that it will do.", "It actually embeds the directorate in law. The reason that’s important is because it actually protects the directorate from the political cycles that we inevitably go through in this House. There actually was an Anti-Racism Secretariat previously, in the early 1990s, but then the Progressive Conservative government dismantled it. It ceased to exist.", "One of the things that we heard when we did consultations was that the public said, “You’ve set the Anti-Racism Directorate up again, but now we want you to make sure that it isn’t going to disappear.” The way we make sure that it isn’t going to disappear is by embedding the directorate right in the law. So I think that’s one of the things that I’m very, very proud of.", "One of the other areas that I’m very interested in, and the Minister for Children and Youth Services and I have talked about this a lot, is the ability to collect race-based data. I know that that often gives people pause, but I know from my experience as education minister that when we set up the Indigenous Education Strategy, one of the things we said was we actually need to be able to identify our First Nation, Métis and Inuit students, because it’s well known that there’s a gap in performance, for a whole variety of historic reasons, between our indigenous students and other students. But if we’re going to have strategies to try to narrow that gap, we can only tell if the strategies are effective if we actually have the race-based data that allows us to monitor the performance of different groups. I think people often look at the collection of race-based data in a negative way, as though we’re trying to negatively label certain groups. But in fact, what we’re really trying to do when we collect that race-based data is have the ability (a) to identify issues, and then (b) to monitor whether or not we’re successfully correcting those issues.", "One of the things that this legislation does is it provides a standardized approach to collecting race-related data. We just simply do not have good information in Ontario right now about those disproportionalities in success. If we’re going to find out if the anti-racism strategy is a success, we need to be able to measure it, just as with any other program.", "So this bill does set out the ability to create race-based data in a way that will be consistent. For example, we know that black children make up 41% of the children in care. How do we address that? Obviously, there is an anomaly going on here. They’re overrepresented in the population that is part of the child welfare system. If we’re going to address it, we need to have standards. The minister has been working very carefully with the privacy commissioner—because we certainly don’t want to offend anyone—around the standards, so that we will be able to do that.", "Certainly, one of the things that we have to make sure that we’re doing is protecting privacy. We do not want data about any individual to be able to be identified. That means that, laid out in the legislation, we have the rules around how we would de-identify, how we would disaggregate the data to make sure—or aggregate the race-based data to make sure no particular individuals are being identified.", "But what this really allows us to do is, as we look at work that’s happening in the ministries of justice, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Children and Youth Services itself, as we work through all of these issues, we will now have consistent standards that have been approved by the privacy commissioner, and that we know that we can move ahead comfortably with the collection of the data that will be so critical in making sure that we can address issues of racism—and everybody is gazing skyward, because even here in the Legislature, we can hear that a tremendous thunderstorm has just opened up outside. With that, I will conclude." ],

The member talked about the two little boys who thought they were identical when they got the same haircut, but they happened to be two different colours.", "Something I saw earlier in the week, which was quite something, was a little girl from the States and she wanted to get a new doll. Her parents told her, after she was potty-trained, that she’d get a new doll. She went to Target and picked up the doll, and the doll was a doctor. When they were going through the checkout, the older woman who worked at Target basically suggested that maybe she should put the doll back, and the little girl goes, “No, I’m not putting the doll back. She looks exactly like me.” And the cashier effectively said, “No, no, are you sure you don’t want a white doll?” And the little girl said, “Well, no. I want the doll that looks just like me. I want to be a doctor, and she’s a doctor”—so that’s a two-year-old kid.", "Then finally, my daughter recently had her birthday. She’s into this American Girl doll thing. It’s very expensive. We go in and we see this doll. She picks this doll that looks like her very good friend, and very good hockey player, Bethany. I thought that was great. She picked up the doll that was brown, because it looked just like her friend Bethany, and she thought that was fantastic.", "Listen, I think we can learn a lot from our children, particularly in this debate. I think it’s a good conversation that we’re having, and it’s one that we must continue to have in this assembly. The more that we talk about it, the more that we talk about acceptance and inclusion, the more that, I think, the public will as well. Times are changing." ],

As you know, Speaker, community health centres have been collecting socio-demographic data as well as other race-based data for decades now. They have used this data to work on anti-racism policies. The minister was good enough to explain to me that we have a hurdle to overcome with PHIPA, the Personal Health Information Protection Act. Hopefully we will be able to get this done before the bill receives third and final reading. I think that the end goal for both sides is that we collect data that is relevant to help us achieve our goals of anti-racism.", "When I think of a community health centre like TAIBU that exists to serve the black community, or when I think about Hamilton Urban Core—the same thing: a community health centre that targets anti-racism action and programs—they have a lot to offer. The Toronto Central LHIN has mandated hospitals to collect that data for quite some time. As the minister said, the more information we have, the more chances we have to have good policies that we can measure and that we can take steps forward on that we can all be proud of.", "PHIPA is never little, but if we put our brains together, I’m sure we’ll find something positive out of this." ],

I want to thank everyone for their hard work in putting this bill together and getting it to the point where we are today. Systemic racism is unfortunately persistent here in Ontario. We must constantly strive towards a more equal, fair society for all.", "I’m no stranger to discrimination, and I would like to share my personal story. I was born and raised in South Korea before I came to this great country, Canada, in 1967. There was barely any mention of racial discrimination among Koreans in Korea, mainly because it was such a homogeneous society. When I landed in Vancouver, British Columbia, as a landed immigrant, I gradually began to experience different forms of racial discrimination in different social situations. For example, when I was taking the bus to work and sitting down in one of the chairs, I realized that no one came and sat beside me, even though there was enough space and the bus was filled. Although I did not mind having so much space to myself on public transit, I came to realize that many people did not want to sit next to me because I’m an immigrant or perhaps because I look different.", "I’d like to share another example as a new immigrant. I was very busy looking for a room to rent. When I saw an advertisement in the local newspaper for a room to rent, I would go out to that place and knock on the door. They opened the door and I inquired about the room for rent, and the lady who responded to my door knocking said, “Oh, I’m sorry. The room was just taken.” I just believed the lady and continued searching for a different room to rent. After this occurred a few more times, I slowly came to realize and understand the meaning of racial discrimination in my new country of Canada.", "Mr. Speaker, now I’d like to share my very common and painful experience that most new Canadians experience when they arrive in Canada.", "Each time I had a job interview as a new immigrant, the first question that I would be asked was if I had any Canadian experience. Of course, my answer was always no as I was never able to get a job in Canada.", "Finally, I got a job. This job gave me great joy and it gave me a sense of relief, as well as a great surge of confidence. Now I knew for sure I would not die from starvation.", "That was around mid-April 1967 in Vancouver. I had less than $50 with me. The first job was as a dishwasher in a big restaurant. I thought that washing dishes would be an easy job; however, it was actually very difficult and tiring. My fingers were bleeding after every shift work from scrubbing so hard on the metal pans.", "After two weeks of hard work as a dishwasher, I got my first cheque. I went to the bank with my head held very high to deposit my $40. Truly, I was very happy, and I felt like I was a millionaire.", "I told the bank teller that I was there to open up an account and deposit my money. The bank teller asked me my profession. As a new immigrant, although I knew English, I did not quite understand the word “profession” or what she meant. So I asked the bank teller, “Could you tell me the meaning of ‘profession’?” Maybe a bit of sarcasm; I don’t know. She told me it meant a job—she didn’t say “you idiot,” but the non-verbal behaviour was there; pardon my language, Mr. Speaker—and looked down at me for asking. I told her that my profession was a dishwasher. She laughed at me, yet I still felt very proud of my new job and source of income.", "However, I felt that having moved to Canada and working as a dishwasher would not be my end goal. Instead, I knew that to become more successful, I would have to become a rich man or get a better education. I decided to go with achieving higher education and become a professional worker. I approached the University of British Columbia and applied for admission to their MBA program. I was accepted to the University of British Columbia, but to afford the tuition, I first had to work more in order to pay for it.", "I got a job in northern British Columbia near the border of Yukon Territory. There, I worked as a labourer in an asbestos mine during the day, a waiter at a bar in the evening and as a janitor during the night.", "When I was working in that northern community, I saw the real discrimination against the indigenous people. Because of the systemic racism, the people there did not see the benefits of getting an education and were unfortunately caught in a cycle of discrimination which they did not know how to get out of. This persistent discrimination unfortunately made them feel that their Canadian dream was an unrealistic goal for them. As Nelson Mandela once said, “Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.” It saddened me to witness how people become victims of systemic discrimination and that they may not even realize they are victims of the system, or perhaps they do not know how to get out of the cycle.", "In September 1967, thank God, I was admitted to an MBA program at the University of British Columbia. However, I was too tired and drained to study and I had to discontinue my MBA program in Vancouver. However, in December of that same year, I moved to Toronto, the city I now call my second home. Toronto was quite a different city compared to Vancouver in terms of racial discrimination.", "However, finding a job for a new immigrant like me was not different between Toronto and Vancouver. Each time I had a job interview in Toronto, the first question I was asked was, “Do you have Canadian experience? What kind of Canadian experience do you have?” This time my answer to that question during the interview was, “Yes, I have experience in Canada,” and my experience was as a dishwasher. So my first job in Toronto in the year 1968 was as a janitor at the Toronto General Hospital.", "My determination in pursuing my education motivated me to study further, at the University of Toronto. I ended up getting three degrees from U of T. I was hired by the Catholic Children’s Aid Society of Toronto as a professional social worker after I was awarded an MSW degree from U of T. I felt so thankful for that position and to the Catholic Children’s Aid Society.", "By the way, I’d like to add that after being a dishwasher, janitor, all that, I felt so thankful that I got the job. I went to Catholic Children’s Aid as a social worker. I was the first social worker to arrive in that building, and I was the last worker who left the building in the evening. I’m sure the management appreciated my hard, good work. But one day my next-door neighbour approached me: “Hey, Raymond.” “Yes?” “I’d like to chat with you.” “Sure.” “It’s great you work so hard.” “Oh, thank you. You appreciate my good work.” “Yes. But you know what? You make all of us look so bad. Why do you work so hard?”", "I’m sorry, but I continued to work hard. I loved helping people, and because of my hard work and the generosity from management, I got a free scholarship at the U of T and finished my MSW and continued to study. Helping people is not easy, so I felt I needed more skill, more knowledge. And that’s how I ended up getting so many degrees.", "As I was working as a social worker at the children’s aid society, time and again I witnessed that more children from indigenous, immigrant and low socio-economic families were admitted compared to children of higher social and economic classes of families. Again, I was saddened to see how children and families from racialized, marginalized communities had no choice or less of a choice because they were trapped in the cycle of systemic discrimination.", "It was too much pressure for me to observe so many children from less fortunate families coming into the care of children’s aid. I finally left the CCAS in the early 1970s and got a new job as a school social worker with the Toronto school board. I also saw systemic racial discrimination imposed on the same students from a similar background—perhaps unintentionally, but nevertheless, it was there.", "In 1991, I got elected as a Metro Toronto city councillor, the first Canadian politician of Korean background. Working as a city councillor has allowed me to interact with a vastly diverse group of people from all over the world. This experience made me realize that individuals from marginalized communities need our help and our leadership so that they can escape the cycle of marginalization and discrimination.", "I have always stood up for the marginalized people of my community. After the horrible attacks on September 11 in the United States, I met with the Muslim people in my then ward and even got the police of 42 division involved in ensuring the safety of all Muslims and that their mosques would not be vandalized. I cannot thank 42 division enough for their dedicated work helping Muslim communities feel safe during that turbulent time.", "I understand that I’m not the only one who has faced discrimination, that many of us are still currently facing discrimination. I hope my story does not dispirit others, but instead empowers others to see that the system of racism can be broken. However, many of us have not gotten the opportunities that I have had and are still caught in the cycle of being discriminated against.", "Bill 114 is a step in the right direction towards combatting systemic racism. With Canada’s population becoming more diverse by the year, the need for an end to any form of racism needed to happen yesterday. However, we are not at this stage. Therefore, we must do our best as legislators to combat racism today so that the people of tomorrow can enjoy Ontario to the fullest, so that Ontario can become a role model for other provinces and so that Canada can be a role model for the world.", "We, as members of provincial Parliament, are seen as leaders in our respective communities. We must ensure that we bring the right message of acceptance and that we will stand up against discrimination and systemic racism.", "The need to end racism is persistent, especially when we look at our changing demographics. According to Statistics Canada, nearly one in two Canadians could be an immigrant or the child of an immigrant by 2036. If the current levels of immigration continue in the coming years, the proportion of immigrants in Canada’s population could reach between 24.5% and 30% in 2036. Combining immigrants and second-generation individuals, the percentage of Canada’s population in 2011 was 38.2%, which could be between 44.2% and almost 50% by 2036.", "The places immigrants are coming from are increasingly more diverse than 50 years ago. Canada has opened its doors to more people from vastly different cultures and societies, who practise different religions, faiths and beliefs. Moving forward, the diversity of Canada will only increase as time passes by.", "In my riding of Scarborough–Rouge River, you can hear languages from all corners of the world. You can see people practising different religions and faiths from all over the world. The diversity of my riding is one of the highest here in Ontario. I strongly believe that my riding of Scarborough–Rouge River is so great because of its diversity.", "I do not want to see the people from my riding or, as a matter of fact, any place here in Ontario or even Canada being discriminated against because of the way that someone is. I, like many others, came to Canada because we had a dream of settling here in this great country, getting a job, starting a family, adding back to our Canadian communities and calling Canada our home.", "Immigration and diversity are Canada’s and Ontario’s strengths and add to their cultures, communities and economies.", "Bill 114 is a step in the right direction; however, we must ensure that the delicate personal information the bill asks for from the people of Ontario is used in a safe, secure and proper way. We must ensure that the personal information that this bill asks for is not abused and is strictly used for ending systemic racism and other forms of racism.", "Bill 114 covers many good points, such as an intermittent review of the progress enforced by the bill. We, the legislators, know that bills and laws alone cannot change social behaviours and change our society. We need more efficient education for public servants, as well as the general public. We need to establish equal and fair employment practices that reflect and respect the characteristics of the diverse population and communities here in Ontario.", "Again, Mr. Speaker, I thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak on Bill 114. And I want to thank everyone, especially the minister, for their hard work on this very important step." ],

He talked about the overrepresentation of black youth in the system. I just want the member to know that in our three-year strategy, which is available online, on page 21 there’s a section on the farthest right that talks about One Vision, One Voice. It’s a project that we’ve committed to as a government, and it was a project that came about by bringing the black community together—we provided some funding—to look for ways to build a framework to better address some of the issues around overrepresentation and equity within child welfare reform. In fact, Mr. Speaker, in the piece of legislation that we put forward to reform child welfare, it actually acknowledges “systemic racism,” which I think is the first piece of legislation in the history of this province, if not this country, that actually uses that terminology in the actual legislation.", "In regard to the member from Kitchener–Waterloo, she made reference to the fact that this is long overdue. I believe that a lot of the work that we’re tackling today as a government is long overdue. I agree with that. But, you know, Mr. Speaker, I’ve been in this Legislature for six years, and I cannot remember anyone from the opposite side asking about an issue around the black youth and overrepresentation in CAS or about the youth violence that’s taking place in the streets of Toronto and across this province.

  "text" : [ "It’s a pleasure to stand in my place to debate and discuss government Bill 114, the Anti-Racism Act. In many respects, I have waited a long time to be a part of this debate, beginning as a school board trustee back in 2003, and prior to that as a school community adviser and settlement worker with the former Toronto Board of Education, where, quite honestly, helping navigate and facilitate the multicultural and diverse community into the school system was a valued role, because those supports were needed to address many of the obstacles.", "I am going to be talking about Kitchener–Waterloo and Waterloo region in general a little bit, just to give it some provincial context. I do want to say that I think in order to address systemic barriers and issues that we face on the racism file—because it is actually more prevalent today than it has ever been—I will say that we have to be honest about who we are. We have to look at our communities with our eyes wide open and be reflective about what’s happening in our community. And sometimes we have this sort of insulated opinion of our communities because we’re so proud to come from them. Our worlds are very different, and I will acknowledge that I am speaking from a position of privilege as a white woman who lives and works in Waterloo region.", "With that in mind, in 2009, Waterloo region made national headlines as the hate crime capital of Canada. This is something we don’t talk a lot about because we’ve done a lot of work since that point in time. The Waterloo Region Crime Prevention Council took notice of these numbers and organized a forum in 2014 called Breaking the Silence on Hidden Violence. Sometimes we don’t see racism as an act of violence, but I think there has to be a cultural shift, if you will, in that regard. The forum established a working group which seeks to create awareness of hate crimes in my community. While the working group is currently focused on LGBTQ-based hate crimes, their efforts highlight the proliferation of hate crime in Waterloo region.", "Since 2014, the number of reported hate crimes in Waterloo region has fallen, and a lot of work has gone into addressing the issue of hate crimes. However, we have to remember that one third of hate crimes go unreported, and that’s important.", "Waterloo region was host to one of nine community meetings led by the Anti-Racism Directorate in the fall. I don’t believe we were on the original list, but I want to thank the minister, because I did write a letter to him and made the point of saying, “While Waterloo region is one of the most innovative and collaborative communities in Ontario, incidents of racism continue to occur at a rate higher than other communities in Ontario and we can do better.” I think the conversations that we had at that meeting were significant. And to the point that we have to be honest about what’s happening, about the problems that exist in order to solve those problems, that was a good first step.", "Some of you may have heard, though, because there have been incidents—and from a disturbing perspective, there seems to be an acceleration. One has to only look to south of the border to see the tension, the divisiveness and the permissiveness around the language that political leaders are using in the United States, which really has infiltrated, I think, even emboldened, some inherent, racist feelings that people have.", "In 2015, a Hindu temple in Kitchener was vandalized. Five rocks were thrown through the windows of the temple. This happened two days after the terrorist attack in Paris. That’s my point: There is this very prolific but hidden sense of anger that people have when there are violent incidents that happen in other places, which transfers to our own communities. This happened, as I said, two days after the attack in Paris. Around the same time, Peterborough’s only mosque was deliberately burned down. These are points of shame for us.", "Before this act of vandalism, temple board member Vijay Solanki said that racial slurs had been painted on the temple wall in the past. After the vandalism, a group of GTA Muslims started an online campaign to raise money for the repairs at the Hindu temple, and in their fundraising campaign they said, “As Muslims we are quickly realizing that these hate crimes are not just affecting our community; it is not just our mosque being burned, or our people being attacked.” It takes a lot of courage to speak up in this way.", "We have an ongoing issue right now in Waterloo region. Part of the Muslim Association of Canada is looking to open up a Muslim prayer centre. You have to remember that Waterloo region was one of the number one draws for new immigrants and refugees—the fourth-largest draw for refugees and immigrants in Canada. Many people don’t know that. Our community is changing drastically. We look different; we sound different; we pray differently. Therefore, those religious institutions need to be reflective of the people who are coming into the region.", "However, in Waterloo region, there is an issue. I’ve said that there is a growing need for a prayer centre on the west side of Waterloo, which is home to more than 150 Muslim families. There was unreasonable pushback from the community; this project has received the most pushback of any project the association has undertaken, ever, in Waterloo region. Common sense should prevail. They would say the community is changing. We have had mosques; we have had gurdwaras; we do have temples. We should be adaptive to the changing religious demographics.", "Yet now, in 2017, we’ve seen some of the most vitriolic pushback to a small prayer centre on Erbsville Road, near Laurelwood Drive, in Waterloo. I’m going to quote from Luisa D’Amato’s piece from just March 29, so very recently. Here are some of the responses, because we have to be clear about what people are saying about Muslims in our community. They are saying, “You should be on a farm somewhere where no one can see you.” “This is going to bring more Muslim families to the neighbourhood, and that’s going to lower my house values.” “I hope this city stops the Muslim centre, and all other Muslim places [are] torn down.”", "There are others that I cannot speak of. I cannot repeat them because they are violent. They make me ashamed. The organizer of the prayer centre project, who also lives in the neighbourhood, said she couldn’t believe some of the comments that were made during the meeting earlier this month.", "The meeting was organized by the Muslim Association to offer more information to neighbours about the project, which still requires a zone change from city council. The association wasn’t required to host a meeting, but it did anyway, in order to be helpful.", "There were comments made by the association, the architect and the city of Waterloo planning official. After that, there was an opportunity for individual residents to approach the experts one on one and ask questions. More than 100 people attended, and there was an incident at this meeting where the sign-in sheets were ripped up. People responded with anger and with opinions which can only be based on fear, really—fear and racism. It has to be said that when you are saying things like this, these statements that I’ve just shared with you, those are racist statements. They must be called out for being racist.", "After the meeting was over, the organizer said that she wanted to be sick; she felt sick to her stomach. She couldn’t believe that these were the kinds of reactions. The organizer said that the prayer centre was proposed because it would help observant Muslims living nearby. They are required to pray five times a day, preferably in a group setting. The proposed centre would allow people to bike or walk over instead of driving a longer distance, and it would foster a sense of belonging for Muslims in the community.", "There doesn’t appear to be any valid reason for city of Waterloo council to deny the zone change. One of the councillors mentioned, “If our concern is about traffic,” which sometimes is a valid reason to deny a zone change, “that horse may have already left the barn.” We are growing so much, the traffic planning is really catching up to that kind of growth.", "Sadly, there was a comment made, and the columnist agrees. She says, “I think Lawendy is right when she says there would have been no opposition if a Christian church had made the request.” I think that’s very powerful.", "You know, we witness anti-Muslim bigotry all over the world. Let’s not think it can’t happen here. When one community doesn’t stand with the other communities, we are inherently allowing it. We’re permitting it; it’s permissive. And for those of you who don’t know how I stand on that issue, you now do. This small prayer centre: The zoning should pass. The centre should go up and people should welcome—we are all immigrants in this country except for the first peoples, and sometimes it seems that we’ve forgotten that, quite clearly.", "There are some really positive things happening, though. There is a response to some of the racist actions and words and feelings that people feel in the region. As a result, a positive anti-racism initiative has arisen from that. I always say that sometimes people discover that they are activists when they’re faced with a very conflicting perspective.", "Wilfrid Laurier University has an initiative to fight campus racism. This is something that I hope the minister pays attention to, because I did want to bring it to his attention. The Wilfrid Laurier University diversity and equity office recently published a report in March 2017—two weeks ago—calling for a new approach to promoting diversity and equity. That report concluded that simply promoting diversity and equity on campus is not enough. Essentially, it doesn’t suffice. It doesn’t shift a culture of an organization to promote diversity, to use positive diversity language.", "Laurier’s director of diversity and equity—her name is Laura Mae Lindo; she’s an amazing woman—said that campuses need programs, research and training that explicitly target racism, even if this is scarier and more difficult than promoting diversity or multiculturalism.", "The report calls for anti-racism training for senior administrators and faculty, as well as an online portal for sharing anti-racism resources.", "The report follows a summit in 2016, hosted by Laurier, which examined race and racism at Canadian university campuses. This was a national summit. A key take-away from the summit was summed up by Renu Mandhane, chief of the Ontario Human Rights Commission. She said, “It is not enough to simply react to an incident of racism after it happens.” And let’s be honest: That’s essentially what we do. We do. We react to racism, and sometimes we don’t react to it in a very productive way or a very effective way.", "Laurier hopes to take the lead in addressing issues of systemic racism on Canadian university campuses. I’m so proud of the work that they are doing. They are also tackling sexism on our campuses. These are very real issues that affect the culture of our universities, the academic success of the students and the working conditions, quite honestly.", "Laurier is hoping to establish a sector-wide approach to systemic racism. The report stresses the importance of collecting and analyzing data to measure change. For Laurier, not having accurate data is a huge challenge for doing anti-racism work on campus.", "I would say, with respect, that this will be the same issue for the minister. Good data informs good policy, but you have to be honest about the data that you’re collecting. You have to be transparent with the data. The data has to be processed in a way which actually makes it actionable.", "That is what Wilfrid Laurier University is doing, under the leadership of Laura Mae Lindo, who is Laurier’s director of diversity and equity. I commend them for doing that.", "The connecting piece with Bill 114 is that it enables the government to mandate race data collection and an anti-racism impact assessment framework in order to properly apply anti-racism perspectives to public sector policies and programs.", "I do feel that there will come a day, and there will come a time, when the language that we’re using around applying a gender lens to our budget—we may actually get to a point where we apply an anti-racist lens to our budget. When you look at the effect of where funding goes, where financial resources go in this province, that has impact on the success rates of marginalized communities, of the black community and certainly of First Nations communities.", "Federally, of course, we are looking at a long-standing, systemic, almost 33% less funding for education on reserves for First Nations children. How we can ever expect children to be successful when they don’t have access to the health care that they need, the social services, the mental health—and education, because when you get education right, almost everything else will come into place. Education obviously is a big part of this bill going forward.", "But we have to be, as I stated—which is why I’ve been so very clear about what’s happening in my own community, because my community is asking me very good questions about the Anti-Racism Directorate. They are asking, “How is the secretariat going to address the fact that there are violent incidents in Waterloo region? What is the mandate of the secretariat, and will that mandate be actionable for the minister?”", "We, of course, have urged the Ontario Human Rights Commissioner to task the secretariat with—sorry, the directorate—with undertaking broad consultations inside and outside government on how the government and the broader public sector can do more, because one of the things that we can do better in the province of Ontario is that our own government could be less racist. I know it’s quite a concept. But we could actually, in our hiring practices, for instance—yes, in our hiring practices, in the way that we allocate money to certain communities. What I’m saying is that the government, in all of its operational practices, should model the exact goals of what the Anti-Racism Directorate is proposing.", "I think that there’s a lot of work before us. I did mention in my preamble to the minister that there is some history, and he agreed that this is long overdue. I will reference the fact that we have been raising this issue of racism in the employment sector with the ongoing acceleration of marginalized communities, particularly here in Toronto, in part-time and precarious contract work. We see that very clearly as impacting negatively one community over another. Where funding is going, particularly in the province—and certainly our own critic, the member from London–Fanshawe, in her capacity raised this issue many times in this House. Collectively, we have a shared responsibility to ensure that the directorate actually is successful. In order to do that, we have to have very good data. I think that’s one of the strongest points that I can make. We have to understand what is actually happening in our community. We have to understand what’s happening in our schools. Why are there more black youth being expelled or suspended in our education system? That’s a good question, don’t you think? Why are there more black families who have their children taken into care? Why do we have more First Nations children in care in 2017 than we ever had in residential schools?", "What is the impact? And when you look through the lens of how racism and racist policy, or lack thereof, as the Wilfrid Laurier study has confirmed, being proactive around diversity is only half of the equation. The education piece, which is supported by effective policy and legislation, is part of the solution as well. I think that we all have a shared responsibility to make sure that the directorate and the mandate that the minister has (1) have the resources to be successful, and (2) know that this is an accountability and transparency exercise that could potentially change the entire province and have some sense of shared prosperity for all Ontarians. That’s what our collective goal should be." ],

As it stands, the three-year plan mentions certain communities and changes to our education system; however, it doesn’t mention Ontario’s Jewish community. So that’s one point I’d like to reiterate during this two-minute opportunity to speak to Bill 114.

Item 21 covered such comments as the way a person looks, their religion, their language and their name. It got to a point where people were sent home and disciplined for violating item 21 in our plant. What is good about item 21 is that—that was one of the first places in Canada that brought forward a program to stop racism in many different forms. And it can take many different forms. We were quite proud of that. Not only did it work in the workforce, but when those 12,000, 14,000 employees went home—not counting the salaried people, which was about 20,000 people in our plant—that would go into the broader community, and some of the lessons learned in that plant were taken home.

If he’s not, well, then I’ll just keep going.", "I do want to offer my remarks from the point of view of how this anti-racism strategy fits in with issues that indigenous peoples of Ontario face. It’s in that regard that I’m very happy that our guests, the youth council from Beausoleil First Nation and their chief, could join us today. They’re very interested in this issue, and they have some thoughtful and compelling insights into the issue that we’re debating today. I say to you, thank you for the meeting that we had earlier and for joining us this afternoon.", "Speaker, I was very pleased when the minister undertook this project—the minister responsible for the anti-racism secretariat. One of the first things that he did was to engage the Ministry of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation on this important work. He sought the advice of my ministry, he sought the advice of me personally, and he sought the advice of many indigenous and First Nation leaders in Ontario.", "I know that at the announcement of the event, which was held in Don Valley East, Regional Chief Day was there. Regional Chief Day gave a powerful speech on the very good work that this strategy is doing. He was particularly mindful that our government had fully engaged with indigenous people, particularly First Nation people, on what they thought the anti-racism strategy should look like.", "To make the point at that event announcing the strategy, in addition to Chief Day speaking, there was a powerful opening prayer by an elder.", "Then, in the booklet published by the Ontario government, A Better Way Forward: Ontario’s 3-Year Anti-Racism Strategic Plan, on page 27, there’s a very clear statement, and I want to read this into the record:", "“The Ministry of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation has a mandate to strengthen relationships with indigenous communities and institutions, improve socio-economic conditions, facilitate economic sustainability, resolve land claims and promote reconciliation. Since its establishment, the Ministry of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation has been working to build stronger relationships with First Nations, Métis and Inuit peoples to improve socio-economic outcomes and support the overall goal of reconciliation.”", "The overall goal of reconciliation: An important component of that goal is dealing with racist stereotypes that have developed over the last 200 years, probably particularly over the last 100 years. If one reads through the truth and reconciliation report, Mr. Justice Sinclair—or Senator Sinclair, as he now is—dealt with this issue of stereotyping. “Stereotyping” is a softer word, I suppose, or a gentler word for a harder reality, and that harder reality is racism.", "From the First Nations, from the indigenous point of view, how do we deal with that? We have an obligation to fully integrate the indigenous community into all aspects of life in Ontario, whether it’s in economic development, health care, education, our political life, whether it’s at the provincial level or the municipal level. It’s only by full integration that we can tackle these issues of racism. It’s that profound work that the Ministry of Indigenous Relations, working with the anti-racism secretariat, is tackling.", "Further, in the report that I just quoted earlier, on page 46, there is an item entitled—I do want to speak about this—“Indigenous Cultural Competency Training.”", "“The government is implementing mandatory indigenous cultural competency and anti-racism training for every employee in the Ontario public service. The training will include topics such as terminology, diversity, aspects of colonial history such as residential schools and Indian hospitals, and contexts”—this is the important piece—“for understanding social disparities and inequities. It will also include a focus on violence against indigenous women.”", "With respect to that last sentence focused on violence against indigenous women, I have visited over 90 First Nations in Ontario. I’ve had many conversations with indigenous men and women, elders, youth and the middle-aged. One of the really nasty, venomous pieces of racism that floats in some quarters and has in the past is this idea that indigenous women who have been murdered or beaten or assaulted or raped have somehow brought it on themselves because it’s inherent in the femininity of indigenous women. That is an ugly, nasty piece of racism that has to be rooted out and is being rooted out. But we still have work to do in that regard.", "I also want to speak to another issue that’s covered in the booklet. I’ll just read it. I want to put this into the record too. I’m thinking of this now from the point of view of indigenous peoples:", "“A lot went into government because they wanted to make a change. And they are afraid to speak out. They’re afraid that it’s going to be a career-limiting move, because what happens is that you become targeted. What happens is that you become marginalized. What happens is that you are characterized as the aggressor, as the problem.”", "That is an issue that is particularly prevalent in attitudes towards the indigenous community. If the indigenous community raises a concern, voices an objection, points to an area of racism, points to negative stereotyping, they’re often pounced on and told, “Well, you’re exaggerating. You’re making this up. You’ve got some other motive on this. You’re chasing down money or chasing down compensation.” Again, it’s that sort of inherent racism that we have to stamp out.", "I come back to this idea of the indigenous cultural competency training. Every person in the Ontario public service—whether it’s a janitor, a deputy minister, a minister, everybody in between—all approximately 60,000 public servants and anyone employed in the Ontario public service will take this cultural competency training. It’s a computer program, an online program and it’s interactive.", "I know that many of us are doing it. I’m about three quarters of the way through it. It takes a number of hours. Even when I went through it and started looking at some the comments and questions when you go into the online program that raise questions about your own assumptions, it is really surprising how subtle racism can be. I think one of the great things that the government has done is this cultural competency training that I know we are all looking forward to.", "In closing, I want to reiterate again, from the indigenous relations point of view, that the program, the three-year anti-racism strategic plan, A Better Way Forward, was informed by 10 public meetings in all four regions of the province.", "What is particularly important here is that submissions to the Anti-Racism Directorate that the minister particularly asked for included indigenous representatives at those meetings who put forward their points of view, their issues, drew attention to the subtleties of this inherent racism, and made suggestions on how it can be dealt with.", "Thank you, Speaker. I’m going to share the remainder of my time with the Minister of Transportation." ],

I guess I would start by referencing that I believe, and I’m quite certain that every member in this House believes as well, that the minister who is responsible for this legislation, the minister responsible for the Anti-Racism Directorate, has done some incredible work with respect to putting this legislation together and bringing it forward. It is, in many respects, unprecedented legislation. It’s a very clear indication of how that minister, our Premier and our government feel extremely passionate about this particular issue, this particular topic.", "I would also say that we’ve heard here today in the Legislature from members in both opposition parties who feel a similar passion with respect to making sure that we get this legislation right, that we strike the right balance and that we find creative ways to work together to move the province forward on issues relating to equality, on issues relating to all of those things that matter to the people who I’m very proud to represent in my community of Vaughan, which I know would be held, with respect to the values, in similar ways by people who live in every corner of this province.", "I wanted to say right off the top to that minister, the minister responsible for the Anti-Racism Directorate, the minister who is also responsible for children and youth services, that he has done fantastic work. It’s not surprising that he would have been able to put together this legislation, not only because of his enthusiasm and his own particular hard-working approach to these kinds of initiatives.", "But to go through some of the work that was undertaken by that minister and his team with respect to the consultations that occurred right across the province—I know it has been mentioned here, but I think it bears repeating that since its establishment, the Anti-Racism Directorate has held 10 open, public meetings between July and December 2016. Through social media, through conversations with that minister and other colleagues of ours who had the opportunity to attend a number of the meetings that took place, the turnout was phenomenal. We literally saw hundreds and hundreds of Ontarians from every different community, from every different aspect of the incredible fabric that works together to make this province of ours so extraordinary. Literally more than 2,500 people attended the Anti-Racism Directorate public meetings between July and December 2016, in Toronto, Hamilton, Mississauga, Scarborough, Sudbury, Kitchener, London, Thunder Bay, Windsor and Ottawa, and an additional more than 2,000 participated in the public meetings via live-streaming online.", "I will say, as the Minister of Transportation, someone who has had the opportunity to be in this portfolio for close to the last three years—I’ve done town hall meetings myself on the issue of transportation, and in many communities the turnout has been considerable—that I’m actually literally blown away by the exceedingly large turnout numbers we saw with respect to the public consultations, the feedback that we received, that helped to create Bill 114. This literally, and understandably, brought hundreds and hundreds of Ontarians out, because there is such interest and there is such passion in making sure that we get this right in this bill.", "I know that others have talked at length about some of the elements of the bill. I think it’s also important for us to take into account, when we move forward with legislation, that we learn from some of the unfortunate—I’ll use the term “mistakes,” Speaker—circumstances that have given rise to the need for this legislation.", "I don’t think there is anybody in this chamber—I sincerely would like to believe that’s the case—that doesn’t want us to move forward in this particular direction, but we have to remember—this is not a partisan comment: I recognize that governments are not perfect. I don’t think the people that we represent expect their governments to be perfect. But we have to take great care to make sure that as we move forward, particularly in the global environment that we find ourselves in right now, where people from right around the world seem to feel an increased freedom or an increased licence to perhaps lash out and behave in ways that just a few years ago we wouldn’t necessarily have found to be particularly acceptable—maybe that’s the advent of social media. Maybe it’s something else, some other phenomenon that none of us knows or can point to specifically.", "I think, particularly in the context in which we find ourselves today, we have to remember that we cannot afford on these issues to go backwards. We cannot afford to do things in a way that wouldn’t keep moving these issues forward in a manner that’s consistent with the values held by the people of Ontario.", "We find ourselves in a position today to move forward because a number of years ago the people of this province saw the Anti-Racism Directorate dismantled by a former government, and in that case it was the Conservative government. This is not a partisan comment, because governments aren’t expected necessarily to be perfect. I point that out just to say that, as we go forward with Bill 114, as we go forward hopefully to pass this legislation—and I expect and I certainly hope that we will—we have to take great care so as not to repeat mistakes that perhaps Legislatures and other governments have made in the past; I just wanted to point that out.", "Now, I know that the Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation spoke at length about some of the particular elements of the bill, and I don’t want to necessarily repeat because that minister always does a fantastic job of speaking in a very eloquent way and articulating in this case the provisions of this bill that would help with respect to lifting up our First Nations in this province, which I think is great news and everybody here would support.", "With some of my remaining time I would only point out that—I say this often when I have the chance to participate in debate in the Legislature. Many who are here will know that I have a couple of young children at home. My daughters are nine and five. Actually, just in a few days our five-year-old will turn six. When I think about all of the initiatives that we are undertaking—not just as a Liberal government but as parliamentarians—whether it’s coming via government policy or whether it’s coming through private members’ business or flowing from opposition members, we are all involved in this phenomenal enterprise of helping to build a province up.", "We may have challenges and we may have points of disagreement between the three parties because of our own philosophical moorings or our foundations. We may have points of disagreement around whether building a highway in a particular location, putting up traffic lights in another community, building transit in a particular community in a certain way, using one transit technology versus another, balancing a budget in one year versus another year, building 100,000 child care spaces perhaps versus building fewer, building a school in a particular way, using a delivery model for procurement.", "Speaker, these are all very understandable points of disagreement as it relates to policy. Of course, I’m a very proud Liberal and a very proud Liberal MPP. We on this side have a very particular perspective around how to move forward on these important policies. I think that we see evidence of that in a number of the initiatives that our Premier and our team have brought forward over the last four years, and in fact over the last 14 years with a number of the initiatives that we brought forward.", "But where I would like to believe, and I sincerely in my heart of hearts do believe, that there is no significant room for disagreement—again, I’m thinking of my daughters, thinking of the pages, thinking of the tens of thousands of young women and men who live in every corner of this province and who have an expectation of us that we will find ways to work together on legislation, particularly legislation that, when you look at it, truly embodies the values that are right at the heart of what a province or what a country is supposed to be about, because they’re infused with values that I believe as Ontarians we all hold equally and we all hold dearly.", "This is legislation that I believe should move forward. It is of critical importance. When my nine-year-old and my soon-to-be-six-year-old are of voting age, when they’re in their forties, like I am now, I think that they will look back to this particular moment and will understand that people in this chamber, the 107 of us, came together and moved forward with legislation like Bill 114 because we had an expectation and a desire to build a more inclusive and fairer society for the people of Ontario.", "I would call on members in all three caucuses to support Bill 114, to work with our Premier and our government to build the kind of province that I know my daughters and others like them deserve for many, many years to come. I look forward to the discussion on this legislation over the course of the rest of the debate." ],

It was published on March 7, 2017. It’s available online and we certainly encourage all to read the strategy.

As a caucus, we recently went through some anti-oppression training. That’s why I referenced the position that I speak from, which is a position of privilege as being a white woman in the province of Ontario. But I must tell you, Senator Beyak should have got some training before she issued very harsh, critical, racist comments about the indigenous community in this country.", "I will also say that one of the main recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation report—which I have favoured and about which I’ve put a question on the order paper to the Minister of Education—has to do with education. I will quote a First Nations chief, Obomsawin, who said that she was appalled by how Canadian history was taught: “I had recognized that it was really designed to create hate towards our people.”", "I will tell you, as a mother of a 16-year-old daughter who’s in the education system in grade 10 and learning about the history of this country and this province, because we’ve talked about this at home, that she’s not getting the full picture. She’s not getting the full picture of our history and how we have dealt with indigenous communities. I will tell you that today’s youth are hungry for the truth, and they deserve it. It needs to be reflected in our curriculum. If we can get that part going and accelerate that piece, we will be a stronger province going forward." ],

I think that should be our focus when we look at legislation like this, so that, going forward, we can teach our youth how to live in a diverse society and the importance of learning about other cultures and other religions, so that we can live together in a harmonious way, and so that kids know that there is no acceptance of any form of racism or prejudice against their friends. They will grow up in a better society as a whole because they know these things. This goes to show that we are intolerant towards any form of racism in our province. I think that this legislation is going to make our whole province a better province, especially for our youth. Our youth are so important.", "Coming from a school board, I know how hard it is when kids fight with each other because of racial issues that they may face, and how parents can become involved in these battles. We want to teach them right from the start that it’s important for kids not to worry about the colour of somebody’s skin or what somebody may be eating or why it’s different than what they may be doing.

  "text" : [ "Thank you, Speaker.", "It gives me great pleasure to speak on behalf of Patrick Brown and the PC caucus regarding anti-racism, anti-Semitism, anti-Muslim bigotry and, of course, the systemic discrimination of Ontario’s indigenous population.", "Hate is hate, Speaker. Our party has said that many times. Hate of all kinds needs to be condemned, whether it is vandalism, violence, or even the subtle digs and/or strange looks that those who are racialized experience. I can tell you that I have seen, in recent events, proof that hate of all forms exists.", "I believe I’ve told the House on different occasions that I was born and raised in Essex county, just south of Windsor, Ontario, and grew up down there. I went to high school down there. We were just across the river from Detroit. We went to school with boys and girls of the black race, and we didn’t seem to have some of these problems that we are talking about here today. As children, if we had issues, we settled them ourselves, whether it was outside at school or—and sometimes it got a little rough, but we settled our disputes ourselves and we got along quite famously.", "But I look back to the 1950s and 1960s, and I’m old enough to remember some of these things. Most of our television came from Detroit and we were watching what was going on in the United States. It wasn’t nice. It was terrible. The black people were being treated terribly. They were segregated. They couldn’t go to white schools; they couldn’t go into restaurants that white people used. They couldn’t travel on a bus unless it was at the back.", "I never really understood why that was going on, because I was just a young fellow and, like I say, we didn’t have those experiences, that I can remember, where I was born and raised. It came to a head in Selma, Alabama, and they had terrible race riots down there. Then Martin Luther King started speaking out. We saw some of his broadcasts—very passionate—that we are all equal and it wasn’t fair what was going on in the United States at that time. He met much resistance.", "I believe some of that resistance was based on fear. The white population feared—I don’t know why, but they feared that they were being taken over by the black race, but they weren’t. The black race just wanted a fair shake. They just wanted to be able to prosper and grow up as anybody else would.", "I do study history a bit. I’m mostly interested in military history of the 20th century. I saw a program on television one night. It was about the Tuskegee Airmen. Anybody who has seen this documentary—it’s quite interesting. The Tuskegee Airmen were a black squadron of fighter pilots. They were formed during World War II. The powers that be in the army air corps at that time were hoping they were all going to fail. They didn’t believe that the black airmen had the qualifications or the will to fight that the white population was supposed to have. But they succeeded. They succeeded in that they were able to form a squadron—and they were stationed in Italy. Their purpose was to guard the bombers that were flying into Germany and other parts of the Third Reich bombing missions, because they were being shot down at a terrible rate. So they gave the Tuskegee Airmen the job of protecting the American bombers, and they did very well at it. They were tenacious, they were great fighter pilots. They gave them proper airplanes to use; they flew Mustangs at that time.", "Their reputation was quite renowned, but only in the black communities. It wasn’t until a bomber crash-landed in Rimini, Italy, where these airmen were stationed—the pilots got out of this bomber, they were all okay—and that was the first time they realized they were being protected by a black squadron. They got along famously, they got along as comrades in arms should, and that’s generally what happened in World War II and in previous wars and wars since. Once you’re under fire, once you’re in battle, you fight for your fellow soldier and try to protect him as much as he would protect you. There were about 200 of these pilots that were killed over there, so they were in the thick of battle.", "One of the saddest parts of the story is when they came home. A lot of these soldiers and airmen came home in the same boat. They sailed into New York harbour, they went by the Statue of Liberty. When they got off the boat, they started disembarking, and it was black folks this way, white folks this way. The black pilots were devastated, because they thought, they had fought this war together, they lost many people. They thought maybe it was over with—the discrimination—but it wasn’t. They were not allowed to go to any of the parties that the white folks were at. It was very devastating to these people.", "I guess what I’m trying to get at here is this business of anti-racism has been here for a long time. It’s been something that’s festering and has festered for a long time. We do see, certainly, in some parts of the world, that people are getting along better than they used to, especially in the United States, I think we can say that—where you look at the armed forces in the United States, they’re fully integrated, everybody has a chance of doing the same job if they qualify for it, and that’s gratifying.", "I want to go back, actually, to 1967, when my father and mother bought the dairy farms up by Monkton, Ontario. That was the year of the riots in Detroit—1967. It was in July of 1967. Across the river, where we were on the Canadian side, you could hear the gunfire. You could see the fires burning. It was quite a devastating time. Again, this race business festered. It was terrible, just terrible.", "Now we get up to modern times, and it’s still here. Why is racism still here? I’m not a scholar; I’m not smart enough to give you all the reasons. You would think, from lessons learned in the past, that we should, as a society, be able to condemn this and be able to get rid of it, but it’s still here.", "We have this bill presented to us, An Act to provide for Anti-Racism Measures. Really, it’s a bill that tries to address the situation that is happening right now. It’s really too bad that it has to be introduced, because you would think that in a modern society, as we are in, we wouldn’t have to. We shouldn’t have to deal with this type of thing.", "The MPP from Thornhill introduced into the Legislature a motion to reject BDS, the BDS movement, which was an important gesture to Ontario’s vibrant Jewish community. Why do we have to do those things? We shouldn’t have to do them, but we do.", "MPP Todd Smith crafted the Ontario Tamil Heritage Month bill.", "Of course, you, sir, were responsible for the Emancipation Day Act, recognizing Ontario’s role in helping the enslaved and the oppressed.", "Even Mr. Shurman was successful in the Legislature at condemning Israeli Apartheid Week.", "I don’t want to just stand here and say that I’ve seen it all, because I haven’t, but I think I’ve been around enough to wonder why people have to do these things. We see what is going on over in Syria right now—race hatred for each other.", "In Perth–Wellington, in my own community of Stratford, which is the largest city that we have in the riding, we have welcomed people from other countries. I’m proud to say that there hasn’t been as much racism—that I have heard of—in our community.", "We actually have a group that gets together once or twice a month. There’s a couple of hundred of them, and they come from all different backgrounds, all different races. Geza Wordofa is the fellow who put this together. He’s from Ethiopia. He was educated in Russia and received his university degrees in Russia, and then immigrated to Canada. He actually worked for the United Nations at one point.", "I believe he told me he had about 250 people involved, and they’re people from Spanish-speaking countries, Muslim communities, and different countries from around the world. His work is to get them settled in our area, to try to help them find work, and help them with the language, of course, but also, he has cultural events where they all get together. I’ve been to them a couple of times. One time, he’ll have, say, the Muslim community get together. You eat the food that they eat from whatever countries they’re from. The next time, you’ll have Polynesian people, Filipino people, and they’ll bring their food. It’s kind of interesting to see these things.", "But they all want one thing: They all want to live in this country, and they all want to get along. I believe that most of Ontario certainly wants that to happen too.", "I think that as legislators, certainly if there’s this problem out there—and there is—we have to deal with it. We have to try to bring forth the best legislation we can and be fair to everybody.", "You would know, Mr. Speaker, that if someone or some group deems that this isn’t fair to them, then we will have difficulties getting it passed or getting them to agree with what we are trying to do.", "I went to a number of Vimy Ridge celebrations, remembrance ceremonies, this weekend. It was interesting, some of the pictures I saw of different cultures that fought with the Canadian troops in World War I in different ways. It brought a lot of people together who, today in Ontario, we see being discriminated against, and that’s too bad.", "It shouldn’t be happening. We can’t afford it. It’s hard on your economy, because if children of a certain race are not feeling welcome, then they don’t do good in school. They probably won’t get the jobs that they’re after, or won’t have the opportunities to get these jobs because they’re discouraged. They have a feeling that they’re not wanted sometimes.", "Toronto has such a diverse community. Ontario can’t afford to let this happen. They bring so much to the culture—and not only culture, but they bring so much to Ontario as far as being able to help our economy. They want to work, and they want to work hard, because they came from places where the best conditions weren’t there for a long life.", "It is very heartbreaking to hear the stories that some of these people have had to endure in the countries they’ve come from. But they get over here, and it’s like the land of opportunity for them. They want to work; they want to play; they want to be safe. Part of being safe is certainly not having to undergo any kind of racial discrimination.", "Speaker, I believe I’ve come to the end of my talk here.", "I think that there are certainly good and bad parts, and parts of the bill that maybe need improvement. I would ask that the government consider in committee that the plan does not focus only on the black, indigenous and Muslim communities. It focuses on that, but it is very weak on protections for the Ontario Jewish population, which both the 2011 census and the Toronto police hate crimes unit say is the community which is the most targeted by hate in the province. Anti-Semitism runs deep and should be acknowledged along with the other targeted groups in a similar vein in the three-year plan.", "The three-year plan also mentions specific tables for certain communities and changes to our education system which are not explicitly mentioned in the legislation and, again, which exclude Ontario’s Jewish community.", "Finally, there is a concern with the privacy measures outlined throughout the bill itself. With the collection of private information on race-based incidents, the government must take great care to ensure there aren’t privacy breaches. The Ontario PC caucus is most interested in learning how the government intends to protect from these breaches." ],

The Canadian Nationalist Front was there. Of course, they believe that all people of colour should be deported from Canada. This was a small group of men who rallied in contrast to an Islam awareness talk. I was so proud to see some of the community stand up against that hatred and focus on the safety.", "Following that story in the Peterborough Examiner, there was a columnist, a woman by the name of Kelly McDowell, who wrote that “Racism is All Around Us.” But she was almost relieved to see this visual of white supremacy, because she experiences it each and every day, and she says, “It has come out of hiding”—racism—“so … now we can start having some real conversations” and address the practices and address the inequities.", "She goes on to say, “Our economy, political system”—for sure our political system—“and culture, in general, have been founded on racist practices,” and that, by default, we are all implicated.", "She goes on: “This difficult work is what is before each and every one of us. With patience and compassion, we must” go forward.", "I raise this issue of what happened in Peterborough because it’s right there under the surface, and we have to be honest about it in this province in order to address the issue of racism." ],

I want to talk a little bit about a story that my dad always tells us.", "When he was first elected to the House of Commons in 1993, he says, he was standing by the eternal flame one day, and somebody came up to him and said, “Where’s your taxi today?” He looked at them. He says, “I just looked. I stood there for a minute and I thought to myself, ‘Is this man really insinuating that just because I’m a turbaned Sikh and I’m standing in front of the eternal flame, I’m here to drive a cab and to drive people around?’” He said, “You know, I didn’t even have the energy to answer that. I turned around and I said to them, ‘Oh, I’m off today.’” And he said, “I laughed and I walked away, because I had become so used to this ignorance.” He goes, “I knew where I had come and where I had come from. It was a matter of pride for me to be who I was, but it didn’t matter whether or not somebody recognized it.”", "It’s sad to see that that was the type of ignorance, that less than 20 years ago, this was what people thought. They marginalized a group of people to be a taxi driver, to be in the trucking community. And do you know what? I would honestly say that it’s hard work. We should believe in hard work and the ethic of hard work regardless of what somebody does. It shouldn’t be a sign of disrespect to say that this is what you do for a living. Anybody who earns a hard day’s living should be proud of what they do.", "I want to say that racism impacts us all. It impacts all of our lives in some way or form, and I’m so glad that this piece of legislation is on the floor today, because we’re going to work together to make our province a better place to live." ],

But we had something a little bit different in the fact that the majority of the settlers that came were Catholic, which was unusual because it was illegal to be of the Catholic religion in Scotland at the time. But it was a reward for fighting beside the British.", "So there was that animosity between the two, and some battles.

One year back in, I guess, the 1920s, it was led by a priest who was playing the pipes. Of course, that raised some eyebrows, as you can imagine. And one of the members who was organizing it said, “You know, he was good enough in the trenches to help our boys. He is good enough today to lead our parade.” It shows how you can get over some of these prejudices. But it sometimes takes a long time, far too long.", "Of course, over our history, if you go back into northern Europe, many, many battles were fought, and it takes a long time to forget.

It was way ahead of its time, not expected, and it was very, very controversial at the time: All in the Family. But it showed Americans how racism existed.

Certainly, back in 1991, I think, under the NDP government, that was originally when the Ontario Anti-Racism Secretariat was introduced.", "I was thinking about what I was going to talk about, beyond my constituency experiences. In the work that I did over the years with the Ontario Nurses’ Association, some things changed greatly around racialized people, and some things haven’t changed very much.", "I’ll use a couple of examples. For many years, I did organizing of nurses into the Ontario Nurses’ Association, into a union. Depending on where you were doing that work—I worked across the province. In Toronto, in an organizing drive, you would see many racialized nurses coming together to join a union and participate in an organizing drive. But I will use McMaster in Hamilton—it was probably 20 years ago that we organized that hospital. I think there were 800 nurses eligible to vote. I was at McMaster on that day for the entire 12 or 14 hours of the vote. There were only a handful of nurses—I would say 80% of them showed up for that vote, but only a handful were not white-skinned—in Hamilton, just 70 kilometres away from downtown Toronto, where you would see, in a vote here, perhaps, the exact opposite.", "I remember, in my early days of nursing—as will the Minister of Natural Resources—working in smaller communities, that the vast majority of racialized nurses would have been Filipino. Many Filipino nurses came to Canada and worked in the hospitals for the most part. Even then, 40 years ago, there was a struggle with the way some of those nurses were treated. Fortunately, they worked in a unionized environment for the most part, and they had a voice when those kinds of issues happened.", "This last year, I had a lot of interaction with the not-for-profit Saint Elizabeth, in a home care setting, and met a number of personal support workers, registered nurses and RPNs over the last year. Some of them expressed to me that racism is still alive, even in health care. Some of them experienced that from their patients, their clients and their families, in people’s homes and going out into retirement homes, where they’re supporting people with personal care. They are still experiencing that today, even though there have been a lot of awareness campaigns and a lot of work done in many communities.", "I think it depends on where you live in the province as well. Where I live, for many, many years, the vast majority of people who lived in my riding—Welland, Port Colborne, Thorold, Wainfleet—probably 95% of the people were white-skinned. When we started to become quite multicultural, and people started to arrive from Somalia and Mexico and Haiti, you certainly had to do some work in the communities to start to have some acceptance and some integration there.", "I wanted to speak about some of the issues that have recently happened in my community, which I think are important for people to hear. I think it was in March or maybe February that we had a break-in in my community of Port Colborne. Port Colborne is a small community of only about 20,000 people. It happened in broad daylight and over the course of 45 minutes. There was a family, the Benner family—this is all public knowledge—who live on a small farm just outside of Port Colborne, which is near the Welland Canal on Lake Erie, in the Niagara region, about 150 kilometres south of Toronto. It’s a long, unpaved laneway up to the Benner house.", "At first, the father, Tim, thought that it was just a regular break-in in the middle of the day, when nobody was home, but when he went in he found his furniture trashed, his computers stolen and his walls spray-painted. Three hours into a police investigation, officers alerted him to a message written on the wall of his daughter Ruby’s room. Ruby is, I think, 16 years old, a high school student. Someone had spray painted “N-word lover” in large letters.", "The family was just devastated by this. They were so shaken up. They recounted stories of the immediate shock afterward, where they simply just sat on the bed and cried together as a family. They weren’t even sure whether they should show their daughter the messages, but eventually they realized that it needed to be brought out and brought forward to let the children and to let the community know that this was happening and that it wasn’t right.", "Worse, they knew that it was someone who knew their family and, specifically, someone who knew the daughter Ruby. Now, Ruby happened to be dating a young black boy, who was 16 as well. His name is Jayden. They were both grade 10 students at Lakeshore Catholic High School, and they had been dating for about six months.", "When talking to the media about how they were coping, Jayden, the young man, said, “Some nights, she’s crying and I'm just trying to say it’s all right.” But, despite this, Jayden still hopes, he proceeded to say: “I just think to myself not everyone is racist or not everyone thinks of me different, or her, because she’s dating a different colour.”", "The truth is, it’s hard not to think about how this incident will forever change and affect young people’s futures.", "Jayden had been experiencing racism. He played hockey in the community. Even at hockey games and at practices, he was experiencing harassment, but he hadn’t told anyone about it. He’d been experiencing it from parents of other hockey players, calling him names on the ice if he happened to score or if he happened to get a puck off of some other kid. He was experiencing this, but he was just kind of brushing it off. And then this incident happened.", "His mom, Shannon Hannigan, described how Jayden no longer wanted to go to school, he didn’t want to play hockey, and he didn’t even want to leave the house anymore. And, really, that’s not fair to a child who really should only be concerned about what he’s going to do on a Friday night. Shannon, the mother, was worried that they’ve robbed her family and that they’ve robbed her child of his innocence, which can never be restored.", "She’s right, and that’s why we actually need some legislation here in the province of Ontario. We need investments in our social programming to educate, to collect data, to understand where the gaps are and how to fill them to make sure that stories like Jayden and Ruby’s never happen again.", "Niagara regional police were very quick to call it a hate crime. In 2016, Niagara regional police reported that there were 10 similar cases in the Niagara region. We only have about 450,000 to 480,000 people in Niagara, and not one of these cases has actually resulted in any charges. That really makes it difficult for families and for individuals to accept: that these hate crimes are actually going on, but the police are unable to lay charges because they can’t find out who the people actually are.", "Charges and convictions for hate crimes are rare for a number of reasons. Studies show that the police many times aren't effectively trained on what to look for, and, according to more studies, hate crimes are almost always a matter of interpretation. They’re difficult to argue in court in terms of the burden of proof required for any convictions.", "In Niagara, we have a great anti-racism coalition called the Niagara AntiRacism Coalition. Earlier this month, around this incident of the Benners and the Hannigans, within a very short period of time—I would say it was just a matter of a couple of days—this coalition actually pulled together hundreds of students, parents and teachers, who all came out to the Guild Hall in my riding, in Port Colborne, to support both of the families and to send a loud message out to the community that this was unacceptable, that it wasn’t going to be tolerated. Hopefully, we’ve not seen any more incidents there in Port Colborne at this point.", "It was organized by the Niagara AntiRacism Coalition, an initiative started, actually, by one of my part-time staff in her spare time and a group of dedicated local organizers. But it is a reminder that you can get 400 people out to a rally through social media and a little reporting in the local newspaper; that people really do care about this issue and they want their community to be supportive. And it’s a reminder that, despite the bigotry and the racism, communities will come together, they will support each other, they will stand up; they will send a loud message that it’s unacceptable and it will not be tolerated.", "Many described it as an act of hatred that turned into an act of kindness and community solidarity and support.", "I just wanted to do a shout-out to these two young people that their community is supporting them and there are avenues for them to go to if this reoccurs or if they need support in any way." ],

  "text" : [ "Yes, they sure are.", "The other thing that happened in my community back a couple of months ago as well was a devastating reminder of the urgent need for this anti-racism legislation, in an incident that occurred in our community and certainly too close to home, involving two young women, Bilkis Al-haddad and Mahabba Ahmed. These two women were in their car and they were headed to the mosque in St. Catharines for Friday afternoon prayer. The two women were each wearing the hijab—a head scarf that covers the hair and the neck—and they were close to the mosque when they watched a 20-something female driver next to them roll down her window, turn in their direction and shout to these two women, “Go back home.”", "Mahabba is a Canadian-born Muslim, but describes that it’s not the first time that she’s been on the receiving end of hateful words. What the woman driver and her female passengers could not have known is that Bilkis has already experienced unimaginable pain in her life. Three of her four children—Qamer, Ahmed and Nabil—died in a fire at their home in July 2002. She is still struggling with the death of these three kids, but yet we have these women driving in a car sending hate messages to this woman.", "Her only surviving son, Mohammed, who was 12 at the time, escaped the fire by climbing out a window and on to the roof. He is now a political science student at Brock University.", "She is a single mother. She works as a personal support worker; she helps the sick and elderly in this province. During her time off, she throws her heart into a charitable organization she started in honour of her three kids. The mission of her foundation is that it helps and supports the youth in the community.", "So imagine this woman, who has lost three children in a fire, is able to do this charitable work, go to work every day in a tough job—it’s a slug job being a personal support worker; lots of heavy, tiring work. But she still finds time to go out and support the youth in her community. Yet on that day, being visibly Muslim, none of that could have shielded her from the hateful remarks of those women.", "The young women did what most Muslims are advised to do. They ignored it; don’t engage; confront that ignorance with education. So she did just that. She actually went out and she spearheaded an event designed to promote peace and clear up misconceptions about Islam and Muslims. The name of that event, Je Suis Moi, was taken from the Je Suis Charlie slogan that spread around the world as a message of freedom of speech after 12 people died in a shooting at the French newspaper Charlie Hebdo in Paris. It is a message, “I am me,” of universal peace that’s intended not to let the horrific actions of a few tarnish an entire community.", "The Al Noor mosque also opened their doors in the last few months, following recent events in my community, in St. Catharines. The mosque itself was built on the values of diversity and acceptance. The entire community represents people from over 25 nationalities. They host open houses. They offer school tours. They collaborate on events with other faith groups in the area, including church visits. During Ramadan, they invited community leaders to breakfast with them at sunset. A few years ago, following an attack on a young woman—once again in Niagara—walking home from the mosque, they responded by mailing out over 1,000 pamphlets across Niagara region dispelling myths about their faith.", "This is one or two women going out and doing the work in the community.", "The most recent vigil that we attended in Niagara—I’m sure many of you attended those in your communities as well—was around the recent shooting in Quebec City. I had the honour of attending a candlelight vigil at the same mosque in St. Catharines, which saw over 500 people. The government whip will remember we were there and said a few words. The area out in front of city hall was packed with people coming together from all faiths to support and send a message that this would not be tolerated. It, too, was organized by the Niagara AntiRacism Coalition in collaboration with the mosque, and there was an enormous show of support by our communities, which came together at that vigil. We had, I believe, all levels of government represented there, from municipal right up to federal. There was an enormous show of support. We came together not just to mourn the deaths of the people in Quebec City, but to show how united we were, how non-partisan we can be in tragic times like these.", "The next day, this mosque in very short order organized a special event for World Hijab Day, inviting community members and friends to come to the mosque to try on a head scarf and even take one away for the day to wear, if you chose to do so. It was organized as well by the foundation and the Islamic Society of St. Catharines as a way to educate, inform and strengthen friendships and relationships with the community.", "Those are just a few of the things that have been happening in the Welland riding, but we also have issues beyond just the issues of racism. We have a number of issues that have come into my office around the LGBTQ community where we’ve had to call the police in to try to deal with some of these neighbour-to-neighbour issues. Two women moved into a neighbourhood and they were being harassed on a daily basis, as was their son, by a couple of people in the neighbourhood. To date they’re still living there—but once again, I don’t know how much education police actually get to deal with this. I don’t know how much money is in the budget to have an officer specifically assigned to these issues and to perhaps do some training. It can become problematic when people feel like they need to move out of their neighbourhood because they’re being harassed in many different ways.", "While the bill is good and it’s a good step, there are some areas that we think are lacking, and we don’t think that it goes far enough. The NDP, our caucus, is actually encouraging the government to have the Ontario Human Rights Commission task the secretariat with an undertaking of broad consultations around this bill. As we look around this room, we don’t see many racialized groups. We have a few members.", "I think it’s very important that we get this right. If we’re going to do it, then we need to go out and do consultations, particularly in areas where we know racialized populations live across this province.", "I thank you for the opportunity to say a few words." ],

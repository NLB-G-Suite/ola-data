We have committed to balancing the budget by 2017-18, and we’ve done a lot of government work to ensure that we will meet that target, including making sure that we’re ahead of those targets year by year.", "We are also incorporating new commitments into our plan to make everyday life easier for the people of Ontario. At the same time, we are managing spending. In fact, this year’s public accounts show that we beat our annual deficit target again, as I was saying, for the seventh year in a row. That’s worth repeating. That has been day by day, month by month, the thing that we have made sure that we’re going to be doing. For the seventh year in a row we are beating those targets.", "We have also held growth in program spending over the past four years without making cuts to services or raising taxes.", "Continued economic growth is helping to keep the province on track to balance. For the first half of 2016, Ontario posted stronger GDP growth than Canada, the US and almost all other G7 countries. As a matter of fact—and this is something that we’re very proud of on this side of the House—Moody’s has upgraded our credit rating, showing confidence in our government’s plan to grow the economy and create jobs. As we all know, a growing economy and new jobs are the best way to support Ontario families and to generate revenues that will keep us on the path to balance and long-term prosperity.", "Mr. Speaker, business investment in Ontario increased by 0.6% in the second quarter of 2016 and 0.9% in the first quarter. At the same time, Ontario’s labour market continues to grow. Ontario has recovered all of the jobs lost during the recession and over 640,000 jobs have been created since the recession. This is something all of us Ontarians are very, very proud of. The majority of these jobs are full-time and private sector jobs, as well.", "The current unemployment rate is 6.4%. It has been under the national unemployment rate of 7%, month over month, for the last 18 months.

This fall bill reflects the decisions we’re making as part of our commitment, as I’ve said, to help the people of Ontario with their everyday lives. Our commitment reflects our respect for their hard work and our approach ensures that they have the opportunities to realize their full potential while contributing to Ontario’s economy and society today. It reflects our desire to promote better conditions for future generations of Ontario workers, their families and all individuals for tomorrow.", "I revealed our actions in detail to this very House earlier this week when we introduced the 2016 Ontario Economic Outlook and Fiscal Review. Mr. Speaker, our actions as a government are helping to build that better future. People from all over our great province are building Ontario. They are doing so today, but they’re not doing so alone. They expect their government to do its part as well.", "Our role in this Legislature is to foster more opportunity for everyone. When we support one person, it makes their life a little bit easier; and when we support making the lives of 14 million people easier, it makes Ontario’s economy a much better place and our society a better place to live and raise a family. It is this notion of our collective well-being that underpins this bill.", "The legislative amendments that we’re bringing forward are aimed at fulfilling our commitment to improve the well-being of all Ontarians. We want to ensure that Ontarians have the opportunity to realize their full potential while contributing to our economy and our society. We want to ensure that everyone has an opportunity to succeed.", "As a result, this plan is about making moms and dads get to work and back home safely more quickly. It’s about helping businesses, who are those job producers, grow their economy and, of course, create jobs. It’s about offering our kids a promising future with great schools, colleges and universities. It’s about opportunities to access apprenticeships and industry training programs. This bill will help us achieve that goal.", "It’s also about housing affordability, Mr. Speaker. Ontarians are telling us that finding affordable housing is one of the top things on their mind. They’re concerned that they cannot afford to buy their first home, for example, in today’s real estate market. Given the appreciation of home prices, young families, especially those who are having a challenging time to enter the housing market, are looking for relief or some form of support.", "Purchasing a first home is one of the most exciting decisions in any person’s life. But many today are worried about how they’ll be able to afford that first condo or house. Mr. Speaker, we’re proposing today, as of January 1, 2017, to double that maximum land transfer tax refund for first-time homebuyers, up to $4,000. With an increased maximum, no land transfer tax would in essence be payable on the qualifying purchasers of a first home at $368,000. They would not pay a land transfer tax, and that is of some benefit. In fact, with a doubling of the refund, more than half of first-time homebuyers in Ontario would not pay the LTT on the purchase of their first home.", "I would also like to remind members of this House that during the fall economic statement, our government announced that it was taking action to protect renters as well. We’re freezing the property tax burden on apartment buildings while reviewing how the high property tax burden on these buildings affects rental market affordability. Right now, the average municipal property tax burden on apartment buildings is more than double that of other residential properties such as condominiums.", "We’re also proposing to modernize the land transfer tax system for the first time in a generation. The LTT rates have not changed since 1989. As a result, the government is proposing to modernize these rates to reflect the current real estate market.", "The LTT is payable, as you know, on the purchase of any land in Ontario, and it’s usually based on the value of consideration, which is typically the purchase price. Overall, the proposed rate increases would impact less than 1% of purchasers of homes here in Ontario. Revenue generated from proposed increased LTT rates would be used to fund the enhancements of the first-time home-buyer refund.", "We know that the housing market is an important source of economic growth and employment in Ontario. Improving housing affordability will benefit people across the province while contributing to the creation of jobs and economic growth.", "To help ensure we understand the market forces at play and to inform future policies, we’re also proposing to collect additional data about the real estate market. This would include the type of property, the intended use, and the citizenship and residency status of the purchasers. As part of this proposal, the province will work with the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario to ensure that the appropriate steps are taken to protect all collected personal information.", "Strengthening Ontario’s property tax and assessment system is key. A fair and effective property tax assessment system is critical, in fact, to support local services and adequately fund Ontario’s school system. That’s why we’re working with municipalities, the Municipal Property Assessment Corp. and taxpayers to enhance the fairness and effectiveness of Ontario’s property tax and assessment system. Specifically, the government is working to give municipalities increased flexibility to manage business property taxes, including business vacancy programs. Today’s bill shows how we’re moving forward with measures to create a fair and modern provincial land tax system.", "Today’s bill is also about measures to address concerns about retirement security. Mr. Speaker, tens of thousands of young people across the province are at the beginning of their careers. Many are on contract or working for small businesses and don’t have the benefit of a workplace pension plan. For many, it’s hard to start saving for the future. That’s why we’re strengthening retirement security.", "Two thirds of Ontario workers not participating in a workplace pension and many families worried about how they’ll maintain their standard of living in retirement required the province to take some action. Our work on the planned Ontario Retirement Pension Plan was the catalyst, in fact, on reaching a national consensus to enhance CPP this past summer. This consensus will help strengthen retirement security for future generations of Ontarians and Canadians.", "CPP enhancement is just one component of the province’s strategy to support Ontarians in retirement. This bill moves forward many other components of that strategy as well. For example, there are proposed amendments that would enhance the benefit security, providing the superintendent of financial services with greater enforcement powers to ensure compliance with the Pension Benefits Act.", "The bill also supports the Investment Management Corporation of Ontario, known as IMCO. This body is a non-share capital corporation that will provide investment management services to broader public sector organizations that choose to become its members.

I was just talking about IMCO, which is the Investment Management Corp. of Ontario, which is critical to the success of trying to assemble a number of our agencies so that they can manage our pensions and asset values more effectively and at lower cost for the benefit of all of you and others who are dependent upon some of these services.", "IMCO would, as I said, deliver enhanced risk-adjusted returns to its members by providing greater investment economies of scale and facilitating enhanced access to investment opportunities and, of course, world-class expertise.", "The province established IMCO on July 1, 2016, by proclaiming the Investment Management Corporation of Ontario Act, 2015, into force. Also, on July 1, we designated IMCO’s initial members, the Ontario Pension Board and the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board. With combined investment assets close to $50 billion, these two institutions provide the scale to ensure IMCO’s success. The bill I discuss today helps support the supervisory role of IMCO’s board of directors, and with the appropriate oversight of its board, IMCO is preparing for operations beginning in spring of 2017.", "Mr. Speaker, changing times are impacting how Ontarians work, live and do business. Our commitment to building a fair society is also about inspiring growth that is more inclusive, lifting people out of poverty and ensuring all of them and all of us reach our full potential. It’s why we’re developing a basic income pilot. It’s why we’re also addressing the gender wage gap. It’s why we’re helping refugees settle in Ontario. It’s why we’re supporting reconciliation with indigenous peoples.", "Taking action to help people in their everyday lives is important to all of us, Mr. Speaker. We’re all concerned about rising costs of living and doing business, so we’re taking action to mitigate these costs. Starting in January 2017, we will rebate an amount equal to the 8% provincial portion of the HST on electricity bills. This move will help five million families, small businesses and farms.", "Mr. Speaker, those are just some of the aspects of our plan to grow the economy, create jobs and help people in their everyday lives. Our plan, which underpins this bill, is working. It’s been working over the past two years, as our economy has grown 5.3%. Last year, our economic growth was double the national average. In fact, for the first half of this year, Ontario’s growth was faster than that of Canada, the US and almost all other G7 countries. More than 641,000 net new jobs, as I already explained, have been created here since the depths of the 2008 global recession. The majority of these jobs are indeed full-time, they’re in the private sector and they’re in above-average-wage industries.", "We want to do more. Ontario’s unemployment rate today is at an eight-year low. These are positive signs, certainly, of our economic growth, but we all know global challenges continue to exist, and we must always be prepared. But our goal has always been clear. We have never wavered from our fiscal plan to balance the budget. In 2015-16, the public accounts of Ontario confirmed that we exceeded the deficit projection by $3.5 billion, putting us ahead of plan yet again. It was the seventh year in a row that we have beaten that deficit target. I’m pleased to say that, consistent with the 2016 budget, Ontario’s deficit for 2016-17 is projected to be $4.3 billion. As I revealed in the 2016 Ontario Economic Outlook and Fiscal Review, we are on target and we are on plan.", "The goal is close now. It’s not easy, and it hasn’t been, but we will continue to make strategic investments to grow our economy, and we’ll make the right choices to bring Ontario to balance next year.", "This bill also includes amendments that support the work we’re doing, specifically with the Financial Administration Act. The amendment, if passed, would simplify the process for obtaining borrowing authority for refinancing the province’s existing debt.", "Mr. Speaker, the province’s total long-term borrowing is forecast to be $23.8 billion for 2016-17. It’s a reduction of $2.6 billion from the forecast in the 2016 budget. This is the smallest amount to be borrowed since 2008-09. Thanks to a combination of historically low interest rates and cost-effective debt management, Ontario has been able to keep interest on debt costs below budget projections. As part of its cost-effective debt management, the province has also extended the term of its borrowing to lock in low interest rates for longer periods, reducing refinancing risks. Ontario is also committed to helping develop the Canadian green bond market, and we plan to issue our third green bond before the end of 2016-17.", "The province continues to move forward with municipalities and indigenous people. This partnership of shared priorities enables us to build on solid partnerships and, again, improvements to our economy. This bill includes amendments that will reflect our work enhancements in those relationships and with those municipalities. I would like to add that a new era of collaboration between the federal government and the provinces and territories is yielding some positive results, as well. Ontario and the federal government are co-operating to deliver real benefits to people in their everyday lives. These benefits include stronger pension benefits and renewed infrastructure. Together with its partners, the province has also made progress in areas such as reducing barriers to interprovincial trade and fighting climate change.", "Mr. Speaker, I began the second reading of Bill 70, the Building Ontario Up for Everyone Act (Budget Measures), 2016, by talking about our common desire, our common goal to ensure a bright future for all Ontarians. That common goal is at the root of all that this government does. It’s a common goal that is shared across Ontario, and I believe we all agree, here and outside this room, that what’s at stake and what’s important to all of us is that people have the jobs and security they need going forward that are enabling our children to have the best opportunities to get a good start in life and that our moms and dads and our most senior are having the health care they require so that they, too, can have security.", "Our dream of futures for our children and grandchildren is important. I believe many would say it is. It’s a common theme, I believe, and ultimately we all want that same benefit for our families. Many across this province are working hard for their loved ones, and we in this Legislature are doing our utmost to ensure that that be the case for our neighbours and families as well. Many will go about their business across the province to better our lives and to improve the lives of those they love, as I mentioned, and the measures in this bill would help bring those to a reality. If it passes, it would go a long way to support them to support each other.", "Mr. Speaker, we recognize the extent of work and effort that all of us in this Legislature do for the benefit of others, and I would just like commend the efforts that many are taking to do just that. If I look at the fiscal plan—and that’s what this is about: This economic update and this bill are about enhancing and bringing forward the work that we did in the 2016 budget. As we move forward, let’s be clear about some of the achievements that have been had and certainly the challenges that are still before us. But if you look—and I’m just going to talk about some of the fiscal numbers, specifically—our net-debt-to-GDP ratio, which is a measure of our ability to afford the things that matter to us in the long run, is hovering around 40%. You can compare that with Quebec, which is around 52%, and if you look at what is happening in other parts of the world, it’s 80% to 100%.", "So Ontario has had some movement and we have had some flexibility to enable that, but keep in mind that the accumulated deficit, which is the measure of the deficits that have been had since the start of time in this Legislature, is the same today as it was 25 years ago. We’re roughly at around 27%. That’s a strong measure that we’re operating effectively and that you are not borrowing for your operating costs. We don’t mind borrowing for capital so that we can invest long-term. That’s the kind of legacy we want to leave for future generations. We have taken into consideration those two issues.", "We have to ensure that we continue to be mindful of our program spending as well, without sacrificing the things that matter. That’s why we’re investing more in health care: an addition $1 billion. That’s why we’ve increased operating supports for health care this year by $140 million, which is part of this bill, on top of the $365 million that was put forward in the budget in the spring. These are matters that are important to the people of Ontario. It is why we’re offering free tuition to 150,000 more students who are going to start in September. That’s important for them to get a start in life, recognizing that the sticker shock of tuition oftentimes precludes those most vulnerable and unable to access post-secondary. This is enabling them to be at their best, because, ultimately, what enables us to succeed in this province is having, appropriately, talented, skilled individuals to be prepared for the jobs of tomorrow. We’ll continue to make those initiatives and those efforts.", "I recognize the importance of education, health care and creating jobs for our economy. An individual who is working hard on our behalf to forward those very issues is a young man himself who has taken on the role of doing work in this Legislature for the benefit of the people of Ontario.", "I would like to pass along now an opportunity for Yvan Baker, the MPP from Etobicoke and the parliamentary assistant to the Ministry of Finance, to also enlighten us.", "Over to you, sir." ],

First of all, I have to say that it’s an honour to be Minister Sousa’s parliamentary assistant. When I was campaigning, knocking on doors and meeting constituents, I heard a lot from people about the importance of making sure that we manage the province’s finances effectively; that we make those investments that are important to people, the ones that I know the minister has just spoken about; but also that we balance the budget and we manage taxpayer dollars wisely. This was something that I heard regularly at the doors on the campaign, and I know a lot of us heard that. Coming from a business and finance background, it’s a true honour to work with Minister Sousa on a daily basis on those issues and many others.", "The other thing that I wanted to share was that I was raised in a family where I spent a lot of time with my grandparents growing up. My grandfather—who, like so many immigrants, struggled to establish himself in this country, but did—talked a lot about what made Canada so great was the fact that the generations that came prior to me, to us, worked so hard to build this country, to make it the great country that it is and make our province the great province that it is. He said, “It’s your responsibility”—this was when I was still young—“to work to make the province even better. That’s what previous generations did, and the onus is on you to do the same.” I share that with you, Mr. Speaker, because I believe that this bill takes an important step in doing just that.", "As Minister Sousa articulated so well, the fall bill reflects the decisions we are making as part of our commitment to help people in their everyday lives across Ontario. It reaffirms our commitment to grow the economy and support job creation. It is laying the groundwork to accelerate the development of an innovation economy. Our plan to help people in their everyday lives and to grow the economy and create jobs is working. The province is expected to remain among the leading economies in Canada over the next two years.", "Just recently, a report by the Bank of Montreal reiterated that Ontario is expected to grow faster than the national average. In other words, the economy is performing well. The report stated:", "“Ontario’s economy is one of Canada’s growth leaders, expected to outperform the national average for a third straight year in 2016.", "“Ontario’s real gross domestic product is expected to grow 2.6% this year and 2.3% in 2017.”", "This is proof that our plan is working—a plan founded on building Ontario up and centred on our work of fostering a dynamic and innovative business climate.", "Today, Ontario’s labour market continues to grow, with more than 641,000 net new jobs created since the last global recession. Today, the unemployment rate is at an eight-year low, proof that the plan is having a positive impact on Ontario’s economy.", "At the same time, our plan is also taking care of Ontarians in their everyday lives. It includes improving protections for consumers, investors and pension plan beneficiaries. I would like to highlight some of the key components of that plan that are reflected in the bill that is under discussion today.", "First of all, Ontario is moving forward with a new statute to establish the proposed Financial Services Regulatory Authority of Ontario, FSRA for short. The FSRA would regulate the sectors defined in the Financial Services Commission of Ontario Act, 1997. The financial services sector is a significant part of the economy and touches the everyday lives of Ontarians. I’m talking about areas that have real impact on people—real impact on the people who are at home watching right now—on insurance, on mortgages, loans and trusts, credit unions and not to forget pension plan sponsors and plan administrators that are part of the regulated sector. People entrust their futures to these institutions. We entrust our futures to these institutions.", "Today in Ontario, more than 85,000 businesses and individuals working in the financial services sector are regulated or registered with the Financial Services Commission of Ontario, or FSCO. Among these 85,000 businesses or individuals, there are:", "—321 insurance companies;", "—sponsors and administrators of 7,054 pension plans;", "—101 credit unions and caisses populaires;", "—53 loan and trust corporations;", "—1,188 mortgage brokerages;", "—2,681 mortgage brokers;", "—10,893 mortgage agents;", "—166 mortgage administrators—Speaker, I’m not going to test you on this later, I promise;", "—1,779 co-operative corporations;", "—52,925 insurance agents;", "—5,693 corporate insurance agencies;", "—1,505 insurance adjustors; and", "—4,479 accident benefits health service providers.", "When you break it down, you see how many Ontarians can be touched by these 85,000 businesses and individuals. This touches real people and affects their day-to-day lives and financial welfare.", "Furthermore, FSCO also reviews and approves auto insurance rates, which provide the basis for the premiums paid by Ontario consumers on more than seven million personal vehicles. FSCO also monitors and ensures compliance with legislated minimum standards for more than 7,000 employment pension plans, with 3.9 million members.", "For example, in 2014 more than 250,000 life insurance policies were purchased in Ontario, usually through a FSCO-licensed insurance agent. Ontario’s mortgage brokerages reported that they arranged $148 billion of mortgage business in 2014. Ontario consumers rely every day on services offered by financial services intermediaries licensed by FSCO.", "Meanwhile, the Deposit Insurance Corporation of Ontario, known as DICO for short, protects the deposits of the approximately 1.6 million Ontario credit union members. Credit unions and caisses populaires are member-owned, deposit-taking institutions that provide loans and other financial services to their members. Caisses populaires focus their services on French-speaking communities.", "I have to say, Speaker, that in Etobicoke, and in Etobicoke Centre, I have a large number of constituents who rely on the services of credit unions every single day. In fact, my family—my grandfather and my parents—have been members of credit unions for decades.", "Ontario’s credit unions have provided $42 billion in loans outstanding to Ontario households and businesses as of June 2016. Furthermore, approximately 7,000 Ontarians are employed by these institutions.", "In short, Ontarians rely on agencies such as FSCO, DICO and the related Financial Services Tribunal to ensure that they are adequately protected in their everyday lives. The government recognizes the important regulatory role these agencies have served. With many different touch points between consumers, financial services and pension administrators, the role of these agencies is fundamental in protecting the public.", "Financial services are one of the fastest-growing sectors in our economy, and that is why the province is moving forward to establish the initial parameters for the proposed Financial Services Regulatory Authority of Ontario. Our intention is for the FSRA, for short, to be a strong, modern and efficient financial services and pension regulator that will benefit Ontarians by protecting the interests of consumers and pension plan beneficiaries while fostering a strong business environment.", "I want to restate that, Speaker, because I think it’s really important what the goal is of the FSRA: It’s to protect the interest of consumers and pension plan beneficiaries while also fostering a strong business environment, an important balance to strike. Overseeing these areas is a public trust that our government takes seriously and we want to ensure that robust consumer and pension plan beneficiary protections are in place. We will make sure that we have a modern financial services and pension regulator.", "The next topic, Speaker, that I want to speak to, and that’s contained in the statute, can be seen as a midway point in the rigorous process to create the proposed financial services regulator of Ontario. This is a process that began in early 2015. That year, we appointed an expert advisory panel to review the mandates of the existing agencies. The panel consisted of George Cooke, the former president and CEO of the Dominion of Canada General Insurance Company and chair of the board of directors of the OMERS Administration Corp.; James Daw, former Toronto Star personal finance columnist, who has written extensively about all facets of Ontario’s financial system; and Larry Ritchie from Osler, Hoskin and Harcourt LLP, partner and former vice-chair of the Ontario Securities Commission—so a group of individuals with tremendous experience and knowledge of the sector.", "The panel conducted consultations and drafted and released both an interim report and then its final report this past June. The government had tasked the group to answer four specific questions, and the questions focused on the relevance, responsibilities, powers and governance of the three agencies. They concluded that significant change was required, in part because the financial services and pension sectors are changing at a rapid pace. To keep pace, they argued that Ontario needed a regulatory authority that is flexible and innovative and that possesses the expertise appropriate to match the consistently evolving financial environment. In short, the agency’s effectiveness was limited by a list of items outside their control, such as mandate, authorities and resources. They called not for amendments, revisions or improvements to the existing regulatory framework and apparatus; they called for replacing the current regulatory structure and approach with one that would be more flexible and also more accountable.", "In their report, they stated clearly that they do not believe the necessary transformation could be accomplished within the current system that’s in place. They recommended the creation of a new regulator. They said that this new regulator required a new mandate and the authority to work closely with the sectors that they regulate, as well as with sister agencies in other provinces, if they were to encourage a vibrant and safe marketplace. To ensure consumers, investors and pension plan beneficiaries are well protected today and tomorrow and that the industry is competitive and responsible to consumers’ needs today and tomorrow, Ontario needed change. It needed significant change to the mandate, governance, organizational structure, regulatory tools and overall regulatory means.", "In its report, the panel made 44 recommendations, all relating to these fundamental functions. Overall, the report’s message was that Ontario’s current regulatory framework was not sufficiently flexible, adaptable or responsive. The expert panel clearly highlighted FSCO’s structural limitations, which create challenges in regulating financial services in the pension sector in an area of rapid industry innovation caused by competition and consumer change. The report was clear and unwavering: Change is needed.", "Speaker, consumer changes and industry innovation are proceeding very rapidly, as we have seen in the sharing economy. For example, two or three years ago, few had heard of Uber and Airbnb, and today they’re household names. Innovation within the financial services sector is inevitable, necessary, and actually desirable. Innovation will drive competition. This dynamic, together with ever-changing demands from consumers and investors, will require an innovative, flexible, adaptable and responsive regulatory environment. In other words, if the financial services sector is going to innovate and adapt, we need to make sure that the regulator can keep pace.", "Our government is committed to modernizing and strengthening financial services and pension regulation, as well as providing consumer protections, which is why we will establish the new recommended Financial Services Regulatory Authority of Ontario. But it needs to be said that how the panel’s recommendations will be implemented requires further analysis. As stressed by the expert panel, we know that the transition from the current structure to the panel’s recommended approach needs to be carefully and strategically planned, implemented and overseen with due regard for its impact on registered pension plans and on plan beneficiaries.", "If passed, the legislation before us today would enable the government to appoint a board of directors that would govern the FSRA. The government will work with the bargaining agents to ensure that FSCO employees are treated in accordance with the applicable collective agreements during the transition to the FSRA. Our government will ensure that FSCO continues to provide regulatory oversight until the FSRA is fully operational.", "The panel also recommended that the FSRA be funded on a cost-recovery basis through appropriate levies and fees paid by the regulated sectors. If the implementation goes according to plan, the FSRA would be set up as a corporation that is operationally independent from the government and that is funded on a cost-recovery basis through appropriate levies and fees paid by the regulated sectors.", "This model is similar to others that are out there, regulators such as the Ontario Securities Commission, as an example. The establishment of the FSRA would represent an important first step towards the panel’s vision for modernizing and strengthening the regulation for the financial services under its oversight and pensions in Ontario.", "In short, we are looking at a major overhaul to the regulatory landscape, with a modernized governance and accountability framework. In the coming months, the government intends to take other important steps in support of this multi-phased transition process, such as the development of a detailed implementation plan.", "Mr. Speaker, the province’s efforts relating to FSRA are not the only work it is doing to modernize how financial services are regulated in Ontario. We are also working to promote clarity and consumer confidence in the sector. I’d like to spend a couple of moments speaking about that as well. Our steps include reviewing the regulation of financial planning and financial advisory services.", "It is an understatement to say that the financial decisions confronting individuals have become increasingly complicated and increasingly complex. So, as a result, many people need access to informed professional financial advice to ensure that their investment decisions serve their financial goals. Currently in Ontario, no general oversight framework exists to regulate the activities of individuals who offer financial advice and planning services. The absence of a general regulatory framework for financial planning has raised concerns. It has raised concerns about proficiency, quality standards and potential conflicts of interest in the industry. This potential regulatory gap could leave consumers vulnerable when looking for assistance to meet their financial goals.", "Last year, the Ontario government took an important step in appointing an independent expert committee to review the regulatory framework relating to financial planning and financial advisory services. This committee was mandated to provide advice and recommendations to the government regarding whether financial planning and the giving of financial advice should be regulated in Ontario and, if so, the appropriate scope of such regulation. The goal is for consumers to get trustworthy planning and advisory services so they can be confident in the advice they receive when they face complex financial decisions with confidence.", "When I think about the decisions that people make about their financial future, and I think about how many Ontarians rely on this type of financial advice and how those decisions are pivotal to their future prosperity, to the future prosperity of their families, how it’s fundamental to ensuring that people can achieve their potential, retire securely, support their families—it’s really, really important that we get this right. It’s really important that people can rely on that advice and have confidence in that advice.", "The expert committee I was talking about said it would ensure that its recommendations avoid imposing unnecessary or duplicative regulation. As part of the consultation process, the expert committee travelled across the province to solicit stakeholder input on exactly how to do this. Their final report is expected to be released in early 2017.", "Another area of note in the fall economic statement is syndicated mortgages. The Financial Services Commission of Ontario, FSCO for short, which regulates mortgage brokers involved in Ontario’s syndicated mortgage market, reports that syndicated mortgage lending in Ontario almost doubled, from $3 billion annually to close to $6 billion annually, between 2012 and 2015 alone. As the size of the market has increased, the types of investors participating have changed, with syndicated mortgage investments increasingly marketed to smaller-scale and to retail investors. In this evolving context, changes were suggested to the way that syndicated mortgages are regulated. In particular, the expert advisory panel that reviewed FSCO’s mandate recommended that syndicated mortgage-offering documents should be subject to the same level of regulation that the securities regulator applies to other offering documents used to raise capital in Ontario.", "The expert panel’s recommendation fits together with a suggestion made by the participating jurisdictions in the Cooperative Capital Markets Regulatory System. These jurisdictions include the governments of British Columbia, New Brunswick, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Saskatchewan, Yukon and the government of Canada.", "In August 2015, last year, they proposed that the Capital Markets Regulatory Authority, when formed, would be responsible for the regulation of those offering syndicated mortgage investments. The government is taking steps to ensure that strong investor protection is provided under the regulatory framework for such products. As an initial step, the Ministry of Finance recently established a working group composed of representatives from the ministry and experts from the Ontario Securities Commission and FSCO. It is expected that over the coming months, the working group will develop recommendations for the government’s consideration. The fall economic statement indicated that the government will announce further actions by the spring of 2017.", "I’ve talked about a number of items here. I’ve talked about the regulatory authority; I’ve talked about syndicated mortgages. I also want to talk about credit unions and caisses populaires. The bill before us today also supports the government’s related work having to do with modernizing the regulation of the province’s credit unions and caisses populaires. In the 2016 budget, the government announced it intended to implement the recommendations contained in the report on the review of the Credit Unions and Caisses Populaires Act, 1994. The review was led by my predecessor as parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Finance, and now minister, Laura Albanese.", "Speaker, as you know, Ms. Albanese is now Minister of Citizenship and Immigration. In her role as parliamentary assistant, she was asked by Minister Sousa, back in the fall of 2014, to undertake the review of the Credit Unions and Caisses Populaires Act. The act has been amended over the years, with the previous significant amendments being made in 2009. A review of the Credit Unions and Caisses Populaires Act is something that must be done every five years just to keep it current. This is an imperative undertaking for the Ministry of Finance.", "As part of her review, Minister Albanese did a number of things. She looked at the impact that the act and its regulations have on the day-to-day operations of credit unions and caisses populaires in their dealings with their members. She solicited public input through an open consultation process. Working together with Ministry of Finance officials and Osgoode Hall Law School professor Poonam Puri, her expert adviser, she held eight in-person consultations across Ontario. Additionally, they met one on one with individuals and held two round table sessions with key sector participants. As well, stakeholders in the public submitted more than 35 written responses to a consultation paper issued to stimulate that conversation. All together, they heard from more than 2,020 individuals across Ontario. These people included credit union members, small-business owners, local chambers of commerce and sector representatives. Input from everyone was considered carefully and was reflected in Minister Albanese’s 15 recommendations.", "After her work was completed, Minister Albanese observed that what really became clear to her over the course of the review was the pivotal role that credit unions play in their communities. She heard repeatedly about the positive contributions that credit unions and caisses populaires have made in northern, rural and urban communities, and their importance to their communities remains unmistakable and unshakable. Credit unions are vital to the communities that they serve.", "I just want to offer an example. In northern communities where banks have closed branches, credit unions and caisses populaires have often stepped up and are the only remaining financial institutions in the community. In urban centres, ethnic credit unions assist members in their native languages. I can speak to that specifically. In my community, we have many, many members who are served, for example, by the Ukrainian Credit Union, by the Buduchnist Credit Union. These are the credit unions that I refer to that my grandparents and mother were members of. They not only provide an essential service to their members and to those communities, but they also give back to their local communities. They take their resources, they take their profits and they contribute back into the communities in a way that’s quite exceptional. To that extent, they also provide a vital service to their communities. Of course, they create sustained and good-quality local jobs, the backbone of any community.", "However, in Minister Albanese’s report, she noted that credit union revenues were under strain. They’re under strain due to Canada’s low interest rates and rules that could pose challenges to them. As a result, many credit unions are looking to pursue new and innovative lines of business in order to generate non-interest income. Credit unions and caisses populaires are vibrant and dynamic businesses. They compete for clients and strive to satisfy the needs of their members. They are looking to grow and compete more effectively in the modern financial services sector. The amendments contained in this bill go a long way towards ensuring that credit unions and caisses populaires can continue to provide those vital and competitive services.", "Minister Albanese’s 15 recommendations serve three overarching objectives: (1) protecting consumers; (2) encouraging best practices; and (3) enabling credit unions and caisses populaires to meet their members’ evolving needs.", "Let me talk first of all about protecting consumers. While credit union and caisses populaires members are well served, the province can do more to ensure their best interests as consumers continue to be soundly protected. The report recommended a number of things:", "—increasing the basic deposit insurance coverage limit, to $250,000 from $100,000, to better protect consumers in the event a credit union becomes insolvent;", "—seeking voluntary commitments from credit unions to provide data on member complaints to the Financial Services Commission of Ontario;", "—increasing credit union and caisses populaires transparency and accountability through published public accountability statements and notices of branch closures; and", "—exploring with the sector new product offerings as alternatives to high-cost payday loans to help consumers find more sustainable financial solutions.", "The minister underlined that in recent years there have been significant developments internationally in financial services regulation. It is important that Ontario remains aligned with international best practices. It is now evident that new best practices have emerged, in particular with respect to governance and capital adequacy. It is important to ensure that Ontario is aligned with those standards. In that vein, she recommended a number of things, including that they update their capital adequacy requirements to match federal and international financial standards.", "Thirdly, in the area of enabling credit unions to meet evolving member needs, Minister Albanese underlined that the financial services sector is a competitive and evolving marketplace. By updating the Credit Unions Act, Ontario would help credit unions better meet their needs today and in the future while helping them compete more effectively. Therefore, she recommended a number of things:", "—identifying and amending regulations under other provincial statutes that limit the types of business that credit unions can conduct with a variety of sectors, including municipalities, universities, school boards and hospitals, in order to put them on a more equal footing with banks;", "—removing restrictive rules for small credit unions to give them the same flexibility in lending, investment and managing liquidity as large credit unions;", "—allowing credit unions to wholly own a broader array of subsidiary businesses than is currently permitted, including insurance brokerages; and", "—permitting loan syndications with credit unions in other provinces to help Ontario credit unions better fund local needs and manage risk through greater diversification of their loan portfolios.", "These are all changes that the minister recommended in this third category that really allows credit unions to compete, to survive and prosper, to serve their members and their communities more effectively. With these recommendations, Minister Albanese was confident that new legislation would bring forward the right ideas that will improve the legislative framework for credit unions and caisses populaires.", "As a first step, the government is proposing amendments to the act that would provide authority to set different deposit insurance limits for different insurable deposits, therefore enabling regulations to be proposed to set the deposit insurance coverage limit for non-registered deposits at $250,000. That’s the first thing. The second thing is to remove differentiated rules for small credit unions, and the third is to permit credit unions to enter into loan syndication agreements with credit unions in other provinces.", "The government will also propose amendments to regulations under the act and other relevant statutes that would further implement the above measures and would do a number of things: permit credit unions to establish or acquire a corporation that is an insurance agent or a registered insurance broker; and address provisions and regulations under various statutes to include credit unions as permissible financial institutions.", "Implementing these changes, Speaker, would help improve the legislative framework for credit unions so that they can meet the evolving needs of their members, contribute to the Ontario economy and ensure that deposits continue to be well-protected.", "Ontario’s continued economic growth has occurred in the face of intensified international competition and uncertainty around global growth forecasts. From reducing regulatory burdens to helping businesses keep pace with technological change and expand their operations, the province is improving the conditions for economic growth, now and into the future. Ontario needs to be a destination of choice for businesses looking to set down roots and grow their firms.", "Looking ahead to the new opportunities resulting from the transition to a low-carbon economy, the government is implementing its plan to combat climate change and support individuals and businesses. Attracting and supporting investment in financial technology sectors will also provide significant new economic opportunities. It is our responsibility to put in place the regulations and supports needed to make those opportunities a reality in Ontario.", "The province is also committed to further strengthening consumer protection and ensuring a fair, safe and informed marketplace for all Ontario families, because we recognize that changing economic and social realities are affecting how Ontarians work, live and conduct business. To enhance consumer protection in Ontario’s financial services marketplace, the government is doing a number of things: first of all, exploring options with credit unions to offer small-dollar loans as another option to high-cost payday loans; working with the sector to identify and address any potential legislative or other barriers to offering such products; and exploring with credit unions ways to reduce cheque-cashing costs for recipients of government payments.", "The government has also completed the delivery of key reforms to improve the auto insurance system, including launching a new auto insurance dispute resolution system that will help the people of Ontario get faster access to the benefits that they need, reducing the maximum interest rate for monthly premium payment plans and prohibiting rate increases for minor at-fault accidents.", "Ontario will continue to seek opportunities to improve the auto insurance system to benefit and to protect consumers. We will do so with the help of David Marshall, the former president and chief executive officer of the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board, who was appointed by the province as an adviser on auto insurance and on pensions. He is currently reviewing the system to identify ways to improve health outcomes and lower insurer claims costs. Ultimately, this will make auto insurance rates more affordable for Ontarians. I know that this will make a difference for the people in my community of Etobicoke Centre and for people in communities across Ontario.", "In conclusion, the proposed Bill 70, the Building Ontario Up for Everyone Act, 2016, would implement, in part, measures contained in the 2016 Ontario budget by amending various statutes and enacting four new statutes. It’s an important bill. It is a document that reflects our common desire to make Ontario the best place for people to work, the best place to raise a family and pursue what makes them happy in life, wherever they live in this great province.", "When I started, I started by talking about the fact that when I was young, I was told by my family, by my grandparents, how important it is that, as citizen of this province, as a citizen of this country, I have a responsibility to continue the work of prior generations in making this province, making this country, a better place to live. As an MPP, that responsibility is my everyday focus.", "I’m proud to support this bill, because this bill takes important steps to strengthen our economy, to create jobs, to protect consumers, to ensure that the services that Ontarians need are provided and, ultimately, that we make this province and this country even better than it has been in the past and for generations to come. Thank you, Speaker." ],

I know in our lead we’re going to be looking forward to giving the government comments and criticism and hopefully some feedback on what they’re proposing.", "There are areas in Bill 70 that touch all of us, and health care is one of them. I was in committee yesterday with Bill 41, putting patients first, and that particular bill is very concerning. There were stakeholders there who were worried about the powers the LHINs were going to have over their agencies. The CEOs from CCAC are going to be appointed through the LHINs and they’re going to be able to go into community agency health groups and basically run the show. There are concerns about that because the community agencies, the health groups there—they know their areas. They’ve been appointed to the board, they’ve been elected to the board, and the concern was that those people with the LHINs, through the CCAC, that were CEOs, weren’t appointed. They’re not accountable; they’re unelected. And so that is something that was flagged.", "When we talk about health care, it’s probably one of the biggest budget items in Ontario that we have to make sure we get right, and there’s many times that I have spoken in this House about things that need to change and concerns around mental health. That’s still one of the things I’m very passionate about.", "I look forward to looking at Bill 70 in more depth with regard to the health care piece and having comments on that in the future." ],

A couple of questions would come in: the fact that in all of the others that have it, it was decided by the local regions if they wanted to elect a regional chair or if they wanted to appoint a regional chair. I think there are only three of the regions that presently have an appointed chair. The question, of course, would come: Why is the minister putting it in the finance bill to change that when, in fact, the same day, the Minister of Municipal Affairs introduced a municipal bill that deals with the composition of those regional councils? But this is not part of that bill. That’s a question I would have liked to ask the minister.", "I’ve also spent the last two days at committee on another bill where I’ve been working on trying to get the government to allow the minister to come and talk to the committee, because in the debates in the House, we all realize—to the Minister of Finance—that the minister makes his statement, but there’s no opportunity to have a back-and-forth to get an explanation of what’s happening. I’m told at committee that the government feels that in the House is enough debate on the bill. But the question I just asked—and maybe we can get it in the reply to the comment. You need the minister to come to committee to talk with us so you can ask questions and have a discussion as to what it actually means. So I would ask the minister, when this bill is finished, if it would go to committee so in fact we could have this discussion of what is in the bill.", "On that one, I just want to say that it includes the word “Oxford,” and that’s what caught my attention, or I would likely never have seen it.

There are a lot of things in this bill. I am going to respond to both questions of the members opposite. But let me again reaffirm: This is about us coming to balance to ensure that we maintain a very disciplined and determined approach to our program spending, and to ensure that we continue to stimulate economic growth so that we do come to balance. And we are. We’re taking the necessary steps to ensure that no one is left behind; to invest heavily in the things that matter the most to people—building new hospitals, ensuring more children go to universities and colleges—and to ensure we have a strong premise by which we can grow the economy and enable those jobs to be created.", "I’ll reflect on that one question: 94% of the 641,000 net new jobs, after we capture the 280,000 jobs that we lost in the recession plus the additional jobs that were created in new value-added industries, in new manufacturing, in agri-food processing and a wide sector of the economy that’s enabling us to weather those commodity shocks that are now evident in Alberta and in the east coast—Ontario has led the way with the lowest unemployment in eight years. The majority of those jobs, 94% of those jobs—", "Interjections." ],

They tell you one thing when their own ministry is telling you something completely opposite to that.", "We know that there is a trust deficit with this government.

Now, I know that we can continue to talk about their trust deficit, because five OPP investigations, charges flying all over the place—we know there’s a deficit of trust in this government.

Our communities need to be dementia-ready and dementia-friendly.", "On Friday, our office and local community leaders took a step to achieving this goal by holding a community consultation on the development of Ontario’s Dementia Strategy. The government launched a consultation paper, an online survey and several in-person meetings on the strategy, but none were scheduled either in Cornwall or anywhere east of Kingston.", "Our community deserves a voice, and it came through loud and clear. Participants included people with dementia; their families, who are often the primary or sole caregiver; community agencies dedicated to serving people with dementia; and other concerned residents. They brought a wealth of experience to the table, and two of the strongest messages were that caregivers need significantly more respite programs, while programs and services for people living with dementia must accommodate the patient, not the other way around.", "I will deliver a fuller summary of the recommendations arising from the consultation to the Minister of Health later this week." ],

This community-wide initiative was launched in 2011 by CTV London and the Thames Valley District School Board, under the leadership of former director of education Bill Tucker.", "The pledge recognizes that bullying is not just a school problem but a societal issue, and the entire community needs to take action to end it.", "On November 10, I was proud to join with student and community leaders in London to repeat, once again, the simple yet powerful words of the pledge: “I believe that everybody has the right to live in a community where they feel safe, included, valued and accepted regardless of differences. I pledge to be respectful of others and stand up against bullying whenever and wherever I see it.”", "In the six years since the pledge was first launched, the campaign has spread to Kitchener, Barrie, Windsor, Kingston and Brockville, as well as Saskatoon and Winnipeg.

It did not succeed, but the Holodomor left a tragic mark on generations of Ukrainians. Today, we remember the millions who died in this monstrous act.", "The word “Holodomor” itself translates to “hunger extermination.” Soviet brigades seized food stored in Ukraine to help people survive the long and cold winter. They then deliberately blocked Ukrainians from leaving the famine-struck areas to find food and survival elsewhere.", "By June 1933, at the height of the Holodomor, people in Ukraine were dying at the rate of 30,000 per day. Nearly a third of the dead were children under the age of 10. Overall, an estimated five million to 10 million men, women and children perished without record in one of the century’s most evil acts. Entire families were wiped out, villages depopulated; Ukraine came under the heel of the Soviet Union.", "L’Ukraine a énormément souffert durant les années qui ont suivi l’Holodomor.

  "text" : [ "As we begin National Holodomor Awareness Week, I join with Ukrainians in Ontario, in Canada and around the world to remember the victims of the Holodomor, the Ukrainian genocide. Holodomor was a famine in which it is estimated as many as 10 million Ukrainians, many of whom were children, were targeted and intentionally and systematically starved to death in 1932 and 1933 by the Communist dictator Joseph Stalin. Stalin was punishing Ukrainians for resisting Soviet rule. Soviet authorities confiscated all food grown by Ukrainian farmers. Although the harvest was rich, Ukrainian people were forbidden to touch it. Anyone, including children, caught taking even a stalk could be executed. Special squads were dispatched to search homes and forcibly take all food from Ukrainian people, ensuring a mass famine would ensue.", "These targeted and international crimes turned Europe’s bread basket into a land of immeasurable human suffering. While millions were dying of starvation, the Soviets took the wheat the Ukrainians had produced and sold it abroad. This genocidal famine was denied, ignored and covered up throughout much of the 20th century. Despite decades of oppressive rule, Ukrainians refused to abandon their drive for freedom and independence.", "This past year, I became more acquainted with the history of the Holodomor as I had the incredible honour of meeting a few Holodomor survivors, as well as their children and grandchildren. This past May, we hosted a Holodomor awareness night with our leader, Patrick Brown, and our caucus. We heard narratives from speakers from the League of Ukrainian Canadians, the Holodomor National Awareness Tour, the Holodomor Research and Education Consortium and other organizations. Hearing the historical facts and figures and stories of suffering, trauma and personal tragedy gave me much food for thought and reflection.", "However, an innate part of all these stories was incredible courage, determination, a fight for freedom and a message of hope. I am truly amazed at the incredible work the Ukrainian community in Canada has been doing and continues to do to educate us fellow Canadians about the dark depths that humanity can sink to, but also about the unbreakable spirit of Ukrainian people.", "Whether it is the Holodomor bus—which I highly encourage all members to visit when they have the opportunity—the updates to our school curricula or the efforts to erect a memorial to the victims of the Holodomor in Toronto, I applaud Canadians of Ukrainian heritage for these important initiatives.", "Today, Ukraine faces new challenges to her territory and independence. Once again, Ukrainian people have demonstrated and continue to demonstrate their unyielding commitment to human dignity. Ukraine’s current struggle for freedom and democracy is a testament to the unbreakable spirit of its people and honours the memory of the many who perished under Stalin’s brutal rule.", "Canadians of Ukrainian heritage who have made many significant contributions to this province and this country over many generations have been key in ensuring that we properly honour the memory of those who perished in one of the greatest tragedies of the last century.", "In Ontario, the fourth Saturday of November in each year is proclaimed Holodomor Memorial Day to memorialize those who perished as victims of the genocide by famine that occurred in Ukraine in 1932 and 1933.", "Throughout this week and in the days ahead, many events will be held across Canada to commemorate the Holodomor. I will be honoured to attend one such commemoration this Saturday in Etobicoke, organized by the Ukrainian Canadian Congress, together with my PC leader, Patrick Brown.", "By commemorating the victims of Holodomor, we remind Ontarians that we share a responsibility to advance freedom, human rights and the rule of law, and to oppose tyranny in all its forms.", "Today, I join all Ontarians, particularly Ontarians and Canadians of Ukrainian origin, in solemnly marking the anniversary of this most heinous crime against humanity." ],

We must remember them. There are over 300,000 people of Ukrainian origin here in Ontario. Many have direct family connections to this tragedy, as I do.", "The Holodomor has been called the forgotten genocide, primarily because calling the actions of Joseph Stalin’s regime a famine was forbidden in the USSR until the late 1980s glasnost period. However, the Holodomor, which is translated into English as “to kill by hunger,” was a famine. It was catastrophic in its scale, and its scale remains unknown even today. Although it is estimated that at least four million Ukrainians were killed, possibly as many as 10 million victims suffered under the regime.", "I would like to congratulate and recognize that the government of Ontario has taken the important step to introduce the lessons of the Holodomor into the provincial curriculum. It is, indeed, incredibly important that students of all ethnic backgrounds understand not only that the events took place but what a genocide is and what it looks like, and our responsibility as a developed country to intervene and to act and to learn from what has happened in the past.", "Speaker, the famine was manufactured by Stalin’s regime as a genocide of the Ukrainian people. Farms were forced to fill impossible grain quotas. Food was taken, leaving villages with absolutely nothing. One Holodomor survivor who came to Toronto, Mykola Latyshko, said in 2008, “Those who protested were beaten up, quite often to death. Those who were protesting even more were simply shot in front of their children, wives, mothers.” There are also many stories from survivors of those desperate to survive having to resort to cannibalism.", "We must remember what happened in 1932 and 1933. In Ontario, we mark the fourth Saturday of November as Holodomor Memorial Day. On November 23, please take a moment to remember.

The Premier finally acknowledged that skyrocketing electricity prices were her mistake. I’ll be one of the first to say congratulations to the Premier. Congratulations on coming to grips with what everyone in Ontario already knew.", "Now, if the House will oblige, I want to give a quick history lesson, back to just a few short months ago. Our Premier, just a few months ago, refused to admit she had made a mistake on hydro prices, under a barrage of questions from opposition members of all parties during question period. Everything was fine. Everything was rosy. There was no concern with electricity prices.", "Our Premier wasn’t apologizing for bad Liberal energy policies when she got booed at the plowing match. Back then, everything was rosy. The Premier wasn’t taking ownership for skyrocketing rates on her tour of northern Ontario in the summer. Instead, she was blaming everyone else. In question period, “Nothing’s wrong”; at the plowing match, “Nothing’s wrong”; in northern Ontario, “Nothing’s wrong”—despite the fact that everyone, from every community, is complaining about the skyrocketing electricity rates.", "If you had asked the Premier just a few months ago, she would have told you that if there was any problem, blame previous governments. Blame Mike Harris. Blame Leslie Frost. Blame Mitch Hepburn. She was blaming people who were there even before the member for St. Catharines. The excuses, Mr. Speaker, were unbelievable. I think the Premier began to realize that no one was believing these excuses, hence we have this admission that this is her fault, that these are her policies.", "It might have been what happened in September, too. In September, the Liberals lost a by-election in Scarborough–Rouge River, a seat they had never lost before, a seat they never even dreamed they could lose, and they scrambled. They scrambled and they came up with a band-aid solution for the people of Ontario equivalent to a cup of coffee a month.", "They had their MPPs tour the province touting their band-aid solution. Maybe they hoped that people would forget about these skyrocketing hydro bills.", "But still, the Premier didn’t apologize after Scarborough. The Premier still refused to admit that skyrocketing electricity prices were everyone else’s mistake but hers. But then last week the Liberals got crushed in Niagara West–Glanbrook, falling all the way to third place, the government party for the first time finishing in third—a distant third. And in the Liberal fortress of Ottawa–Vanier, the Liberals’ safest seat in the province, their margin crumbled almost in half.", "What that shows is that, finally, the Premier is seeing these numbers crumbling, seeing Ontarians irate across the province. Then, when it appeared to affect the Liberal Party’s self-interest, the Premier admitted that this was her mistake, this was this government’s blunder. It’s not a problem for the Premier until it’s a Liberal Party problem. That’s what this is about. It started to affect the government’s own self-interest.", "What’s disturbing about that is, you’d think it should have been acknowledged by the Premier when she heard the news—not that it was affecting Liberal seats, but that there were 567,000 Ontario families in arrears. Can you imagine that, Mr. Speaker? There are 567,000 Ontario families in arrears. They can’t pay their hydro bills, but it doesn’t bug the government, it doesn’t bug the Premier that Ontarians can’t afford their hydro bills. It only bugs them when they lose a seat that they had for decades and decades.", "Mr. Speaker, one in 20 Ontario businesses report they expect to shut down in the next five years because of skyrocketing hydro rates. That’s astonishing. It’s not a problem for the government when 81% of Ontarians are concerned the skyrocketing rates will impact the health of our economy. That’s across the board—81%. It’s not a problem for the government when families are being forced to choose between heating and eating. But when it starts to affect their electoral fortunes, all of a sudden we see the government change their tune.", "The Premier didn’t have the gall to state the mistakes the government made. Was it a mistake? It’s one thing to apologize, but are you actually going to change course? Is the government going to acknowledge that it was a mistake to spend $12 million on consultants and advertisements instead of hydro relief for low-income families? Was it a mistake to dole out $9 billion in energy contracts to Liberal donors? That’s not right. Will they finally admit that their fire sale of Hydro One was foolish and reckless? We don’t hear the Premier saying that. It’s one thing to apologize, it’s one thing to say you’ve made a mess of the hydro sector, but it’s another thing to actually change the foolish policies.", "Mr. Speaker, I want the Premier to say and finally acknowledge that it is a mistake to continue shipping out billions of surplus energy to Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania. When are we going to hear the Premier say that? Unfortunately, the Premier’s admissions of guilt and half-apologies just don’t cut it. Words amount for only so much. The people of Ontario want to see real action. If the Premier really thought that her government was to blame, if she was really sincere about her apology, then she would announce that she’s immediately going to stop the fire sale of Hydro One. That did not happen. If the Premier really accepted the blame and her apology was sincere, she would have stopped signing energy contracts for power Ontario doesn’t need, but she’s not doing that.", "If the Premier really was sorry, instead of admitting her mistakes in front of the party faithful and loyalists, she would apologize in front of the people of Ontario in every single riding in Ontario. The Premier has already pledged to visit every single riding. Will she pledge to apologize in every single riding? Because every single riding in the province right now is hurting because of this Premier and this government’s reckless energy policy.", "Finally, if the Premier really thought that bad Liberal policies were to blame, she’d have her Liberal caucus pass this opposition day motion. If they were sincere, if this apology was really an apology, they’d say, “You know what? We’re going to do the right thing. We’re going to support this motion.” But I don’t think she’ll have them pass this motion. They like to double down on wrong positions. I don’t think the Premier is actually sorry. I don’t think the Premier actually wants to accept the blame. I think her government is going to continue down the same road of terrible energy policies. Rates will continue to skyrocket, and life will continue to get harder in Ontario.", "I hope the Premier can prove me wrong. I hope this Liberal caucus will prove me wrong and vote for our motion today. Prove us wrong. Do the right thing for Ontario and pass this motion today." ],

I’ve dug up some things that were before my time here in the Legislature, and I find them fascinating, so I’d like to share them with the people in the House and the people across the province.", "I’m going to share with you an opposition day motion that was brought forward on May 21, 2002, by Dalton McGuinty, a Liberal member who was in opposition. Ernie Eves was the Premier at the time; he was a PC Premier. The first quote that I have from Mr. McGuinty’s opposition day motion is, “It’s time to slap a ‘Not-for Sale’ sign on Hydro One.” That’s a direct quote out of Hansard.", "Then, I would like to look at what the current Premier said. On April 2, 2015—basically in response to that, I would say—Premier Kathleen Wynne said, “The fact is that we have to leverage our assets, and we have to work with the private sector.”", "So here we have one member of the Liberal Party, who went on to become a Premier himself, who said we need to say no to the sale of Hydro One, to put a “Not for Sale” sign on it. Fast-forward not even 14 years, and we have a Liberal Premier, who was a minister under Dalton McGuinty, who suddenly feels that the position of the Liberal Party should change and it’s okay to sell off Hydro One.", "I have another quote from Dalton McGuinty, from the same day, May 21, 2002. He had a lot of interesting things to say that day in his opposition day motion.", "“I can’t actually fathom contemplating a multi-billion dollar sale of anything without a good business case to back it up. We’ll let that go for now, but the fact is not only is there no good reason to sell Hydro One, there are numerous very good reasons not to. For a start, it happens to be making money. I want to say that again, because it doesn’t seem to register with the members opposite. Hydro One is making money.”", "There are many things that I would not agree with Dalton McGuinty on—too many to list, in fact—but I happen to agree with him on that one. It’s interesting that suddenly we have a Liberal government who actually justify selling off a public asset that’s making money.", "What’s interesting to note, though, is that when Dalton McGuinty was speaking, he wasn’t speaking to his party a little more than a decade down the road; he was talking to a PC government. The very party that’s standing up here and being the champions of public hydro were actually looking to sell off the same asset that the Liberal government is.", "He then went on to say, “What would possess the government, I mean any government, to sell an asset that generates 300 million some odd dollars every year?”", "I’m not making this up. This is in the Hansard.", "“This government should know that when you turn a natural public monopoly over to the private sector, it is the consumer who ultimately pays the price. Rates would go up. Rates could in fact go up dramatically and there is nothing consumers could do because, as I said, it’s the only game in town.”", "Again, it’s important to note that this was a Liberal member, who went on to become Premier—and we still have members on that side who were on his team when he became Premier—but he was actually talking to a Conservative government that was selling off Hydro.", "Now we have quotes from current sitting members of the Liberal Party that seem to completely contradict what Dalton McGuinty was saying back in 2002. “We’re getting value for the sale and the broadening of Hydro ownership, and we’re investing in transit, in infrastructure.” That is the now Minister of Energy, quoted on September 26.", "So here we have a Liberal member, who was saying that you shouldn’t be selling off Hydro in order to be investing in things because, in fact, it makes money to go back into things like infrastructure; fast-forward to a Minister of Energy, who is saying, “Well, you know what? We realize that we’re not capable of doing the job properly and managing what we have, so we’re going to sell off a money-generating asset in order to be able to meet promises that we’ve made.”", "Then, we have another quote from a current sitting Liberal member: “We have to pay for that, and that’s why we’re looking at our assets to see how we can recycle those assets to build the infrastructure of tomorrow.” That’s the Deputy Premier saying, “You know—okay, we don’t really agree with what we were saying in 2002. In fact, we don’t really know how to pay for the promises we’ve made. We don’t know how to manage this income-producing, revenue-generating tool that we have, so we’re just going to sell it off in order to try to meet promises that we’ve made.”", "It’s interesting to see that we have Liberals, at one point, who very strongly opposed the sell-off of Hydro One, and now we have Liberals who justify the sell-off of Hydro One. I’m not quite sure when their thinking changed, but I can certainly say that the people of Ontario—80%-plus of the people of Ontario—aren’t sure why the Liberals feel they need to sell off our public hydro asset. The people of Ontario didn’t give them the mandate to do that.", "Then I also pulled something else that’s a little more recent, which I found really interesting, because although I’ve kind of browsed through it, I’ve never really gone through it in detail. I thought today, since we have the Conservative Party bringing forward an opposition day motion regarding the sell-off of Hydro—opposing it—it might be interesting to research some of their more recent thoughts around the sell-off of our public asset.", "I’m going to pull quotes from a May 2012 report written by the then leader of the PC Party, Tim Hudak, and signed off on—in fact, his picture is right on it—by Vic Fedeli, the member from Nipissing. It was the white paper, and this part is specifically on hydro. If people haven’t read it, the white paper is quite interesting. It covers all kind of things. If you want to know the Conservative record on anything—education, health, all kinds of stuff—there’s all kinds of wonderful stuff in there. As they’re standing up being the champions for public hydro, for public health care and for public education, you should go through it and actually look to see how they really feel. Their leader at the time, going into the last election, came right out and said, “Let’s fire 100,000 people,” so I think it’s pretty clear, but there’s some really interesting information in the white paper.", "I pulled some quotes specific to hydro. This is the then, 2012, leader of the PC Party: “Establish a system where power is provided by companies competing to offer the best prices.” We talk about language that isn’t clear. We talk about how the Liberal Party says they ran on selling off our public hydro, and we say, “No, actually, that wasn’t clear to the people of Ontario. That’s not what they voted for.” Here we have the Conservative Party using the same kind of language. Mr. Hudak then went on to say, “We are suggesting significant changes in who owns the electricity sector.”", "So I’m going to ask: What has changed from 2012—a platform that they ran on—to now? Because it was very clear in 2012 that their intention was to sell off Hydro, just as it was under the leadership of Ernie Eves. In fact—I could be mistaken, because it was before my time here—I’m pretty sure that it was a union, CUPE Ontario, that brought forward a lawsuit in order to stop the Conservative government from selling off our public hydro system. Fast-forward to now, to the current day: Lo and behold, it’s like Groundhog Day, really. We have CUPE Ontario suing the current government to stop the sell-off of Hydro One.", "Mr. Hudak goes on to say, “We are suggesting policy changes that will unlock the value”—interesting choice of words—“of the public’s huge investment in the sector, while creating a more efficient system that relies on private capital in the future, not more public borrowing.”", "So this was a Conservative member, a leader of the Conservative Party, in 2012, saying that they want to “unlock the value” of our public hydro system. I think, if we dig back through the record, if we look at some of the reports in the media, if we look at some of the comments made from the Liberal side on this issue, they have used the same language.", "Then Mr. Hudak went on to say: “We suggest opening both Hydro One and OPG to investment. The first step would be to negotiate a partial sale to Ontario’s major pension funds. These funds are the largest in Canada and have a strategic demand for long-term investments. That initial sale could later be followed by a public offering of shares to both institutional and retail investors.”", "Now, I don’t think it’s any surprise to anyone in this House or anyone out in the public that the only party who has ever opposed the sell-off of Hydro One and our public hydro assets has been the NDP, has been New Democrats, has been this side of the House, our caucus. I just want to be clear on that, and I have records to back that up.", "But I will say—and again, with Mr. Hudak, there’s not a whole heck of a lot I would ever agree on either, probably even less than I would agree on with Dalton McGuinty. But at least Mr. Hudak was honest enough to put out there to the people of Ontario his intention to sell off our public asset, rather than using words that would be unclear to the people of Ontario, and then using that to say, “We actually did campaign on it.”", "I know my colleagues have a lot to add to it as well. I would love to read some of our quotes into the record as well, but quite frankly, maybe it’s a little boring for some people in this House, because over and over again, we’ve said the same thing: Don’t sell the public hydro system. Don’t sell Hydro One. We’ve been pretty clear on our position.", "I have one last thing I want to say. It’s interesting, very interesting, that during Mr. McGuinty’s May 21, 2002, opposition day motion to stop the sell-off of Hydro One, he said: “The soap opera that has played itself out over the past few weeks has not been worthy of respect. It has been worthy of nothing more than a channel change.” And wait for it; this is a good one, because it relates directly to this motion and the party who has brought it forward. What he said about the PC Party then was, “We have witnessed flip-flops,” and I think that’s what we’re seeing here today.", "It’s interesting; it’s like he had a crystal ball. He knew that if we fast-forwarded to 2016, it would be the same story we were hearing from the PC government in 2002, which is that they haven’t picked a lane, that they will tell the public anything they want to hear in order to get elected. And there’s another quote in here from Mr. McGuinty about the same thing: about how the Conservative government of the day would tell you one thing, tell the next person something else and do anything they could to get elected.", "Although history certainly shows that that’s not case with the Conservative Party, my hope is that this isn’t a flip-flop, that this is a real commitment to the people of Ontario to stop the sell-off of Hydro One, and that if they were to actually form government down the road, they wouldn’t do the exact same thing that the Liberal Party is doing right now; they wouldn’t mislead the people of the province, that they would stand by what they say and they wouldn’t sell off Hydro either." ],

Having grown up in Montreal and gotten politically active fighting for the federalist cause in referendums and having had the privilege of living in Ontario twice in my life, you realize what a magnificent and great country we live in. You also realize that we have a lot of things in common and we often lead and make different decisions in different ways.", "I watched from the mayor’s chair in Winnipeg the Harris government struggling at the time with a problem that, to be fair to them, wasn’t entirely of their making. It was a problem that I think is laid at the feet of all political parties here: that for about 40 years, Ontario spent less per capita on infrastructure than any other province. As a matter of fact, from about 1968 on, Ontario started, under successive governments, to reduce its infrastructure spending on roads, transportation, subways, housing and energy, to a point where it was only spending a fraction.", "I watched this with great interest because at the time, when I was mayor, we were negotiating the sale of Winnipeg Hydro. Its dams and its transmission systems were being assessed and valued to be sold to consolidate with the provincial hydro utility, a single publicly owned utility. So we were paying great attention to that, and I remember the consultants we had saying to me, “Those people in Ontario must be crazy.” You’re taking a monopoly, breaking it up, and what you immediately do is you collapse the value of that monopoly, because a public sector monopoly, if not properly transitioned—and it’s very hard to do this—loses value, because if you control an entire system, that asset has a certain value that it doesn’t when it’s just one of multiple players. And that’s what we now call the $28-billion stranded asset, that $28 billion of lost asset value.", "The Leader of the Opposition wants us to apologize. He’s out asking for apologies. Well, I would suggest that his party apologize to Ontarians for the degradation of what was an asset that—Quebec didn’t sell its hydro utility. Manitoba was consolidating into one. Because we got greater asset value by having one utility in Manitoba rather than two, we saw our asset and public value increase.", "They have to have known that, Mr. Speaker, because during that period of time in the 1990s and the early part of the first decade, everyone understood that because everyone was looking at their utilities and their hydro and their energy for a whole bunch of reasons. I anticipate that what’s good for the goose is good for the gander, and the official opposition will apologize for precipitously and irresponsibly devaluing the public asset and putting $28 billion of lost value on the bills, which our party and our government just finally paid off after 12 years of cleaning up their mess.", "What else did they do in that underinvestment? Well, our nuclear plants, which were the pride of Ontario in the latter part of the last century, went wanting. As a matter of fact, the lack of investment by the parties opposite left decisions by the nuclear regulator in Canada in both 1996 and 1997 to declare that the nuclear fleet in Ontario was barely meeting minimum safety standards and was so badly invested that closure had to be considered.", "What is the second big thing driving energy costs after stranded assets? It is the disinvestment in our nuclear fleet, and now, $15 billion to refurbish one plant. Mr. Speaker, I ask, through you, to our friends opposite: Please explain to me why Ontarians have two or three sets of nuclear reactors that are doing repair and refurbishment work that should have been done 30 years ago, 40 years ago, 20 years ago.", "When you and I ran, Mr. Speaker, we knew these things. These were front page news stories. The fleet was in trouble, safety standards couldn’t be met and tens of billions of dollars of repair and maintenance on the nuclear fleet had not been done. I know the member from Leeds–Grenville was there, because he and I were mayors at the time. I remember when we went to the Federation of Canadian Municipalities and one of the popular topics of conversation was the poor state not just of Ontario’s nuclear generation, but the transmission system. One of the biggest expenditures in my Winnipeg days was the refurbishment of Manitoba’s transmission system.", "Of course, you know that when you’re mayor or a Premier, you get these reports that compare your system to all the others. The opposition loves these things because they find any unfavourable comparison and that forms the basis of question period. They can’t quite seem to explain that of the 10 provinces, no one came close to that level of underinvestment in transmission.", "The third-largest cost now that we are struggling with with our electricity rates in this province is $8 billion that we had to invest to repair and replace critical infrastructure—and that’s not even including the damage that was done during the ice storm. We all know that much of the damage done during the ice storm was made quantum worse because the system was in a poor state of repair. Not only was it badly repaired by any reasonable standard, it was not up to climate resilience, because there had been no climate action planning taken on our basic infrastructure, because the governments of the day didn’t believe in climate change. As a matter of fact, I have to commend the member for Simcoe North for his discovery a few months ago that climate change actually exists. It would have been helpful to the wallets of Ontarians if he and his colleagues had discovered this a decade ago, like the rest of the word." ],

Ontario, for the entire province, was spending $1 billion to $3 billion—less than a province of a million people. Since the official opposition is in the apology business, let me add that.", "Maybe you could explain why you only invested a fraction of 1% of our GDP in infrastructure when everyone else in Canada was spending 5% or more. That has been recognized for 50 years as that. As a matter of fact, it was John Robarts, a very fine former Conservative Premier, who was the last Premier before we came into power who actually spent 5% of Ontario’s GDP. From the 1940s to the late-1960s, Ontario led the country proudly under that party. They have lost their way for 50 years. And clearly today, since they find apologies poor substitutes for investment, that’s what you will get—you’ll get a party that wants to have it both ways, wants to change positions, wants apologies and can’t explain their own program or how they would maintain Ontario now at the 5% threshold and exceeding it with the federal partners who finally did that.", "The member from Simcoe North sat in a federal government that also happens to have had the worst record in modern times on investments in green energy and renewables and did nothing but pump money into fossil fuels and oil extraction. And the members of that government from this province sat back while billions of dollars of subsidies went into oil sands and zero came to Ontario for green energy, which was ironic since how many of them were former Conservative cabinet ministers who oversaw the lost decade of energy here.", "Then what about health, Mr. Speaker? Since we closed coal plants, premature deaths in hospitals from respiratory-related illnesses have dropped by 23%, and 41% since 2004. That is one of the biggest health improvements—loss of asthma—in seniors going healthy. We recognized, as the Premier did—because she demonstrates a certain amount of humility. Of 107 politicians in here, and three leaders, I’ve only heard one ever actually have the courage and decency to say, “Sometimes we make mistakes because we’re just human like the other 14 million people and, while we are very proud of our record here—we’re going to double down and do that.”", "How are we doing that, Mr. Speaker? We’re taking $8 billion, the largest amount going into energy home retrofits—$1.1 billion for low-income people in private apartments to dramatically reduce their emissions and cut those. We are going to retrofit every single residential building in Ontario to net zero, which will be much less expensive. Already, companies like Sifton in London, Royalpark Homes in Barrie and Stanton in Etobicoke are building homes that don’t come with heating and cooling bills because they have dura-thermal, they have heat pumps. They have those technologies.", "We are leading a green revolution in low-cost, affordable, redistributive energy, which is going to be one of the biggest reductions. When you look at Switzerland and you look at other jurisdictions that have done that, we know it works because we can see it working, Mr. Speaker.", "We have taken the HST off and we are now dealing with the other side over the next couple of years, having fixed the system, having decarbonized it.", "And who do they compare us to on rates? First of all, they don’t understand overnight loads. We don’t lose money on it. We’re not subsidizing it in other jurisdictions. But they love to compare us to Quebec and Manitoba. Well, Manitoba is a province of a million people who, long ago, paid for its entire fleet of hydro dams. It’s like competing with a business that’s been in the family for five years and has paid off its mortgage. Manitoba makes a small fortune selling to US jurisdictions at a high rate of return, as does Quebec.", "So find a jurisdiction that has closed coal plants, that has actually made the tough decisions that have given the health dividends, that have taken this city from 56 smog days a year to zero. Find a jurisdiction to compare us to that has shown that kind of bold environmental and health leadership.", "Why are they having such trouble doing that? Because there’s no comparator. No one has done it." ],

Their initiatives have undermined the economy of this province. They’ve made life incredibly difficult for families. They’ve made it very difficult, frankly, for businesses to operate. For all of those reasons, Kathleen Wynne, who said that she had made mistakes and needed to apologize, needs to talk concretely about the things that she did that have made life difficult for people in this province.", "I also think that, at the bare minimum—the bare minimum—the Liberals have to stop the sell-off of Hydro One. They’ve sold too much already. The idea that they would continue on, undermining this province, undermining our economy, undermining our households, is completely outrageous.", "There’s no question, Speaker, that the ongoing privatization of the electricity system by the Liberals, who followed the initiatives that were started by the PCs before them, have been detrimental to Ontario. The ongoing privatization: You can see it in the leasing of the Bruce nuclear power plant. That was something that was owned by the people of Ontario and now provides profits on an annual basis of over a half-billion a year. That money shouldn’t be going to private owners; that money should be going to the people of Ontario.", "Not only do we have a problem with private profits adding to people’s hydro bills, we have a problem with these private contracts that have put us in a straitjacket because, the reality is, demand in Ontario has been falling for a decade, and that has been driving up hydro prices.", "We all learned—everyone in this chamber learned—through the experience of the gas plants scandal that Ontario’s system has been set up to protect private profit. Our ability to say, “We no longer need this particular piece of infrastructure” is dramatically hampered. It’s handcuffed by this privatization. That is why the cancellation of those contracts was so expensive; that is why they were relocated: because we were on the hook for 20 years of profits—20, Speaker. That protection of private profits, that constraint on our ability to plan and manage electricity, has been a huge problem for Ontario. It has meant overproduction of power in the range of about $2 billion worth of power every year, which we sell at 25 cents on the dollar. We lose money on those exports.", "This is a government that has ignored all of that until it got into politically very choppy waters. Now it can see the water coming over the gunwales. They can see themselves in deep trouble. We’re starting to get a verbal—a rhetorical—recognition that there’s a problem. But never—never—have we heard the Premier stand up and say, “I was wrong to sell off Hydro One; frankly, I was wrong to not tell the truth about selling off Hydro One. I didn’t tell anyone when I ran in 2014, I denied it in the fall of 2014, and then I sold it.” Speaker, not a word—a general sense that mistakes were made, but not the detailing.", "There’s no question that Ontario is going to have to continue to invest in renewable power because we have to make the transition away from fossil fuels. We will need those investments in renewable power, no doubt about it, particularly now that technologies like wind power are coming in at 6.5 cents a kilowatt hour—amongst the cheapest power in this province.", "When I questioned the Minister of Energy a few weeks ago in estimates about the renewal of contracts with private gas-fired power plants, he would make no commitment that those contracts would be set aside. There’s an opportunity to actually reduce cost to the system and give people a break. That power we don’t need.", "I actually had a chance at public accounts the other day to look at a spreadsheet showing the cost of the different forms of power. Private gas-fired power in this province: 17 cents a kilowatt hour—17 cents—about two and a half times the cost of wind in this province.", "This government should be looking for those opportunities to get out of those private contracts, bring generation back into public hands, balance generation with demand, and make the transition from a fossil-based system to a renewable, carbon-free system. That’s what it needs to do. Instead, it’s engaged in privatization, privatization and privatization. That’s where it’s headed.

We also got a stranded debt on top of that. We didn’t pay the bills because we artificially depressed electricity prices. With that lack of investment—as a number of members have said—we ended up having a challenge in 2003. Our power was not reliable. We didn’t have a reliable electricity system here in Ontario. What is the cost of reliability? What’s the cost?", "I know that we talked about the phasing out of carbon. One of the things that’s really big in terms of a good thing is eliminating the coal-fired plants. We’ve heard about the health care costs. We have $4 billion in health care costs saved; rates of childhood asthma are way down; rates of premature death are way down. It’s hard to quantify the value of that, but I think we all know—all of us who have children and have aging parents—that those things are important to us.

I won’t go down that road.", "Let’s go back to 1995: The Atomic Energy Control Board told Ontarians that they were considering shutting down our nuclear plants because of the number of incidents and their concerns over safety—1995. It didn’t just happen in isolation one year that all of a sudden things were really bad in 1995; they got that way somehow. We were all there, right? The members opposite were there. The members opposite, over there, were there. We were there before the members over on the other side, in terms of our responsibility in the system.", "It’s nice to cry out for an apology, but I don’t think—I can’t support the motion because I don’t think that that’s actually productive in any way. I really don’t. We have to be straightforward about what the challenges and the pressures are in our system. We know that there are pressures on people because of electricity prices because of the decisions that we made—that people made in what they thought were the best interests. We had choices. Are we going to go to green energy? Are we going to get out of burning coal or not? We got out of burning coal. That had a cost. It was important that we do that, not just because it’s good and healthy for our families, but in 10 years or even in five years, there will be a price on carbon. Even the Leader of the Opposition agrees on that. We are going to have to have an electricity system that fits into that world economy. No matter what’s going on today, we’re going to have to be there.", "Now the other challenge—and the member from Toronto Danforth, who I have a lot of respect for, says that we have an oversupply of power. We do. But you want to know what? You’ve got to plan power—you’re not just planning it five years out; it’s seven years until you get a project. So you have to take a look at the growth in your economy to make those plans. Everybody will admit that we have a surplus of power. It’s there. It’s evident. You can find it. You can go to the web and find it in about 30 seconds. That information is available to people.", "So here’s your choice: Would you rather that we know the lights are going to come on? Or would you rather not? Can you can build an economy—and ask people in India about an economy where you can’t rely on a source of power. Ask people in those jurisdictions where they don’t know whether or not they’re going to have power that day. There are some places in the world that are developing—California was that way, at one point, where there was no reliability in the power system. How can you build an economy on that? To be fair, I’m going to say where I stand: I think that you need to ensure that you have power there. I would rather have more than less, because you’re not going to build an economy on less, that’s for sure.", "Back to what I was saying earlier: We all recognize, because we all see this in our own constituencies, with people who are having a really hard time not just meeting the pressures on their electricity bills, but other things in life—those are the things that we need to look at.", "One point I wanted to make: The member from Windsor West asked, “What has changed?” I did mention earlier about Ernie Eves closing the coal plants even though he wasn’t around. So what has changed is that things seem to change over there with some frequency, like, “I believe in this, but now I believe in that. I wrote a letter. I didn’t write a letter.”", "You know what? Firefighters—and they were here today. Did everybody meet with their firefighters? Great bunch. I think if you go to the firefighters and say, “You know what? I really believe in interest arbitration,” and then you go to municipal leaders and say, “You know what? Don’t worry, we’re going to take care of interest arbitration,” it’s no good saying to people what they want to hear because, once you land in the spot—gosh, I hope that never happens—you’re going to have to make a decision about what lane you pick. So you’re going to need to pick lanes. I don’t think that this motion is talking about picking lanes. I don’t think asking for apologies when we all bear responsibility is an appropriate motion.", "I would like to suggest to the members opposite that we focus on the things that we can do for people, not on apologies. We have a debate. It’s fair for us to disagree. That’s what you’re here for: You’re here to push us. We’re here to try to do what we believe is in the best interests as expressed not only by the people who we serve, but expressed by the members opposite. I take what every member opposite has to say very seriously.", "But I think, if you want to put a motion forward, it might be a little bit better if you put a motion forward that speaks to what it is we can do for people as opposed to asking for an apology. I just don’t think it’s—I won’t use the word that I was thinking because somebody might stand up.", "I want to thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, for letting me have this opportunity to debate.

That’s the former Auditor General himself telling us that.", "With respect to rates, you have among the highest rates in North America, but you have by far the highest all-in price in North America when you include delivery charges, which have skyrocketed. Delivery charges have skyrocketed because you have run high-voltage power lines down side roads that had regular power lines just to meet the two windmills at the end of the road or the two solar panels. You’ve done hundreds and hundreds of extra miles and incurred hundreds of millions of dollars in new costs. You forget to mention that to the people of Ontario. We’re paying for every kilometre of that wire that wasn’t necessary—you might want to remind people about that—just to fit your stupid green energy plan, which has turned out to be an enormous generational cost to the people of Ontario. I don’t know how you’re going to get out of it. As was said today by many people, there’s an apology from the Premier, but there are no concrete solutions." ],

The opposition day motion is an important motion to get from this government a clear admission of their mistakes.", "It’s also very timely, the fact that this motion comes just after the Premier spoke to her party faithful and indicated that yes, indeed, she has made a mistake on this file. A formal apology goes a long way.", "Let’s talk about some of the problems in the electricity system. I think one of the things that the Liberal government is doing which is very damaging to the discussion around where we want to go as a society and as a province is that whenever someone raises the issue of high energy prices, the government quickly starts pointing fingers at the eradication of coal. The problem with this line of argument is that it opens up the door to those who want to see coal reinstated. When you start blaming the high energy prices on closing down coal, which is the right thing to do, you’re opening up this wrong-headed area of discussion.", "The reality is, if you look at the facts—the facts are pretty clear—the beginning of the problem, one of the major problems with the electricity system, is privatization. The privatization of electricity production, started by the Conservatives, opened up the door to many of the contracts which were quite costly, were not negotiated appropriately.", "With these contracts for green energy, the problem wasn’t the green energy, and every time you do this complaint and the Conservatives complain about green energy, they again venture down this path of saying that green energy is somehow wrong. It’s not green energy that’s at fault; it’s the way the contracts were negotiated, and the way they were negotiated was allowed because the Conservatives allowed for the private production of electricity. If it was publicly produced, we wouldn’t be in this position. If the Conservatives hadn’t opened up the door and said, “You can privately produce electricity,” it wouldn’t have opened up the doors to these contracts that we’ve seen which have been so costly.", "Using coal as an excuse for why energy is so high first opens up this wrong discourse which we don’t want to enter into, because the real problem is the mismanagement. Let’s look at the evidence. We have such clear evidence. The government has seen what happened. As soon as the production was privatized, costs went up. Now that they’re selling off our distribution, privatizing the distribution, we’re losing our ability to pay down the debt. It’s a simple scenario.", "We have had over the years a legacy of building up the electricity system, and we have some debt. There have been some bad decisions by the government, so we have some debt. Now, when the government sells off our hydro, we’re losing a source of revenue. This is a fact. When you sell off 60%, then 60% of the revenue that used to go into the public coffers no longer goes into the public coffers. No one can challenge that argument, right? That argument is solid: 60% of the revenue we used to receive is now going to go to private hands. It’s not going to stay in the province.", "Well, that means 60% less revenue to pay down the debt with respect to electricity assets, so it’s putting us in a worse position. It’s making it so that it’s more difficult to pay back the costs that have been built up over the years. We have less of a capacity to do that, which is going to drive up electricity costs. That’s a direct decision that this government has made.", "On top of that, some of the key problems—the government has not been able to manage the electricity system in terms of ensuring that we produce the amount of electricity that we need, that we consume. The overproduction of electricity has resulted in these very costly decisions to sell—not to sell, but to pay other jurisdictions to take our electricity. All of these decisions that the government has made are why costs are so high.", "Again, I implore you: If you really believe in fighting climate change, if you really believe in addressing the problems that we face in terms of our environmental impact and the problems that we face with respect to the environment, please don’t continue to blame and say that it’s because you had to shut down coal plants that electricity prices went up. That’s not the reason. Shutting down coal plants was the right decision and actually puts us in a better position for the health of the people of this province, but stop using that as a discourse because you open up the argument that you’ll see some Conservatives and some folks who don’t believe in addressing climate change start to say, “Well, exactly. It’s because of that, and we need to now open up those coal plants.” Just accept the reality: It’s because of your poor management and your bad decisions with respect to the energy system.", "In addition, bills like Bill 135, which took away the transparent, evidence-based decision-making around electricity, took away the non-partisan decision-making around how to structure our electricity system in this province—passing bills like that, that resulted in the path that we’ve gone upon right now. When the government decided to make decisions in our electricity system based on partisanship, not looking at what’s in the best interests, what’s based on the data, not looking at what’s the most effective way to provide electricity in this province, not looking at things from an objective lens, that was another path that this government went down that created the problem that we’re in today.", "Here’s some advice. The argument that you raise time and time again that you’re selling off the electricity system to build infrastructure—nobody buys that argument. First of all, the argument doesn’t make any sense. It’s a very simplistic argument, and if you start looking at the numbers, your promises are in the hundred-billion-plus range and the money raised by the sale of Hydro One only accounts for a net revenue that’s going to go towards infrastructure potentially, maybe, of $4 billion. You have promises that well exceed $100 billion, $130 billion, and you’re raising $4 billion. To suggest that you needed that $4 billion to somehow fulfill a promise of $130 billion just does not make logical sense. No one buys that argument. It’s a false argument. It’s just so shallow. It doesn’t hold any weight. It’s such a superficial argument. Anyone can see through that.", "Then, on the other hand, you know that the revenue that you can generate is close to $1 billion a year, then yes, it’s probably better to borrow off of that revenue of $1 billion a year than to sell it off and no longer have it at all and have no future source of revenue. Yes, it is probably better. I don’t know why. I’m not an economist, but it’s pretty basic to look at that. It makes a lot more sense to borrow off of a billion-dollar revenue than to sell it off and never have that revenue anymore. That doesn’t make any sense.", "And better than me giving you this advice, we have independent people who have looked at this decision as one of the worst decisions this province has ever made. The government likes to talk about the 407 any time one of them talks about selling off Hydro One. Yes, I agree with you. The sale of the 407 was a horrible decision. It was a horrible decision, but look at this: You don’t have to drive on the 407. Many people don’t drive on the 407. You don’t have to use the 407. You have to use electricity. You’re selling off something that’s absolutely necessary. You’re selling something that everyone needs and, as society moves forward, more and more people will need. We will need to move towards more use of electricity as we see vehicles that are being produced that are electricity-based. As we see society moving away from fossil fuels, we are going to become more and more reliant on electricity.", "So, while you complain about the sale of the 407, at the end of the day you don’t need to take that highway. It was a bad decision; don’t get me wrong. That was a horrible decision. The government sold out the people of Ontario, the Conservative government absolutely did, but keep this in mind: You’re doing something far worse. It’s far worse because it’s sold forever. This was a lease. The government sold off a lease. At least in 99 years we’ll get it back. We’ll get it back in 99 years. Are we going to get back the electricity system in 99 years? You can’t nod your head to that because you know we’re not going to get it back. In 99 years, we’re not getting back Hydro One. Once you sell it off, it’s gone.", "I think this government needs to finally acknowledge their decisions just don’t make sense. Their decisions don’t make sense on an objective level. They don’t make sense on a principle level. They’re putting our province in a worse position than it was before.", "This is the problem with these types of decisions: They’re not only going to hurt people right now—and we know people in the north are struggling and people in rural communities are struggling because of this government’s poor decisions around the electricity file—but you’re creating a legacy that is going to impact future generations, because the sale of Hydro One is not just going to impact this generation; it’s going to impact generations to come, future generations. It is going to forever impact this province. It will literally go down—and I’ll tell you this now: When you read about this 10 years from now, 20 years from now, this will go down as one of the worst decisions ever made by an elected provincial government in the history of Ontario, this decision to sell Hydro One. Without a doubt, it will go down as one of the worst decisions, and this is a legacy of the Liberal government. This is a legacy of a government that does not respect the people of this province, did not ask the people of this province to make this decision, did not request any sort of permission to sell off this public asset that belongs to the people of Ontario.", "For 100 years, the people of this province built up the electricity system, they built up the transmission grid, and this government, with a stroke of the pen, without any sort of consultation with the people who built this up, has agreed to sell it off.", "That’s where we are. I think it’s absolutely important for us to make sure we support green energy initiatives and make sure we blame the privatization and not the green energy initiatives, make sure we blame this government’s mismanagement, the overproduction, the lack of objective decision-making, instead having subjective, partisan decision-making when it comes to electricity. These are reasons why we’re in the position we are, and that’s why we absolutely need to have a formal apology by this government. That is the will of this House." ],

We had a fairly good discussion with the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change about why, if you really want to think about who needs to apologize here, there’s a lot more reason on the other side of the House for apologies than there is, certainly, on this side of the House.", "We’ve made much hay of the fact that this weekend, the Premier, as the minister pointed out, with great bravery, did a mea culpa and talked about—because we are an extraordinarily activist government doing a lot of things in a lot of different areas. We have fixes going on in a whole raft of different ministries, things that need critical attention and care too, and I think what the Premier said was, “I’m apologizing not for the things that we’ve done, but maybe for some of the things we haven’t done, which was to pay closer attention to the hardships that were resulting from the very important fixes that we brought into the system.”", "Let’s be very, very clear. The Premier: It’s her vision of infrastructure renewal. It’s her vision of climate change and creating an electricity system in our province that is clean and green. She has much to stand up and be proud of and needn’t apologize for a bit of it. But what she did say—and I was there at the convention, as so many of my colleagues were. We were there at the convention and we heard the messaging, and the messaging was around that she understands, as we all do, the hardships that some people are experiencing with electricity pricing.", "Right off in the throne speech, we were very clear that we were taking immediate action to remove HST from that—8% savings across. That’s an important issue. We shouldn’t be receiving government revenues on top of the costs associated with the clean, green, reliable system we have, so we pulled that back. And there’s further recognition that in remote communities in the rural areas and the north, particularly for those who are struggling to heat on electricity alone, it’s a disproportionate cost to rural Ontario compared to those in my community, for instance, who have the luxury of gas.", "The member from Renfrew–Nipissing–Pembroke goes on about, “Every single member over there knows.” My constituents aren’t up in arms about their hydro bills, to be very clear about that. I get calls; they’re concerned. I ask them, “What was your hydro bill this month?” “320 bucks.” That’s over two months in Toronto; a Toronto Hydro bill is over two months. So that’s $160 a month.", "Then, when you point out to them that they’re heating with gas, they’re using gas in their stove, they’re using gas for their water and that gas prices are at an all-time low, they suddenly realize, “Well, this is just a lot of hysteria.” It’s a lot of hysteria that’s drummed up by members of the third party, particularly in my community, where they have flyering at the subways and in the neighbourhood. They picket every single community hall meeting to stop the hydro thing, but the message doesn’t carry. In my community, which was held by the NDP and the CCF for the last 54 years, except for a four-year break with the Tories, that message doesn’t fly. It’s not an issue for us, and it’s not an issue for a lot of people who are serviced by natural gas for heating purposes.", "Let’s be very clear: The Premier has nothing to apologize for when it comes to fixing the transmission system. It’s interesting to hear the member from Simcoe–Grey acknowledge in the House today his irresponsible role in both breaking up Ontario Hydro as it once was and destroying the combined assets of that corporation. Under his tutelage, under his direction, we ended up leasing out Bruce Power. You talk about the privatization of a generation asset—we’re not doing that with our nuclear assets in the province. We made a very clear decision. That just wasn’t on. But what we’ve done with Hydro One is very important. Under his direction under the previous administration, Hydro One had turned into the most dysfunctional of distributed electrical utilities in the province of Ontario. Just look at the report from the Ombudsman, In the Dark. They’re talking about the legacy of the mess that was left behind with Hydro One across this province. What better way to fix it than to put some private sector discipline into it?", "That’s what we’re already seeing. Customer survey reports at Hydro One are demonstrating that customer satisfaction is way up—way up. By putting the kinds of customer service demands in place, Hydro One has accomplished an incredible purpose.", "We also see it in the asset itself. While it first came out at $21.50—I think the number was—the price per share has gone up to as high as almost $27. If you take that 7% increase in value—we took a corporation by privatizing the operations of it, and we have increased its value by almost 10%. At the moment, we’ve only sold off 30%. But we’ve got the value of that extra 10% in our pockets, working to build better assets in this province. It is extraordinarily important.", "We’ve heard a lot of debate here about excess power. I’ve said it in the House before: My uncle—my godfather, in fact—Larry Higgins, a wonderful man, a chief forecaster for Ontario Hydro during the period that we built our nuclear stuff, was very clear in talking about the surplus of electricity generation in the province: that, just like John A. Macdonald and his drink, a little bit too much is probably the right amount.", "Speaker, understand that when you provide for an electrical generation system, it’s important that you have excess supply to keep the system reliable. Right now, Speaker, I’ll tell you, we’re generating something on the order of 17.9 megawatts of power from various sources, and our demand is somewhere in the area of 16.8. Do the math: That’s a little bit above 5% of excess generation over the demand. It’s important to have that in the system, so you have the flow-through back and forth.", "When we took over the transmission system, which was left as a legacy by the member from Simcoe–Grey, after that 2003 blackout—a bird on a wire and a utility in the US somehow shut down 60% of the power in our province because the system was so broken. Transmission lines were falling. Transformers were burning out. It was an absolute disaster. So we have nothing to apologize for there." ],

We would talk about that the equivalent of a jumbo jet would land and crash in the middle of the GTA every year, and nobody noticed because there was one death, two deaths or three deaths at a time in emergency rooms across the province. That has been reduced dramatically. We’re very proud of that legacy. We’ve had a chance to rebuild the generation with clean, green, reliable power.", "It is absolutely critical that our energy system—we’ve done the heavy lifting so that we are almost at 93% clean energy, on average, in the province of Ontario, because that’s the advantage we now have in our climate change action plan to modernize our economy and move to a carbon-free economy.", "I know the members opposite have trouble getting around the fact—are they with us in understanding and believing climate change is real?

We are guaranteeing that the taxpayers of Ontario are getting the best value for their buck.

We’ve also heard from businesses who are concerned they will have to close their doors if hydro rates are not addressed.", "So Ontarians aren’t satisfied when the Premier admits she made a mistake.

I asked when most electricity is used, they told me that 90% is off peak, meaning I’m doing everything I was asked to do and yet are being penalized for it. As a family trying to make ends meet, how are we supposed to live?”", "Another individual wrote me and said, “Our monthly hydro bills have been between $395-$400 a month! I make sure that I do my laundry after 7 or on weekends, pretty much all my lights in my home are off, I’ve even started to unplug appliances and still my hydro is high. I work full-time and my husband runs his own business in Orangeville. We are living paycheque to paycheque due to the cost of hydro. Something has to change. If prices go up any more I’m not sure what we will do.”", "This one is a little personal for me, Speaker. I had a friend of mine whose wife was very ill and passed away in July. From February to July, she used medical devices at home and had an oxygen concentrator, which was obviously working 24/7. His hydro bills by the time his wife passed away were $1,400 a month. He said that it’s probably going to take him a year to pay those bills. He doesn’t begrudge the fact that he was keeping his wife at home. What he begrudges is that when he was at his most vulnerable, when his wife was palliative, he was getting dinged every single month by this government. It’s a sad example of what medically necessary equipment can do to increase hydro usage. And there are thousands of people who have no choice when they use electricity.", "Another individual wrote, “You want to see horror stories. There are people who have monthly hydro bills in the thousands. They are losing their homes because they can’t pay. Elderly are sitting in the dark with no heat because they can’t pay. Wynne has done nothing but hurt the residents of Ontario with all the hydro increases because Hydro One is so poorly mismanaged.” If a private sector company was trying to do the same thing, we would be turning them away. “Do the Liberals want to make Ontario a ghost province...?” Because they are going to do it in the way they’re heading right now. “Businesses are jumping ship, jobs are scarce.… We need help and we need it now before they completely destroy Ontario.”", "I strongly agree, Speaker, and there is no one who is telling me that an 8% rebate is going to make any difference at all in their hydro bills.", "As we head into the Christmas season, I’m thinking that the Liberal Wynne government is going to be the Scrooge that steals Christmas, because no one is going to be able to afford their Christmas lights.

What are you going to do to correct those actions, to undo the misdeeds that you’ve done? People across our province are suffering, and I haven’t heard a single thing yet where she said, “I made a mistake, and here’s what I’m going to do tomorrow to start to address it.”", "Is she going to cancel any further sales of Hydro One shares, an asset owned by the people of Ontario—and/or will she put a moratorium on any more green energy projects that require subsidies? Mr. Speaker, it’s going to cost $133 billion over the next 20 years because of that decision.", "Has she stepped up and said, “I made a mistake and I’ll stop it in its tracks”? No, she hasn’t, Mr. Speaker. Is she going to ask the Liberal Party, her cronies in Ontario, to repay the $300 million it wasted on energy scandals, millions paid by the hard-working taxpayers of Ontario?", "Will she repay to the taxpayers the $12 million she wasted for consultants and then put every penny of it towards hydro relief for low-income families? If you recall, Mr. Speaker, I believe about $9.2 million went to consultants and about another $2.7 million to actually advertise and market the program. How much money actually got to the front line, to the people who need those relief efforts? Is she going to apologize to them? I’m not certain.", "What about the $28 million she lost in a lawsuit to Windstream, and the other $179 million she lost in a court case with energy producers? This is all money that could be going to the front line, to the people less fortunate, to the people who need community and social services, to our seniors, to our long-term-care facilities where people are on waiting lists.", "Again, Mr. Speaker, she admitted that mistakes were made, but it remains unclear what exact mistakes and what she is going to do, what she is going to commit to, so that we can truly believe—this is about trust. Saying that you made a mistake means nothing. It’s hollow unless you’re actually going to step up and say, “This is what I will do tomorrow to start to address that and to make amends for those poor decisions.”", "As the saying goes, whatever could not be said clearly was probably not thought clearly through either. For this reason, I support the call for a formal apology to the people of Ontario for the Liberal scandals, waste and mismanagement by the Premier and all of the people on that side of the House who stand behind her. She has made mistakes, but we want to know exactly what mistakes she admits to making, and what she’s going to do to reverse the misdeeds and the pain and the suffering of the people who truly have been impacted by these poor decisions, by these mistakes that she has admitted to making." ],

There’s a lot that’s captured by this bill. There are three main elements to the legislation itself. As many in the House will recall, a number of weeks ago I joined with the Premier here in Toronto, in a community known as Leaside, to make the formal announcement relating to our government’s decision to move forward with the elements in this legislation. Just to point them out off the top of debate this morning—first of all, this legislation, which is known as the Safer School Zones Act, would, if passed, provide municipalities with the option to use three particular road safety tools. I’ll highlight those quickly, Speaker.", "The first one is something we call automated speed enforcement. It is also known, of course, as photo radar. This would provide municipalities across the province with the power and the authority, should they choose, to proceed with implementing automated speed enforcement, using technology to deal with some of the challenges around drivers who still, notwithstanding all of the great efforts made by our government and others, including our road safety partners—to encourage people to drive more responsibly through two critical areas of communities: school zones and community safety zones.", "Speaker, I want to stress that through this legislation, automated speed enforcement or photo radar will not be implemented on provincial highways. This is unique in that it will provide power to the municipalities, should they choose to deploy this technology, to help deal with challenging road safety issues in school zones and community safety zones.", "The second element is reducing default speed limits, regarding what municipalities will have the power to deal with. Again, this is all about empowering municipalities, enabling them, giving them the tools to make decisions for themselves and their residents when it comes to the default speed limits.", "Many in this House will know that the default speed limit in the province of Ontario in urban settings is 50 kilometres an hour. But there is very clear recognition from our Premier and our government that our municipal partners, our municipal leaders, will often—in fact, in almost all cases—know better than we will here at Queen’s Park what the unique requirements are in their neighbourhoods and in their communities. Again, this is about empowering them to make decisions as it relates to that particular point.", "The third element deals with the red light camera program, a program that has existed for some time in the province of Ontario. It provides municipalities with the opportunity to gain access or entry to the program. It smooths out the transition, or it smooths out the efficiency, making it easier for them to gain entry into the program. The red light camera program, as I mentioned, has existed in the province for some time. This simply strengthens it and makes it easier for municipalities to participate.", "Speaker, there are a couple of things I should mention now that I have laid out what the key points are in the legislation. First of all, we have heard from a number of municipalities across the province over the last couple of years. Literally since the first few weeks that I was on the job as Minister of Transportation starting back in June 2014, not only have we heard from municipalities, but a number of members on the government side have been talking about some of these issues for a number of years. I don’t want to limit it to just this individual, though he is a good friend and a seatmate, but—I’m talking about the Attorney General, the member from Ottawa Centre, who has been talking not only to me, but also been talking with his community, with neighbourhoods, with parents and with other community groups in Ottawa Centre about the importance of making sure that we provide municipalities with those powers, those tools, to make decisions for themselves.", "I know that in the case of Ottawa Centre and in communities right across the province of Ontario, we have heard from municipal leaders who say, “We understand that there needs to be an overarching requirement to set the rules of the game, to set the table, as it were.” But very often, when you’re sitting in Queen’s Park, despite your best intentions, despite wanting to make sure you build on the phenomenal track record that the Ministry of Transportation has and has had historically as it relates to road safety, we often confront challenges, particularly in school zones and community safety zones, particularly as it relates to default speed limits that need to be sculpted and need to be nimble, because of the challenges we’re facing.", "Whether we’re talking about Ottawa Centre, or whether we’re talking about communities like Leaside that have unfortunately witnessed their own tragedies historically as it relates to these issues, or about communities right across the province of Ontario, the notion is that we can work closely with our municipal partners and provide them with the tools so that they can go through a process to determine at a grassroots level, at a neighbourhood-by-neighbourhood level, what makes the most sense for them. Again, I want to acknowledge the contribution and the relentless pursuit, the relentless advocacy, of the Attorney General on behalf of his community, and all others on this side of the House who recognized very early on that this was the right way for our government to move, or the right way for our government to go.", "I talked off the top about the fact that there are a number of communities for which this is extremely important. I should say that there are a number of communities very specifically—and I think it’s important for us to recognize which communities. Whether we’re talking about the automated speed enforcement piece or we’re talking about the requests regarding reducing, amending or sculpting the default speed limit, literally the list of communities that asked us for this power, this support, this authority, would include the cities of Ottawa, Toronto, Hamilton; Oxford county; Chatham-Kent; Oshawa; York region, which, of course, has a number of communities that are part of York region, including Markham, Richmond Hill, Georgina, East Gwillimbury, my own home city of Vaughan, Nottawasaga; and the region of Waterloo. Those are the communities that made the request regarding automated speed enforcement. On the default speed limits, in addition to that list I just gave, Ottawa, Toronto, Kingston and Smith-Ennismore-Lakefield are some of the communities that talked to us about the importance of moving forward on default speed limits.", "Many times in this Legislature over the last two years, in response to questions and in debate, I have talked at length about the very proud track record that we have here in the province of Ontario as it relates to road safety. One of the lines that I know members on all sides of the House have heard me say repeatedly is that for the last 13 years, as it relates to road or highway safety, Ontario ranks first or second across all North American jurisdictions. You don’t have a track record like that by accident. In fact, in one of those years, the only jurisdiction that was better off in some respects than the province of Ontario was the District of Columbia, which goes to show that when you compare Ontario, with its road network and with its population, we are only in that particular area beaten out by a much smaller jurisdiction, the District of Columbia.", "By and large, as I said, you don’t amass a record like that by accident. Regardless of partisan strife, regardless of which particular provincial government we’re talking about, you do it when your Ministry of Transportation, working very closely with all of our road safety partners, including those who are represented in the gallery today—when you are focused exclusively on those outcomes, and, when you recognize that there are significant challenges within the system, that you work together, that you partner and collaborate together, so that you can produce positive outcomes.", "Of course, one of the first—in fact, the first piece of legislation that I introduced in this House was Bill 31, the Making Ontario’s Roads Safer Act, which, when you look at the component parts of that legislation, pulls together much of what had previously been contained in two other pieces of legislation brought forward by predecessors of mine in this ministry. We consolidated those elements into one bill. We added some other pieces, particularly around dealing with sanctions for drug-impaired driving for the first time ever. We consolidated all of those elements and brought forward Bill 31. We had significant debate here in this Legislature, and certainly at committee and elsewhere, on Bill 31. I would say that perhaps my proudest moment over the last two and a half years as Minister of Transportation was the day that that legislation passed in this House and did so unanimously. Members from all three caucuses stood in their places to support Bill 31. I think that was a very clear recognition on the part of members on all sides that when it comes to not only maintaining but enhancing and improving upon our road safety record, there’s a requirement to consistently do more.", "From my perspective, it’s an evolutionary process. It’s an evolutionary process that means, among other things, that we have to continue to listen to our municipal partners, who, as I said at the outset of debate this morning, understand in many respects more clearly than we might here in this Legislature what is needed in some of the neighbourhoods that we’re talking about. That would be true whether we’re here in the city of Toronto or, for example, we’re in Waterloo region, which, we have heard, is one of the communities that made the request to the province for more authority to make some of the decisions that are germane to its neighbourhoods and its communities. It’s one of the reasons that we’ve been responsive.", "At the same time, Speaker, we’ve also decided to move forward because we’ve heard loudly and clearly from law enforcement and from our road safety partners about the importance of that evolutionary process, of never resting on our laurels. It’s one thing for a Minister of Transportation to talk about the last 13 years, but we have to consistently look for new and creative and innovative ways to make sure we are ahead of the next challenge. We know—I think everyone here in this House knows, and I’ve certainly heard it in the course of debate over the last number of months—what a significant challenge we face, for example, as it relates to the ongoing struggle against alcohol-impaired driving.", "I mentioned that Bill 31 contains provisions, for the first time ever, introducing sanctions for drug-impaired driving, which is not necessarily a new phenomenon but a growing phenomenon, unfortunately, that we are experiencing here in the province of Ontario.", "Speaker, of course, everyone here will know very clearly about the significant challenge that we face as it relates to distracted driving. That’s one of the reasons that we not only toughened the penalties for distracted driving in Bill 31, as I mentioned, but a number of months ago, the Ministry of Transportation also deployed perhaps the hardest-hitting public relations campaign in the province’s history, a campaign known as Put Down the Phone, to try to drive home, in a compelling way, the message very clearly to our motorists, and I would say, particularly our youngest motorists: When you get behind the wheel of a car or the wheel of any vehicle on our roads and highways in the province or elsewhere, you need to be very focused on the task at hand, which is to keep your hands on the wheel and to keep your eyes on the road, and to not be distracted by hand-helds or other distractions or devices. The consequences, unfortunately, Speaker, are potentially far too great.", "I mention these elements, and there are others that I’ll probably touch upon, to help illustrate how the fight to constantly improve road safety is literally an evolutionary process, because we know that the challenge continues to persist. I think here, with this particular legislation, we see very clearly that we are taking the next important step forward in that evolutionary process.", "I did mention this at the outset: To me, it is fitting that we are debating this particular legislation the day after Family Day. That day that the Premier and I stood along with Mayor Tory, members of law enforcement and representatives from our road safety partners—we actually did the announcement at an elementary school in Leaside. I have to say that Leaside is a community, as I mentioned, that was particularly touched by an extraordinary tragedy as it relates to speeding on quiet residential streets near schools, adjacent to schools. The level of awareness on the part of the parents and the school kids of the importance of making sure that we work with our municipal partners to put in place these kinds of initiatives to help make their own travel from home to school and back again—safer for them, safer for their friends at school and safer for the other parents in the neighbourhood—is something that was truly compelling to them. You could actually see that sort of visceral feedback coming from the community to the Premier, to myself, to the mayor, and to members of law enforcement. There was recognition that these steps, perhaps overdue, were at least steps going in the right direction.", "I should also point out that another colleague of ours on the government side, the member from Eglinton–Lawrence, is someone who has not only served in this Legislature with distinction for a number of years, but on road safety issues, he is someone who has literally been at the leading edge himself, who has consistently spoken to me about the importance of making sure that we hold our own feet to the fire, that we push that envelope a little bit and look at creative ways. I know in the past, and currently, this particular member from Eglinton–Lawrence has brought forward private members’ legislation proposed specifically because he shares that passion that I do, as minister, that we do at the Ministry of Transportation. He shares that passion to make sure that we are striking that right balance and getting it right.", "I know I’ve mentioned the member from Ottawa Centre, the Attorney General, and the member from Eglinton–Lawrence, but there are a number on this side of the House. Frankly, even members of the opposition, both the Conservative and NDP opposition, have spoken to me about the importance of making sure that we get these critical elements right. I know that we’re going to have debate over the course of the day today, and over the course of the coming weeks, on this particular legislation, Speaker. I can’t imagine there being stiff opposition. I don’t want to presuppose the outcome of debate. Obviously, this is legislation that we aspire to and hope to pass, and I suspect that it will, because it’s so important for it to land, and it’s so important for us to provide these powers to enable our municipal partners to make these decisions that are mostly relevant to the challenges they are facing in their own communities. So I do look forward to hearing from members of both the Conservative and NDP opposition—and frankly, members from the government caucus—about their feelings with respect to this legislation.", "I would hope, as I mentioned, that with Bill 31, when we had some vigorous debate, as should be the case in this chamber, that at the end of the day, members on all sides of the House saw the importance of that evolutionary process as it relates to road safety, saw that we had positive outcomes top of mind in Bill 31, and were therefore able to put partisanship aside and support that legislation.", "I would hope, Speaker, number one, when you consider the requests that came from municipalities, and number two, when you would consider that nothing in this legislation compels any of Ontario’s 444 municipalities to do any of what is included in this bill that simply empowers them to make decisions locally that matter most to their neighbourhoods—because, again, in some respects I would argue that being closest to their neighbourhoods, they would understand the needs of individual neighbourhoods better than we would here at Queen’s Park.", "Again, I want to stress, for the purposes of debate here, that nothing in this legislation compels a municipality to move in a particular direction, and that we take into account that there is a lot of new technology out there. In this case, we’re talking about photo radar, or automated speed enforcement, that helps make it easier for us to make sure that in terms of providing a penalty for those who would continue to speed through a school zone or a community safety zone despite signage—despite it being, I would argue, second nature to know that when you’re in a school zone, you should not be speeding—in addition to the penalties that would be levied, there is also a deterrent factor, because people would know over the course of time that they were entering a school zone or a community safety zone where there would be automated speed enforcement like what currently exists for our red light camera program. There would be that impediment, and there would be that notion, that public awareness.", "When you combine that with what I would argue should be an innate or inherent understanding, when you’re entering a school zone, of all things—whether we’re talking about school-age children, elementary school-age children, or their parents or grandparents who are walking them to school—that at all times somebody would want to drive through one of those zones at or below the speed limit is second nature, I think, to all of us in this House. But it’s evident from what we hear from law enforcement, from tragic examples that we’ve seen in a number of communities, that we need to do more.", "When you take that into account, combined with what I’ll call the effective or the efficiency measures we’re dealing with on the red light camera program, and the notion that we’re empowering municipalities to make decisions for themselves as it relates to their default speed limit, I would be hard pressed to understand exactly what an opposition—well, not a critique, Speaker, because I understand that this is exactly the place for opposition parties and opposition members to lend their voices to debate and to come forward with questions or concerns they might have. So it’s not criticism, particularly of a constructive nature, that I would be surprised by, but any strident opposition to this particular bill would be a surprise to me, and I think it would be a surprise to our partners in law enforcement. I think it would be a surprise to our road safety partners, like CAA and Parachute and the Ontario Safety League and many others.", "I think it would be a shock to our municipal partners, who would look at this particular legislation and understand that at its core, there are two objectives in this legislation. One is moving the yardsticks forward and demonstrating significant progress in terms of achieving the very important road safety outcomes that we collectively want to achieve and, at the same time, based on that very collaborative and constructive partnership that we have with our municipalities across the province, providing them with the power and the authority to move forward with any or all of these initiatives, should they choose to do so.", "Whether we’re talking about the importance of a constructive, collaborative relationship and providing more support and more enabling power to our municipalities, or we’re talking about those really critical road safety objectives and outcomes that I know everyone here shares—and I know it, Speaker, because there was unanimous support for Bill 31, as I mentioned, and frankly, there have been calls from opposition with respect to pushing the envelope further and looking for more creative ways to drive road safety outcomes. I would be surprised if we didn’t have broad-based support at the same time as vigorous discussion around this particular bill.", "Of course, I would certainly use this opportunity at this particular moment of this debate to encourage members on the other side of the House to engage in that vigorous debate that I expect of them, that we expect of them, but at the end of the day, understanding those crucial twin objectives, to be supportive of these initiatives.", "If they see ways for us to improve the legislation—of course, Speaker, I always want to keep an open mind and have that discussion, as I know we will over the course of the legislative process.", "I think understanding, at the end of the day, that those twin objectives, particularly the objective of making sure that even though statistically we have done well over the last 13 years—we can’t afford to rest on our laurels. We have to keep pushing the envelope forward. The ministry is absolutely determined to consistently look for ways to drive home that message, and also make sure that we have a legislative and regulatory framework in place, working with our municipal partners to make sure that we can produce those outcomes.", "Again, I would sincerely hope that the debate, as it always is in this place, would be rigorous, would be exciting, but at the end of the day, that we would all see a way to be supportive of this particular legislation. As I mentioned earlier, I have heard, not only from colleagues on this side of the House, but from members of both the Conservative and NDP caucuses, about the importance.", "It’s interesting, because when you’re in a large city like Toronto or Ottawa, you hear a certain perspective on many of the issues that we confront in this chamber. When you move to some of our medium-sized and smaller and more remote communities—and I’m not talking about this bill necessarily; I’m talking about generally—you often hear very different perspectives. That’s something that helps all of us do our job better. It’s a fascinating by-product of all of us being in this chamber to debate legislation.", "On road safety initiatives, I would say, it’s interesting to me that the perspective—because something that might work in the city of Toronto may not work in a particular other part of the province—while there is nuance, at its core, the fundamental objectives that we try to pursue when it comes to road safety initiatives are felt in many respects equally across the province.", "I think that goes right to the heart of this particular bill, to Bill 65. We are not in this legislation requiring any particular municipality to do what we are demanding needs to be done. I know often there’s a concern in different parts of the province that there are directives coming from Queen’s Park. People say, “Hey, look, down here on the ground in neighbourhood X or community Y, maybe you didn’t contemplate what that outcome would be.” I understand that tension. I understand that dynamic. Here, with this legislation, what we are particularly doing is saying to municipalities, “We understand there is a challenge.” There is a challenge in communities like Ottawa, like Toronto, like York region, like Oxford county, like Chatham-Kent, like Oshawa, like Nottawasaga and a number of other communities that have taken the time to write in to the government to say, “Provide us with these powers.”", "At AMO conferences and at ROMA/OGRA conferences in the past, I’ve heard directly from many of these municipalities that confront these challenges. They say, “We love the work that MTO is doing as it relates to road safety. We respect that you passed Bill 31, but there are additional tools in the tool kit that are available to you, but we are hampered. We can’t do them without your support, without you enabling us, without you providing us with the authority to proceed.” We have some examples that are embedded in this particular legislation. It’s why, after considerable consultation on a number of these initiatives, we’ve decided to move forward with this legislation.", "I know I’ve said this before in debate this morning, but I think it bears repeating that it really is important for us to understand that this legislation has two philosophical underpinnings:", "(1) Moving forward with initiatives that will, at the end of the day, when municipalities—I am going to say “when” because I know a number of municipalities very strongly desire having the power to move forward and implement some of these initiatives. When municipalities have, should this legislation pass, taken the tools that would be provided, they will actually experience road safety outcomes in their communities that will benefit the population at large. That’s one, and as the Minister of Transportation, that is my most fundamental goal with this legislation.", "(2) There is a very clear recognition here that one level of government working alone, one level of government saying, “We know what is best for you as it relates to matters that impact your own neighbourhoods in this road safety respect,” is not always the best way for us to proceed. Taking that into account, and taking into account the significant and profound input that we have received—from a number of organizations, from law enforcement, from our road safety partners, from mothers and fathers and grandparents across the province, who have spoken to us both informally and formally and said:", "“When I leave my house in the morning in whatever community I reside in in this wonderful province of Ontario and I’m walking my son or my daughter or my grandchild to school, and I’m doing it in a neighbourhood where it’s apparent—the school is right there. I’m in a school zone or we’re in a community safety zone and I am literally the dictionary definition of a vulnerable road user, or my child or my grandchild is, and there is somebody out there driving—maybe they’re late to get to work, maybe they have a delivery that they’re dropping off somewhere in the city and they’ve decided to cut through our neighbourhood; maybe, frankly, they live in the neighbourhood, but they’re late, they’re behind schedule, and they decided on this particular day of all days that they’re going to gun it, that they’re going to exceed the speed limit and they’re going to put themselves and passengers in their vehicle and, worst of all, other users of our roads, including those vulnerable road users, at risk, that’s not acceptable.", "“We have an expectation that our political leaders, whether they’re provincial or municipal or, best of all, working together, will come up with creative solutions that recognize that technology has evolved, that we have a clear need in our particular neighbourhood or our community that we have to move forward with initiatives like this.”", "That’s a message that we can’t ignore, that we won’t ignore. It’s a message that’s right at the heart of Bill 65. It’s why, after this consultation, after listening to those voices, working closely with our municipalities and working closely our road safety partners, we have come together, we have created this legislation and we have brought it forward.", "I have certainly heard from community representatives in every corner of the province that they are happy to see we are moving forward. I think each of our road safety partners would say very clearly that this is an important step forward in that evolutionary process that I referenced a second ago. I fully expect that this will not be the last time that I’m on my feet in this Legislature to talk about how we continue to move that evolutionary process forward.", "I know there are other challenges that we still face on road safety. I know there will be, I expect there will be other initiatives that we’ll bring forward. But at this particular point in time, dealing with these particular elements that are contained in Bill 65, and given that we’ve had historic support externally from law enforcement, municipal partners and road safety partners and, frankly, internally in this chamber from members of the opposition as it relates again to the passage of Bill 31, which passed unanimously, I think we’ve struck the right balance. I think we are moving forward in the right direction.", "I do look forward to the rest of the debate that will occur today and beyond on this bill, but I would close off, before handing it off to the member from Kitchener Centre—I would strongly urge every member in this House to think of our vulnerable road users, to think of the requests that have come in from municipalities and to understand that we’ve struck the right balance, that with Bill 65, we have gotten it right. I would call on them to support this legislation." ],

  "text" : [ "Thank you, Speaker, and good morning and welcome back.", "I’d like to thank the minister for the leadership that he is showing on this very important issue and also say that as a parent of two young children, I know that Bill 65 is of personal interest to him.", "While many of you have heard the minister and me say that people in Ontario deserve to have safer roads, this government is fully committed to making sure that our roads continue to be among the safest in North America. This proposed legislation, the Safer School Zones Act, if passed, is going to ensure that we do maintain safe roads in Ontario. This legislation is going to protect children and other vulnerable road users, and it’s going to reduce collisions and fatalities in urban and rural areas, making our communities safer.", "We know that many municipalities have asked for more tools to improve road safety so that they can be active road safety partners. When I assisted the minister a few weeks ago at the ROMA conference—and for people who are watching at home right now, ROMA is the Rural Ontario Municipal Association; we meet every year and they tell us what their concerns are—I heard from a number of mayors, reeves and councillors from across Ontario who were advocating on ways to slow down drivers who speed through their towns. In fact, one mayor, Margaret Lupton—she’s the mayor of Zorra township— told me, and this is an exact quote and she gave me permission to use this: “Daiene, we are frustrated beyond belief with speeders.” I called her up on Friday to let her know that we would be discussing Bill 65 and she told me something that was very distressing. She said that she was in a coffee shop and this man came up to her and started mocking the speed bumps that they had put in in the town in order to slow down speeders. He said to her, “You know, I can still take these speed bumps at 110 kilometres per hour in my truck.” So clearly, the speed bumps are not working.", "Mayor Lupton and other municipal leaders in Ontario are looking to us for ways to help them make the roads safer. They’re looking for more effective measures. The legislation that we have introduced will, if passed, give municipalities more tools to improve road safety. We are giving them the exact tools that many have asked for. This means that we’re empowering municipalities to implement measures that will work best in their communities.", "We’re very enthusiastic about the support that we’re hearing from municipal leaders across Ontario. That includes support from Waterloo region, my home community. Our police services wrote to our government to request automated speed enforcement, and they’ve shown support for the action that we’re taking through this piece of legislation.", "We recognize that no two municipalities are alike, Speaker; that’s why this legislation is all about giving towns and cities across Ontario lots of different options.", "If passed, the Safer School Zones Act will remove the regulatory approvals process currently in place for the red light camera program to make it easier for municipalities to opt in. This means if they want to do this, they can. They don’t have to come and ask us for permission. This is going to help municipalities enforce red light laws in their communities.", "The Safer School Zones Act will also help municipalities reduce speeds in high-risk areas. Municipalities can create their own safety zones, with lower default speed limits. That’s going to make it easier for them to reduce speeds, thereby making it safer in their communities for pedestrians, cyclists and drivers alike.", "Finally, the Safer School Zones Act will allow municipalities to use automated speed enforcement technology in school zones and community safety zones if they choose to do so. This technology has been around for years. It’s proven to reduce speeding and improve road safety, and it’s going to help keep vulnerable road users safe in these high-risk areas. That’s one of our mandates, to ensure road safety for all road users, particularly in high-risk areas. That includes places where there are high numbers of children and seniors.", "Bill 65 is the latest step our government is taking to provide road safety options to protect those communities as well as vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and cyclists.", "As we saw in Bill 31, road safety is not a partisan issue. That is why we hope to see support for the Safer School Zones Act on both sides of the House. This is about making communities safer. It’s about protecting our children and our families from dangerous driving behaviours, where they play and where they walk to and from school.", "For many years, our family lived in a neighbourhood just down the street from a school, five doors down, and it used to infuriate me as a mother when my kids were walking home from school—or really at any other time—when I’d see cars speeding up and down the street. We were so close to a school, and I was always concerned about the children in the neighbourhood.", "It’s simply unacceptable that we have drivers speeding in these areas. Drivers should always be proceeding with care. An extra degree of care can be the difference between life and death, especially in high-risk areas that are frequented by young children or seniors.", "Speaker, in 2013 alone there were nine pedestrians under the age of 18 who were killed in collisions in Ontario—nine children killed by drivers while they were walking in their communities. Clearly, more needs to be done to make certain that people can get to and from home safely. This legislation, if passed, is going to give municipalities the tools that they need to make their journey safer.", "Seniors are another vulnerable group. The number of seniors who are being injured and even killed while walking is quite alarming. In 2013, 45 pedestrians over the age of 64 were killed in Ontario. That is a distressing number. This is a vulnerable segment of our population, and one that we know is quickly growing. Soon many of us are going to be in that age bracket; right? Seniors deserve to feel safe on our streets. They deserve to be able to walk in their communities without fear. I urge everyone to support this legislation to make that happen.", "In my home community of Waterloo region, in 2013, we saw four pedestrians struck and killed by motorists. Municipalities and police boards, including Waterloo region police, have reached out to us for help. They want the tools that they need to best address the road safety concerns that they are seeing and feeling in their communities.", "We understand that these issues may not be the same everywhere, and that’s why these measures proposed in this piece of legislation would not be implemented province-wide. I’ll say that again: It’s not going to be implemented province-wide. We’re not proposing that red light cameras be installed at every intersection, or that automated speed enforcement be on every municipal road, and we are not putting automated speed enforcement technology on Ontario highways or changing the default speed limits in Ontario. Instead, what we are proposing is to give municipalities greater autonomy to use these measures at a local level only if they choose. It is entirely up to them as to whether or not they want to use these measures, and believe me, they are telling us that they want this.", "Municipalities know what road safety concerns need to be addressed, and they know the areas in their communities that are of the highest risk, so why shouldn’t they have the ability and the power to address this? They’ve asked us to put in a framework so that they can make necessary changes based on their respective needs. This means that we’re empowering municipalities to make their communities safer in the way that they see fit.", "Speaker, we know that there is a direct correlation between speed and death on municipal roads. Three out of four collisions on local roads occur because of speed. It has been proven that lowering speed limits and implementing other measures which deter speeding do improve road safety. Bill 65 includes two measures that will help municipalities reduce and enforce speed limits on their roads. The first is to reduce default speed limits. It’s going to give municipalities the ability to create special zones in urban areas where the speed limits are lower than the standard default of 50 kilometres per hour. There is a significant amount of research which shows that lowering speed limits even by 10 kilometres per hour can lead to significantly fewer collisions, injuries and deaths. It gives drivers more time to react to emergency situations such as children running onto the streets. Have you ever been driving down the street and suddenly you see a ball bouncing onto the road, and quickly a child follows behind that ball to retrieve it? Well, if you’re going at a slower speed, the chances of you stopping in time are going to be better.", "Not only do lower speed limits help prevent collisions; they also reduce the severity of injuries that happen when collisions do occur. Lower speeds in urban areas can save lives. We know that. Municipalities have asked us to make it easier for them to do this, to save lives, and that is exactly what we’re looking at doing with this legislation. It’s going to help them make their communities more walkable and more user-friendly.", "Lowering speed limits is one way to make communities safer. Another is finding ways to deter people from speeding, and that’s where automated speed enforcement comes in. With automated speed enforcement technology, cameras can take a picture of a licence plate of someone who is speeding, and then that person is issued a ticket. That’s how it works. The technology is used in a number of jurisdictions already, and it is proving to be very effective. We did have this in Ontario back in the early 1990s for a few years on our highways; we don’t anymore. However, at the municipal level, leaders in communities are asking for a return in order to calm speeding. People are less likely to exceed the speed limit in areas where there is this technology, and less speeding means safer streets.", "Since this proposed legislation would give municipalities the ability to use this technology in school zones and community safety areas, it also means more protection for children and other vulnerable users. The technology also means more efficient enforcement by freeing up police resources to address other local safety concerns while at the same time making sure that road safety is never disregarded. This is something that we heard about at ROMA from many municipal leaders: that they would rather take their well-trained, well-skilled policing force and address them to issues within the community where there could be crime or other matters, and leave the business of issuing tickets to speeders up to automation.", "It’s a similar technology for the red light cameras that’s proposed for the legislation. Both technologies use cameras to target dangerous driving habits. For automated speed enforcement, we’re proposing to allow municipalities to use this technology in specific high-risk zones on municipal roads. For the red light cameras, we’re making the approvals process easier and eliminating the red tape to make it simpler for municipalities to opt in if they wish to.", "Speaker, all three parts of this proposed legislation will help make our roads safer, and that alone should be enough reason for everyone to support it, like they’ve supported similar road safety measures in the past. I think that everyone in this Legislature would say that they’re in favour of safer roads.", "We have a great track record in Ontario when it comes to improving road safety. We’ve done a lot, but we still have more to do. Keeping communities safe requires everyone to do their part. It’s not just about one group using our roads; whether it’s drivers, cyclists or pedestrians, everyone needs to be safe and play an active role in promoting road safety.", "When it comes to road safety, our goal is always a balance of measures and actions which encourage everyone to stay safe, from penalties to increased awareness. When you look at recent road safety legislation, that’s clearly evident. In the Making Ontario’s Roads Safer Act, which passed in 2015, there were a number of measures that focused on improving road safety—including school bus safety, distracted driving, cycling safety, tow truck safety, school crossings, pedestrian crossovers and impaired driving. That legislation was a major step forward for road safety in Ontario, and it has helped to make our province a safer place. It, like other road safety legislation passed before it, is one of the reasons why we have the road safety record that we do in this province.", "Again, it’s extremely important that we don’t stop working toward improving safety. Someone is killed on our roads every 17 hours in Ontario. With the Safer School Zones Act, we’re continuing to push Ontario’s road safety forward, we’re helping to make our communities safer, and we’re sending a message to municipalities that we are listening and we’re committed to being their road safety partners—partners such as Mayor Margaret Lupton of Zorra township, who is looking for ways to reduce speeding in her community. I promised her that I would stand and advocate for her and ensure that she will see changes in her community.", "That’s why it’s so important that everyone support this legislation. It is a crucial step forward. I know that keeping our roads safer for our children is something upon which we can all agree." ],

For those of us who have trouble recalling its history, when the divisive issue of photo radar was addressed in this House, a short two decades ago—I’ll take a few minutes to take you down memory lane." ],

We had a very serious accident a few years ago where a child in a neighbourhood was walking on the sidewalk and the vehicle actually came up on the sidewalk. It was a tragic situation. The child was injured, with very serious life-long injuries. In that case, Speaker, that person was impaired. There were all kinds of other factors that contributed to that.", "Regardless, when I was campaigning back in 2014, everywhere you would hear people complaining about speeding. It wasn’t just in school zones; it was people averting other traffic-congested areas coming down side streets. So it is very important that we look and address those concerns for speeding. Children’s lives are at risk.", "We know that today many kids are transported from their neighbourhoods in school buses to other neighbouring schools, and it becomes a heightened issue with school buses and kids walking to school as well.", "In London, I know there was a council that brought forward a bylaw that wanted to address speeding zones, specifically in school areas. I think this will help, of course, but we also need to make sure that distracted driving and other issues are also part of these contributing factors when there are accidents and unsafe drivers. Speeding is probably one of the main concerns and it is a good idea to allow and empower municipalities to set their own guidelines around the unique characteristics of their city." ],

It’s about all those things that matter to people in the areas where they live, in the neighbourhoods where they come from. They often find out when they go in to investigate who is doing all the speeding in these neighbourhoods—I think the people in the neighbourhood think it’s people coming from outside and doing the speeding. Every time they do any licence plate checks or that type of thing, they find out that the vast majority of speeding comes from right within the neighbourhood itself. A lot of the culprits don’t understand that, I think.", "What we’re doing here is we’re providing municipalities in the province of Ontario with tools to ensure that their communities can be made safer.

If this is something that the communities are supportive of—and I believe they are—it’s something that I would personally be very much in favour of. We want to make sure that this doesn’t become a political football that gets kicked around.", "Also, the challenges that municipalities have: I know that my municipality is concerned that they would have to lower the speed limit beyond where they want to go, if it’s established, and they want some clarification on that.", "Interjection." ],

I’m looking forward in particular to the contribution of my critic from the Conservative caucus to the discussion. I think it’s entirely fitting that both he and his colleague from Renfrew–Nipissing–Pembroke chose to start off their questions and comments back to me with very clear recognition from both of them about the importance of making sure that we do place a significant emphasis on producing those additional safety outcomes. I think that’s encouraging.", "Certainly, to have heard the member from London–Fanshawe talk about experiences that have taken place in her community—tragedies—is also something that I think would resonate because it has happened in communities right across the province.", "To the member from Renfrew–Nipissing–Pembroke, I would say: I know we will have discussions regarding what this legislation requires or doesn’t require of municipalities. I just want to stress really quickly that there is nothing in this legislation that requires the municipality to do anything. So if it’s one of the communities in his riding or it’s my community of Vaughan or York region or Waterloo region—nothing in this bill requires a municipality to touch their default speed limit if they choose not to. Nothing in this bill requires them to deploy automated speed enforcement if they choose not to. Nothing requires them to enter the red light camera program if they choose not to. We are certainly enabling municipalities.", "On that note, Speaker, I’ll finish off by saying that I think we also have to be very careful in this debate to not, for what might be considered partisan reasons, try to confuse the issues of the history of photo radar with what we’re actually discussing in this particular debate." ],

My other little guy was not feeling too well last night. He’s just at home, hopefully watching SpongeBob or something and not the legislative channel. If he is, good morning, and welcome.", "I do think it’s important, as I have an hour here to go through the bill in its entirety— we’ll compliment the government, obviously, on addressing some issues that I think we all have heard in our communities, but there will be opportunities to question the details of the particular bill.", "I do think it’s important, when I have this opportunity, to go back and perhaps give a little history lesson. I think it’s important for all of those, whether you’re here or at home—a history lesson—because it was back in August 1994 that the then NDP Premier and soon-to-be eventual Liberal MP, Bob Rae, flush with his excitement at forming the first and, to this point, last NDP government in the province, introduced us to the concept of photo radar, a new safety tool that motorists soon came to know as a government “cash grab.”", "Now, to be clear, Speaker, the photo radar program introduced in August 1994 by the then NDPer, Mr. Rae, was much larger in scope than what we hear government discussing today, and I think that’s an important distinction to note. The initial program was introduced on the 400-series highways across the province, as opposed to the school zones, as is the stated focus of today’s bill.", "As my colleague has made mention here, I want to again acknowledge our road safety partners. Brian Patterson is here, Elliott Silverstein is here from CAA and, of course, the gentleman from Parachute. Welcome again to the debate.", "As I had said, the initial program was introduced on 400-series highways across the province, as opposed to the school zones, which we’re talking about. That said, there have been many who have noted that today’s bill may open the door to questions that could take us back to the future.", "Within three months of the 1994 project launch, the provincial program was churning out around 12,000 or close to 13,000 tickets a month, leading the forefathers of today’s Ontario Liberals criticizing the NDP photo radar pilot as “nothing but a cash cow.”", "As ticket fines surpassed $2 million in November of that first year, with the OPP confirming some people were getting dinged for driving less than 10 kilometres an hour over the speed limit, many shared the Ontario Liberals’ concerns.", "That said, Speaker, while the Liberals were criticizing the cash grab, we got to work to eliminate it. Former Premier Mike Harris both promised to put the brakes on the controversial program and then immediately acted to eliminate it, following the 1995 election.", "In the words of our former colleague and then-Solicitor General Bob Runciman as to the concerns for the NDP’s photo radar program: “We believe having officers on the front lines is much more effective in terms of curtailing this form of activity than photo radar”— calling it “a cash cow for the NDP.” Without a doubt, those are the two main concerns or questions when it comes to photo radar programs: Is it having an effect on improved road safety, and at what cost?", "The fact is, at the time, there were varying reports on the amount of safety improvements, but there was a pretty clear consensus on what this was costing motorists. For instance, photo radar advocates cited a January 1995 MTO preliminary four-month study showing photo radar had reduced speeding on highways. On the other hand, that same year, there was an overall drop in speeding drivers across Canada, when those other areas did not have photo radar. Still others cited the fact that photo radar did nothing to catch other dangerous driving behaviours, such as distracted driving. We have that problem still on our roads today. In fact, one of the leading causes of fatalities on our highways, of course—unfortunately, we still have drunk driving or driving while impaired, both with substance and with alcohol.", "I know we had a consensus in this House on Bill 31 recently that improved the fines and penalties for driving while impaired. It’s an important mechanism to stop people from doing that. Unfortunately, we’ve still had instances across the province where we have seen fatalities, just tragic fatalities, for the senseless use of a substance while operating a motor vehicle.", "Of course, there’s operating a vehicle without a licence or even insurance. Dangerous driving: I think I heard on the radio just this morning that there was a young gentleman—24, I believe—nabbed for speeding over 200 kilometres an hour in a 60 zone. That’s a significant charge. We still have all of these behaviours happening on our roads.", "Many questioned then, and continue to question today, the impact on driver behaviour when ticketing through photo radar is assigned to the vehicle’s owner and not necessarily the driver.", "I had an experience only a few months ago in my community. I was picking my son up from the bus. He got off, the bus pulled away, and there was a speeding car going down our street at probably at least double the speed limit. I was so upset by that. It was a young driver, of course. Ideally, I would have loved to have had a police officer there to deal with that behaviour. Of course, who knows? The vehicle may have been owned by his parents, and if this were the case, he would have received a ticket a few months down the road—or not even actually himself.", "These things are happening, and as a parent, it’s upsetting, knowing this. It’s that behaviour change that needs to happen. We do question whether that behavioural change will come with ticketing at the moment of the alleged infraction, and that is, of course, through the use of front-line officers, which we feel are still so important, especially in these school zones in the morning hours and afternoon hours when the kids are getting off the bus and walking home from school etc.", "The fact is that while we see the Liberal government introducing a return to photo radar today, there has also been long acknowledgment on that side of the House of the list of concerns that accompany photo radar, and I think it’s important to bring these up. I’m going to have an hour, so we’re going to get through the bill in its entirety. But I wanted to bring a few of these up, because when I read some of these quotes, I just couldn’t not share them with my colleagues today.", "Former McGuinty government Finance Minister Greg Sorbara, in this very House, called photo radar “the most arbitrary, objectionable, obnoxious... one of the most repulsive pieces of legislation that the government has brought in”—that being the NDP—“because it just completely abrogates our very long-standing tradition in this province of being innocent until you’re proven guilty in a court of law.” That was Greg Sorbara in, I believe, the seat now occupied by the now Minister of Transportation, who would know Greg well.", "He further noted, “If you set the precedent with photo radar, then, the precedent having been set, you arbitrarily move into a whole bunch of other areas, without due process, without the normal procedures for identifying and apprehending and charging the person who committed the offence.”", "Or how about former Liberal Minister of Natural Resources and Aboriginal Affairs David Ramsay, who told the House, “I think that’s what the problem is: The government sees this type of thing, this type of apparatus as policing and that’s the last type of thing I consider to be policing.” That was David Ramsay, a former Liberal minister.", "A former energy minister, Liberal Gerry Phillips, said that “it is a revenue-grab; it is a tax grab. It heads down a very dangerous route. I don’t know where the government is going to draw the line, because if you do it with speeding, you can do it with all sorts of other things, and we won’t have that debate.” That was Gerry Phillips, then-energy minister under the Liberals.", "What about the former Premier himself, who, after much back-and-forth, said in 2006, “We looked at it in our first year and we have rejected it so it is not part of our plans.” That was back in November 2006, from Premier McGuinty himself.", "Those plans, or lack thereof, made headlines the following year, in 2007, in a report: Ontario Premier Says No to Photo Radar. Quoting Mr. McGuinty, “There seems to be a stronger consensus around making sure that there are tougher penalties associated with speeding.”", "Further, “More needs to be done to crack down on speeding, but photo radar is not the answer.” He said that in 2007.", "I will say, because I know I only have a few seconds left—one minute—that we will have an opportunity to get back into this, and I look forward to doing so.", "I want to thank the minister for bringing today’s bill forward, and thank him for allowing us to go over the rich history of photo radar here in the province of Ontario. I’ll have more to say about that as we continue our debate.", "But I think it’s important that we keep in mind the pitfalls of the past and the concerns that remain today, as outlined by my colleagues, as we look forward to further debate focusing on the application of photo radar in school zones specifically as well as the extended community safety zones that this bill will target, to ensure that Ontarians remain safe in the province of Ontario.", "Thank you, Speaker, for the time." ],

We need to take more costs out of the system, we need to reduce those bills, and that’s exactly the proposal that we will bring forward before the budget." ],

Mr. Speaker, it is an honour for me to rise in the House today to formally recognize the United Nations International Decade for People of African Descent.", "Before I start, I just want to thank MPP Hunter and also MPP Granville Anderson for the work that they’ve done to get to this point. It was the three of us and many members of this caucus who worked hard over the last year to get to this point today. And, of course, I would like to thank the Premier.", "In recognizing this decade, we’re acknowledging that people of African descent represent a distinct group of people whose human rights most be promoted, they must be protected, and whose history, culture and contributions must be respected and celebrated.", "I’d like to take a moment to recognize and thank our community partners that are here to join us today. The men and women whom you see in the east members’ gallery and other parts of the Legislature here today are folks who have been working hard to advocate on behalf of the community and the rights of racialized people here in Ontario. I just want to say thank you so much for being here. Without your help we couldn’t do what we’re doing here today.", "Mr. Speaker, around the world there are around 1.3 billion people of African heritage. Outside of Africa, it’s roughly 200 million people. Over half a million people identify as members of the African community or people of African descent here in Ontario, the province we call home.", "The International Decade for People of African Descent calls for the international community to join together with people of African descent to raise awareness, collect statistics, preserve historical memory and celebrate the achievements of black people in the spirit of recognition, justice and development. The objectives of this decade, which started back in 2015 and runs until 2024, are to:", "—promote the respect, protection and fulfillment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms of people of African descent, as recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights;", "—promote greater knowledge of and respect for the diverse heritage, culture and contributions of people of African descent; and", "—adopt and strengthen national, regional and international legal frameworks according to the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and ensure their full and effective implementation.", "The Canadian government invited a delegation of United Nations human rights experts to assess anti-black racism here in Canada. During their visit last October, the group raised concerns about systemic anti-black racism in the criminal justice system, the education system, the underemployment of black workers and the damaging legacy of Canada’s history of slave trade, racial segregation and marginalization. At the same time, the UN delegation welcomed the establishment of Ontario’s Anti-Racism Directorate to address this systemic racism and promote fair practices and policies.", "We know that racism takes many forms. Sometimes it’s subtle, and sometimes it’s overt and intentional. Systemic racism harms our entire society, but black and African Canadians are among the most uniquely, and immediately, affected by it. It is true that we have come a long way, but there is so much more that we know we can do as a society to eliminate systemic racism. Together, every single person in this province has a role to play to build a multicultural society that everyone can be proud of.", "Our government is committed to fighting systemic racism faced by indigenous and racialized people, including specifically anti-black racism impacting people of African descent. To inform our work, as the minister responsible for this file, I travelled across the province between June and December of last year and listened to people share their stories around racism. We interacted with over 4,000 people across this province, and I have to say that the stories that came out were just incredible. People spoke about the fact that they landed in a new country and they couldn’t find employment that was connected to their professional credentials. We heard about people expressing the disproportional number of black families involved in the child welfare system and how their children, once going into that system, lose their identity. We listened to people talk about their educational experiences and the need for change there. There were many thousands of people that shared their stories and talked about how racism impacted their lives.", "This government, our people and all of Ontarians are committed to working towards eliminating systemic racism and building a society characterized by racial equity. Recognizing the UN’s International Decade for People of African Descent as we celebrate Black History Month this February is part of that commitment.", "This province first proclaimed Black History Month back in 1993, marking the 200th anniversary of a law banning the importation of slaves to here in Upper Canada, which we now refer to as Ontario. Last year, Ontario passed legislation to formally recognize February as Black History Month on an annual basis.", "Black History Month is an opportunity to reflect on the history that has collectively shaped us. It is important to share these challenges faced by black Canadians and to celebrate their accomplishments and outstanding contributions to this province and this country.", "Mr. Speaker, as the minister responsible for children and youth and the minister responsible for this government’s Anti-Racism Directorate, I am committed to engaging with communities in every corner of this province and working with my colleagues across the aisle as we address systemic racism to create opportunities and equitable outcomes for all. Moving forward, we will break down those barriers, and we’ll help every Ontarian, regardless of where they are from, to reach their full potential. Thank you very much." ],

It was on this day in 1952 that university students in Pakistan held a demonstration protesting the Pakistani government’s decision to make Urdu the country’s national language. At that time, the majority of Pakistani citizens were Bengali, and the students wanted that language recognized as well. Police opened fire, killing several of the protestors. Those students died defending their mother tongue. These protestors died defending a language they believed was under threat. They wanted to preserve their language for themselves and for future generations.", "In 1999, the United Nations proclaimed February 21 as International Mother Language Day. Ontario is proud to join with nations around the world in marking this important day thanks to a private member’s bill presented in the past by my esteemed colleague the MPP for Richmond Hill in 2009.", "Today is a day to reflect on and celebrate peace, diversity and multiculturalism. It is also a day to remind ourselves that some of the most basic freedoms we enjoy are freedoms that others have died to secure and died to defend. The right to communicate in one’s mother language is one of these freedoms.", "Many of us learn one or both of Canada’s two official languages, English and French, growing up. But both Canada and Ontario were built by a great many people whose mother language was not English or French. Today, Ontario is blessed to be home to people from 200 different countries who speak more than 250 different languages and dialects. Here in Ontario, we welcome the mother languages of our newcomers, and they welcome the chance for themselves and their children to learn English and French in school or tuition-free ESL and FSL adult classes. This generous linguistic accommodation is what makes Ontario a beacon to the rest of the world.", "This past year, the attention of the world has been fixed on the plight of refugees, particularly Syrian refugees fleeing the terrible civil war unfolding in their country. Ontario, like many other jurisdictions around the world, has stepped up to help. From November 2015 to the end of 2016, Ontario welcomed more than 20,000 refugees. Approximately 17,000 of these were refugees fleeing the crisis in Syria. We cherish these and the 100,000 immigrants who make our province their home every single year. We cherish everything they bring: their hopes, their dreams, their diversity and their language. Ontario is not a place which asks newcomers to stop speaking one language to learn another; Ontario is a place for all cultures, all races, all beliefs and all languages.", "As many of you know, my mother tongue is Italian. A special kind of beauty exists, which is born in language. We bond together over language, and Ontario gives us the opportunity to promote that awareness of linguistic and cultural diversity in multilingualism. On this International Mother Language Day, we proudly say, in 250 different languages and dialects, “You are welcome here.” Thank you." ],

I feel so fortunate to live in such an accepting and diverse society as Ontario. It is rare to find a place where you can be proud of the culture and language that makes you who you are while also being in such close contact with people of other cultures and other languages.", "Ontario’s multiculturalism is the envy of the world, expressed vividly through food, art and language.

Knowledge of history is in many ways a guide to the future, for it was once said: “The only new thing under the sun is the history you don’t know.” It’s so true.", "We all need to take an interest in the extraordinary history of this province and our beloved country. We have been hearing this month the compelling stories of brave war heroes, courageous civil rights pioneers and determined trailblazers. Hearing these stories, we come to better realize that black history is Ontario history. It is the history of Ontario as a beacon of freedom for those escaping the cruelty of slavery in the American South. It is a story of the black Loyalists and the War of 1812 veterans who fought courageously for their freedom with the hope of one day calling Canada home. It is the legacy of a people’s perseverance and determination forged in the face of great challenge and adversity.", "We hear the stories of former slaves who found freedom here in Ontario, like Josiah Henson and Richard Pierpoint, which remind us of slavery’s inhumanity and also that liberty and tolerance are central to the character of the province of Ontario.", "We hear the story of civil rights pioneers like Viola Desmond, which remind us of what prejudice and injustice look like, and also inspire the next generation of Canadians to stand up for the courage of their convictions.", "We hear the story of Canadians like Lincoln Alexander, whose birthday we acknowledged on January 21. We do this not simply as a reminder of the trials and challenges of bigotry, but also to encourage the next generation of Canadians to strive for excellence, to never give up and to give back in service to the country.", "Black History Month is a time to recognize these stories of heroism, bravery and triumph over adversity. Together, all of us can work to ensure that the values we champion—freedom, democracy and human rights—are what unite Ontarians of all backgrounds.", "In this, the United Nations International Decade for People of African Descent, we say this: Racism in any form is unacceptable. We stand together to condemn racism in any way it may appear and in any way it manifests itself, for in the 21st century it is our diversity that will continue to be one of our greatest strengths, showing Canada to be a beacon for the world." ],

It is a time for us—everywhere, everyone in this province—to take part in the celebration of black and African history and culture in our country and in our province.", "When we talk about Black History Month, what we’re really talking about is, in fact, Canadian history.

Of course, I’m talking about Lincoln Alexander.", "Born on Draper Street, just three kilometres from here, Linc had to travel a long road before he eventually found his way to Queen’s Park, where he served as Lieutenant Governor. He overcame many challenges, including significant discrimination, to become a highly respected lawyer, politician and community leader, accruing many firsts along the way, including being elected as Canada’s first black member of Parliament, representing Hamilton West.", "Inspirational leaders like Lincoln Alexander, whose example is still so relevant today, remind us that Black History Month is more than just a curriculum subject for school classrooms; it is a celebration for all Ontarians. Ontario, Canada and communities around the world have been profoundly influenced and enriched by the black community.", "Black History Month is a time for all Ontarians and Canadians to celebrate the contributions the black community has made and to honour its role models and leaders past and present. Ontarians of all backgrounds owe it to themselves to take time to learn about the challenges and triumphs of black and African Canadians and Americans, as well as those from the continent and the diaspora. It is important that this history never be forgotten or ignored.", "Of course, using the word “history” risks implying that this is all just in the past. It is critical that while celebrating historic figures and achievements, we never downplay or ignore the challenges still being faced by the black community. Despite some improvements, the black community still bears a disproportionate burden of violence, poverty and lack of opportunity.", "There is overrepresentation of young black men in our criminal justice system and overrepresentation of black families in our children’s services system. We see what’s happening in some of the school boards in this very province, where our minister has had to step up to deal with the racism that continues to occur there.", "We have situations where I meet with black families and they tell me that they see their sons being suspended and kicked out of school much more frequently than any other children, and that’s not acceptable. That’s what we call systemic racism, and unfortunately it exists in many, many of the institutions that we have and that we are responsible for here in this chamber.", "You can recall that back in the early 1990s we had an Anti-Racism Secretariat, and I look forward to the minister responsible for anti-racism in his role—I sometimes wonder what it would be like here in the province of Ontario had the subsequent government not gotten rid of the Anti-Racism Secretariat back in the 1990s.", "However, thankfully, contemporary black community activists and leaders are carrying on the tradition of human rights pioneers like Stanley Grizzle, Bromley Armstrong and Viola Desmond. These community leaders, past and present, are standing up to make the promise of Canadian multiculturalism, diversity and, in fact, acceptance a reality. Their ongoing struggles and leadership are a call to action to all Ontarians to confront injustice wherever we see it and to build a fair and inclusive society, where everyone can build a future for their family.", "Ontario’s New Democrats are proud to stand in solidarity with these community activists against anti-black racism and to celebrate the leaders and activists who have come before. The black and African Canadian community, its history and its past struggles should always hold an important place in our schools, in our literature and in our culture. Otherwise, we will not be able to change the present or the future.", "Alongside all Ontarians, New Democrats are proud to celebrate Black History Month this year and every year." ],

  "text" : [ "Thank you very much, Speaker. It’s good to be back. Good to see you in the chair.", "I’m pleased to rise and discuss Bill 84, the Medical Assistance in Dying Statute Law Amendment Act. If passed, this legislation would support the implementation of medical assistance in dying in Ontario, which is also referred to as, and as I will in the speech, MAID.", "The bill will provide more protection and greater clarity for the implementation of MAID for patients, their families and their health care providers. As I will outline, the bill as proposed aligns with the federal legislation regarding medical assistance in dying, which was enacted following a Supreme Court of Canada decision in the case that challenged the prohibition of assisted dying.", "Speaker, I’d like to begin by providing you with the context under which we got to this point. The Supreme Court of Canada issued its decision in Carter v. Canada on February 6, 2015. In the Carter decision, the court unanimously struck down the Criminal Code prohibition against physician-assisted dying for “a competent adult person who ... clearly consents to the termination of” his or her “life ... has a grievous and irremediable medical condition,” and is “enduring suffering that is intolerable to the individual in the circumstances of his or her condition.”", "The Supreme Court suspended its decision in Carter for 16 months to allow federal, provincial and territorial governments and regulatory bodies, should they choose, to develop an appropriate response, including potentially enacting legislation consistent with the decision. During this time, our government led a process with the provinces and territories to engage and consult with key stakeholders and Canadians on this complex and personal issue, and make recommendations.", "Following the 16-month suspension of the court’s declaration in Carter, the federal government passed Bill C-14, which came into force on June 17, 2016. It’s just a little over eight months old. I’d like to point that out and will say a bit more about that later in my remarks. The federal legislation provides a national framework to support the implementation of MAID. The legislation outlines the eligibility criteria required to obtain MAID, requires procedural safeguards to be followed, requires that a monitoring regime be established, and promotes a safe and consistent approach to medically assisted dying across the country.", "Under the federal legislation, to obtain medically assisted dying, an individual must first be eligible to receive health services funded by a government in Canada, be at least 18 years of age and capable of making health care decisions, have a grievous and irremediable medical condition, voluntarily request medical assistance in dying and give informed consent to receive MAID. Safeguards in the legislation include a requirement that two independent physicians or nurse practitioners determine a patient’s eligibility, a mandatory reflection period and a requirement that a request for MAID be produced in writing in the presence of two independent witnesses.", "Speaker, I’ve just briefly outlined the Supreme Court decision and the accompanying federal legislation. Before I describe the details of the proposed bill before us today and its role in light of these developments, let me provide an overview of the steps we have already taken to support the implementation of medically assisted dying in Ontario. These steps reflect our commitment to providing Ontarians with the best possible information and assistance they need when making decisions about their care. That is why the ministry implemented a number of initiatives in the months immediately following passage of Bill C-14. These initiatives include information, tools and training to help patients, health care providers and health care facilities understand how to access or offer medical assistance in dying.", "We’ve been working closely with the province’s health regulatory colleges that regulate physicians, nurses and pharmacists to provide guidance on MAID and their respective members. We have moved forward with funding the cost of drugs for MAID so that they are available to Ontarians at no cost. A clinician referral service has been launched that helps clinicians locate other clinicians willing to provide or assist in the provision of MAID. This service is used in cases where doctors and nurse practitioners may object to providing MAID on moral or religious grounds, and are looking to refer patients to willing providers. This service is also used for locating a clinician to provide a second assessment, which is required under the federal legislation.", "Finally, we have taken steps to ensure information sharing and monitoring of any implementation issues through regular webinars with system leaders, stakeholders, including health professional associations, sector associations, LHINs and patient groups." ],

  "text" : [ "With these initiatives in place, we are now proposing further steps through this legislation that, if passed, support the implementation of medical assistance in dying in a manner that aligns with the federal legislation. This proposed legislation, which introduces amendments to a number of provincial acts, is necessary to further support and protect providers and patients.", "Although the federal legislation—and this is important, Mr. Speaker—is comprehensive and contains important safeguards, there are some issues that it does not address since they fall under provincial jurisdiction. That is why I’m pleased to speak today about Bill 84, the Medical Assistance in Dying Statute Law Amendment Act.", "It provides clarity and direction for clinicians and patients navigating MAID and ensures there is appropriate oversight for MAID deaths in this province. The bill contains a narrow series of amendments to existing legislation, including amendments to the Excellent Care for All Act, which, if passed, would include the following two provisions. First, medical assistance in dying would not affect a right or benefit that would otherwise exist under a contract or statute, whether it be life insurance or survivor benefits. That’s a very key part of this legislation and I’m glad it’s there. Second, physicians, nurse practitioners and persons assisting in the lawful provision of MAID would have immunity from civil liability.", "Amendments to the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act would ensure that claims under the act would be determined based on the illness or disease for which the worker was determined to be eligible to receive medical assistance in dying.", "An amendment to the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act and the Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act would, if passed, protect clinicians and facilities willing to provide MAID from being identified under access-to-information laws and requests.", "Further, an amendment to the Coroners Act would, if passed, ensure the effective monitoring of medical assistance in dying by:", "(1) requiring the coroner to be notified of all MAID deaths—certain information would be required to be disclosed by clinicians so that the coroner is able to properly exercise discretion in determining whether to investigate;", "(2) clarifying that the existing requirement under the Coroners Act to investigate any death from any cause other than disease does not apply to medical assistance in dying;", "(3) clarifying when the coroner is required to complete death certificates for MAID deaths;", "(4) requiring a review of the coroner’s oversight role.", "The Minister of Community Safety and Correctional Services would establish this review process within two years of passage of this bill.", "Finally, an amendment to the Vital Statistics Act would clarify requirements respecting the coroner’s documentation of medical-assistance-in-dying deaths, consistent with the proposed Coroners Act amendments.", "Speaker, you will see from the proposed legislation that we have outlined steps necessary to safeguard the rights of patients and health care professionals. It is important to point out that the steps we have already taken to facilitate MAID and the proposed amendments—changes that respond to the Supreme Court ruling and that we must therefore put in place—were built through the hard work of our government, in consultation with our stakeholders.", "This process involved thousands of Ontarians and health care providers who shared their views. For example, we conducted surveys, invited submissions through a dedicated email account, and held in-person and online consultation. This process reflected our commitment to undertaking changes to our health care system in a manner that best meets patient needs.", "Further, the government has heard concerns expressed by clinicians who have conscientious or religious objection to providing medical assistance in dying. I want to make it clear that the bill, if passed, does not require a clinician to perform MAID or assess a patient for MAID. Thus, in addition to the clinical referral service already in place, the government is working to establish a care coordination service which would assist patients and caregivers in accessing additional information and services for medical assistance in dying and other end-of-life options. We would be working closely with our health care delivery partners to ensure that the service meets the needs of patients and clinicians.", "Just as important, Mr. Speaker, we are committed to doing this while supporting alternative end-of-life options. Ontarians deserve to have a health care system that provides seamless, consistent and compassionate care that includes information and access to the fullest range of choices possible. I want to point out that the care coordination service would also provide patients and their families with information on palliative care so they can make the choice that is right for them.", "As I’ve carefully outlined here today, Ontario is taking a thorough and thoughtful approach to medical assistance in dying, in light of the Supreme Court’s ruling and subsequent federal legislation. What our government is proposing to do with Bill 84 is to introduce amendments that are necessary in light of the fact that medical assistance in dying is both legal and practised. Between June and December 2016, a total of 187 medically assisted deaths occurred in Ontario. We have made every effort to propose the best possible legislation in light of these developments. The bill, if passed, would provide additional clarity and protections to patients and clinicians.", "The goal here is to support patient choice while protecting the vulnerable and respecting the rights of health care providers and institutions. The proposed amendments would do just that. If the bill is passed, we would continue to monitor stakeholder and public opinion. As part of this process, we would continue to rely on our partners in health care for input and additional feedback.", "We would also continue to monitor for operational changes. For example, we identified issues that include timely access to MAID drugs and assessments, as well as sufficient clinical capacity to service medical-assistance-in-dying requests. The Ontario government continues to engage with the federal government on these and other important issues regarding MAID.", "Our government remains as committed as ever to the goal of putting patients at the centre of all we do in health care. The proposed medical-assistance-in-dying statute law is needed to deliver on this commitment. Our job at the provincial level is to ensure that we are providing the information, the tools and the training to help patients, health care providers and health care facilities understand medical assistance in dying. We are providing more protection and greater clarity for patients and their families and health care providers, and we have taken steps to ensure that the bill before us today aligns with the federal legislation and addresses areas that fall under provincial jurisdiction.", "We know that medical assistance in dying is an important issue for people. Because of the Supreme Court decision, it is now legal in Canada, so we need to look at how we provide these services to people when they need them. Death and dying is a difficult topic. We don’t really ever want to talk about it very much. It’s important to recognize that there are differences of opinion on medical assistance in dying—for some people, at a very, very fundamental level.", "Part of my mandate as the parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Health and Long-Term Care is to oversee our government’s efforts in the area of palliative and end-of-life care, so for many months now I’ve been talking to stakeholders. I think we had about 350 at our consultations last year and continuing through this year with health care stakeholders, caregivers and families, talking about death and dying and how we care for each other at the end of our lives and how we need to provide comfort and compassion to people at the end of their lives.", "Just to back up a little bit, if I can, Mr. Speaker, I was very fortunate to be made the parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Health at the same time, in August 2014, that the Carter decision was being discussed. It was actually, I think, just before the decision. When I became parliamentary assistant, the minister said, “What would you like to do?” I said, “I’d like to work on palliative and end-of-life-care issues because I think they’re critical.” I was fortunate enough to be given that as part of my mandate in that letter, a very important part. So I’m really very thankful for that.", "Not often do you get an opportunity in your job to work on something that you really care about and that is important to you and that you have some understanding of. I’ve been doing work as a volunteer and through government for about 20 years, always maintaining a connection to that. So I feel very fortunate, and equally as fortunate last summer to have continued on in the PA shuffle—not having been shuffled—to be able to continue to work on this. I want to assure all members of the House that I am continuing to work on it.", "Because of these responsibilities, I spent a great deal of time reflecting on death, dying and end-of-life care and the need for us to act in compassion, mercy and love. I had to ask myself the question—I’m not a health care provider, but I had to think about the question because I had spoken to a number of providers on different sides of the issue about how they felt about it. Some had strong objections; some had concerns—on both sides. I still haven’t come to the answer myself, but I do know we have to act out of compassion and love and mercy.", "I went to the person who I trust most: I spoke to my mom. My mother, Mary, is a registered nurse. She’s 84—sorry, mom; I guess I wasn’t supposed to say that out loud. She’s somebody who I know I can trust for her insight and wisdom. She’s an incredibly practical person and very devoted and committed. I asked my mom, “Mom, you’re a nurse. I know you’re not practising anymore, but do you think you could participate?” She spent 35 years as a registered nurse at the National Defence Medical Centre in Ottawa, which is no longer operating as a hospital. Her response to me—and this is really telling. My mom is a person of really deep faith, and her answer was, “I don’t think I could, because I believe God gives and takes life away,” and in the next breath she said, “but there are extreme circumstances.” So what she said to me as I understood it was, “You just asked me a question—it’s a hypothetical question—to which here is my answer. But it’s a question which I have no proximity to. It’s not in front of me. I don’t see it.”", "So it’s important for all of us to realize that—not just as individuals, because we’re not all going to be put in that situation. I think we have to take that approach. This is what we’re doing in this bill. We have to come through this together. As we gain proximity to the thing, as we have in identifying things like the need to protect people’s insurance rights, the need to protect their WSIB rights, the need to protect them from litigation—as we get that proximity and we get closer, this will evolve and develop so we have an understanding, a common community understanding of how to move forward.", "Medical assistance in dying is a difficult and very personal choice. As I said, it’s important for us to move forward as a society with respect for everyone’s choices, opinions and decisions. It’s more than just an academic discussion; it’s about the way we feel. It’s about the way we view the world. It’s about compassion and mercy and love. Ultimately, we need to consider, when we look at the Supreme Court’s ruling on medical assistance in dying and the federal government’s amendments to the Criminal Code, that at its core, the decision is about choice. To have real choice you need to have choices. That’s why, on this side and, I know, across this Legislature, we’re advocating for better palliative care: because those other choices are access to quality end-of-life and palliative care. I know that the minister is committed to that. I know I’m committed. I know all members of the House are committed to that.", "Last year, when we announced some of the initiatives we had for community-based palliative care and the Ontario Palliative Care Network, members on all sides of this House, during that budget speech, applauded that one part. I will never forget that, because you don’t see that happen very much in a budget speech. So I’m very proud of all the members in this Legislature. When I have an opportunity to visit their ridings, and I have, to make some hospice announcements or be there to meet with—when I was in Windsor, I met with Darren Cargill, who I have a lot of respect for. He’s doing some really great work.", "I guess I’d better not be listing people off, although I do have an hour." ],

We understand that making end-of-life decisions is a both challenging and sensitive topic for patients, their families and health care providers, and we want to support them by promoting dignified palliative and end-of-life care—care that relieves suffering and improves the quality of living. That’s what it’s all about: It’s about living. The things that are most important at the end of life are really the things that are important during life. It’s just that they become more important and we focus on them. Those are the things that it’s important, as a community, we start to recognize.", "I beg your indulgence, Speaker.", "This change is a community change—and I’ll talk a bit more about this later. It’s about a culture change. It’s about how we approach end-of-life and suffering, and how we take responsibility for each other, not just as governments, but as communities and communities of practice, families, friends, volunteers. It’s a big change, and it’s going to require everybody rowing in the same direction.", "When you go to communities like Windsor, Sudbury, Ottawa or Kingston, you find that those programs that are most effective in relieving pain and suffering are those programs that more parties are involved with. That level of collaboration and that working together is a thing that’s making a difference in those communities, and as a government we have to do what we can to support and build on that. As members in this Legislature, we have to do what we can—not just from a resource perspective from government, but with our time and attention—to talk to people inside our community about the importance of coming together and working together to provide the kind of comfort that people need." ],

This is a critical part of that culture change. We don’t often talk about it at home.", "I’ll relate to you two experiences. I think my wife, Linda, is listening, so it’s good I’m not back home for three days. I just want to say that we talk about it at home, and it’s easy for me to talk about it. I say, “Well, if this happens, this is what I would like. These are what my wishes are. Here’s how I’d like it handled.” To be fair, Linda doesn’t want to hear that, and I don’t think that’s an uncommon experience. She doesn’t want to have that conversation, because we don’t want to think about our own mortality, and we don’t want to think about how that’s going to affect other people. We don’t want to think about what we think is the unthinkable, but the reality is it’s thinkable, because we’re all going there.", "But it’s a difficult conversation to have. It’s an important conversation to have. It takes an effort to do that. You don’t have to do it all at once. There are all sorts of tools out there for advance care planning that help people to define what it is and what’s important—because it’s really about what’s important to you, right? It’s really about what’s important to you in your life.", "A clinician said to me once, “You know, the thing I ask when I’m talking to a patient who is palliative is, ‘What are you afraid of? What are your fears? What’s important to you? And what would you do to get that thing that’s important to you?’”, which is a pretty basic human conversation. It’s important because it informs your health care provider, to make sure that you can get access to those things that are important to you, that you can have some confidence that you’ll be able to experience those things.", "So often, people end up in an emergency room when that’s not really where they wanted to end up, because they were not going to be able to deal with those things or have access to those things that are important to them. Or they end up with interventions that, if they fully understood the impact of that on their lives and what was important to them, they would not have otherwise taken. It is important for us, and it’s important, as a gift to someone you love, to someone who’s going to make that substitute decision for you, to have some idea about what’s important to you, because it’s very difficult for people, when they have to make a substitute decision.", "I’m going to tell a story about my mom. I’m sorry, Mom. My mom and I—I know this will be okay with her—have had numerous conversations. My mom is 84—I did it again. About a year and a half ago, she had a heart attack, and she had two stents put in her heart. My mom is very practical, and she started talking about, “Well, you know, here are the things that I want.” She started thinking more about dying, so we’d have conversations back and forth. She said to me, “I don’t want any extreme measures. Here is how, when I pass, I’d like you to do these things.”", "So this Christmas, just before Christmas, I walked into the house, and there on the table was, in my mom’s script, which is typical nursing-type script, a list of instructions—quite legible, because nurses’ instructions are very legible; that’s a thing I’ve learned, growing up with a nurse. She went through all these things. It was hard to read, but I was happy that I saw it. It was harder for some of my siblings. We had conversations.", "One day, I’m walking down Bay Street and I call Mom, because I try to call my mom as often as I can when I’m here—not as often as I should. I say, “Mom, we’re talking,” and we start talking about it again. We’re on the phone and we’re talking about her wishes at the end of life, on the phone, walking down the street in the cold of winter. And she repeats it: She says to me, “I don’t want any extreme measures.”", "I said, “Okay, Mom.” This is the importance of the conversation, and it’s really important to underline that it’s an ongoing conversation. She said, “I don’t want any extreme measures.” “Okay, you don’t want any extreme measures. Okay. Mom, you have a heart attack in the house right now. Do you want CPR?” Pause. It’s really important to have these conversations, because that was not included in what she felt was an extreme. So they’re really important conversations to have. I wanted to share that personal story. I know my Mom’s okay with it—or I’m 90% sure she’s okay with it." ],

  "text" : [ "I know she is.", "It’s important. I know we’re discussing this very important bill that’s addressing some very specific and narrow definitions, narrow things that need to be corrected in certain acts here. But I think it’s an important opportunity for us to talk about things like this, and the impact of advance care planning on our personal lives and on informing the health care system so it can do what is important to the patient. That’s critical.", "Many of us have had the talk with loved ones about who would make critical decisions that need to be made in the event that we are unable to because we had become ill or had been in an accident. We all know we need to do this while capable of doing it so that we can ensure the right decisions get made in keeping with our wishes, yet we hesitate. As my former boss said, we often confuse the immediate with the important. These discussions about advance care planning are critical. I’ll leave you with that thought. Maybe you’ll answer it at the end.", "Advance care planning is about making clear how you wish to be cared for and about giving someone you trust the authority to act on those wishes for you if the need arises.", "The government recognizes that we also have an important role to play when it comes to palliative and end-of-life care. Our approach is to ensure that the services we deliver will improve the quality of life and, Mr. Speaker, the quality of death. We are improving the health care experience so that patients and caregivers understand their palliative care options and how the system works. This will help alleviate their stress and help them focus on what’s important.", "We’re building a palliative care system that is coordinated, equitable, accountable and sustainable. Starting last year we increased our investments in hospice and palliative care. I mentioned that earlier—$155 million over three years for very important services. I know that of the 34 hospices in Ontario, we increased their operating funds and we’re going to support up to 20 new hospices in Ontario.", "There are supports for caregivers and supports for visiting home hospice. The Ontario Palliative Care Network, through Cancer Care Ontario, is there to ensure that we can measure, that we can have quality and that we can ensure access. It’s not a widely known piece but it’s a really critical piece in ensuring that we continue to move forward on this, that we ensure that there’s a coordinated effort.", "The growth of hospice and palliative care was based on coalitions. The eventual grand coalition was seen in the Declaration of Partnership and Commitment to Action. I think there are over 80 agencies and regulatory bodies and associations that have signed on to this to say, “Here are the things that we need to do.”", "The Ontario Palliative Care Network, in collaboration with them—that declaration of partnership continues to grow. It was important for that to be solidified and given a space inside government, inside the health care system, in order to make sure that we continue to move forward in a way that is going to ensure access to quality palliative end-of-life care.", "We’re also providing services and resources for caregivers and volunteers because we recognize the important role they play in palliative care and we want to ensure that they remain healthy too, because we understand that the toll for caring for someone near the end of life can really have a great impact on a person.", "Many of you know my own experience with my father, who was diagnosed with an inoperable oral cancer just after my first election—it was about three months after my election. It was kind of tough news. His journey we went through together as a family, and it was a journey that informed the work that I do right now. It had some really great moments—excellent care—and then it had moments where things fell between the cracks. There were problems in transitions from one setting to another. There was not great communication. But at the end of the day, if I go the way that my father went, in that way, I’ll think I’ve won the lottery, because it was a fairly big effort where we all came together, and there was a lot more good than there were things that were negative. But there were things that I knew needed to be fixed.", "What remained with me is that I think it’s incumbent on all of us that we ensure that families have that choice, have that option, that we are able to provide care for people whose families may not be able to make that kind of commitment. It’s not just family; it’s as communities that we have to look after each other.", "We were very fortunate: A year to the day after my father’s death was our first grandchild, and we’ve had two more since then. My theory is, one in, one out. That experience was something else that informed me, because with the babies coming into the world I realized that all of us, as families, as health care providers, as educators, if you’re coming into this world, the nursery is set up, we’ve got schools going, we’ve got whatever we need in hospitals, we’ve got great midwifery practices—as a community, we’re all ready, we’re all there. We’re all thinking about that. At the end of life, it’s not so much; it’s not really the same way. What really occurred to me is that the end of life deserves the same kind of attention that we give to the beginning of life, and I think that should inform all of us. They’re not really different. They’re just opposite ends of the same string. There are a lot of similarities in the experience. That’s part of what informs me, as we go forward on working on palliative care.", "I want to thank all those who took the time to participate in that consultation I mentioned earlier. They helped us by sharing their insight and experiences, and it has really helped us to shape and inform the report that I wrote and the future direction of palliative care in Ontario. There’s a lot of work to do; there’s no question about that. The things that I heard and saw in the consultation with all of those people—the health care providers, the families, the caregivers—really did resonate with me. It resonated with me because it was reflective of my own personal experience.", "Mr. Speaker, it’s important that we have those important discussions about what we want in the event that we cannot speak for ourselves later. Medical assistance in dying, as I said, has provided the context to have that conversation. Again, the imperative is, since the Supreme Court decision and subsequent legislation is really about choice, that we have to make sure the choices are there and we have to talk about those choices. It’s given us an opportunity to talk about something that’s really a very critical part of our lives, which we don’t talk about enough and which we don’t share with loved ones.", "Medical assistance in dying is only one part of the larger conversation on how we provide care for people at the end of their lives, and we’re working hard to provide that care. It’s going to take a lot of work, but I know that we’re all, in this Legislature, committed to doing it. We know that we want to give people choices about end-of-life care, and we know that 70% to 80% of Canadians would prefer to die at home if the right supports were available. We have to work to make sure those supports are available, not just from a perspective of government and the health services we fund, but also from the perspective of the communities that we live in and how we come together over those things that are important in our lives: our service organizations, our churches, our municipal governments.", "One of those things that we have to focus on is—look, it’s something we do through our municipal governments for kids coming into the world, and we do that provincially. We need to put a focus on that. We need people to understand what it means to support someone at the end of their life. It can be a really big family effort and it takes more than just family sometimes; it takes community. We have to think about our neighbours and we have to think about what resources we have in our community that we can bring to bear to help provide comfort and compassion and love and mercy to people.", "Although we know that about 80% of Ontarians want to die at home, we know that’s far less than what actually happens; most people die in hospital. About 6% of people die in hospice, and we’re trying to increase that. Hopefully we’ll be able to double that number.", "We’re doing some work right now on consulting with people in long-term care about some of the great things that are happening in long-term care and how we actually expand that and make that grow. I think that’s critical because long-term-care homes are home. As I’ve seen by going around, there are some really incredible things that are happening in many places in this province, but we need to have more of that.", "There is some work to do. We have to ensure that the high-quality supports Ontarians expect and want are available to them at the end of life’s journey. We’re going to ensure that people have options so they can make the choices that are right for them.", "Mr. Speaker, I just want to recap here, if you’ll give me a moment, the provisions included in this bill—the very specific provisions. You’ll just have to give me a second here." ],

The bill contains a narrow series of amendments to existing legislation, including amendments to the Excellent Care for All Act, which, if passed, would include the following two provisions: first, that MAID would not affect a right or a benefit that would otherwise exist under a contract or a statute, whether it be life insurance or survivor benefits; second, the physicians, nurse practitioners and persons assisting in the lawful provision of MAID would have immunity from civil liability.", "Again, amendments to the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act would ensure that claims under the act would be determined based on the illness or disease for which the worker was determined to be eligible to receive medical assistance in dying.", "There is also an amendment to the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act and the Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act that would, if passed, protect clinicians and facilities willing to provide MAID from being identified under access-to-information laws and requests.", "I did mention as well a number of provisions under the Coroners Act. Again, just to restate those: requiring the coroner to be notified of all MAID deaths, and also certain information would be required to be disclosed by clinicians so that the coroner is able to properly exercise discretion in determining whether to investigate; clarifying that the existing requirement under the Coroners Act to investigate any death from any cause other than the disease does not apply to MAID; also clarifying when the coroner is required to complete death certificates for MAID deaths; and requiring a review of the coroner’s oversight role. The Minister of Community Safety and Correctional Services would establish this review process within two years of passage of this bill.", "Finally, there’s an amendment to the Vital Statistics Act that would clarify the requirements respecting the coroner’s documentation of medical-assistance-in-dying deaths consistent with the proposed Coroners Act amendments.", "Again, you’ll see that in this proposed legislation we’ve outlined the steps necessary to safeguard the rights of patients and health care professionals. It is important that we take these steps to facilitate MAID. As you can see, they are a very narrow swath of what’s in our provincial jurisdiction, and what we need to do to make sure that patients and providers are protected.", "I want to congratulate the minister and the Attorney General, who worked on this act. I know there’s been a lot of work. As I said, we’ve done a fair amount of consultation in advance of this. As I said earlier, individually most of us have no proximity to this, and we need to have proximity so that we come through it together. It’s a really critical thing about how we display compassion, mercy and love as a society.", "I’m encouraged by what’s in this bill.

He mentioned that he had attended a number of ridings, and Leeds–Grenville was one of the ridings that he visited. Ottawa South is very close to a municipality in my riding, the municipality of North Grenville, which borders the city of Ottawa. Mr. Fraser was very—sorry; the member for Ottawa South was very accommodating. He came and toured the Beth Donovan Hospice, both their office and their new “forever home.” I know that I’ve advocated to him many times that it’s high time that the Champlain LHIN looked outside of the city of Ottawa for the next hospice funding. So I appreciate his advocacy.", "In terms of the question, I know that Minister Hoskins has received a number of letters regarding C-14 and the fact that the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario has adopted a protocol that requires an effective referral for medical aid in dying. This issue has come up in constituency offices. I spent a lot of time in my constituency office last week, and I saw a number of letters from my constituents asking me about an amendment to Bill 84 that would protect the conscience rights of physicians and other health care workers.", "So I’d like to, through you, ask the member for Ottawa South if the government is going to support an amendment. As I said, my inboxes have been filling up over the last week with constituents asking me to ask this question of the government, and I would appreciate if, in his final response, he would give me some indication of whether the government would support that." ],

In Windsor, a 53-year-old tool-and-die maker, Austin Bastable, wanted to die. He had MS. He could only move his head and his left hand. He tried to get Canadian doctors to help him out. Of course, at that time in Canada you were facing 14 years in prison if you did something like that. He tried suicide. It didn’t work; his wife found him and called 911. Anyway, a couple of years later, he went over to Detroit. Dr. Kevorkian was there, was in the home of the local president of the Hemlock Society. There were five other medical doctors from Michigan there. Austin Bastable was given a face mask and a cylinder of carbon monoxide. At 53 years of age in Detroit, instead of in Canada, he passed away.", "At that time in Canada, Prime Minister Jean Chrétien didn’t want anything to do with it, even though 75% of Canadians polled at that time agreed with medical assistance in dying.

They were setting up a process for conscientious objectors—that there had to be somebody on the premises. If the doctor or the nurse wasn’t going to tell you what the process was or a phone number to contact, for the family or the patient, there had to be somebody available to the patient for the referral or for the information referral. But it’s unclear.

With the 10-degree-plus weather, we were still able to clock people coming down the hill with the snow that was created the week prior.

So my daughter, Maggie, and her friend Hannah, and Karen’s son, Christian, and his friend Clark provided the action for the team. They did well. They finished about the middle of the pack, but they had a lot of fun, and we had a lot of fun watching them go down the hill.", "It’s a great opportunity for the hospital to still pull off an amazing event when it was spring-like weather and we had barely any snow available. Thanks to all the coordinators and volunteers who made that event happen. As I said, over $60,000 is a great amount of money that will definitely be going to not only our addition that’s ongoing at the hospital, but for other activities that the foundation supports. Congratulations to everyone who participated.", "Mr. Speaker, I’m here today to have the lead-off for the PC Party on Bill 84, the Medical Assistance in Dying Statute Law Amendment Act, 2016. It’s a great bill to start discussing in the Legislature. The way I view the bill is basically that it’s a housekeeping bill to clean up the implications from the federal legislation that occurred last year with regard to medical assistance in dying.", "Back in February 2015, the Supreme Court of Canada struck down the Criminal Code prohibiting assistance in dying. In the court’s view, assistance in dying should be granted to a competent adult person who clearly consents to the termination of their life, and has a grievous and irremediable medical condition, including an illness, disease or disability, that causes enduring suffering that is intolerable to the individual in the circumstances of his or her condition.", "The Supreme Court of Canada stated that “it is for Parliament and the provincial Legislatures to respond, should they so choose, by enacting legislation consistent with the constitutional parameters set out,” with the above reasons. As such, assisted dying became legal in Canada last June, on the 6th. Today, Ontario has introduced Bill 84, which we are starting to debate today, which, as I said before, I see as a housekeeping bill to add protections to various groups, organizations and individuals in the province.", "So what does Bill 84 do? Bill 84 provides clarity and legal protections for health care professionals and organizations that provide access to medical-assistance-in-dying services in Ontario in accordance with the federal legislation, Bill C-14. A doctor or nurse practitioner who provides medical-assistance-in-dying services shall notify the coroner with the necessary information to determine whether or not an investigation into the death is necessary. Basically, the Coroners Act is going to be amended to require that the coroner is notified, but it also allows the coroner to determine whether or not to investigate these deaths.", "Also changing in this legislation: Death certificates for medical assistance in dying do not need to be signed by the coroner, unless the coroner is investigating the death.", "A civil claim against doctors or nurse practitioners or others who provide medical-assistance-in-dying services is being prohibited except in cases of alleged negligence. This is, again, going to be protecting health care providers who will be participating in medical assistance in dying from any lawsuits, which, from the federal legislation, is part of that piece of legislation.", "The other part that they’re making amendments to: Benefits or other sums provided under contract or statute—basically payouts from insurance or other types of benefits—shall not be denied if the deceased person receives medical assistance in dying. So there we are. This legislation is protecting those families whose loved one has decided to choose medical assistance in dying. It protects those families so that they’re able to access the life insurance policy or any other benefit that they’re deemed worthy of. Also, the legislation points out that even with workers’ compensation, if the medical assistance in dying is due to a condition caused by the workplace where they worked, again, the family can’t be denied access to the benefits entitled to them, if they do so choose medical assistance in dying. It also allows for protection of information of the patient and the health care provider in the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act.", "What this bill is actually doing is setting out some protections and cleaning up the legislation brought forth by the federal government.", "Medical assistance in dying it is a controversial issue, no matter who is talking about it, on one side or the other. It is now legal in Canada. To many, it will be a valuable tool, a valuable option for them come the end of their life. However, there are other options out there that also need to be looked at.", "As pharmacists, very often we deal with people who are in palliative care—who are receiving palliative care either at a hospice in the community or in a hospital—and ensure that they have access to the necessary supports they need in order to facilitate the end-of-life journey in dealing with the pain and suffering that they’re undergoing. As noted, it was very important at the time that we were able to give them the pain medications and supports that they needed when visiting a home. Our pharmacy provided supports to the community care access centre nurses, part of their palliative care team. We developed the palliative care medical box. It was a box of various narcotics, antiemetics, and sedatives that would be needed by somebody who is dying at home. This facilitated easy access to the medications, if the proper forms were filled out by the doctor. I think that was a step in the right direction. We were able to get that started in Elgin county, and we’ve seen many changes since then.", "But as mentioned by our House leader, we do have to be cognizant that there will be some health care professionals out there who object to providing medical assistance in dying. We feel it’s a right that needs to be protected, and we are looking at making an amendment to this legislation that protects that right, provided there’s a quick and accessible process for people to obtain medical assistance in dying. We can find that balance that was mentioned previously by the opposite member, ensuring there’s access and quick provision of the services of medical assistance in dying and also protecting the conscience rights of those medical professionals who choose not to participate in medical assistance in dying.", "In fact, Mr. Speaker, if we look at, from committee, Bill 41, Maureen Taylor spoke at committee and was the co-chair of the Provincial-Territorial Expert Advisory Group on Physician-Assisted Dying set up by the Ontario government. Her husband, Dr. Don Low, passed away from a brain tumour. He gave an exquisite, emotional plea on YouTube about the need for assistance in dying being legalized in Canada.", "She did say at committee, and I’ll quote her, “I want to stress, too, that I totally support the rights of individual health care practitioners not to participate in assisted death if that goes against their conscience.”", "I think there’s a balance out there that we can look at. Even the strong advocates of medical assistance in dying provided expert advice to the government that they too share in the common thought that people’s conscience rights are something we need to ensure we can protect out there.", "The Coalition for HealthCARE and Conscience has stated that the right to freedom of conscience in religion is enshrined in section 2 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The protection of rights against discrimination is enshrined.", "Many other provinces, such as Alberta, have adopted alternatives to effective referral, and no foreign jurisdiction that allows assisted suicide or euthanasia requires effective referral.", "The member opposite is saying there’s a balance we have to trend toward. I think there’s a balance already out there, an example that we could emulate here in Ontario and ensure that we have quick access to medical assistance in dying while protecting those who have conscientious objections to MAID.", "A couple of the jurisdictions that were mentioned—Washington state has a provision in their medical assistance in dying that basically no one will be subject to “censure, discipline, suspension, loss of license, loss of privileges, loss of membership, or other penalty for participating or refusing to participate in good faith compliance” with medical assistance in dying.", "In California, the health care provider, professional organization or association “shall not subject an individual to censure, discipline, suspension, loss of license, loss of privileges, loss of membership, or other penalty for participating in good faith compliance with this part or for refusing to participate in accordance with subdivision (e),” which is participation in activities authorized pursuant to voluntary medical assistance in dying.", "Oregon, another state, and Vermont have ensured that the balance is there for those who need to access medical assistance in dying and those whose objections of conscience prevent them from participating.", "I’ve reached out to a few of the stakeholders and I’m still talking to many as we go forward. I’m glad the government took the opportunity to meet with as many organizations as possible. It’s good to see that there was some outreach on their part here. I’m waiting to hear back from a few patients’ groups.", "However, speaking with the Canadian Medical Association, their policy is to support those who will choose to provide/participate in medical assistance in dying and also those who will not. Their position articulates a duty that is widely morally acceptable and allows physicians to act as moral agents without in any way impeding or delaying patient access to assisted dying. They support the freedom-of-conscience choice.", "They have advised the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario to revise their effective-referral approach. Basically, they want to say that if Canada is to emerge with a consistent, pan-Canadian framework, they should be working with what’s going on with the other colleges in this country. By revising their effective referral approach, the CPSO is encouraged to support the creation of systems and resources that would facilitate access for those seeking medical-assistance-in-dying services.", "The College of Nurses of Ontario: Medical assistance in dying only allows nurse practitioners and physicians to administer medications to cause the death of a client. RNs and RPNs can participate in providing nursing care in aiding the nurse practitioner or physician to provide a person with medical assistance in dying. The college recognizes a nurse’s freedom of conscience. This legislation does not compel an individual to provide/assist in medical assistance in dying, but the nurse’s conscience objection must not be directly conveyed to the client, and their personal judgments regarding beliefs/lifestyle/identity are not to be expressed to the client. The client must be transferred to another nurse or health care provider who is willing to fulfill the client’s medical-assistance-in-dying request. Until a replacement nurse is found, said nurse must remain with the client and continue providing nursing care.", "The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario, which has been the topic of a bit of my sentences here: When the physicians limit the health service they provide for reasons of conscience or religion, the CPSO requires that they provide patients with an effective referral. An effective referral ensures a patient is connected in a timely manner to another physician who is non-objecting, accessible and available to the patient. An effective referral does not guarantee a patient will receive treatment. It ensures access to care and demonstrates respect for patient autonomy.", "I mentioned the coalition for health care and conscience rights. They represent over 110 health care facilities, which includes over 18,000 beds, 60,000 staff members and 5,000 doctors in Canada. Their members come from diverse perspectives, but agree that taking a patient’s life or referring this procedure violates one of the following: the Hippocratic oath, religious convictions, missions and values, professional ethics, creed or their deeply held conviction that health care should heal people and not hasten death.", "Now, a benefit is that I’ve heard the government is working with this group to try to facilitate a solution for this controversy that has flowed from a certain segment of the medical professions in this province. I’m hoping they work towards ensuring that there’s a process that can take over for these doctors who want to object for conscientious rights, one which does allow for quick access to medical assistance in dying.", "The Ontario Medical Association: supporting a patient self-referral option for medical assistance in dying in addition to current clinician referral service. OMA supports the efforts to ensure patient access, but recognizes that some physicians believe the act of making a direct referral conflicts with their fundamental beliefs. The OMA does not support CPSO’s effective-referral policy.", "RPNAO, Registered Practical Nurses Association of Ontario: Their principal concern remains how medical assistance in dying will impact the quality and funding of Ontario’s palliative care services. The RPNAO wants to ensure that we still have a good, strong support in growing access to palliative care throughout this province.", "As I mentioned earlier, Alberta has a process in place which basically—I have it here. I’m going to go from my notes here. Alberta has adopted an alternative to effective referral, and we have to note that no other jurisdiction that allows assisted suicide or euthanasia requires an effective referral.", "Alberta offers care-coordinated services. Patients will have access to a single point of contact for all end-of-life options. These services connect patients to health care providers who can best meet their unique needs.", "Alberta Health Services advises patients to speak with their normal health care providers about receiving medical assistance in dying. However, if the physician does not provide this service, they can contact the Medical Assistance in Dying Care Coordination Service through telephone or by email. This process protects a physician’s conscience rights as well as ensuring a patient will be able to access the services they’re requesting.", "I’ve had many conversations over the last year with a number of doctors. One is Dr. Ramona Coelho. She’s a doctor in my region of Ontario, who works in London and loves her job thoroughly. She’s been a loving doctor, helping people, and loves being with them to find solutions to their problems. She has a strong marginalized patient practice. Many of her patients are on permanent disability. However, Mrs. Coelho is right straightforward with all her patients at the start that she doesn’t believe in providing medical assistance in dying.", "She’s been practising for 10 years and, through her 10 years, her ethical limits have never been a problem with her patients due to her upfront discussions with them when they become her patients. She has never experienced an argument with a patient, nor has a patient complained about her with regard to her conscience beliefs.", "Dr. Coelho convenes meetings at the London Catholic doctors’ guild, and has spoken up in defence of conscience rights for doctors on a number of occasions.", "As a young doctor, Ramona was asked to teach medical students about family medicine, and was even encouraged to apply for a faculty position before she and her urologist husband made the move to London. Somehow, that accommodating, respectful and practical spirit began to evaporate after Dr. Ramona and her husband moved to Ontario.", "All she wants is a solution, preferably something that protects her conscience rights and respects her right to freedom of choice, and not to be punished by the college of physicians and surgeons. She fears that the next generation of Catholic medical students will be steered out of family medicine, which to her is terrible. Every faith and creed should have the right to practise medicine, provided access is available to those who need the services they need.", "We believe, as I mentioned earlier, that there’s room for improvement. This bill does a great job of cleaning up certain aspects created by the federal legislation in protecting health care professionals, protecting families. We feel that we have an opportunity to ensure that a process is put in place to ensure access to medical assistance in dying in a timely fashion at the same time as providing protection of conscience rights.", "The government plays a big role in ensuring that this process is in place. Unfortunately, there hasn’t been a lot coming out of this government in terms of communications to health care professionals and to the opposition parties at this Legislature. That’s unfortunate. We need to see medical-assistance-in-dying services in Ontario. However, we believe we need to find the common ground we mentioned much, much earlier.", "Legislation processes should be put in place to allow doctors to continue to serve their patients while having their conscientious objections legally provided, provided, as I said earlier, that there’s a process put in place for easy access to medical assistance in dying.", "Mr. Speaker, diagnosis of a terminal disease is a reality that many have experienced in one form or another. Through our significant others, extended families and friends, each one of us, I think, has been affected by this tragedy at one point in our lives. It’s very devastating when someone is diagnosed with a condition that our medical advances cannot cure.", "The federal government has added a new avenue for patients to access medical assistance in dying. However, we must remember that that isn’t the only option out there. We can’t lose sight that there are other options that we can take a look at.", "Palliative care is a great option which is aimed at relieving suffering and improving the quality of life for persons living with or dying from an advanced illness. Palliative care is to help the journey at the end of someone’s life. It’s a journey for the patient and the family to take together. The goal of palliative care is to provide comfort and dignity for the person living with the illness and for their families. Palliative care helps with the need for physical care, as well as psychological, social, cultural, emotional and spiritual care.", "Palliative care will not prolong someone’s life. It is commonly used as an option for families who have exhausted all other options and, again, are ending the journey of life. Palliative care can be given at home, it can be given at a hospital, and it can be given in a hospice.", "Unfortunately, in my riding of Elgin–Middlesex–London, Elgin county does not have a hospice. I’m currently a part of a committee with the LHIN, health care providers and community members to prepare our county for a hospice. We’ve partnered with St. Joseph’s Hospice of London, who is paying for our RFP to look at the services actually needed in Elgin county, so that when the government comes around with funding for the next batch of hospices, Elgin county is prepared to break ground and build that hospice.", "We’re hoping to have funding in place, and a hospice built sometime next year is our goal. We’re hoping the government does well with its commitment to expanding hospices. Unfortunately, many in St. Thomas and Elgin county have access to seven beds out of London, so you can see the lack of availability of hospice beds.", "I toured the Kensington Hospice, which isn’t far from here, a few month ago. What a beautiful place—a home environment, a caring environment, that is welcoming to patients and families and helps them through their journey at the ends of their lives.", "I do want to give special mention to two groups in Elgin county, HOPE and Serenity House. Both have been very supportive of palliative care and hospice care in our region for a long time. HOPE has recently expanded their services for grief counselling for youth.", "As I mentioned earlier, palliative care and hospice care incorporate support for the families not only during times of sickness and end of life, but when a loved one has passed on and has died, the support is still there to help those people deal with their grief. I think it’s great that HOPE has taken the time to create a program to help the youth of our area deal with the loss of a loved one.", "Canada is not the only area or the first jurisdiction to offer medical assistance in dying. I’ve already mentioned a handful of others, but it should be noted that other countries in Europe have been dealing with medical assistance in dying for years upon years. I think it’s an opportunity. If the government wants to reach a balance, we need to look at other jurisdictions and what is occurring, and maybe get to that balance a lot quicker than what is going on right now—to alleviate the concerns of the health care professionals, but also ensure that the access is there for them.", "Speaking of other jurisdictions in the health care system, it’s interesting to take a look and compare our health care system with regard to other jurisdictions in the world. The Commonwealth Fund report, which is an accepted report globally, ranks health care systems country by country. Unfortunately, Canada ranks 10th overall among 11 industrial countries on measures of health system quality, efficiency, access to care, equity and healthy lives. We’re 11th in timeliness of care.", "While we are debating the bill on medical assistance in dying, we should not forget that other issues affect patient care, such as the length of time it does take to see that specialist, to get that diagnosis, or the length of time it takes for a patient to get the palliative care services they receive. I know I’ve mentioned Elgin county, without a hospice, is left to a newly formed physician-nurse group for community palliative care, but that’s just new.", "I visited northern Ontario a week ago, Sault Ste. Marie and Timmins. The health care accessibility for them is extreme. The doctors in Chapleau were mentioning how hard it is for people to access palliative care and mental health care in a timely manner, and the burden it’s putting on the lone doctors in the area.", "We have to take a look that when we measure our health care system, we need to start comparing ourselves to other countries to see where we really do sit and where there are other jurisdictions that are performing much better than we are. We can do much better than we are doing right now. And the more we quarrel with our doctors, as this government has been doing for three years now, and demoralizing our nurses, the harder and longer it is for the patients to access the health care services they need. So when we’re talking about access to medical assistance in dying, we also need to be talking about access to palliative care, access to a family physician, access to that specialist and access to that test in order that they receive care in a timely manner.", "Many palliative care physicians in this province are lacking in the support needed from this government. They’ve made some mentions and some announcements, but this government, over 15 years, has really accomplished very little in terms of quality palliative care.", "Mr. Speaker, what are the top three challenges Ontario faces today in the health care system? I’ve mentioned wait times and access to care. The Auditor General’s report noted a few months ago that operating rooms are closed. In southwestern Ontario, if you want knee or hip replacement surgery, the financial year starts in April, and by October they’re out of money. It’s a rationed, underfunded system, which is compounding the wait-list.", "The second-highest challenge Ontarians face is the financial and emotional burden of supporting a loved one at home. The government has moved to create a larger bureaucracy. A year ago, the government came out with an Auditor General’s report which showed that 39% of the money going into the CCACs stays in the management and bureaucracy administration. It doesn’t reach front-line care.", "This government has utilized Bill 41 to merge the LHINs and the CCACs, and, two weeks ago, created 84 new vice-president positions throughout the province. They’ve created 78 sub-LHINs. The level of management is growing at the expense of patient care. It’s growing at the expense of access to palliative care, access to medical assistance in dying, access to that heart surgery, access to the knee surgery you need.", "Mr. Speaker, the third point of what Ontarians need and are experiencing the challenge in is the lack of available services in northern and rural/remote areas. As I mentioned earlier, with the northern Ontario tour in Sault Ste. Marie, at the physician clinic we visited, due to government cutbacks, the amount of mental health supports is gone. They’re unable to provide the supports. I was speaking to a doctor at London Health Sciences Centre who has provided much of the mental health supports outside in the rural parts of the riding. The cuts this government has imposed on the system—there’s a lack of support for youth mental health in the area.", "In Chapleau, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, the Chapleau doctors—there are three of them working full-time and there’s a fourth doctor, who is in his 80s, who is pulling his own weight. Two of the doctors are married. In order to have the full coverage, many times these doctors do not get time off, in order to provide after-hour emergency, weekend coverage. You’ll find these doctors are burning out because they’re working seven days a week the majority of the year, 24 hours on call. And these doctors have been demoralized over the last three years with how this government has vilified doctors to the public. It’s unfortunate.", "This government, over 13 years, has attempted many experiments on the health care system. Each one of those experiments has been costly to the patients of Ontario, because much-needed money for front-line patient care has been spent on management and administration growth. They created the LHINs. They’ve changed the structure of their own ministry five times. They’ve changed the role of the CCACs. They’ve changed the structure of the CCACs. They were responsible for one of the biggest scandals of all time, eHealth, which is currently at $8 billion spent on eHealth with no timeline to completion and many, many problems. They created hospital hubs. They increased Ministry of Health management structure by 500%. They increased departments within the ministry by 500%.", "When the Auditor General announced that, as I mentioned earlier, 39 cents of every home care dollar is going towards administration, they created Bill 41. Bill 41 does nothing for patient care, even though it’s called the Patients First Act. Bill 41 creates a larger management structure. It merges CCACs with the LHINs and creates 78 sub-LHINs, as I’ve mentioned.", "We’ve got to be wary with every announcement this government makes with regard to the titles they use in legislation. The Patients First Act and many pieces of legislation and acts are really about how they can create a higher, more burdensome bureaucracy. As we mentioned earlier today—in the question I mentioned about three-year-old Madison, who needs surgery so that she can walk—the ministry has approved the surgery, but they don’t fund it. The minister has a report on his desk and recommendations from their health experts on what to do with this surgery. I don’t know why the government isn’t acting on it. But, unfortunately, this poor three-year-old has to go to St. Louis for surgery. Unfortunately, because of the bureaucracy’s red tape that has been created, it’s virtually impossible to get through the entire paper—I wish somebody on the Ministry of Health side would help this poor family out to ensure that we can get some funding for them. They have to raise $140,000 to get the surgery that’s needed. They’ve made it difficult, almost impossible, for this family to gain access.", "The Premier’s answer spoke volumes to this government: “I don’t understand why it’s listed but not funded.” It’s because they’ve gotten so large in the management structure of the Ministry of Health that the left hand doesn’t know what the right hand is doing.", "What we need to do is to ensure that health care policies going forward benefit patient care, that we’re focusing our work on direct patient care, that we’re working with our health care professionals—our doctors, nurses, pharmacists, physiotherapists, respiratory therapists, physician assistants, RPNs—ensuring that they have the tools and support they need to provide the patient care that’s needed in this province.", "This bill on medical assistance in dying brings forth cleaning-up legislation, but we have to ensure that we are protecting the public and that we’re protecting health care providers. We have an opportunity to protect the conscience rights of health care professionals with some amendments, for which I think we can find a suitable solution between the three parties. But we also have to ensure that we don’t forget the other aspects, the other options out there for people who are on their end-of-life journey: to ensure that there is sufficient hospice care available to people; to ensure that hospitals have the correct numbers of staff and funding to deal with palliative care; to ensure our community care and community support system—that the management is minimized and more money is flowing to support the health care professionals that are calling on a loved one’s home to take care of them in their end-of-life journey; and just to ensure that palliative care and medical assistance in dying get equal share and equal support as options from this government.", "I think we can get there, Mr. Speaker. I think we can find a path. The experiments have to stop on the other side of this House. The government needs to start working with those involved with direct care. They need to look at other jurisdictions instead of creating everything in-house, like they tend to do. We can get there, Mr. Speaker.", "I want to thank all the members here today for joining us this afternoon and listening. I appreciate your willingness to listen. I look forward to debate and amendments at committee. As I said, I think we can get to shared ground, a level playing field here. We’ll be supporting the legislation, and we hope that at committee we can ensure that patients will get access to timely care and medical assistance in dying, while also protecting the rights of our medical professionals.", "I just want to reiterate that we need to ensure that we have the supports in place in our health care system so that people have access to all the services that they need to access during their lifespan, from birth to death, and that we have a quality funded health care system that ensures the respect of our health care providers, but also ensures the respect and wishes of our patients." ],

Actually, we still have a promise on the books. From the last promise, there are 10 hospices that we still haven’t seen, and now the government is making new promises of hospice beds coming.", "At the end of the day, good palliative care is part, as he said, of the continuum of care. If you want to have a robust health care system, this has to be a part of it. Palliative care has to be there. It has to be accessible to where people live. It’s not reasonable to ask somebody from my riding to travel 400 kilometres to go to a palliative care bed. That means the family is not around. That means you will live your last days in isolation.", "I want to put a pitch out, though, for a very good home that we have. It used to be called Maison Vale Hospice; it’s now called Maison McCulloch Hospice. It has just been renamed. They do fantastic work.

I’m sure his community is very grateful.", "There are a few things you said that I take issue with, that I don’t agree with, but I don’t want to talk about those things right now. I just want to go back to what I said earlier. This is a really difficult issue. It’s an issue that is potentially very divisive. If we take hardened positions on either side, we are not going to do ourselves good service. I know the minister has been working hard with those physicians and practitioners of conscience who are concerned about a care coordination service very similar to the model they have in Alberta. I want to assure the member that that work is going on and that we are very aware of those things, and communicating.

He beat them three times; the fourth one was declared a mistrial. They kept changing the law. Eventually, they convicted him of second-degree murder. He served eight years of a 10-to-25-year sentence. He was paroled, and part of the conditions of that parole was that he could no longer participate in or be present at any type of suicide involving euthanasia. He wasn’t allowed to even talk about it or promote it or even tell any other stories about his experience. He did get into politics, though. He ran for Congress. Even though he was well known, he didn’t get that many votes. I think he got less than 3%. He got about 9,000 votes when he ran for Congress.", "His claim to fame, I guess you could say, is that he ignited an international debate on this issue.

As I said, the bill is cleaning up a lot of the tidbits that needed to be cleaned up from the federal legislation—ensuring that families are protected and health care professionals are protected from litigation; that families have access to the rights and benefits that they truly need; and that information is protected from those who participate in medical assistance in dying.", "As I said earlier, we can hopefully reach common ground. I’m hoping the government is open to listening to amendments and debate at committee and will judge each amendment as it comes forward—as opposed to what has been the history of dealing with this government over the last two years: They don’t listen to what’s going on in committee, nor do they ever support any amendments brought forward by the opposition. I’m hoping that, at the end of the day, we can work for the betterment of the patients of Ontario, ensuring timely access to medical assistance in dying while at the same time ensuring the conscience rights of our health care professionals are respected." ],

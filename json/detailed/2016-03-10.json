  "text" : [ "It is always a pleasure to rise on behalf of the people I represent in London West. In particular today, I am honoured to join in this very critical debate about the government’s Climate Change Mitigation and Low-carbon Economy Act. Certainly, this is an issue that is vital to my community. It’s vital to the 107 ridings that we represent in this chamber. It’s vital to Legislatures across this country and around the world.", "In London, there was a city council report that looked at infrastructure needs and the vulnerability of infrastructure to climate change. That report noted that in the last 30 years London has had five severe flooding occurrences: in March 1977, September 1986, July 2000 and then twice in 2008, in April and December. The report said that climate modeling based on more up-to-date rainfall events and patterns suggests the city of London can expect to experience more frequent and severe precipitation events in the future which may seriously impact various public infrastructures.", "So there are costs associated with not addressing climate change. The costs go beyond economic. They are, obviously, environmental; they’re also political. Speaker, the decisions that we make on this bill are going to be far-reaching in terms of their implication, so we need to get this bill right.", "I want to state at the outset that New Democrats unequivocally support a cap-and-trade system. We recognize the urgency of taking action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the urgency of moving to a low-carbon economy. Climate change is real, Speaker, and the consequences of inaction are devastating. The stakes are too high to play around with half measures or to put a plan in place that doesn’t have the buy-in necessary to truly make a difference. We’ve already seen how this government’s failure to listen to expert advice, to heed the warnings that have been sounded, has undermined environmental initiatives in the past. We can’t afford another green energy debacle. It tainted the whole notion of green economy. It made people cynical about the government’s motivations in moving ahead. Instead of a collective commitment to promote sustainable development, to support environmental responsibility and ecological stewardship, people are starting to look at government legislation as simply greenwashing. That’s why New Democrats have been insisting that the cap-and-trade system that is established by this bill is fair, effective and transparent.", "What do we mean by each of these tenets?", "By fairness, we mean that we need legislation that will unify Ontarians, not divide them. There is nothing that divides people more than the feeling that some are being asked to contribute more than their fair share while others are getting a free ride. New Democrats want assurances that the cap-and-trade system will not disproportionately affect low-income Ontarians. They already pay a much greater share of their income in home heating and gas for their vehicles, so we want assurances that low-income Ontarians won’t be disadvantaged.", "In addition, we don’t want to see people who live in remote and northern communities across the province disadvantaged by the system. Northerners and people who live in rural communities don’t have the same options as those of us who live in southern Ontario to reduce carbon emissions. They don’t have access to transit. They wish they had access to transit, but they don’t have any other choice but to use their vehicles to get around. So they are limited in their ability to reduce carbon emissions. The same thing goes for those who live in rental apartments. They don’t have the ability to turn down their thermostat or replace their windows with energy-efficient upgrades.", "So the impact on renters, on low-income people, on northerners and on those who live in remote and rural communities will be much greater, and we need to ensure that there are some mitigation measures put in place so that these people don’t disproportionately carry the burden of moving to a low-carbon economy.", "Does this mean that we shouldn’t increase costs for gas and heating? No, it doesn’t. But what we do need to do is look at ways to mitigate the impact of these costs. This is what is being done in BC, it is what has been done in California and it’s what is going to be done in Alberta. We know that in BC there is a special rebate for low-income families. California requires that at least 25% of cap-and-trade revenues are spent on programs that benefit disadvantaged communities, and Alberta’s new plan includes a consumer rebate that will offset the impact of carbon pricing on most households in the bottom 60% of income across that province.", "New Democrats are not the only ones who are calling for measures to share the burden fairly to help low-income Ontarians be part of the solution. The Canadian Environmental Law Association and the Clean Economy Alliance have also urged the government to include requirements that revenue from the cap-and-trade program be used to counteract the impact of the program on low-income communities. In spite of what the government has heard from organizations like the Canadian Environmental Law Association and the Clean Economy Alliance, the Ontario government’s proposed system does not recognize fairness as one of the fundamental principles that need to be in place for an effective cap-and-trade system.", "I now want to turn to transparency, which is the second key tenet of any effective program of cap-and-trade. The government says that the revenues that are generated by the cap-and-trade system will be dedicated to climate change action. However, we understand that the money is going to flow into general revenue. The greenhouse gas reduction account that the government is setting up is not a separate, special-purpose account at all; it is an accounting procedure. The rules are flexible, as the Financial Accountability Officer has pointed out. The government can basically spend the money that is put into the account on anything it wants, including deficit reduction. There’s no guarantee that cap-and-trade revenues are going to increase overall funding for climate change action, no commitment to record money in/money out. The balance of the account can be spent on programs that are either directly or indirectly related to greenhouse gas emissions, but there are no guidelines about what this actually means and no firm restrictions on how that money can be spent.", "New Democrats are calling for the money to flow into a separate account that is separately and transparently audited and directly connected to targeted, measurable and independently verifiable greenhouse gas reductions. We want to see the revenues that are generated used to actually help mitigate the effects of climate change and bring about some of that fairness I talked about earlier. This cannot be done if the government is unwilling to open the books and tie this funding to evidence and to require tangible results.", "Finally, but of course most importantly, is the tenet of effectiveness. That is the third of what we see as the absolute fundamental preconditions for a cap-and-trade system. Because what good is the bill if it is not effective in actually reducing emissions? The way that the program is set up in this legislation is with as little oversight as possible. The system is delegated to an unaccountable private corporation that is not subject to public oversight. It’s not subject to the Auditor General or the Environmental Commissioner, which we, Speaker, see as unacceptable. The Financial Accountability Officer has said it is impossible to know if the revenues will actually be spent on new greenhouse gas emission reductions. The Environmental Commissioner is shut out of the legislation. She is not given access to the information and data that she would need to properly assess the system.", "We need look no further than Quebec to see what can happen when a plan is announced but there is no effective oversight put in place. New Democrats want to see this system work and we are looking forward to amendments to make sure that it does." ],

Alberta and BC are planning increases in greenhouse gas emissions. Alberta is planning increases. Manitoba: The NDP government there is adopting a similar system, very similar, and we are working very closely with Premier Selinger’s government. California is still trying to get to 1990 levels, which we’re 6% below.", "Mr. Speaker, this is a higher standard than anybody else, including New Democrats in Manitoba and Alberta. They have not had the standard. Quebec is now adapting the standards that we have. So if any member in this House has any difficulty understanding how the money is flowing, I would be glad to meet with them and take them through line by line exactly which programs are there.

I know the NDP, of course, on paper—this-cap-and-trade would set up a huge bureaucracy. Of course, huge bureaucracies are something the other two parties love. They chew up a lot of the scarce resources we have, taxpayers’ money. If we’re going to really share the burden fairly, this should be revenue-neutral, where the money comes back. Sure, we’re talking about a price on carbon, but this should not be a tax grab. We see, contrary to over here across the floor, that the budget is very clear: It’s $1.9 billion to pay off the deficit in 2018. We don’t think that’s fair; we think it will hurt the economy. If you really want to benefit the people of Ontario, give that money back.", "I have a small oil company in my riding; it also serves Quebec. His plea was: Stay away from cap-and-trade. There’s a huge bureaucracy in his own company—lawyers, experts and consultants—and he said, “We paid a huge amount of money to California for offsets. That does not benefit anybody in Canada, when your money is leaving the country.” So on top of the fact that it’s not revenue-neutral—that’s very clear in their own documents and in the budget—we see a big export of our own scarce dollars, and we need to do something.", "It may have been a Freudian slip, but the Premier called it “crap-and-trade,” and I think that’s not too far from the truth. We have to get away from something that just—they tried it in Europe, and it didn’t work. It was a huge bureaucracy that collapsed, with a lot of people getting into the market selling offsets that weren’t really beneficial to the system. It just hasn’t worked anywhere else." ],

You don’t have the money to expend on targeted investments that will actually show real reductions in greenhouse gases. If you actually do the analysis of the emissions in BC, you’ll find that they are rising. Where in California and Quebec emissions are declining, in BC they are rising because that process isn’t working. You don’t get serious, good greenhouse gas emission reductions unless you target opportunities for common, regular people to invest in hybrid cars, to invest in ground-source heat pumps and a whole bunch of others.

As I mentioned in my speech, the Financial Accountability Officer himself said—and I’m quoting here—“It is unclear to what extent these new revenues”—these new cap-and-trade revenues—“will be directly tied to new program spending or can be used to fund existing spending commitments.” There is nothing in this legislation that ties the revenues that are generated by the cap-and-trade system to actually reducing greenhouse gas emissions.", "The other big concern, when I talked about fairness, transparency and effectiveness, is that currently the bill before us includes this exemption so that all of the largest polluters in this province get a carbon tax holiday. They don’t have to pay for their carbon emissions until some undetermined date, whereas Ontario families—including those with the lowest income, including those from remote and rural communities, including those who rent apartments rather than own—all other Ontarians are being expected to start paying as early as January 1, 2017.

There’s some good in what the government is trying to do, but I’m thinking it’s leaving a lot of municipalities scratching their heads and figuring out how they’re going to pay for this. The way the government has set this up is that rather than the people who cause the cost of having to pick up the large recycling of those items that are covered by this bill, boxes and other such things—rather than them paying, we’re essentially asking ratepayers to pay. And the municipalities are saying they’ve only got so much that they’re able to do when it comes to room with the budgets they’ve got, and where are they going to get the money to offset all of this? I think municipalities are willing to do their part, but we need to have some system by which the people who make the products also have to pay at the front end so that it’s not the ratepayer at the end of the taxes who ends up having to pay. It’s always the same story with these people. It seems that the government has a predilection for passing on the cost from industry and pushing it onto the consumer and, in this case, the ratepayers of our municipalities.", "J’ai entendu, par exemple, de la ville de Hearst, qu’ils ont eu un débat assez animé sur cette question, justement, peut-être il y a un mois passé. Je sais que j’en ai parlé avec une couple de conseillers, dont André Rhéaume, et d’autres. Eux autres soulèvent la question et ils disent, « Écoute, on veut faire ce qui est bien et bon, puis on veut faire notre part. On comprend tous qu’à la fin de la journée, on a besoin d’avoir un système de recyclage qui marche, qui fait du bon sens et qui accomplit le but d’assurer qu’on recycle autant que possible plutôt que de mettre des affaires dans les dépotoirs. Mais, pourquoi est-ce que c’est la municipalité qui va devoir payer la majorité du coût pour être capable de mettre ce système-là en place? »", "So, donc, les municipalités, telles que Hearst et telles que d’autres communautés qu’on a entendues à travers AMO, the Ontario municipal association, disent qu’il y a un vrai problème avec la manière que cette affaire-là est faite. Moi, je me demande pourquoi le gouvernement a fait la décision de changer un peu le concept du premier projet de loi, qui aurait vu une plus grosse responsabilité de la part de l’industrie que dans cette version de la loi—à cette heure qu’ils sont une majorité—où on va transférer le coût à ceux qui payent les taxes dans nos municipalités.", "Je pense que le gouvernement a manqué un peu son coup. Possiblement, si on est bien chanceux, quand ce projet de loi arrive au comité, il va y avoir une chance pour les communautés, telles que Hearst et d’autres, d’arriver devant le gouvernement et de leur poser cette question-là.", "Je vais vous dire à ce point-ci, monsieur le Président, que je ne sais pas si vous le savez, mais la province de l’Ontario est plus grande que Toronto. Il y a d’autres municipalités. Il y a des municipalités comme Hearst, des municipalités comme Ottawa, Kenora, Sioux Lookout, Cornwall, Sarnia—il y a bien des municipalités dans la province. Mais ce gouvernement, quand ça vient à l’habileté du public de venir présenter devant un comité, ils disent, « Oh! On va aller à Toronto. On va rester ici, et tout le monde a besoin de venir à Toronto pour présenter à ces comités. »", "Dans le cas de ce projet de loi, je pense qu’on serait très bien servi si le comité embarquait dans un autobus—ou dans l’avion, dépendamment d’où on s’en va—et puis s’en allait à quatre, cinq ou six communautés à travers la province et parlait à des municipalités moyennes, plus grandes et plus petites pour savoir ce que veut dire ce projet de loi-là, comment ça va marcher pour eux autres et comment on peut améliorer le projet de loi pour faire ce qui est bien et bon quand ça vient à l’environnement.", "I don’t know anybody, Mr. Speaker, who doesn’t want to do what’s right for the environment. We are all living on this very small planet, and we all want to do our thing to make sure that we don’t pollute our planet and leave the planet in worse condition than when we were born on it. So we have to do our bit, and recycling is a big part of that.", "As I was saying—it’s a big surprise. I know that the government thinks that there’s no other place but Toronto. I love Toronto; Toronto is a beautiful city. It’s got a lot to offer—great people. But you know what? There’s more to Ontario than just the city of Toronto, and that’s why committees, when it comes to hearing from the public, shouldn’t just stay here in Toronto in the Legislature. We should actually do what this Legislature did for over 100 years until these guys came along, and that is to travel committees out into the community.", "When I got here in the 1990s, almost every controversial bill got to travel, and they would travel at least two to three weeks. If a government was doing a bill that affected northern Ontario, guess where that bill went? If the bill affected eastern Ontario, guess where that bill went? There was a sufficient amount of hearings that the public and those people affected were able to come forward.", "In this case, we know that especially small communities across Ontario have an issue with this bill. Sitting on councils in municipalities across Ontario, from Welland to Port Colborne to Hearst to Chapleau and to other communities, those aldermen and councillors that sit at those council tables want to do what is right. They’re green in their own right. They want to do their bit in order to make sure that we leave for our children a planet that is livable and not polluted. Part of doing that is making sure we have good recycling programs. But they want to do that in a way that makes sense for their communities.", "So I would argue, let’s travel this bill. Let’s allow this bill to go to some of the communities that are going to be affected by it so that we can hear from residents, councillors and various people that are interested in this, so that we can actually get it right and actually finish amending this legislation in a way that people will say, “You know what? I can stand behind this. This is a really good bill.”", "Is this a good idea? Absolutely. Nobody is going to argue this is a bad bill. But I think it can be made a lot better, and I think one of the ways that we do that is that we go out and travel.", "So, donc, avec les couples de minutes qu’il me reste, je ne veux que répéter que ce qui est important dans une démocratie, c’est de donner l’habileté au public d’avoir la chance de connecter avec leurs politiciens et d’être capable de connecter avec cette Assemblée. La manière qu’on fait ça, c’est à travers nos comités législatifs.", "Comme j’ai dit tout à l’heure, non seulement les francophones mais la population ont toujours eu la chance dans le passé de venir présenter. Je demanderais au gouvernement, quand ils envoient ce projet de loi au comité, qu’ils s’assurent en effet qu’on ne fasse pas d’audiences publiques seulement ici à Toronto, mais qu’on fasse des audiences publiques dans d’autres communautés qui vont être affectées par le projet de loi." ],

We’ve put service standards in that no one else in Canada has. It’s interesting, because I immediately got a call from municipalities in northern and remote British Columbia, and it looks like the BC government is moving there. So there is a strong consensus amongst the environmental groups and the municipalities.", "There is still some more work to do, to do some of these issues, but since this bill has gone through three debates now, people are anxious to get onto it. This is the third introduction of the bill. What’s different, and I just want to take a moment, because I think from this Parliament—there’s ideas from all parties. You’ll see a lot of people’s fingerprints in here on both sides of the House. There are many good ideas that have been offered over the years that we have tried to incorporate here.", "This is actually called the “circular economy” bill, not just the “waste-free” bill. The other bill that we debated earlier today is actually the “low-carbon economy.” I think, as members look at it, we are trying to get to a zero-waste economy by 2050, and a zero-carbon economy. The implementation of these two bills will be some of the biggest challenges we’ve ever had in Ontario because this is really economic legislation more than it is environmental legislation." ],

I can tell you that for probably eight or nine years as a regional councillor, I sat on waste management’s planning, steering and—there were two or three committees in the region of Niagara at that time. It is a real struggle for municipalities to get their minds around this. They try many different things. They do all kinds of pilots.", "I know that in my own riding, we used to have two small contractors, Burger and Protz. For many years, they were the waste management people. When the region took over waste management from municipalities, there was this promise that waste management costs were going to go down. Well, in fact, they didn’t go down, because after the first contract with waste management, which was a lowball, it edged out all the small contractors. It took lots of people who were making $18, $20, $24 an hour at that time—I’m talking more than 10 years ago—out, to waste management which now has one guy on a truck making just over minimum wage, driving, jumping out, emptying the recycling and emptying the garbage.", "Bigger isn’t always better in the world of waste management.

If you really want to find an issue in your community, propose building a new dump; propose transporting waste through your community. This bill is all about, how do we reduce that?", "What’s the benefit of this bill? The benefit of this bill is that by recovering resources from waste, you can create something in the neighbourhood of 13,000 new jobs in the province of Ontario and contribute something like $1.5 billion to Ontario’s GDP. This is important. Just look at what a great recovery that Ontario has had in manufacturing, a subject I’ve spoken about particularly in our riding, where manufacturing has been one of the real drivers of Mississauga’s economy coming out of the recession.", "The green economy is going to be one of the major drivers of the first half of the 21st century, and Ontario has got a lot of raw material that, at the moment, is locked in landfills. What this bill is all about is opening up that industry and enabling the recovery of glass, metal, plastic and organic waste, and by reprocessing that and repurposing it—particularly such multiple-use materials as metals, for example; separating out iron, copper, lead and all other metals—you can recirculate them and put them right back into new construction.", "That’s what this bill is about, Speaker. It’s about jobs, it’s about investment and it’s about moving forward in the 21st century." ],

We have a really excellent garbage and recycling system where it’s all done at the same time. They’re dual-combination trucks. What you have is a grey bin and green bin. They are quite large: A green bin is as big as this—pretty large—and the grey is a little bit smaller. You do your separation of garbage at your home and put your recycling, obviously, in the blue bin, I should say, and you put your garbage in the grey bin.", "I’ve got to tell you that at our house and at the cottage, where we have that system, it is unbelievable the amount of garbage that we actually put into the landfill now as compared to before. You can go an entire week and cook for your family and have the grandkids over and do all the stuff you got to do, and you’re lucky if you put out a garbage bag. I’m not talking a big green one, but one of those kitchen catchers of garbage into the grey bin, because everything, once you start separating it out, is pretty recyclable.", "It’s kind of funny. Imagine little old me, Gilles from northern Ontario, with my family—I’ve become the recycle czar. I’m the guy who opens up the garbage at the cottage and goes, “Hey, you guys put Kleenex in there. What’s that doing in there?” My family gets a big joke out of that because they’ve never seen me as that type of guy. But I see the value of it because it has really meant that we are not putting into our landfill a whole bunch of recyclables that have some value, that we can bring back into the economy, and, more importantly, that we are able to have a green environment.", "I’ve only got a few seconds. The other side thing: We had a huge bear problem in the area where I’m out at, Kamiskotia. One of the things that helped is that they reopened the dump. But this whole system about how we deal with our garbage at our own properties through this system has also assisted in diminishing the amount of bears that wander on to our property.", "So to the city of Timmins, a shout-out.

Mr. Speaker, our party has said we support this bill, although we are advocating for some changes. It is a topic that I’ve talked about before. In fact, when I learned in the last few minutes that I would be speaking to this, I went back in history to see one of the first times I was talking about the general concept of the bill.", "It turns out—time flies—it was Thursday, May 19, 2005, when I had the opportunity to put forward a private member’s bill. At that time, I was debating my own private member’s bill, which was Bill 195, An Act to amend the Environmental Protection Act with respect to the stewardship of products and of the packages or containers used for products. That really was the same general idea of what this bill is trying to do.", "Initially, when I was going to do the private member’s bill, I was just looking into deposit-return systems, which I thought worked quite effectively to recycle materials and reuse materials, particularly the system The Beer Store in Ontario uses, which has been so effective. But after meeting with constituents in my riding, in particular Dr. Jim McTaggart-Cowan—he had been out in British Columbia, where they had a product stewardship system, and he brought that to my attention, so I decided to expand my private member’s bill to be more about product stewardship. I want to quote from that, from 11 years ago, to talk about what product stewardship is.", "“So what is product stewardship? It’s a management system based on industry and consumers taking full responsibility for the products they produce and use, from their inception through to their final reuse or recycle state. It’s cradle-to-cradle management. The way it works is that government, on behalf of consumers, has three supportive roles.", "“First, it identifies which products it wants embraced, establishes targets for product capture and charges industry with the responsibility of forming a management board and preparing stewardship plans. Second, it assists industry by putting in place regulations to support the collective industry approach and ensures a level playing field for all corporations involved in the relevant sector. Third, it approves stewardship plans, monitors industry progress and ensures that plans are altered to achieve overall objectives.", "“Through this product stewardship approach, government moves away from funding, at taxpayers’ expense, waste management. Instead, it holds industry responsible for the full life cycle of a product but leaves it to industry to find the most cost-effective and efficient way to achieve it, assisting where necessary and desired.”", "I went on to illustrate, using the deposit-returns example, how that would work. In the case of beverage containers, “First, government designates beverage containers. Then government establishes a recovery rate of, say, 85% in three years. It charges industry with the responsibility of forming a management board, which prepares a stewardship plan. Government approves and monitors the stewardship plan, which, in this case, includes a deposit-return system. If industry doesn’t meet the target of 85% recovery, it must make changes to the plan. In the case of a deposit-return system,” the simple way you change the plan, the most likely thing you would do, is increase the deposit, which would then incent people to return the beverage containers.", "“Product stewardship works because industry comes up with the solutions. They know their business best, and they will come up with solutions that are both cost-effective”—because they’re responsible for a lot of the costs—“and that get the job done.”", "I went on to talk a bit about BC, because at that point—and now here we are 11 years later—BC was so much ahead of us here in Ontario.", "“In the year 2000, BC recovered 61% of glass bottles, compared to 45% in Ontario, 73% of PET, compared to 16% in Ontario—that’s probably why we have so much plastic in our ditches—and 84% of aluminum cans, compared to 50% in Ontario.”", "They had a system for paint, which we just don’t have in Ontario, under their product stewardship system. In BC, where paint is a designated product, it has changed the way they sell paint. Here in Ontario, our system is biased towards larger containers. Most of us have garages or basements full of partly filled containers of paint which, hopefully, eventually get disposed of in the proper way at one of the centres, where they can at least keep it out of drains and sewers. When you buy the four-litre container, it’s cheaper than if you buy one litre, so we usually buy four litres. Who doesn’t have a garage—and this is me, 11 years ago—full of partly filled paint cans? Where does the paint end up?", "In BC, product stewardship has changed the way they sell paint. There are more water-based paints. In some cases, you can bring your own container and have it filled. A 2003 BC government summary report looked at the paint stewardship program, which covers paints, solvents, flammable liquids, pesticides and gasoline. It is run by Product Care, a national, non-profit stewardship association made up of 100 brand owners. Product Care’s membership includes manufacturers, distributors and retailers. In 2003, they collected 5,683,000 equivalent litre containers of paint and gave away 107,000 litres in a paint exchange program. Flammable liquids collected were 121,000 litres, and pesticides collected were 31,000 litres. The way they used that was that 4.6% of paint was given back to consumers; 66% was recycled/reprocessed as paint and used in concrete manufacturing; 29% was used for energy recovery through fuel blending; and 0.2% was incinerated; 0% was landfill.", "You can see that product stewardship—this is way back in 2003—in BC was working. I’m proud to have brought this up in the Legislature back in 2005, with that private member’s bill that I’m very proud of. That’s an approach that our party, in later years, has adopted, and I’m happy about that, because I think it makes sense. I’m happy to see that the government is implementing a system that picks up some of those ideas.", "I’m sure there are still some concerns, particularly in the municipal area and what happens with the funding of the blue box system to do with this, and we’ll be watching that very, very carefully.", "The Ontario PCs certainly have long championed a plan to increase recycling and reduce waste through innovation and competition among businesses in the private sector. That’s exactly what I was talking about in my private member’s bill.", "Under the PC plan that we put forward, we would set measureable and achievable recycling targets for businesses, establish environmental standards and enforce the rules. Instead of government being in the business of trying to run these systems—which governments generally are pretty inefficient at doing, and usually make lots of mistakes—you have governments do what they should do, which is set the targets, be the enforcer and make sure the rules and the targets are met. If they aren’t met, then there are ways of achieving that, by fines or other means the government has. It’s certainly an approach that I’m pleased to see, in this bill, Bill 151, that the government is moving towards. We will certainly be very interested to see, in the way that it’s implemented, that it’s done in a way that benefits the province.", "We want to see a legislated timeline to eliminate some of the existing programs the government has, some of the eco tax programs. We want to see the waste cops that police recycling bins and garbage cans around the province dropped, and we want to see a reduction in the red tape and the costs in the current program.", "Mr. Speaker, I’m pleased to have had a few minutes to talk about this important bill. Certainly, our party will be looking forward to it and following it closely. We support in principle the bill, but there are lots of details that we will need to follow as it moves into committee etc." ],

I’m guessing that I’m sort of average in that category.", "The paint cans are really just an example as to why it is so important to travel with this bill, because life is different in the different parts of this beautiful province that we represent, and there are great ideas throughout. Wanting to recycle, wanting to recirculate, wanting to be green, is something that is shared throughout Ontario. You can travel to big areas, small areas, rural or remote. We all share the same thing: Nobody likes garbage. If it can be reduced, reused, recycled, we’re all for it. Sometimes there are some pretty nifty ideas that have been put forward. Let’s travel this bill. Let’s bring it to the different areas.", "I can tell you that garbage pickup and recycling in my riding is very different than in Toronto. I represent 30 little villages; none of them are big enough to be a municipality. None of them have mayors or councillors or anything like that, but everybody wants to recycle. What happens in my neck of the woods is that you usually have a neighbour with a pickup who will come around, you give him or her your garbage and they bring it to the dump for you. What happens at the dump is very different than what happens at the curbs for most of you. Come and see how it’s done." ],

This is a much-needed service that our residents were demanding and our residents used. I know, at the same time, our municipal partners have struggled with those costs, so it’s a good thing to see these recommendations put forward.", "Just flipping to the economic argument for recycling, we’re stuck at about 25% of waste diversion, we’re told, which I think is appallingly low.

We don’t want outbreaks of diseases, but there’s a price to pay, and that price to pay is the kind of packaging that we have today.", "I would just want to remind people that, as a consumer, you also have a responsibility for the products you buy and the manner in which you dispose of their packaging." ],

I know just recently, having bought a new printer for my home last week, there were probably 10 pieces of Styrofoam. Inside the box, there were four more boxes. Each cord was in a box instead of perhaps being wrapped in a piece of paper—newspaper or some kind of paper. It filled my grey box when I did my recycling on Sunday afternoon.", "I know that the Niagara region, where I live, is certainly weighing in and having a look at this bill, as well as the waste-free bill. They are concerned—I was reading an article in the local newspaper—and at this point, they don’t know what it’s going to mean to municipalities because there’s not a lot of detail in the bill. It’s really enabling legislation, so they don’t know what role municipalities are going to play at the end of the day. They wonder whether or not blue boxing will actually move to the private sector and what role they’ll play in that.", "But what they did say was—and we’ve heard it here this morning from several people—that when they open garbage bags in the Niagara region, 50% of it still should be in a green bin, a grey bin or a blue bin, and that diversion rates have really stagnated. So whatever we can do to improve that certainly will help in my riding, where we still have a landfill site." ],

In spite of the fact that it was a male-dominated House, the Legislature had a champion for this bill: Agnes Macphail, one of Ontario’s first two female MPPs, who was a driving force behind the creation of the Female Employees Fair Remuneration Act, which became the first step towards correcting the pay gap. Far ahead of a time when it was a popular topic, she had a strong sense of what the female workforce deserved. She said, “I want for myself what I want for other women: absolute equality.”", "I rise today during Women’s History Month to acknowledge the work done by women like Agnes Macphail who have come before us in this House, but much more needs to be done to honour their legacy.

Yet today, in 2016, we are still working to close the gender wage gap. There is a 31.5% pay difference between men and women, and it has barely changed in the last decade. It affects all women at every age of every profession. Not only that; Canadian women earn on average $8,000 less than their male counterparts who are doing the exact same jobs. This is twice the global average of a wage gap for equivalent work.", "As an assembly with 37 talented, hard-working female MPPs, we can and we need to do better to support the women of Ontario." ],

Regrettably, Ontario has the unfortunate designation of having the most farm accidents in Canada. To be fair, we have the largest number of farmers as well.", "One of the real dangers for many is that the farm is also the home, so not only are people working on the farm in danger, but also other family members and, in particular, children. Last year was no exception to the sad trend of deaths of farmers’ children. This is the largest tragedy, and we must do whatever is possible to deal with this.", "Every year—and it doesn’t seem to change—we hear of tractor rollovers, entrapment in flowing grain, death from silo gas or manure gas, and PTO accidents. I was speaking with the member for Perth–Wellington. He grew up on an Essex county fruit and vegetable operation. This is really scary: Randy Pettapiece was caught in a PTO—power take-off shaft—twice. That’s 540 rpm, and the newer equipment is like double that. His foot got caught once, and he ended up losing his boot and his sock. He was fortunate.", "Another time, he was on top of the other end of a grain auger—a grain elevator—trying to unplug, and his shirt got caught. His dad didn’t see it in time to shut down the equipment, and it ripped his shirt off. This equipment is really scary. There’s much more regulation and requirement for cover shields—safety shields.", "I will mention—as with Randy when he’s working on the farm—that I don’t wear rings. I’ve never worn rings. They get caught in things. Believe it or not, when I work on the farm, especially in the spring and fall, my partner and I wear very, very old clothing. It’s clothing that’s almost rags, almost rotten—it’s an odd thing to say this—because if something gets caught, it rips off. The sleeve will rip off instead of your arm ripping off.", "When I say that, I think of a gentleman—I’m one of the past presidents of our local Norfolk Farm Safety Association. I attended a presentation by a farmer named Ken Kelly, upcountry from here, and he has a steel claw. He talked about how prices were very bad back then in the 1970s. He talked about the stress. He had to lay off his hired man. He was working twice as long, working at night, working in the rain, working in the mud. He got his arm caught in a power take-off. He explained to us, after that happened, “You think you have problems with your farm and with farm labour and dealing with prices and dealing with stress”—stress is a big factor because of overwork and exhaustion. “Once that happens to you, all those problems disappear. You’ve just got one problem: You’ve lost your arm, and you’re dealing with that.”", "On top of these traditional dangers on the farm—it’s probably one of the most dangerous occupations—new threats are developing, and the book put out by the Farm Safety Association contains the fact sheets. They’ve also identified the danger of West Nile virus, one of the new, emerging vector-borne infectious diseases transmitted by mosquitoes. This particular disease, like Lyme disease, was not prevalent back when I was involved with farm safety. I give the association credit for addressing this threat as well.", "Farmers, like outdoors people, hunters, fishermen and people who work outside in the forest industry and construction, are oftentimes in a low, wet area. You’re exposed to not only mosquitos for West Nile; you’re exposed to the ticks that have moved into this area, which carry with them Lyme disease." ],

One of the inherent great things about family farms is that the family is involved. That’s also one of the inherent dangers. It’s a hard balance. I know that on our farm, we took all kinds of steps to make sure that it was as safe as possible. But still, there were close calls. I’m not going to go into a litany of what happens on farms all the time.", "Also, the thing about farm work that’s different than almost every other occupation is that it doesn’t go by a rhythm. Not only is it not 9 to 5, but there are times when you have to work all night. I can tell you a personal story. I had a very serious farm accident, but I’m not going to talk about that one. I almost had a second one after I was an MPP. I got home at 11 o’clock in the morning on a Friday, and we were putting in straw. Everything was going well, and at about 10 or 11 o’clock that night, there was no dew. You don’t need the weather channel: A farmer knows that if there’s no dew, it’s going to rain. So we were going. And at about 1 o’clock in the morning—I had a serious accident years ago and I spent a long time in the hospital. It’s because I grabbed the PTO shaft when I shouldn’t have. At about 1 o’clock in the morning—the way it works is that you shut the PTO off, you take the shaft off the tractor and hook it on the wagon. But you’re tired at 1 o’clock in the morning, and I thought I shut the PTO off; I didn’t, and I grabbed that shaft again. I told my staff and my son, “That’s it. We’re shutting it down.”", "And do you know what? We lost a lot of straw the next day, because it rained and it rained and it rained. But those are the things that make farming different. For many, especially when you’re young, it’s not a case of just hiring extra staff, because you don’t have the money to hire the extra staff. That’s why I had the accident in the first place. We rebuilt the barn. We killed ourselves working. We had a party the night before I had my accident. We had a party to thank all the neighbours who had helped us. The party went late because these people helped us build the barn. The next morning, I went to the barn to milk the cows at 6 o’clock, and at 9 o’clock I walked back to the house and said, “You’d better call an ambulance.” I wasn’t seen in the barn again for three months. Should I have had somebody else to milk the cows the next day? Sure. But there was no money to do that. We risked everything to go ahead.", "My last point—and this is going to sound like we’re a very accident-prone family. My dad died in a farm accident. He did something wrong: He got onto a tractor when it was running. The gearshift was here, and he hit the gearshift—I saw it happen; in the distance, I saw it happen—and the tractor hit him and I saw him die. My dad made a mistake, but if that gearshift had been locked, it wouldn’t have happened. I went to the tractor company, I went to the farm implements board, and they all said the same thing: “Well, your dad made a mistake.” I wasn’t arguing that.", "They sent me a letter that said, “Your dad made a mistake.” It was a farmer who sent me the letter that said, “You should never go onto a running”—I might take a couple of seconds more. “You should never get onto a tractor that’s operating.” I said, “You’re a farmer, right? A dairy farmer?” He said, “Yes.” I said, “Okay, so when you’re blowing your silo full, do you have somebody sitting on the blower?” He said, “Hell, no.” I said, “Well, how did the guy get on and off that tractor? When you’re running a grain auger, do you have somebody sitting on that tractor?” “Of course not.” “Well, how did he get off? How did he get on? When you’re running a generator, do you have somebody”—and he said no. That’s as far as it went.", "I was young; I was busy. A couple of years later, because I’d written to the farm implements board, I got a call from a lawyer in Texas, and I made a deposition. A 12-year-old kid had gone to shut off the grain auger, and what they figured was that as he was getting on, he hit that gearshift and it killed him. And then the company changed the tractors.", "So it’s not just farmers and it’s not just nature, and it’s not just enough to say, “You can’t get on a running tractor,” because there are times—I’m really glad the minister is here—when it’s unavoidable, and the rules and regulations have to reflect that.", "Thank you very much for this opportunity." ],

  "text" : [ "Thank you, Speaker. It gives me great pleasure to be able to rise in the House to speak to Bill 170 today. It seems only about a year and a half ago that I had the chance to speak to second reading of my first private member’s bill, the tipping bill. I’d like to remind members that we were able to get it to committee, the social policy committee, with unanimous consent. We made a few adjustments and it came back to the House for third reading and was approved by the House in the middle of December, just before we rose. That bill will go into effect on June 15, 2016. I was delighted at the fact that we had the unanimous support of the House on my first private member’s bill, and I was delighted that the House leaders were able to get together and find a way to move the bill forward.", "I think I’ve found another bill here that will also encourage the unanimous support of this House so that we can see it be proclaimed in due time, hopefully, in time for the week following the third week in June, because the third Sunday in June, as you all know, is Father’s Day. What I’m hoping to do with this bill—it’s a very simple bill—is that that week prior to Father’s Day we would recognize as Men’s Health Awareness Week.", "It takes a lot of work, as I know all members know, to bring a bill like this together, to reach out to stakeholders and pull together the information that people want to use for the debate, and so I wanted to say thank you to my staff. My staff, I’m sure, are watching on various closed-circuit TVs here or back in the constituency office: David Bellmore, who has done fantastic work in bringing this forward, as have Tom McGee and Kimberly Aherne, to make sure that the bill was able to move forward as speedily as possible. Thanks also to the member who’s immediately in front of me—Glengarry–Prescott–Russell—who swapped his ballot item with me in order for me to do this now.", "This new bill will deserve the unanimous support of the House because what it seeks to address is a chronic failing in men to look after themselves. When I first mentioned the idea to the Premier—I was sitting down beside her during a break in proceedings—her first response was, “Yes, men don’t really go to see the doctor very often, do they?” There’s a universal truth in that, it seems. It seems to be a proclivity that men have that we’re brought up thinking we don’t need the help of others. As a result, we don’t see the doctor as often as we should. Maybe this will be an opportunity during this week where men will take that time to look after their own personal health.", "The idea to do this bill first came to me from the Canadian Men’s Health Foundation. I met with Wayne Hartrick, who unfortunately can’t be here. The foundation is based in Vancouver, and he has been in a couple of times with the founder, Dr. Larry Goldenberg. They couldn’t be here today for the second reading, but they were here for the first reading and we had a media conference beforehand.", "When they introduced to me what they were hoping to see happen, I felt as if they were speaking to me directly. I felt that maybe I’m one of those guys who should probably take a little time out once in a while to think about their own personal health, how they’re running their life and what they’re doing to make sure that they have healthy outcomes.", "What it really reminded me of was what I hear from my mother so very, very often. My mother, Dawn Potts—I have mentioned her here before; she’s 87 years of age—says to me repeatedly, and to the other members of my family, “I wish your father had taken better care of himself.”", "I know what she means by that. Dad died when he was about 81, almost 10 years ago. He lived large. He was a very active man—a judge, lawyer, socialite and member of the bar association—and he lived long and hard. But my mother wishes that he had taken better care of himself. When I mentioned that to her, she said, “Well, you should take the same advice,” encouraging me to also take a look at how I’m living and see if I can’t do it better.", "Dr. Larry Goldenberg, a urologist out of Vancouver—just imagine the scenario: you’re a urologist and you’re dealing with men’s prostate cancer on a regular basis, and you know in your heart that this is a very preventable disease, with the right kinds of diet and exercise and other things. It must be extraordinarily frustrating to a doctor to be in that circumstance and to be practising his craft, knowing that it’s a preventable disease, so he invented the foundation. He founded this organization, the Canadian Men’s Health Foundation, in order to have men take a better look at what they’re doing.", "It reminds me somewhat of a conversation I overheard in the Calgary airport many years ago when smoking was permitted in airports. I was sitting at a bar, having a beer between flights, and a gentleman two over from me started up a cigarette and immediately turned to the gentleman sitting between us and said, “Is it okay if I smoke?” He was being considerate. I thought that was quite nice. The gentleman between us said, “Yes, go ahead. It’s good for business.” The man looked at him and said, “Do you work for Rothmans or something?” He said, “No, I’m an oncologist.”", "It’s a bit of black humour, of course, Speaker, but it speaks to the fact that, yes, it would be good for business if people didn’t look after themselves.", "I think Dr. Goldenberg understands that that’s not his focus. He founded this association in order to get to the heart of what it is that causes men’s bodies to decay in a way that they shouldn’t.", "I also mentioned the opportunity of this bill to my daughter Robin. Robin is a very intelligent woman in her late twenties who now works for OCAD University. Her first response was, “Wow, Dad, do you really want to be a middle-aged male standing up and looking for men to get special treatment? You should really test this idea with others, particularly in the women’s advocacy area, to see if this is going to ruffle feathers and be of concern.”", "I took her advice. I’ve spoken with a number of health care providers, people at women’s agencies, people in public health and, quite happily, to my surprise and hers, this was a recognition that men should spend a little extra time looking after their own health because, in doing so, they become better fathers; they become better husbands, spouses and partners; they become better sons. It’s really about family health, not necessarily just men’s health but family health. Healthy men help lead to healthier families.", "The Canadian Men’s Health Foundation is championing this. I’m delighted to see that they have a number of really high-profile champions assisting them as they move this forward. We have Brendan Shanahan, who is the president and alternate governor of the Toronto Maple Leafs. He’s putting his name, reputation and energy behind this project.", "Adam Kreek—Adam was here when I did my first reading presser. He’s an Olympic gold medallist in rowing and an incredibly inspirational public speaker. He came. Here’s a guy who understands health, healthy eating and healthy activity, and he is bringing that message to men across Canada.", "And then there’s Simon Whitfield, a four-time Olympian gold medallist, probably the highest-decorated Canadian triathlete, and he’s bringing his reputation—as well as Dr. Tony Finelli, who is an associate professor of urology at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre.", "This is the kind of group that they’re pulling together in order to assist in bringing this message home about men’s health.", "They’ve also got partners. The British Columbia government has made a very generous grant to the organization. They’re seeking additional supporting money from the province of Ontario, and I will support them in that effort as best as I can. Sun Life Financial has put significant funds into this, the Canadian Urological Association and Sportsnet. The Public Health Agency of Canada has invested in the program, as has the Canadian Mental Health Association. So it’s a widespread group of people who are recognizing the importance of men taking a step out and looking after their health.", "The Canadian Men’s Health Foundation has an app where you can go on your smart phone and answer a bunch of questions, and it will do a metric of what kind of lifestyle they think you’re leading and what your risks are. It can be done confidentially. I did it, and there were some warning signs there that I might want to take to heart. They have determined that something in the order of 70% of people who use this app make changes in their life—not significant changes, just a little change. That’s part of their model for their big campaign that they want to roll out during that week before Father’s Day: for men to make small changes. I was at a hockey game recently and there, on the big screen at the MLSE, was an ad that they’ve done about men making small changes. A man opens a fridge door, reaches in to get a beer and says, “Maybe I’ll have a bottle of water instead.” It’s sort of a sense that we just want to step back and make small changes in our lives for healthier outcomes.", "I have a constituent named Dr. Nigel Turner. He’s a psychologist who specializes in men’s issues. He wished he could be here, but he wrote in and I want to read into the record his comments: “This is a wonderful idea for men to move off that men should know better, to a more realistic and humane perception that men don’t know enough about their health, which they take for granted, and as a result they die sooner than they need to.” Dr. Turner runs an organization called Just for Today, and he has an alternative therapy program for men who are coming out of domestic abuse situations. Let’s be clear: There’s never any justification for domestic abuse, but sometimes men who find themselves in those situations are suffering from addictions or anger management issues. His program tries to step back with men, that before making men in that situation plead guilty to a charge, to make it conditional to go through his program, rather than the Partner Assault Response Program, in order to help them make changes in their lives which will make them be better partners.", "I’m delighted that we have Rocco Rossi in the crowd today, Speaker. I’ve known Rocco a long time. I know him as the “wise guy” who ran for mayor of Toronto not too long ago. He was executive director of the Heart and Stroke Foundation back when, and currently is the executive director of Prostate Cancer Canada. A good friend of mine, Al Stuart, was involved with Rocco back when he tried to establish a new program for fundraising. He was going to call it “Prostrate for Prostate,” the idea being that men should just go to sleep on the couch and people should sign up to pay for them to do that. That campaign didn’t quite take off, but the latest campaign that Rocco did, Plaid for Dad, was far more successful.", "We also have the Canadian Centre for Men and Families with us. There are a number of individuals here from that organization. It’s a group out of the city of Toronto who are active with male abuse issues: male-on-male abuse, spousal abuse, but also helping with the kinds of issues men face in divorce: separation from kids—those anxieties—giving them a better sense of how they can live more productive lives post-divorce. They’re doing great work in the community. I’m delighted that they will be here to join us today.", "What I would like to encourage in the House is that we get that same level of unanimous support I saw last night. If we are able to get this bill passed in time for this year, we will be celebrating Men’s Health Awareness Week the same week that my tipping bill comes into effect.", "On that note, Mr. Speaker, I’d like to leave the debate, and I hope I get all-party support." ],

One of the most tragic responses to preventable disease states is, “If only he had had an examination a year ago, this could have all been prevented.”", "Mr. Speaker, the health of all Ontarians is important.

And of course, there’s a significant cost to the health care system itself.", "The purpose of Men’s Health Awareness Week is to heighten the awareness of preventable health problems and to encourage early detection and treatment of disease among men and boys. This week will give health care providers, the media, public policy-makers and individuals the opportunity to encourage men and boys to seek regular medical advice and early treatment for disease and injury.", "As a society, we’re now doing more to stay healthy for a longer period.

It seems so fitting, at this time, that we also stress the importance of medical examinations that can prevent disease in males.", "We have more information than ever before about disease prevention, so let’s take that week and turn our minds to male health.

I would also like to commend the Canadian Men’s Health Foundation for their support and advocacy of this bill.", "I’m very strongly in favour of this bill on a personal level. My family always competed at high levels of sports, including myself, and exercise has always been an important part of our lives. Fortunately, we’ve had some longevity because of it. I think the combination of diet, exercise and—unfortunately, I worked in an environment that wasn’t too healthy, a steel plant, but thank God I didn’t smoke, which might have helped a bit—is very important. Exercise, good health and competition build a really good foundation for building health in men and women as well.", "This bill puts Ontario in line with many jurisdictions around the world that have also proclaimed the third week of June as Men’s Health Awareness Week. In 1994, Senator Bob Dole, a Republican, and Congressman Bill Richardson, a Democrat, sponsored a successful bill that proclaimed the third week of June as National Men’s Health Week. It has been followed by the governments of many US states and by the mayors of several large US cities.", "We’re all aware that many men are inhibited from looking after their health and well-being to the extent they should. In particular, many men have a reluctance to seek primary care which, among other things, can lead to early diagnosis of medical conditions. Sometimes men don’t put a high priority on their own health, and the tragedy of this is that the majority of premature deaths among men are preventable. The Canadian Men’s Health Foundation tells us that 70% of men’s health problems can be prevented by adopting healthy lifestyles, and that men are 40% more likely to die of cancer and 70% more likely to die of heart disease.", "Men are much more likely to die prematurely than women. Men are at greater risk of suicide than women in all age groups. Men tend to have a less healthy lifestyle than women: They’re more likely to drink alcohol to excess; they are more likely to smoke; they have poorer diets; and they usually have more accidents.", "Most critically, the United Kingdom’s National Health Service found that men are 70% more likely to die from cancers that are not specific to males or females—70%, Speaker; that’s pretty high. One side of that is the higher incidence of these cancers, again, partly caused by poorer lifestyles, but the other side is that men are far less likely to undergo screenings and more likely to delay a visit to a doctor to report troubling symptoms. Thus, their cancers are less likely to be diagnosed at an early stage when survival rates are magnitudes higher.", "I can’t emphasize enough, Speaker: We all—men and women—need to see a doctor at least once a year for a checkup. Even if you don’t have a family doctor, which is so important for continuity of care, make an appointment at a clinic if necessary. It’s free. There are many gaps and problems in our not-quite-universal health care system, but free access to a doctor for an annual checkup is not one of those. But we desperately need to address the continuing shortage of family doctors in the province, and I hope that the member from Beaches–East York, who sponsored this bill, is advocating just as strongly with his own colleagues in cabinet for expanded access to family physicians.", "We know that the health of men and women is profoundly determined by the conditions in which they live their lives. Unless we start to reverse the growing inequality in the province, the health of many lower-income Ontarians is only going to decline further. The government needs to do so much more to tackle inequality and stop the growing gaps in the health of Ontarians. We need universal access to a family doctor, and we need what the NDP has been calling for for decades, which is to ensure that no person in this province goes without their much-needed prescription drugs because of cost. But what has this government just done? It has asked nearly every senior in this province to pay up to 70% more for their prescription drugs. Speaker, what do you think that will do for the quality of seniors’ health?", "I have spoken many times before about the brutal fact that poverty breeds poor health. I read a very disturbing article in the Hamilton Spectator last week that spelled out in great detail the link between poverty and late-stage cancer diagnoses in Hamilton. In the old city of Hamilton, and particularly in the poorer parts of the lower city, the rate of stage 3 and stage 4 cancer diagnoses is extremely high—many times higher than in the wealthier, more suburban areas. These parts of the old city have low incomes, poor educational outcomes, high rates of poverty and the highest rates of late-stage cancer diagnosis. What does this mean? It means that high poverty is literally killing people in the lower city in Hamilton and in parts of my riding.", "For example, when colorectal cancer is diagnosed at stage 1, the five-year survival rate is 93%. If it is not diagnosed until stage 4, the survival rate drops to 10%. People who live in poverty have not had the same access to education that most of us take for granted, and have delayed access to their health care. They often don’t have a family doctor, they tend to delay seeing a doctor, they don’t necessarily understand some of the symptoms they are experiencing and they are less likely to undergo screening. It’s awful; really bad.", "Many parts of my own riding and the riding of my colleague from Hamilton Centre suffer from appalling rates of cancer and late-stage diagnosis. There are thousands of preventable deaths each year in Hamilton and across the province that may not have to happen in a fairer, more equitable society.", "To close, my NDP colleagues and I support this bill as an opportunity to raise much-needed awareness about men’s health, but it is critical that the government actually takes advantage of this opportunity. And it is equally critical that the government starts to get health care right, to make it a real priority and ensure that everyone in this province has equal access to a family doctor and to the prescription drugs they need.", "The Liberal government has spent the last year spinning a bit and talking about what they call “broadening” the ownership of Hydro One. It’s about time they stopped the spin and started thinking and talking seriously about broadening access to health care in this province." ],

So I really applaud this initiative by MPP Potts to have an entire week dedicated to raising awareness of men’s health.", "I do want to take a minute here to recognize MPP Potts’s consistent advocacy on health promotion issues, whether it’s fighting obesity—he is very, very passionate about that. He is also very knowledgeable on e-cigarettes, electronic cigarettes. I’ve had the pleasure of working with him, as the minister responsible for health promotion, very closely on a number of health promotion initiatives, and I can tell you that he is really passionate about this particular topic, so it’s no surprise that he is introducing this bill.", "I can also say that I think the timing is perfect. In June every year, on the third Sunday of June, we celebrate Father’s Day, so to have the week before that designated as Men’s Health Awareness Week, I think, is a fabulous idea. I think we can find all-party support on an issue such as this, particularly since the men do still outnumber the women in this Legislature. I think the men ought to be voting for this, in their own self-interest if nothing else, and we women will definitely support you, because women care about the men in their lives.", "Mr. Speaker, absolutely, as the minister responsible for health promotion, this bill has my full support, and I certainly hope that members from all sides will support it." ],

The member from Beaches–East York—the timing is maybe a little off, but with Father’s Day, it’s probably a good idea, just the bill working through. Of course, getting the government to pull up is a bit of a challenge as well.", "It speaks loudly to how sometimes we just forget our own health. We heard just a little while ago about farm safety. I look back at my own family, and some of the serious and fatal accidents, actually, on the farm. It all spoke about not looking after yourself.", "In my dad’s case, I think the stress of being responsible for a large family—if I go back into the early 1960s, there were no farms that were very affluent. Most farmers had more than one job. We had dairy cows. We planted crops. My dad sold seed in the wintertime when it was not planting season. We made maple syrup when it got a little warmer. Of course, when we got into the busy seasons, we worked long hours. We spent most of our time trying to get out of those long hours, being younger, but it was always his job to pull us back and make sure things got done.", "That stress plays on you after a while. I think that it might have been prevalent, as farmers, but I guess it was right across society, especially at that time, when there generally was only the one breadwinner in the family. As they aged, the fact that you might admit that you had a health issue—especially because for most of his life, health care was not free, so there would be the indication that if you went, it was going to cost money. We were lucky enough that I had an uncle that was a doctor, but many families didn’t have that. That added to the problems and the stress we have today. Little problems didn’t get looked after, and they became big problems.", "As you look through, there are so many examples, even in people of my generation, friends I had. I had a classmate in school who collapsed on the ice in Maxville. He had just retired, not a worry in his life, and all of a sudden everything changed for him. Luckily, one of the players on the ice was a volunteer fireman. They were able to use a defibrillator and resuscitate him. He had the necessary medical treatment and he’s still around today. But that was a lucky situation, because if he had been anywhere but at the arena, the outcome likely wouldn’t have been so successful.", "With a defibrillator program that we have in most of our public buildings, it really—just in Glengarry county, I wouldn’t even say in my riding, I think I know of three cases where somebody was saved by a defibrillator. Each case was a young man—a parent, most times—who had no idea there was an issue, but it turned out they had a serious heart issue. It just speaks of people not looking after themselves.", "I’m glad to see—I saw him today, too—a great champion for this cause and the community in general. We see him in so many areas where he’s involved and this is just another sector he is in.", "I was looking through the website—Don’t Change Anything, I think it was—and I see—" ],

Being a big Detroit Red Wings fan, I can remember—it may be more memorable to Detroit fans—certainly the Colorado-Detroit fights and the rivalries between the two teams. He was front and centre in that. I remember a couple of series-winning goals and the big fight they had that captured most of the hockey world for about 10 years. At that time, he was fighting for something else, but it’s a cause that he sees today as worth fighting. I know people he was acquainted with, Bob Probert being one, somebody who didn’t look after his heath. He was taken at a very young age. That’s just another example. Jiří was another one from Detroit, the defence man who had a heart attack under the age of 30.", "These are things people have. You don’t expect it and certainly you don’t get tested. In cases where you’re under 30 or 40, I guess you can see that. But certainly, I know as you get older, the idea of having a medical where you might check your heart is probably quite rare in society today. People generally go when there’s a problem, and when you’re talking heart, it’s generally a very serious problem.", "I know we don’t look after ourselves. One of the pages they had on the website was “Sweat is just fat crying.” I think it speaks loudly because nobody takes the time to exercise. If I look around this building, I would think that probably most of us enjoy the exercise, enjoy the time, but probably most of us don’t take the time, as well. We all know that’s not good. We probably hear that every day. If you take the time to do some exercising—actually, I did some this morning, but that was the first time this week, which is not acceptable.", "One problem I have is that if you do exercise in the morning, when you get to this building it’s so darn hot it takes you so long to cool off. It’s an issue. This building seems to be always 10 degrees too warm. You almost attempt not to move in this building because if you do—you know, the perspiration and all the other things go along with that. I know we had an energy bill today but maybe we can spend some of that money on fixing the heating system in this building, maybe put a window in the cafeteria or something downstairs. It just generally is way too hot.", "In my own family, my brother-in-law died of skin cancer at a young age, an issue that he became aware of, but he was too busy to look after it and by the time he got in to look after it, of course—it’s one of these silent killers. You have a little mark on your skin, and I guess in our family maybe it’s a little more—we’ve had a fair number of people pass away with skin-cancer-type diseases. It should be a wake-up call for us to look at.", "In the end, my dad died of colon cancer. Again, it was something that, if you get the testing done today, your chances of not getting cancer are almost 100%. It’s the old story about not taking the time or getting advice to get some of these tests done, and of course, it’s fatal. I look back at him. He was semi-retired and starting to enjoy his time. We were a little older, so we can look after things around the farm. It was a hard life for them, coming through the Depression and coming through the war. To have something that really is preventable just when things are getting better is the unfortunate part. It goes back to talk about people not looking after themselves.", "On a bit of a lighter note, I was at a seniors’ building in Chesterville, probably a year and a half ago. I think it was a protest against the physiotherapy cuts. Anyway, we were there, and there was a table where two men were sitting. I went over to talk to them for a few minutes, and one of them made a joke that when they have a dance or something, they are in quite a bit of demand. He said, “When you look around, we’re the only two guys in this place.” There were 70 or 80 people in the seniors’ residence, and there were only two men in the whole building. It just talks about the numbers. Again, it’s kind of funny, but when you look at the issue, it’s not all that funny.", "It’s just something that I think a day like today will do a lot to bring attention to, and it’s something that’s well overdue. We may be talking about men’s health, but when it comes to exercise and looking after yourself, I wouldn’t think that either sex in this building would be any different. Here, like in many places, we’re working seven days a week, and we tend to throw these things to the back and wait until something happens.", "I think it’s a clear reminder that everybody should be looking after themselves. It ends up being cheaper in the end, so don’t think of it as a money issue. If you can take care of something before it’s an issue, hopefully, you’ll stay out of the operating room or worse.", "Anyway, we will be supporting this bill and look forward to its passage." ],

I grew up at a time—I think a lot of people in this chamber are the same way—when men measured their success by how tough they were: if you were able to cut an extra cord of wood, if you happened to work in the bush, or muck an extra car underground or whatever it was that you did for a living. The generation of my grandfather, my dad and even my generation, to a certain extent, when we were younger measured our success by how strong you were and how much you could take to show how tough a worker you were. Nobody ever really thought about having to take care of themselves, because everything was a measure of having to show just how manly you were and how tough you were.", "It wasn’t just at work, where a lot of people would measure how much they could do: how many cords of wood and how many mine cars they could fill by hand. Once they finished, they ended up at the bar, and they would show just how tough they were by how many beers they can drink and how much food they could eat. I remember, as a kid growing up, that these men, who were probably a little bit bigger than I was and sort of larger than life, all ended up dying in their fifties or early sixties. Why? Because the lifestyle they led couldn’t sustain their life for as long as it needed to.", "I think what has happened over the years is that the generations coming up are a little smarter about what they do as far as choices, and how they measure success. Back in the day, we measured our success by the output of our work and our standing within the workplace. It was a different sort of ethic that existed at the time—excuse me, I have a cold; this darn cold has been running around.", "I look at the younger generation: My son-in-law Shane runs triathlons and watches what he eats and trains on a spin bike and runs outside. When it’s snowing and miserably cold, he will take off for a so-many-kilometre run, a so-many-kilometre swim in the summer, and a so-many-kilometre ride on his bike in order to be able to stay at that level. I remember talking to him at the very beginning when he started doing this. It wasn’t to compete; it was just something for himself.", "I think what we’re starting to learn is that if you don’t take care of it, you ain’t going to have it forever, so you better learn to take care of your body. It’s something that’s like saving up for retirement for a lot of people my age. Nobody really saves up for retirement until they’re about to retire; and a lot of people don’t start thinking about taking care of their health until they get into their fifties or sixties, and it’s a little bit too late and you’ve had a couple of scares.", "I’m the guy whose blood pressure went through the roof last September. That’s why I was off from this place for two or three weeks. I started checking my blood pressure and it was going nuts, and it took a while to regulate. That was a sign something was going on. So it took a while, and since then I still have a lot of bad habits. I still like my beer every now and then, and I certainly love pasta. You can’t get away from pasta; I don’t care how hard you try. But you walk more; you watch what you eat. As you were saying earlier—and I appreciate that—you grab a glass of water instead of a glass of wine. I’ve done silly things. Like, I don’t keep any alcohol in my apartment because I don’t have to drink it. I’m at the point where I don’t do a lot of that at home either. It’s choices that we make.", "I want to say another thing because it really is important. This Legislature treats its members poorly. The member from Hamilton East–Stoney Creek sort of heckled it, but there’s no shower in this building for members who want to bike into work, who want to jog into work or walk at a brisk walk, to be able to get out of their jogging clothes and go to a place and have a shower and then get dressed up in our monkey suits that we wear when we come to this place. I used to bike to work and I stopped doing it because the only shower in this building—and a lot of people don’t know that—is downstairs in the north wing, below the Liberal caucus services. There’s a place down there that looks like a dungeon. That is the shower. I wouldn’t suggest that women go there because there are no curtains, there are no doors, so there’s no privacy. That’s the best that we can do for the members of this assembly.", "We treat ourselves shabbily because our lifestyle stinks. Really. We don’t eat well. We work long hours. We’re constantly under stress. We choose to do these jobs but we don’t make it easy for members to be able to come to this place and to exercise.", "I would just close on this one point in regard to how maybe the House leaders can get together and make this thing pass quickly. I’m a House leader and I’ll just say this: Just so people understand, the Liberal caucus will have to decide which bills it wants to move on at the end of the session when it comes to the deal we make with private members’ bills. So if the Liberals choose Mr. Potts’s bill and say, “This is a bill that we would like as part of the package at the end of the session,” I don’t think we’re going to have an objection on this side of the House, but you have work to do on your side. I’m pretty sure that, in fact, it is supported by your caucus." ],

He was part of the Canadian Olympic team in 1936; he sprained his ankle and couldn’t go. In 1940, four years later, of course, was World War II, and the Olympics were cancelled. In 1944, four years later again, the Olympics were cancelled.

They’re also more susceptible to developing an insecure attachment style, which can impair their abilities to form relationships later in life.", "Partners of these women are also at an increased risk of depression and anxiety.", "In the most severe of cases, these illnesses can lead to suicide and infanticide.", "The complexity of this issue was expressed to me this past summer when I had the opportunity to travel throughout our province to collect Ontarians’ input and experiences to work towards a fetal alcohol spectrum disorder strategy.", "This past fall, I released my report on what we heard at those round tables. Among the things that stuck out to me were claims that FASD is preventable. It seems simple when you think about it: If you don’t drink, your child will not have FASD.", "But there were voices that challenged that, and I’m very glad that they did. They asked us to consider the women who had no choice but to drink. They ask us to remember that there are mothers who are addicted to substances like drugs and alcohol. They reminded us that there are mothers who feel they have few choices but to cope with their mental illness with alcohol.", "Yes, FASD is preventable, but prevention means more than simply not drinking. Among other things, it means that mothers have the resources, tools and supports they need to manage mental illness in a healthy way.", "There was another common thread from the FASD round tables that carries over to maternal mental illness that I want to highlight, and that is the presence of stigma. Mental illnesses carry their own stigma in our society as it is, whether it’s due to lack of understanding, a fear of some sort or an overemphasis on what it means to be “normal.” There’s a tendency for mental illness to force individuals to deal with it on their own. Luckily, we’re moving towards a culture of mental health maintenance in which we consider our mental well-being to require as much routine maintenance as our physical health.", "We should know that women are not simply mothers-in-waiting for society to prescribe upon, but we have a tendency to heap the pressure on women as keepers of not only their own health but the health of their children. That is not an easy stress to deal with, and it does not create the sort of environment where a woman feels safe to come out as mentally ill during their pregnancy. This creates a significant barrier to their willingness to seek medical attention and to receive a diagnosis and treatment.", "Although a significant barrier is a lack of awareness about what treatments are available, many women fear that mental illnesses are predominantly treated with medication, and they worry what sort of impact that will have on their fetus or nursing child. Most women are not aware that treatments include non-medical behavioural changes or that some prescription medications are safe to take during pregnancy. Proclaiming this day will provide organizations an occasion to highlight these options so that women feel more comfortable to come forward with their concerns and illnesses when they most need help.", "Our government is moving forward with a mental health and addictions strategy. Since 2003, funding for mental health has increased by over $506 million, to a total of $3 billion. Phase 2 of that plan will provide further funding to community partners for service delivery and fill the gaps in our system.", "Of course, the ministry’s best practices for health care professionals include health promotion initiatives that encourage parenting skills and healthy-development knowledge of newborns and their families, into which mental health promotion and parental self-care promotion are integrated. But knowledge of what constitutes maternal mental illness, how common it is and what can be done to manage it deserves an opportunity to be highlighted so that women feel comfortable coming forward can find the services they need and can ultimately live safe and happy lives.", "Speaker, thank you for the time. I look forward to further debate." ],

  "text" : [ "I’m very pleased to rise and speak on Bill 176, the Maternal Mental Health Awareness Day Act. Full disclosure: I have four children. I did not suffer, I would say, mood swings or anxiety. Actually, I felt better when I was pregnant than when I wasn’t pregnant, which is probably why I had four children—because my blood pressure, I guess, is normally a little low, and it was probably normal.", "But I was hit very hard when my mother passed away about seven years ago. That was the first time in my life where I felt what you would really call clinical depression. You wake up in the morning and you feel like you have weights on your arms and legs, and you have to really push yourself to get out of bed. That lasted for me for about a month or two, and then it just went away. But I have a vast support network and I’m very comfortable telling people how I’m feeling and asking people for advice, and even going and speaking to my doctor and seeing if I should be going for counselling or anything like that.", "I can’t imagine, though, how a woman would feel, giving birth, which—you know what?—can be physically painful, not just the delivery but even after the delivery. It’s okay to say some medical terms here, I think, but a lot of women—not myself but a lot of my friends had pretty difficult episiotomies. They had trouble healing. Women have Caesarean sections—a lot of complications we all know where pieces of the uterus are left inside and horrific infections.", "To have to give birth and then not be feeling well afterwards and then, on top of that, feel the way that I felt after my mother passed away—I just can’t imagine having the responsibility of caring for an infant who is so in need of comfort. An infant is not just about providing food and changing a diaper. It’s about smiles, it’s about warmth, it’s about cuddling. How difficult that must be not just for the mothers but for the rest of the family members—there are often other children involved—and for the infants. This can hit every culture and anybody from any socio-economic background.", "We rely so heavily on women to support families and to support elderly parents. We really need to offer women the support they need because when the women collapse, we all know that the families can’t continue and cannot function.", "The member from Eglinton–Lawrence—and I’m glad he’s in the House today because I was really moved by some of the stories about women who lost their child. We’re talking about postpartum depression, but that’s not just for women who’ve delivered a healthy child. There are also women who, unfortunately, have given birth to a stillborn child or a child who passes away soon after delivery. Obviously, that’s going to create a significant amount of difficulty in terms of the mood for the woman and the family around the woman. We need to offer far more support for women when they give birth to healthy children, but even more for women who have children who have health challenges of all types and maybe don’t survive into toddlerhood and beyond.", "We need to focus on what our priorities are here in the Legislature. We hear that all the time. Maybe we get tired of hearing it, but I want to repeat it. The priority has to be what we’re collecting taxes for. That tax revenue is to go—it’s not our money; it’s to go to support health care, education and social programs that every Ontarian deserves and needs. Yes, it’s important for us to talk about these things, to talk about mental health awareness and talk about supports, but without the funding properly directed and going to front-line care—not just to another administration and another bureaucracy and another special day commemorating, but to actually go and do some good. That’s what we need to get done here. That’s what we need to focus on.", "I want to say that my hat’s off to all those in our communities who are out there helping people, and I would advocate that anybody who has free time on their hands to, please, volunteer, be a support. You can even do it from the comfort of your own home. If you know somebody who’s given birth or is about to give birth, offer your support. People are very shy to reach out, but they do need a helping hand and just sometimes a friendly phone call.", "Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I look forward to hearing all the comments on this bill." ],

I know I myself, at the birth of my first child, had that experience. The first night, all the new mothers were called into a room. There was a photographer and we could get pictures of ourselves with our new infant, and I experienced this sudden moment of panic: How could I possibly care for this tiny, fragile infant? I actually fled that room. I could not stay. I went back and I cried. I sobbed, because the physiological changes that were going through my body had a really powerful impact on how I felt.", "This just touches the surface of what many women in this province and in this country can experience after they have a pregnancy. Some members in this House may recall that in 2000 there was the story of a 37-year-old family physician who threw herself under the subway with her six-month-old son. She was my family doctor, and that experience, having been so close to somebody who entered into the grip of a terrible, powerful illness that she could not control—she was a family physician as well as a psychotherapist, so she was helping other people work through their own mental health issues, but she was unable to help herself because of this terrible postpartum psychosis.", "That postpartum psychosis, those extreme kinds of events, are rare, fortunately, Speaker, but they are a reality. We know that less-severe forms of postpartum depression and anxiety affect about 20% of women in this province.", "I applaud the member for bringing this bill forward, for proposing to create a maternal mental health awareness day. Education is one of the first steps.", "In the example that I provided of the family physician, there was talk, initially, of laying charges against her. The infant died immediately. She survived about a week or so afterwards. There was talk that if she did recover, charges would be laid against her, which I think really shows a fundamental misunderstanding of postpartum psychosis as a very real illness. She was caught in the throes of something that she could not control, and it would be unreasonable to expect her to be able to.", "Education and awareness are critically important but, really, Speaker, they are only the first step. I found a very useful document from Public Health Ontario called Scan of Parental Mental Health Best Practice Documents. Certainly, yes, education regarding mental health in the perinatal period is identified as a best practice guideline, but there are many, many other practices that are recommended as being important to help women deal with parental mental health issues.", "This report found that women who received psychosocial or psychological interventions were significantly less likely to develop postpartum depression. What that means is intensive, individualized postpartum home visits provided by public health nurses or midwives. It means peer-based telephone support systems. It means interpersonal psychotherapy. It means facilitated self-help.", "There are recommendations around intensive screening for all women in the antenatal period, and also screening for depression during the postnatal period. It means assessing the interaction between mothers and infants in the immediate postnatal period, with careful observation and documentation.", "We need resources to be able to carry out these best practices. We’ve seen a government that has laid off thousands of nurses across this province. We cannot move forward and address some of these issues if we do not have health care professionals in place to provide the kinds of services and supports that are needed.", "In my own community of London, there is an organization called Mother Reach London and Middlesex. This is a coalition of over 20 community members and professionals. It was established in 2003 with a three-year provincial government grant, but since that time, it has had to rely on Trillium funding and attempts to cobble together some resources through fundraising events.", "I don’t think this is a sustainable way to ensure that these services are going to be available to women in our province. It’s not an appropriate way to deliver services to women in our province.", "Again, I appreciate this bill coming forward. I view it as the first step in a longer-term strategy to address maternal mental health and really deal with ensuring that the supports and services that women need are there." ],

It’s my pleasure to speak to it as the minister responsible for women’s issues, and I want to talk a bit about some programs we offer at the Ministry of Children and Youth Services. The one I want to talk about specifically is the Healthy Babies Healthy Children Program.", "First, I just want to say that I think it is really important, when we look at the intent of this bill, to raise awareness of the broader mental health issues that affect women during and after pregnancy. We know there’s still so much stigma associated with mental illness. I know, from my own experience and from the experiences of some of my friends, that it’s extra difficult to deal with that stigma, especially around all the excitement of being pregnant and giving birth. It’s such a celebratory time in so many phases of the pregnancy, birth and beyond, but if you are challenged from a mental health point of view, I think the stigma can be just so great.", "A lot of women I know had high-risk pregnancies, and I had one, too, so I was part of a support group for mothers who were high-risk. I was carrying twins—I think it was triplets, but I lost one of them. Anyway, I got engaged in this group. I never thought I would give birth to premature infants, but I did. My twins came about six weeks early. It can be so hard when you’re trying to be excited about what’s before you, especially as a new mother, and then to deal with the risks of pregnancy and the challenges of giving birth to premature infants, who often go on to have challenges, whether they’re physical challenges or other developmental challenges.", "If passed, the bill would heighten awareness of the broader mental health issues that affect women, and it would certainly be in line with what many other jurisdictions do. So I congratulate the member for Durham for raising the conversation around this issue.", "As the MPP mentioned when he introduced the bill, there are some great programs. I just want to give a shout-out to the one at my ministry, the children and youth services ministry, called Healthy Babies Healthy Children, to support vulnerable women and children from the prenatal period until children reach school age. After a baby is born, all new families are offered the Healthy Babies Healthy Children screening program to determine if they would benefit from further services to support healthy child development. That could include home visiting and referrals to community resources and coordination of other services. It’s a great program. I know we are getting stretched with our resources with that, so it’s an area that I’m looking at specifically, to make sure we can help all new babies and their families be well supported.", "Again, congrats to the member from Durham for bringing this forward." ],

This incredibly valuable facility, located in my riding of Whitby–Oshawa, has an outpatient women’s consultation service with an interprofessional health care team providing flexible, individualized treatment to patients.", "In 2010, Ontario Shores opened the first clinic in Durham region that provides specialized consultation and treatment to women who suffer from a combination of mental health and women’s health issues. These issues include postpartum depression and postpartum psychosis.", "As a patient named Dorothy said, “I liked the holistic approach to care with the nurse, social worker and psychiatrist. Everything was explained thoroughly and I was reassured I would be taken care of. If something happened, I had their help and support.”", "It’s challenging, though, Speaker, when a facility of this quality has not had an increase in funding for so many years. Instead, what has occurred is layoffs of 25 staff. In my view, Ontario Shores should be given the financial capability to perform to an even higher level than it is today. Mental health is just as important as physical health, and governments need to treat it that way.", "This legislation, in my view, is just a start.

It takes a country, it takes a province and it takes a city to raise a child. Although this bill is well-meaning, and of course we’re going to support it, when you’re talking about maternal health, both mental and physical, you’re talking within the context of a province that really hasn’t spent a lot of time focusing on this.", "We didn’t see a lot for children in this budget, and a budget is a moral document. For women who are raising children in this province, they are facing the highest child care costs in the country. They are facing a child care crisis, I would say, where only one in 10 children actually has a space in child care.", "I can tell you that, as a new mother, one of the social determinants of health is housing, as well. We have over 70,000 people in the GTA waiting 10 to 12 years on affordable housing lists. So picture it: The face of poverty in Toronto is a woman and child’s face. The face of poverty in Toronto is a woman, the single head of a family, and her child’s face. That is the face of our poverty.", "We know that at least one in six children live in poverty, that they go to sleep at night without enough to eat. We know you cannot support a child on what the government pays you if you are on social assistance as a woman. You can’t do it without visiting a food bank. That’s the simple reality. And you can’t get a space for child care so that you can get a job. It catapults, Mr. Speaker.", "I remember extremely well having my first child. I didn’t have parents to help; they had passed on long ago. My in-laws were in Chicago, a long way away. I was completely unprepared for what I was about to experience: a colicky baby—and if anybody has lived through a colicky baby, you know what I’m talking about—who screamed six to seven hours a day, and I didn’t know why, and we couldn’t fix it. I can tell you, after a few months of no sleep, a few months of worrying about whatever was wrong with this baby—maybe it was just a growth phase—and even with a partner and even with some supportive friends around, it was incredibly difficult. I can only imagine what that situation would have been like if I had to worry about my rent; if I had to worry on my own, without support around me.", "Again, you heard the member from London West talking about the lack of home care after birth. That is so important, Mr. Speaker. It’s so important to have someone else come in and help you out, just with simple things like groceries, washing the dishes, doing the laundry. Those kinds of simple chores, especially if you’re a single mother, can make the difference between mental health and not mental health. Those are the social determinants of health.", "Of course, we know that if you don’t look after women, you don’t look after their children either. When we talk about maternal health, we’re talking about, ultimately, women’s health. We’re talking about women’s health. Again, poverty plays a role. As I said, the face of poverty in this province is a woman with a child. That is the face of poverty. Whether those across the aisle want to admit it or not, that is the face of the homelessness crisis. It’s the face of a woman with a child. Yes, a time of awareness for this is extremely important, but we need to do so much more. What we need to do—that is the “so much more”—has been so obvious.", "As I said, Mr. Speaker, 50 years ago I marched in my first International Women’s Day march here in Toronto. Guess what we stood up for then? Free universal child care; freedom to choose over your own bodies; freedom from violence; and equal pay. And 50 years later, I spoke at the Mary Spratt Breakfast, along with the member from London West. What did I say? “We’re still marching for the same things.” How long will it take before we have child care? How long will it take before we have equal pay? How long will it take before we have freedom from violence, and the freedom truly to choose?", "It all hits home when a woman is at her most vulnerable, and that can be after birth. First, let’s look after the social determinants of health. Let’s look after women’s health. Let’s look after children. Let’s attack the poverty issue seriously, not just with lip service, because that ultimately determines the health of both mother and child.", "My goodness, yes, another day: Let’s acknowledge that.

I’ve often wondered what she would have been like if she’d grown up in her family with her mom and dad and her brother and sister.

They’re supposed to be great from the instant they give birth, and then they’re supposed to go back to work—these are the moms who give birth to healthy babies.", "There are about 40,000 women every year in Ontario who have stillborn babies or second- or third-trimester miscarriages. They get zero help. They are told, “Go home and try again. No problem, go back to work.” They’re not even eligible for maternity leave. In some cases, they have to give their maternity leave benefits back if they have a stillbirth.", "It’s about time that we started to yell and scream about this: 40,000 women who have pregnancy loss, the other ones are successful, and they get very little support from society and the media.

Before I do, I want to recognize some of my sisters who are here in the gallery with us today: Yolanda McClean, who is CUPE Ontario second vice-president; Christine Laverty and Laura Thompson, from OPSEU Provincial Women’s Committee; and Angela Thompson and Sara Labelle, also from OPSEU. I thank them for their support.", "I also want to recognize some of the other organizations that have expressed support for my bill, including the Canadian Resource Centre for Victims of Crime, Women Abuse Council of Toronto, WomenatthecentrE, the Canadian Labour Congress, Ontario Federation of Labour, ETFO, OECTA, Unifor, the Toronto Medical Officer of Health, the Centre for Research and Education on Violence Against Women and Children, and many more.", "Speaker, this bill addresses the gap that exists in the government’s current initiatives to deal with sexual violence and domestic violence, through Bill 132, as well as its It’s Never Okay action plan. It is an evidence-based bill that is informed by research and the experience of other jurisdictions. It is the missing piece that was highlighted during the hearings of the Select Committee on Sexual Violence and Harassment, during the public input that the social policy committee received on Bill 132, during the Changing Workplaces Review and during the gender wage gap consultations. The bill honours all that was heard throughout all those different consultation processes, and also some of the recommendations of the final report of the Select Committee on Sexual Violence and Harassment.", "Passing this bill will further Ontario’s reputation as a leader in addressing sexual violence and domestic violence and, ultimately, through mandatory workplace training, in reducing gender-based violence across the province.", "The purpose of this bill is to amend the Employment Standards Act to require employers to provide up to 10 days of paid leave, as well as reasonable unpaid leave, to workers who have experienced domestic violence or sexual violence, or whose children have experienced those forms of violence. The leave can only be taken for specific purposes related to or arising from the violence, and that includes seeking medical attention; going to a victim services organization, a rape crisis centre, a sexual assault centre, a women’s shelter or any one of those myriad community organizations that support survivors; seeing a psychologist or another professional counsellor; relocating, which we know is a very real likelihood for women who are fleeing domestic violence; or meeting with law enforcement officials or participate in legal proceedings.", "This is important, because throughout this whole last year of the Select Committee on Sexual Violence and Harassment and throughout the government’s action plan, what we heard repeatedly from the people who spoke to the select committee was that we need to take a survivor-centric approach to dealing with these issues. We need to consider the survivors’ perspective when we’re looking at the needs of those who have experienced domestic violence or sexual assault.", "From this perspective, whether the violence was experienced at home, on a date, at work or anywhere in the community, the basic needs of survivors and the supports they need to help them heal are the same: health services from a nurse, a physician or a psychologist, counselling from a rape crisis centre or a women’s shelter and, as I said, moving to a new residence, potentially a women’s shelter or some other kind of second-stage housing.", "Of course, if survivors decide to report the violence—and as we know, that only represents about 10% of survivors—there are meetings with the police, there are meetings with lawyers and there’s the time that has to be spent preparing for a court trial if the case goes to court, then testifying on the witness stand. Recognizing that survivors of domestic violence and sexual violence should not have to jeopardize their employment because of the harm they experienced, this bill puts in place protections to enable women to deal with the violence and to seek the support that they need without risking their job.", "We know that a number of US states have already passed legislation to provide unpaid leave for domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking, and those include California, Colorado, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Kansas, Maine and Oregon, and New York City, Philadelphia and Washington.", "But it’s also true that many survivors of domestic violence and sexual violence can’t afford to take unpaid leave, and that applies particularly to people who are most vulnerable and also are more likely to be victims of sexual violence or domestic violence, such as racialized women, women with disabilities, LGBTQ individuals and others.", "The District of Columbia provides paid domestic violence and sexual assault leave of three to seven days, and in November 2015, Manitoba became the first Canadian province to provide paid leave for domestic violence—NDP government, by the way.", "I expect that some of the members to my right may raise concerns about what this is going to mean for employers. Isn’t paid leave going to be too onerous for employers to manage? Will it open the floodgates for workers to claim, unjustifiably, a leave of absence? Well, with regard to the second point, the bill does include a provision to allow employers to request reasonable evidence that the leave is for one of the purposes that is specified in the bill. This can be done either through future regulation or through adjudication by the Ministry of Labour. Certainly, throughout that process, we’ll want to ensure that the evidence does not impose too high of a bar that it ends up preventing workers from accessing the leave.", "We know from other jurisdictions—in Australia, there are paid leave provisions across, probably, a third of the workplaces. A 2014 study found that employees who access the leave requested just one to three days of paid leave.", "Australia is really leading the way on issues of domestic violence in the workplace. There was a report in November 2015 called Male Champions of Change, which is an initiative involving 30 CEOs and high-profile leaders in business and the public sector. They recognized that paid leave, in addition to other leave entitlements, is critical to help employees experiencing violence to maintain their employment and to ensure their financial security. That report recognized 10 days of paid leave as a developing norm across that country. One of the CEOs who is involved in the initiative said that his firm has 32,000 employees and only 22 had accessed the paid domestic leave over the last six months, with an average leave of 2.3 days.", "This leave will not cause financial hardship for employers, but the reality is that employers will have to pay now or they’ll have to pay later, because there are significant financial costs to employers associated with domestic violence and sexual violence in the workplace. There are costs associated with reduced productivity, increased absenteeism, decreased employee morale and the cost of replacing, recruiting and training new employees as victims resign because they can’t manage the violence that they’ve experienced with their job or they may be dismissed for performance reasons.", "There was recently a Canadian study that looked at domestic violence in the workplace. It was conducted by the Centre for Research and Education on Violence Against Women and Children. This was a national survey of more than 8,400 respondents. Half of them were from Ontario. A third of the respondents said that they had experienced domestic violence. Another third said they believed that they had a co-worker who has experienced domestic violence. Not surprisingly, four out of five of the victims—the survivors—said that the violence had affected their job performance. Less expected, perhaps: 30% of the co-workers who were aware of somebody else experiencing violence also felt stressed in their workplace. The effects of domestic violence in the workplace are pervasive. They affect not only the employee who’s experiencing the violence, but also those around them.", "Finally, I want to touch on another very important provision of my bill and that is the requirement for mandatory workplace training on domestic violence and sexual violence. The survey that I just referred to asked respondents, “Do you get information about domestic violence in the workplace?” Less than a third of the workplaces said that they were receiving information in their workplace, even though we have Bill 168. We have legislation under the Occupational Health and Safety Act that requires workplaces just to provide that information. Employers are not fulfilling their obligations under the Occupational Health and Safety Act, so we need to make mandatory requirements for this information to be provided.", "But more than information, we need training. We know that people who are experiencing domestic violence in the workplace are quite likely to disclose to a co-worker: 43% disclose their violence to somebody they’re working with. Co-workers don’t feel equipped to be able to know how to deal with a disclosure of domestic violence, so information and, more importantly, training in the workplace are critical.", "There is an excellent information and training package that was funded several years ago by the Ontario government, and I do give them credit for it. It is Make It Our Business, a very rich and robust information and training package available to all employers across this province on a voluntary basis.", "The select committee received a presentation about this Make It Our Business training package. When we asked how many employers are participating, how many are taking up this excellent training package, we learned that it’s about 1%. About 1% of Ontario employers are bringing this kind of training into the workplace, to engage their workers in recognizing the signs of domestic violence and also in knowing what to do if a co-worker discloses.", "I ask all MPPs to do the right thing. Let’s solidify Ontario’s status as a leader on sexual violence and domestic violence, and vote to pass my bill." ],

We understand the importance of it, and we will be supporting this bill today. But we want to acknowledge that workplaces in Ontario have certain measures in place. Yes, this will strengthen those measures, as will Bill 132.", "The Occupational Health and Safety Act is the only legislation of its kind in Canada to require employers to take every precaution reasonable, in the circumstances, to protect a worker from domestic violence that may occur in the workplace. An employer must respond when they become aware of domestic violence that may expose a worker to physical injury in the workplace. We made this information on domestic violence available to assist people in workplaces and to assist workplaces in dealing with these situations.", "With the passing of Bill 132, our commitment to the safety of workers has increased by ensuring that employers are doing all that they can for men and women who work for them, each and every day.", "Our government believes that all women in Ontario should feel safe in their communities, their homes and their workplaces. We have launched a groundbreaking action plan, It’s Never Okay, that is investing $41 million over the next three years. We’ve implemented many initiatives to raise awareness of domestic violence and to strengthen supports for victims since 2004.", "This includes the following initiatives under our Domestic Violence Action Plan:", "—the Neighbours, Friends and Families public education campaign, training more than 34,000 front-line professionals and service providers to recognize the signs of domestic violence and learn how to support victims effectively;", "—the Employment Training for Abused/At-Risk Women Program, which provides women with specialized supports and services to help increase their employability and income-earning potential; since 2006, more than 3,200 women have participated in this program, and 77% of graduates have found jobs or pursued additional training within six months of graduation; and", "—the Language Interpreter Services Program, which will help many of our diverse ridings, like my own and which helps victims of violence, including human trafficking, who face language barriers or who are deaf or hard-of-hearing to access services. In 2014-15, over 10,000 victims accessed interpreter services through 790 agencies, and more than 44,900 hours of interpreter services were provided.", "We understand and we know that we have more work to do, and we’re committed to doing that work. As the member is well aware, we heard from a number of labour stakeholders during the select committee. During our travels with Bill 132, we were able to travel the province and take in consultations which helped make decisions on any amendments we made to Bill 132 through clause-by-clause. We’re going to continue to work and further our action plan, It’s Never Okay, to support everybody in our community, whether it be in their workplace or their home, on campuses and in schools.", "Thank you again for bringing this PMB forward, and we look forward to supporting it today." ],

I want to commend the member for London West for bringing forward this bill. She gave a great speech this afternoon, and I know that her comments were meant sincerely. It’s important to note that this bill would amend the Employment Standards Act, 2000, and also the Occupational Health and Safety Act.", "Just to quickly reiterate what the bill is all about, the Employment Standards Act would be amended and an employee would be able to take a leave of absence if they had experienced domestic or sexual violence. They would also be in a position to take a leave of absence if their child had experienced domestic or sexual violence. They would have to use the leave for certain purposes, such as seeing a doctor, going to victim services organizations or meeting with a lawyer. The leave would last for a reasonable time or for a time provided by regulations made under the act, and workers would be entitled to be paid for up to 10 days of leave in each calendar year. They’d also be entitled to reasonable accommodation with respect to their work hours and their needs in the workplace.", "The Occupational Health and Safety Act, as I said earlier, would also be amended if this bill were to pass. The employer would have to ensure that every manager, supervisor and worker receives information and instruction about domestic and sexual violence in the workplace.", "Mr. Speaker, I recall my first election in 1990 and some of the issues that were brought up at the all-candidates’ meetings. It seems that, through the years, some of those memories from the first election are especially vivid and poignant. This was an issue that came up time and time again in that first election: the need to do more to support victims of family violence. I know that that was an issue that I brought into this Legislature in terms of my thinking right off the bat. Sadly, 25 years have passed and we’re still talking about the need to do more to support the victims of family violence.", "As I said, I think this bill is well intentioned and well meaning. It reminds us that all victims of domestic and sexual violence need our support—not only the support of government but the support of our society as a whole.", "This bill would give employees who are victims of domestic or sexual violence up to 10 days of paid leave, as well as a reasonable time period of unpaid leave, if need be, from work. We think that this bill should be sent to a standing committee of the Legislature for further discussion and public hearings so that more discussion can take place and interested parties can come forward and tell their stories.", "I know that because we’re in this long session that’s almost two years old there are a lot of bills at standing committees right now. There’s quite a backlog, I think, in private members’ bills at all of the standing committees, but it would be my hope that this bill would have the opportunity to receive public hearings, obviously.", "The member for London West noted that there are many other jurisdictions reviewing this issue, and some are currently providing unpaid leave for employees. I understand that this past November the province of Manitoba became the first province to introduce legislation to provide paid leave for victims of domestic violence. When we check the website for the province of Manitoba and their Legislature, it appears that the bill very recently passed third reading but has yet to receive royal assent or be proclaimed to come into force. I guess that will follow in due course, if we read the website correctly.", "We believe that employers need to be consulted on this issue because this bill, if passed, would certainly—there’s no question—add to their payroll costs. We would ask the question if it’s fair to ask employers to foot the entire cost, and we would ask, as well, why isn’t the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board doing more to be supportive of victims of domestic and sexual violence?", "I would say, Mr. Speaker, that we support this bill in principle. We agree that more must be done to support the victims of domestic and sexual violence, and that there is a need for employers to support their employees if they are victims. We would want to see this bill sent to committee for further discussion and ensure that all parties who have an interest in this bill would have a chance to have their say.", "We have two other members of our caucus who want to speak to this issue so I’m going to have to stop now, but I thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, for listening to my remarks on Bill 177. I look forward to continued debate, and again want to congratulate the member from London West for bringing it forward." ],

I’m incredibly proud of the work that the member from London West has done on these issues around domestic violence. She rightly points out that this is a missing piece of Bill 132, and so this is an opportunity to fill that gap.", "When I was going through her validators for the legislation, one that stuck out most for me was the medical officer of health for the city of Toronto, Dr. David McKeown. He rightly points out why this is so important for the workplace. They point out the damaging effects of domestic and sexual violence in the workplace as needing a comprehensive public health approach because, as the member pointed out, these workplaces become poisoned when violence invades them. It is a serious public health concern, as rightly pointed out.", "The letter of support is completely well-researched and documented, but what stuck out most for me, Mr. Speaker, is that Dr. McKeown says that this is how perpetrators of violence interfere with the workplace and an employee. This is really an extension of the power that a perpetrator has over a victim. They move it outside of the home into the workplace. Sometimes they prevent employees from getting to work. They repeatedly phone or email. They come to the workplace; they ask questions of the co-workers. They are dishonest with co-workers about the victim’s whereabouts, they threaten co-workers and they verbally abuse or physically harm the victims. They also stalk these women in these workplaces. We have evidence of this and we have tragedies to prove it. Essentially, we are still at a place in our history where we have to accommodate this violent behaviour in order to keep women safe.", "I think that we can all agree that we still have a huge amount of work to complete on this file, but certainly this piece of legislation is one more tool that can actually try to keep women safe outside of their home, and is an extension of their workplace so that they are not revictimized when they get to work.", "I commend the member for bringing this piece of legislation forward.

  "text" : [ "It’s always a pleasure to stand in this House on behalf of my constituents in Burlington and speak to issues like this. It’s such an important issue, Bill 177.", "I’d like to thank the member from London West for her passion and her advocacy and, in particular, for initiating this important conversation in the House today. This is a bill that seeks to address an issue that is close to our hearts as legislators, and it’s an issue that is sometimes difficult to talk about but one that we must confront.", "Ending sexual violence and harassment, ending violence against women, ending violence, period, is a priority for our government, one that I know the member opposite shares. We understand the tremendous and devastating impact that violence and harassment can have on individuals and their families and friends. That is why I’d like to tell the member opposite that our government and I support this bill, as the member from Brampton–Springdale already noted.", "Back in the fall of 2014, when the Premier announced that she would form an all-party committee of the Legislature to examine sexual assault and sexual violence and harassment, including sexual violence in the workplace, I was honoured to be asked to be part of that committee. I’m pleased to say that the member for London West was a part of that committee as well. I enjoyed the work we did together, culminating in the report that we tabled in this House in December. The witnesses that we heard from shared deeply personal stories with grace, dignity and courage, and we received hundreds of useful and very compelling recommendations from across the province. The response we had to the work of the committee gave me an indication of just how pervasive this issue really is. In fact, we had to add additional public hearings to accommodate the demand to testify, as the member will recall. Much of what we heard was heartbreaking but, sadly, not surprising and not completely unexpected.", "I started my career 30 years ago as an assistant on Parliament Hill. In fact, as the member from London West knows because she was there, too—we both were there together at the same time, as I learned later—sexual harassment was an issue then as it is now.", "I later had the privilege of working at the Canadian Advisory Council on the Status of Women where, in 1992, I had the privilege of working, with a tremendous team of women from across the country, on the national conversation on the rape-shield law. Speaker, when we brought those groups of women together and worked with organizations like the Women’s Legal Education and Action Fund and the Canadian Association of Sexual Assault Centres, we really thought that, in passing the rape-shield law, we had come a long way. We talked about the education of judges. We talked about the importance of the issue as a society, much as we’re doing here today. There were some very high-profile incidents in public discourse, and we really thought we had done a tremendous service, and indeed we had.", "But as it turns out, unfortunately, sexual violence and harassment continues to be far too pervasive in our society. That is why we recently passed Bill 132, the Sexual Violence and Harassment Action Plan Act, and launched an action plan, It’s Never Okay, investing over $41 million over the next three years in programs and initiatives to address sexual violence and harassment.", "Since 2004, initiatives such as our government’s Domestic Violence Action Plan have taken a multi-faceted approach, involving many initiatives, including the Neighbours, Friends and Families public education campaign, and the training of over 34,000 front-line professionals to enhance their ability to recognize the signs of domestic violence and help to give victims the help and supports that they need. The Domestic Violence Action Plan also includes the Employment Training for Abused/At-Risk Women program, which provides women with specialized supports and services to help increase their employability and income-earning potential.", "Speaker, these are just a few examples of what is contained in our action plan, but on its own, it isn’t enough. We know that we have more work to do.", "In 2009, our government passed Bill 168, which updated the Occupational Health and Safety Act. Under the OHSA, employers must take all reasonable precautions to protect their employees from possible violence. Workplaces are now required to have violence policies, programs, measures and procedures to protect their employees from violence, including domestic violence. The OHSA is the only legislation of its kind in Canada to require employers to take precautions in any circumstance where domestic violence may occur in the workplace. The unfortunate truth is that, despite all of these safeguards, there are still incidents of violence in the workplace, which can take an incredible toll on survivors and their families. In addition to the trauma that can last a lifetime, there can be legal matters that need attention, interactions with law enforcement and appointments with support and care providers. The member for London West also referenced many of these in her very passionate remarks.", "Knowing that you can take the time off that you need from work to deal with this incredibly difficult range of issues, without fear of reprimand and retribution, can go a long way in easing the burden faced by victims of violence, particularly given everything on their plate that they are trying to cope with.", "In closing, I’d like to thank the member from London West for bringing forward this legislation and for initiating this conversation. As always, she is passionate in her delivery, purposeful in her intent, and well researched, Speaker. She was always someone at committee that we could count on to be very deliberate and really empathetic in her recommendations, and she was indeed that today.", "This legislation is an important topic. It’s an important conversation for us to have, because it helps to address an issue of tremendous importance to women and their families.", "I support this bill, Mr. Speaker, and I encourage all of my colleagues in this House to do the same." ],

We have heard a lot of great input and a lot of great comments, but I think that there’s a lot more that needs to be done in terms of just educating the public.", "But first, I just want to recap a little bit. This private member’s bill, put forward by one of our colleagues here, is basically to give leave, so that an employer would have to provide paid leave of up to 10 days to any employee who is a victim of domestic or sexual violence, not necessarily in the workplace—obviously, domestic violence is at home. But we are also very concerned here about the children, and I’m very glad that they added to this private member’s bill the fact that the employee would have leave if their child was the victim of any kind of domestic violence or sexual violence.", "I’m reminded of somebody named Julie—it’s Julie S. Lalonde, if you want to look for her on Twitter. She told an incredible story—I believe she was published in Maclean’s—about being harassed by an ex-boyfriend for 11 years, until she got a phone call that he was dead. I don’t recall if she ever said if he killed himself or was killed somehow, but he was a young man, and I don’t think he died necessarily of natural causes.", "She recounts the absolute horror. What bothers me the most about the whole story is that she hid it from many of her co-workers and neighbours as much as she could. That’s the part that really breaks my heart. It takes a village to raise a child. We all agree that communities come together and help with children. But communities need to come together and help adults as well, men as well as women. It’s very hard for people to help if the person themselves isn’t able to ask for help or isn’t able to share their story.", "There’s too much stigma against people who are victims of stalking, of domestic violence, of sexual harassment, of sexual violence. We have to teach kids from an early age. We don’t want to scare kids. We want to empower them to understand that there are people who we may initially love, and we may think they love us, but unfortunately, they don’t have our best interests at heart—and how to go about it: who to tell, who to ask, how to make yourself safe, and how to use the resources that are available.", "Yes, we are legislators, and, yes, we can maybe add this bill as the missing piece of Bill 132. Maybe we can legislate that employees can get time off. But what we really want to do is help these women, and we want to ensure that it doesn’t escalate to the point that they need the time off. We want to help them so that they can be safe, so they can have the quality of life that they deserve and so that their children should have a chance at a promising future.", "Let’s look at all the different pieces of this puzzle. Let’s put our heads together—there is support from all three parties—and let’s move forward." ],

Although it passed, in fact, it doesn’t have everything encompassing that we actually need to address sexual harassment and sexual violence in the workplace. Frankly, it basically took 15 or 16 years after Lori Dupont’s death to bring forward a bill that was somewhat comprehensive to address the issues.", "I remember acutely the fight between the Ontario Nurses’ Association and the Ministry of Labour about investigating Lori Dupont’s death. Bill 168 was a minimal attempt at putting some changes into the Occupational Health and Safety Act, but they were minimal. Then it took another seven or eight years after that for the government to bring forward some significant amendments that would require employers to do something about it.", "The last piece that I really want to talk about is that during the PTSD hearings, the member from Kitchener–Waterloo talked about poisoned work environments, the response from the medical officer of health in Toronto and about how workplaces get poisoned when you have these kinds of activities happening. When I was subbing in for the member from Parkdale–High Park the other day on that bill, the Ontario Nurses’ Association’s Erna Bujna was making a presentation. She talked about the nurse who was present during the death of Lori Dupont in Windsor, who has never returned to work and has suffered PTSD since that day.", "When we hear people talking about the cost to employers, I think that the actual cost for a week or two of leave to employers in workplaces across the province will be far less than having people never be able to return to work and the cost of those benefits through workers’ compensation. I think that there is a balance here in actually doing something and providing some leave." ],

I think we’re starting to see some themes develop here, particularly the process of the private member’s bill.", "I have two things that I want to particularly highlight in today’s discussion. The first one is the issue that someone raised about the 10 days of paid sick leave and the potential resistance that people might have to that. I think that it is more important to talk about the benefits of the time spent with those 10 days and what can be accomplished. If you want to look at it from that line of thinking only, obviously, someone who is able to gain benefits through the question of support in the broader community as well as the professional community is that much better off and a quicker way to be able to maintain their normal life. Obviously, having a job is part of that normalcy. So I think that the 10 days of paid sick leave should be looked at as an investment and a recognition that there is a responsibility by an employer and there is the benefit to the victim.", "The other thing that I think is important to suggest about this bill is that it should be sent to public hearings. The more opportunities that the author of this bill has to find places to broaden the public discussion, the better. The whole need for having this is because people have difficulty seeking help or being able to find it in many cases. So anything that helps promote and open up the conversation on this issue is time well spent. I think that would be a huge opportunity to broaden the base of support for this bill. I think that’s the most important thing that we can send as a message to the chamber as a whole, to the Legislature as a whole—to be able to demonstrate that we’ve opened up more opportunities for people to understand the importance of responding to this process." ],

The last thing a woman needs when she finally makes the decision to do something about her situation, and it’s a situation of domestic violence, is to lose her job. That’s really what we’re asking here. We’re asking that she not have to make that choice.", "The one piece I would say is that enforcement is critical. You’ve heard that 1% of employers are really complying with protocol as it now stands. Unless there is enforcement of a law, we know that law will be broken. Only 1% of employers ever get a visit from somebody from the Ministry of Labour. That has to change. That’s the larger picture.", "I have to say that right now, it’s a pretty sad scene for women experiencing violence. We’ve had a couple of very high-profile court cases where clearly women are under threat. Certainly, the Supreme Court has ruled very clearly that if you hit someone, i.e. in domestic violence, it doesn’t matter whether you go back, it doesn’t matter whether you say you love them, it doesn’t matter whether you keep living with them, it’s still assault. It’s assault, and yet somehow we see this played out in the court system: “No, no, no. She asked for it,” or “No, no, no. She kept going back.” We’ve also seen a high-profile Twitter court case where, again, it’s open season on women now in social media, because it’s okay to be verbally abusive to a woman on social media. That’s seen as “freedom” instead of hate speech, which is what it is. This is a violent atmosphere in which women have to live and work.", "This bill gives a woman simply one thing, and that’s time—simply some time to get some help; to get another place to live, which takes time; to get her children settled, if there are children involved, which takes time; changing schools takes time. All of that takes time. It’s the least we can do. It’s the very least we can do.", "Again, you heard there are jurisdictional examples. There are places that do it much better. So we don’t have to invent anything. We just have to put into place the supports that other jurisdictions already have for women and make sure that those supports are supported and make sure that they are enforced.", "I want to say, again, kudos to the member from London West. She has been a phenomenal advocate on this file, where women are concerned. Her voice is well known and it’s well heard. Those two things are very important in politics. So we thank her again for this.", "We call upon the House not just to pass it, but to make sure it gets to committee, to make sure it becomes law, because this will have an immediate effect on women’s lives. We cannot just give lip service to something this critical. We have to make it so." ],

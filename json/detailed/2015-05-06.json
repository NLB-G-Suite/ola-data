So, congratulations; I’m certainly pleased about that. I think we’re finding out that orange is the new black—just throwing it out there for everybody to discuss this morning.", "There are a ton of other examples where these P3 projects have cost the province far more than they have given us. Look at the local CCAC in the Niagara region. Instead of providing top-line health care themselves, they’re contracting in-home care to a private company called CarePartners. CarePartners’ CEO, Linda Knight, is okay to sit back and collect hundreds of thousands of dollars of taxpayers’ money while she refuses to pay nurses for their working hours or give them sick days. So, of course, the nurses, who are concerned about the level of care that their patients can receive under those conditions—which is really important on that issue—have unfortunately gone on strike.", "This government has a mandate to provide top-of-the-line medical care to its taxpaying citizens. Instead of trying to intervene and help, they’re unfortunately sitting on the sidelines while another privatization plan fails. Those nurses want to see their patients. I spoke with the patients, who are determined to get their nurses back. Yet still nothing is being done. I don’t think this would qualify as good public service.", "I want to say that I have talked to the health minister about this issue. I have raised it with him. That’s the way we should be doing it in here. I raised it: “Here’s what happens. Here’s what has happened in my home community.” I’ve talked to the member from St. Catharines as well. But I think it’s important to communicate that. It’s one thing to stand up here and throw darts; it’s another where you stand and say, “Listen, I’ve talked to you guys. This is what happened.”" ],

These are people who care about their community. They’re people who care deeply about their patients. Yet what we’re doing here is putting them on strike.", "What they decided to do with this company, very clearly, is that they decided to join a union; they’re trying to get their first collective agreement. I’ve been involved in the trade union movement for a long time. The decision for joining a union is usually because the employer is not treating their people with respect. It’s been 18 months.", "What happens, as everybody knows—we’ve been talking about this with the budget—is that you get this pot of money; you have so much money to go around. So, money goes to the LHINs, the LHINs take their money and give it to the CCAC, and they have that pot—the pie is getting divided up all the way along. What happen is that the CCAC gets their money, the CCAC then contracts it out to Linda Knight and here’s what happens: That pie is smaller. She’s taking her money off the top—she’s making her profit—but unfortunately none of that is going to the nurses.", "These nurses, if you can imagine, Mr. Speaker—I know you’re interested in this—are working as pieceworkers, getting paid so much for each house they go to; quite frankly, qualified nurses taking care of my parents, your parents, your grandparents. And at some point in time—I look around, and there are a lot of people in here with white hair—they’re going to be taking care of us. We shouldn’t be treating nurses like this. We certainly shouldn’t be treating patients like this.", "So if the other side can do anything—if my good friend Mr. Bradley can do something and say to the health minister, “Take a look at this. What’s going on in St. Catharines is wrong. It’s wrong how the nurses are being treated. It’s wrong how the patients are being treated. It’s wrong how the St. Catharines community is being treated.” And CarePartners goes right across the province of Ontario. We have to fix this situation. We have to treat our nurses better, and we certainly have to treat health care better.", "We were promised a new hospital in Niagara. It’s now looking like it will be about 10 years away. I’ve met with the NHS; I’ve met with the health providers. You can see, at the site where the planning grant was announced over a year ago—almost a year and three months—that the sign is starting to fade. It doesn’t look good at all.", "This hospital needs to be built to service the people in my riding, and it can be a lot cheaper than the one that was done in St. Catharines. We can have a debate on whether that’s where it should go, but there is no reason that we should be waiting. We have local workers who can get this project done now.", "The point I’m getting at here is that it’s a responsible approach that can help balance the budget by not wasting tax dollars. It seems too simple that it shouldn’t need to be said, but these P3 projects prove that it does need to be said. These are happening. Where, exactly, are our savings coming from in this budget?", "Let me tell you a few things that this so-called progressive budget has done in the province. While this government was using costly P3 projects, this budget was also being drafted to find other ways to bring in revenue. It began by using what they are calling asset optimization, which is essentially selling off the future of the province for the debts of tomorrow.", "One of the ways this so-called progressive budget brought in extra cash—I spoke a little bit about this yesterday—was by selling the province’s share in General Motors. Think about that. The federal government did the same thing—the federal government to balance their budget; the provincial government because they needed the money.", "As many of you know, the province and the federal government negotiated a manufacturing footprint in 2009. As the car companies were being shocked by failures in the industry, the government came to the plate to make sure they didn’t collapse. It wasn’t a direct giveaway. Stipulations were in place to ensure that thousands of jobs were saved, that jobs were saved right here in Ontario that benefited the people, and collective bargaining was protected.", "It also gave the government—this is important; I think both parties should listen to this—a seat at the table, a big seat at that table. I know this because I was there in 2009 when the negotiations were happening. I can remember who supported those auto jobs here in Ontario and who wanted to see those companies fold and leave this country. I can tell you, it gave this province a big say over the future of the automotive industry here in Ontario.", "With the footprint agreement coming to an end in 2016, auto manufacturers are looking to see what we can do to remain competitive and keep the jobs here. Well, that makes sense. When you have shares in a company and you have a seat at the table—and that’s important, particularly at the bargaining table. With a seat at the GM table, we could, and we should, be a strong voice for the thousands of auto jobs in the province and the tens of thousands of spinoff jobs that rely on the auto industry in the province of Ontario.", "Someone looking into this budget must be looking for the government to play a strong role in protecting the auto jobs here in Ontario—well, unfortunately, they won’t find anything like that in the budget, and I think it’s a mistake—instead of this government selling off their shares of GM in a one-time deal that removes a large part of their influence in the industry. We made some money off the deal, but the long-term effects are devastating.", "Look at Oshawa, where they announced just last week that they’re going to lose 1,000 auto jobs. A thousand jobs doesn’t sound like much, until you talk to everybody who understands how the auto industry works. In particular, in Oshawa, we have all the spinoff jobs. You can argue whether it’s 7,000 spinoff jobs; you can argue whether it’s 10,000. But you’re not talking 1,000 jobs now; you’re talking somewhere between 7,000 and 10,000 jobs.", "I know my good friend over there, the economic development minister, is keenly listening to this conversation, because it’s important for his job as well.", "Does anyone believe—and I’m asking my colleagues this—it was coincidental that these job losses follow the sell-off of the GM shares from the federal and provincial government? Was the one-time payout worth losing what those 1,000 workers—and with the 7,000 to 10,000 spinoff jobs. So we’re looking at between 7,000 and 11,000 jobs that you’re going to lose in taxes. Is it worth it for a one-time hit when you could have a say at the table? One thousand people with decent jobs and fair wages now have to worry about their work.", "This was an incredibly short-sighted opinion, and one this government should not be proud of. Perhaps it helps to manage the deficit for one year, this year, but what does it do for the future of the province? Because we’re talking about a sector that is extremely important to the province of Ontario, and there are other sectors in the province of Ontario that are equally important, whether it be tourism—it doesn’t matter what it is; there are other sectors. But this auto is what we’ve really been based on in manufacturing.", "I know my good friend the Speaker is listening to this, because he comes from steel. They’ve been going through the same type of stuff that’s been going on in the province.", "I believe many people will remember this budget as one that sold off the public hydro assets, if something isn’t done right now to reverse that decision. Just look at the sale of the GM shares, the sell-off of our hydro assets in Ontario—a short-term solution that hurts us in the long term, that selling 60% of Hydro One will amount to 3%. Now think about that: 3% of this government’s planned infrastructure projects—3%. We’ll be losing a payout of hundreds of millions of dollars every year because of this.", "It may have helped to remove part of the deficit this year, but in years to come, the province and its residents will not have that continuing revenue stream to spend on their communities. Simply put, it’s a sale of the future of this province.", "Where did that hydro money go? I know everybody’s listening. Where did it go? I think we all should be proud of that. Where did it go? We’ve owned it for my entire life. People who are older than me have owned it longer. Where did it go? It went for health care, our publicly funded health care, which is admired around the world, by the way, and gives us a competitive advantage right here in the province of Ontario.", "One of the reasons why we had a successful auto industry and steel industry was because of our health care costs, because it was publicly funded and publicly delivered. We’re making a mistake on moving into the privatization of it, and that’s a big concern. But at the end of the day, it was publicly funded, publicly delivered, and it came from the revenues from Hydro One.", "What else did it fund, Hydro One? Our education sector, one of the best in the world. We’re going through some tough times right now with strikes, but at the end—" ],

I have a large group of retirees. I met with the retired management group and the retired folks from Unifor. One of the things they told me—it’s interesting enough: The competition between Canada and the United States has really pitted the United Auto Workers in the States against Unifor workers and General Motors here in Canada. I’ll spend a moment to talk about this because both sides have told me about this.", "After the bailout in the United States and Canada, the UAW decided to renegotiate a whole series of collective agreements for their folks at work in Michigan and other states where General Motors operates. The UAW put into place a set of collective agreements and a framework which is radically different than what Unifor has here in Canada. The minister who has been working with General Motors said that General Motors in Oshawa have said that in terms of a new product coming there—we all hope it happens—in effect, it’s going to be predicated on the next round of negotiations with Unifor. That’s what they’ve said publicly. We want to make sure that they happen in a positive way.", "There’s no question that the North American Free Trade Agreement has changed the whole footprint of the auto sector here in Ontario. We’re all concerned about it. We all want to work together. We want to bring those good ideas to the table to make sure that we retain the auto sector right here in the province of Ontario, and I want to make sure that we work together on this important file." ],

They have to; I guess that’s part of the role. The economic plan for this province has been altered, negatively, so badly. We look at the payroll taxes. The car companies are telling—everyone who leaves is saying, “Get your energy under control.” It’s hard when you still hear this government talking about us being actually very favourable on the cost of energy.", "To me, you have to stand up and tell the people what’s actually happening. We see a province that’s no longer competitive. Instead of looking at ourselves and looking at our payroll taxes or energy costs and the property taxes that are really a result of this government’s policies—I would hope, listening to the member here talk about the labour negotiations, that they would actually take that as part of their strategy: to talk about what it would take to make our companies competitive.

Part of that is our Jobs and Prosperity Fund, which enables us to attract and provide incentives.", "Another one is maintaining a very dynamic and competitive business climate. We have one of the lowest corporate income taxes and small business taxes anywhere in the world, for that matter, on average. Certainly, we’re ahead in North America.", "But I find it passing strange that the NDP suddenly are talking about providing loopholes and incentives for business, like the film industry—which, by the way, Ontario continues to be one of the most generous in the world. So you either want us to provide stimulus for those investments and for those businesses or you do not. On the one hand you’re saying, “Cut away with loopholes. Stop providing any supports for businesses.” But when it comes to supporting the auto industry, suddenly, “Yes, that was a good thing to do,” or when we’re supporting the film industry, “Yes, that’s a good thing today.”", "But you can’t have it both ways. Either you are onside, and you recognize the importance of maintaining a very competitive and dynamic business climate to attract investment or you don’t. Oftentimes, the questions are about not supporting business, not supporting those that actually do create those jobs. That is the essence of what is in this budget—and we will continue to do so.

And I think there’s almost no better example of where we can show that than in how much the budget recognizes the needs and the economic opportunities in northern Ontario, and that’s reflected in a number of important ways.", "It’s hard not to start with the very, very important commitment we made related to the Northern Industrial Electricity Rate Program, a program that has been incredibly significant in terms of reducing energy costs for major resource development companies—mining, forestry, the seal sector—by up to 25%. To have a commitment to make that a permanent, ongoing fund of up to $120 million a year is absolutely huge.", "We know that industry obviously responded very strongly to it because industry, more than anything else, in terms of making decisions related to investment, certainly seeks certainty.

So thanks so much to the Minister of Finance; it has meant a great deal in terms of future opportunities in northern Ontario. That’s absolutely huge.", "Really good news related to our Moving Ontario Forward $31.5-billion budget figure, $15 billion of which will be going to build up our infrastructure outside the greater Toronto and Hamilton area—certainly we hear about the incredible needs in the greater Toronto and Hamilton area.

That has been reflected, obviously, in this particular budget, but it has been something that has been very, very important.", "I know that the Premier—I think it’s okay to say this—will be heading up to the Federation of Northern Ontario Municipalities annual general meeting to speak with them, as will many of our colleagues. We understand how important it is to be able to meet with them and be able to tell our story, and actually have an opportunity to listen to the concerns that are there. I suspect that some of my colleagues will be there as well.", "Premier Wynne has made it clear to all of us how northern Ontario really may indeed be the economic future. In that regard, it’s hard not to reference the Ring of Fire. In the mining sector in general, we’re darned excited about the fact that we’ve got new mines opening up every year in northern Ontario.", "We’ve got two of them opening up this year: Goldcorp’s Cochenour expansion—their mine is opening up and being commissioned this year, very soon—and Rubicon, the Phoenix Gold project up in Red Lake, as well. There are other projects that are coming close. We’re pretty excited about the Premier Gold/Centerra partnership in the Geraldton-Greenstone area.", "The commitment and recommitment, may I say, of $1 billion for infrastructure for the Ring of Fire is absolutely crucial. Again, it’s something we would love very much to see matched by the federal government. That’s a huge part of the long-term vision our government has for economic development.", "Before I sit down—and I suspect they’re going to be asking me to give my time up soon to my colleagues—I think it’s also important to point out that getting the Connecting Link Program back up and running has been crucial for municipal leaders in northern Ontario, as a reaction to the downloading that was done many years ago. There are a number—this is important—in Sault Ste. Marie. In fact, we were able to make the announcement. My colleague the Minister of Government and Consumer Services—the MPP for Sault Ste. Marie—and I were there with the Minister of Transportation to announce a $15-million program.", "I’m getting the sign to get off the stage. Thank you very much for the opportunity to speak. This is truly a good budget for northern Ontario and for all of Ontario." ],

Marie: “Our roads need work, our aqueducts need work. We’re all aware that our water infrastructure needs some work. The budget was good news in that sense.”", "The Thunder Bay Chamber of Commerce: “From a Thunder Bay perspective, of course, wherever there is transit investment, there is an opportunity for Bombardier to increase their timelines and their productions, which is a good thing for creating jobs here.”", "I rather like this one from the president of Unifor, Dominic Pasqualino: “I think it’s excellent news. It’s going to solve Toronto’s congestion problems and, if Bombardier gets some of the new contracts, it’s going to be a real boost for Thunder Bay’s economy.”", "The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce caught my interest: “The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce applauds the Ontario government for formalizing its commitment to a fully funded rapid transit project in Hamilton in the 2015 budget tabled today.”", "Let us hear what the mayor of Barrie says: “The government is doing better than forecast on containing costs, so the deficit is smaller than forecast, which is good.”", "The Kitchener-Waterloo chamber of commerce: “There are no increases in (business) taxes. That’s always a good thing.”", "The Canadian Environmental Law Association: “The Canadian Environmental Law Association welcomed confirmation of the recently announced Ontario Electricity Support Program in today’s provincial budget. This program will provide much needed relief to low-income families ... where too much of their family income is eaten up by energy costs.”", "Let’s have another look here at one from Sault College, an important post-secondary education centre: “There’s money in there for aboriginal learners, and 21% of my students at Sault College are aboriginal. That’s something I would applaud the government for doing. They also put in $13 million over two years for pre-apprenticeship programs, and Sault College is heavily involved in” this program for First Nations.", "What does industry say? Here’s a quote from Robert Hardt, president and CEO of Siemens Canada: “By bringing faculty, students and partner industries together under one roof, the Mechatronics Simulation and Demonstration Centre will capture the enormous synergies of applied learning, research and demonstrations.... A defining feature of this initiative is showcasing Ontario’s most promising examples ... in an exhibition-style space that both informs and inspires innovation....”", "What does the director of the Child Development Institute say? “I am delighted to learn about the $20-million expansion” of the Ontario youth action plan for at-risk youth.", "We’ve heard a lot from the practical nurses’ association and the important work that they do in our health care system. The association “supports a number of the health care initiatives put forward by the provincial government, including its continued funding for mental health and addiction services and additional support to improve the quality of palliative care....”", "What does the executive director of Drinks Ontario say? “We are pleased to see that there are changes ahead for the sale of beverage alcohol in Ontario, and that the government is interested in more meaningful discussion on how best to go about making that a reality.”", "For the members sitting opposite, what about Rob Keffer, the mayor of Bradford West Gwillimbury? “I shared previously the good news about provincial funding for refurbishing Back St. and Line 9, as well as the doubling of GO train service. Today’s budget had more good news: an additional $80 million for affordable housing, which I hope we can tap into to deliver on our critical need for seniors’ housing. The federal government also announced measures related to affordable housing....” I hope that this, together with the province, gets things rolling.", "I have another quote from Unifor for members of the third party. Katha Fortier: “Some of the measures in this budget will help secure a stronger future for Ontarians ... 60% of Ontario workers do not have a workplace pension plan. Given the failure of the Harper Conservatives to reform the CPP, the importance of the ORPP”—the Ontario pension plan—“cannot be understated....", "“Today’s budget included much-needed funding for transportation.”", "I could go on and on, but let me pick out one that I find particularly informative. Jamie Lim, the president and CEO of the Ontario Forest Industries Association: “We thank Premier Wynne and Minister Mauro for fulfilling their 2014 commitment ‎to ... provide $60 million in funding for critical resource access road infrastructure in northern and rural Ontario. This is great news because these resource access roads are the foundation of economic development in these regions.”", "Speaker, I could go on and on with endorsements about the strength and the quality and the high regard with which this budget has been received, but I think I’ve captured the point." ],

Both urban and rural communities will benefit from this budget.", "My riding of Barrie is extremely thrilled that they will have more frequent and consistent service for those constituents who must leave our area to go to their jobs. The additions to the GO train schedule will be a wonderful asset to those many, many people who travel back and forth from Barrie to Toronto or points south for their jobs.", "It will also be a wonderful way to bring people to Barrie. Barrie has a lot to offer, and this will make it a great place for young families to come and spend a Saturday afternoon or a Sunday afternoon. I can honestly tell you that my family and people I know are looking forward to being able to take the GO train down to Toronto, not have to worry about parking your car on the weekends, and going to a show or to a baseball game or to a Raptors game, and perhaps having a slight libation before you get back on the train to go back to Barrie. Those are things that are very exciting for our riding.", "Rural municipalities are also looking forward to this budget. They are eagerly waiting to apply for funds for badly needed roads and bridges. It’s very important to rural communities.", "Ontario is making the largest investment in infrastructure in the province’s history: more than $130 billion over 10 years, including dedicated funds for Moving Ontario Forward. Every dollar that we receive from broadening the ownership in Hydro One will be placed in the Trillium Trust, to be dedicated for roads, transit and bridges under the Moving Ontario Forward plan.", "As outlined in the 2014 budget that was passed last July—my first budget, and a wonderful experience, I might add—Moving Ontario Forward is investing in public transit, transportation and other priority infrastructure across Ontario.", "A wonderful side effect of all this infusion of money into transit and infrastructure is the creation of jobs. Good jobs mean people will be putting money into the economy. When you put money into the economy, the economy grows and Ontario prospers. When we’re investing, we’re building, and when we’re building, we’re growing.", "The government is committing to balancing the budget by 2017-18, and we’re on track to do that. The budget deficit for this year, 2015-16, is forecasted to be $8.5 billion, the lowest deficit forecast since the onset of the global recession. A balanced budget will sustain the programs and services Ontarians rely on over the long term.", "What I like about this budget, and why I ran for this party, is because there is a balanced approach. We’re not cutting a whole bunch of jobs. We are infusing money into the province, into the economy, as well as trying to reduce the budget. We’ve consistently delivered on our commitment to follow the path to balance and to do so in a way that is fiscally responsible and fair. Where there is opportunity and security for every Ontarian, the province will be the best place to live from childhood to retirement.", "I do know that I have lived in Barrie all my life—" ],

That’s a tax.", "We’re going to have a new carbon tax, which will raise the cost of energy to the average consumer or anybody who is buying energy, which is everybody.", "We don’t have enough money to look after CCACs and to provide care for our seniors, who need help badly. This budget does not provide that. In fact, we’re getting cuts. There are hospitals in my riding that are laying people off because this government does not have the money to give to them because they squandered it away on things like gas plant scandals etc. That list is very lengthy.", "Not to mention our hydro bills, which are going through the roof with the green energy plan—and of course they keep building more wind turbines. We’re going to have something like 1,900 of them along the north shore of Lake Superior—which is wonderful. Just imagine what the cost of that power line will be to get the power back to where the people are, in Toronto and southern Ontario.

If it’s too complex, sit down with them and have a chat so you can get the understanding about how we need to develop the Ring of Fire. Stop blaming Big Brother.

Everything is clinically determined as to how we might be able to fool the people on this one, confuse the people on that one, hornswoggle them on another couple of things, and the next thing you know, the people are walking around in some kind of a daze, wondering just what the fiscal condition of the province of Ontario is.", "You know why they do some of this stuff, Speaker? They try to deflect it—and I know that you’re sitting in the most non-partisan seat in this House at the time being, so I understand the dilemma that it puts you in sometimes. But you know as well as I do that one of the reasons they kind of throw out this conflicting information from time to time is to deflect the people away from the multitude of scandals that they’re hoping they forget or stop talking about.", "This government is setting all kinds of records. While it’s record deficits that they set in office—no government has ever had a deficit as high as this government, no government has ever added as much to the debt as this government and no government in the history of Ontario has been the subject of more police investigations. So they are record-breaking. They could probably have a section in the Guinness Book of World Records all by themselves. It could just be called Liberal Legacy of—I have to be careful what I say here—Liberal Legacy of Lies." ],

It never came about. But Sean Conway said—and I’ll paraphrase because I can’t quote him, because I don’t have it in front of me—something to the effect of, “You can’t sell Hydro One. It is the central nervous system of Ontario.” You know how the juice, the electricity, the power runs through all those wires all across this province, whether it’s transmission or distribution or whatever? He called that the central nervous system of Ontario. How could you sell it? He said that it’s wrong. Dalton McGuinty said, “You can’t do it, and you haven’t campaigned on it.”", "But what have we got here with the Liberals? They have a vague reference to “maximizing assets” and whatever, that was in that 2014 budget. It is as clear as mud.

In many ways, it holds our feet to the fire as a government to ensure that we’re thinking ahead when it comes to our infrastructure planning. It’s something we take a great deal of pride in as a government, that over the previous 10 years, we have invested significantly in infrastructure. We’ve invested thoughtfully as well to ensure that the investments we make in infrastructure are meeting our infrastructure needs and, at the same time, helping to build our economy and make us more competitive, meeting the needs of our municipalities, meeting the needs of our health care system, meeting the needs of our transportation system, meeting the needs of our education system—and core investments like water/wastewater.", "We’ve invested $100 billion over the last 10 years.

We got the advice of Ed Clark in terms of how to broaden our ownership of Hydro One and how to be able to get some additional revenues so that we can reinvest in public transit—an important bit of advice, good advice, with a good business case attached to that advice.", "At the same time, we as a government have had to have the courage to take that advice. There is a certain element of courage when it comes to making those challenging, tough and complex decisions.", "One thing people in Ontario are tired of is politicians who talk about investing in infrastructure, who talk about how important they think our roads and bridges or our transit systems are, but don’t at all pony up any ideas on how they would pay for it.", "I think what the people of this province need, demand and deserve are leaders who are willing to take the tough decisions, who are willing to not only talk about infrastructure but to make the investments, to find ways to find the dollars to make the investments and build those projects, because you can’t build the projects if you don’t have the dollars to invest.", "It would be helpful to all of us in this Legislature—" ],

In Ontario, Ontarians and our Ontario government have to invest three times the amount in our infrastructure. We’re doing it because it’s an important investment. We’re doing it because it’s really important to our future economy to ensure that we have modern infrastructure, that we can get people to and from their jobs and get people across our city, and so that our businesses can transport their goods across Ontario and transport their people across this province. We’re going to make those important investments.", "Another element of this bill that is really important, and something I’m really happy to see there, is the fact that this bill is committing us to finding ways to utilize our infrastructure projects to grow the number of apprentices in this province, to take advantage of those young people and give them opportunities. Part of the job is committing ourselves, as a Legislature and as a government, to doing that, and we’re going to do that.", "The other challenge is figuring out exactly the “how.” How exactly will we put this?

We need to find the money to make these investments.", "I’ll conclude by saying this: This government is investing more over the next 10 years than any government has ever invested, including the federal government, in any period, any decade, in the history of Canada. It’s something that we’re proud of. It’s something more than that. It’s something that’s crucial to us being able to maintain our competitiveness as an economy.", "I know that the members opposite like infrastructure investment. I encourage them to work with us and to support our efforts to make those tough decisions we have to make to actually fund and build those projects. Again, you can talk about it all you want, but if you’re not putting the money forward, if you’re not coming up with the revenue, if you’re not finding ways to fund those projects, then those are hollow commitments, and that’s all we’ve been hearing from the opposition, over the last number of years, when it comes to infrastructure.

It was one of the first to advocate in favour of community benefits in public procurement; that’s how they’re known. What that means, Mr. Speaker, is that public sector contracts would include targeted training for local residents where these infrastructure projects are taking place; for example, setting a percentage of the total labour.", "The minister also mentioned the Central Ontario Building Trades Hammer Heads Program, which is located in my riding of York South–Weston. I’m very proud of this skill- and employment-based program within construction that offers apprenticeship career opportunities in this under-resourced neighbourhood and many others in the city and beyond. This bill does increase the opportunity for apprenticeships and invests in people’s talents, and it really helps build our province.", "The proposed legislation not only has this key component, but others that are very important; for example, the requirement that the government and the broader public sector consider specified principles when making infrastructure decisions, and the fact that the Minister of Infrastructure tabled a long-term infrastructure plan in the Legislature covering at least 10 years, so that we can have a vision and not just build ad hoc, prioritizing the projects according to what is needed, according to the municipal plans. I’m sure that my colleagues who follow me will be speaking more in depth about all these principles.", "Lastly, the promotion of design excellence in public works would mean that if a project is over a certain size, architects and persons with demonstrable expertise and experience in design would have to be involved in these projects, whether they’re transportation projects or cultural projects.", "That’s why I am pleased to support this bill.

In section 3 of the proposed legislation, it clearly defines the principles of infrastructure. But there are five other components beside the principles part: long-term infrastructure, which my colleague talked about; project prioritization; promotion of designs; excellence in public work; and lastly—and I think my colleague from Timmins–James Bay talked about this—skills training and apprenticeship.", "This proposed legislation, if passed, will also be supported by the budget that was presented by the Minister of Finance recently.", "Very, very clearly, section 8 of the proposed legislation defines the word “apprentice” and the number of apprentices that will be hired under this proposed legislation. I’m not sure if the member from Timmins–James Bay actually read the budget book. But very, very clearly, page 30 of the budget says very specifically that since 2003, this government has put in—over $164.5 million just last year alone. It talks about that.", "The other piece here is that this bill that we are debating is being complemented by the budget bill. It is very, very clear that what the member from Timmins–James Bay is arguing about is not clear about the apprenticeship stuff. But this bill, if passed, will be complemented by the budget.", "In the budget book, it’s spelled out very clearly. It says that we will be investing an additional $13 million over two years for pre-apprenticeship programs; providing $19 million over three years to increase the per diem for apprenticeship classroom training; and investing an additional $23 million over two years in the Apprenticeship Enhancement Fund.", "I am pretty sure, if this legislation is passed, and, on top of it, if the budget is passed, I think we will have additional apprentices being hired across the province of Ontario.", "The other piece of the proposed legislation that I know the members opposite will be very keen to hear about and, as well, read in the proposed legislation: In section 3, dealing with principles, it talks about the transparency of infrastructure planning and investment.", "In section 3.7, it says, “Infrastructure planning and investment should be evidence based and transparent, and, subject to any restrictions or prohibitions under an act or otherwise by law on the collection, use or disclosure of information,”—very, very clearly, Mr. Speaker, the proposed legislation, if passed, will ensure further transparency but, more importantly, the evidence-based infrastructure planning.", "The other piece of the proposed legislation also talks about the types of personnel that are required in terms of doing infrastructure designs. In section 7 of the legislation, on page 7, it talks about the requirement of architects’ and other professionals’ involvement in preparing the planning and construction of infrastructure projects. It defines who the architects are, under the Architects Act, and other professionals’ groups.", "I’m encouraging members of the House—I know they’re going to be very interested in debating the proposed bill.

This time, it’s a new pension tax. It’s a new carbon tax. It’s a new beer tax. It’s a further extension of the aviation fuel tax. It’s just tax, tax, tax. That’s what they want to do, Speaker.

You put people to work and you earn revenue. When people are working, that’s the best revenue that a government can have. Why they won’t go there, why they won’t talk about people being put to work, is because we have the highest energy rates in North America. We have the highest payroll taxes in Canada. We have crippling red tape. This is the area that the government needs to fix. Instead of jumping in and looking at the solutions to fix our energy, to fix our payroll taxes and to work on red tape, they would just ignore all that, ignore putting people to work, snap their fingers and raise taxes.

Until they are truly independent assessments, proving that these private partnerships offer viable and cost-effective models, the current evidence seems to suggest that they are a bad deal for Ontario.", "Some $8.2 billion were spent on P3s. The Auditor General said you should never have done it. And what comes out of that? Well, let’s see. You sell off Hydro because you’re trying to make that up. Higher costs for small businesses. Higher costs for medium businesses. Higher costs for companies like General Motors, who are looking to go elsewhere because of that.", "In my last 20 seconds, if you ask me where you’re going to get the money, let’s add this up: $8.2 billion on P3s that the Auditor General said you should never have done; $1 billion on a gas plant; $1 billion on eHealth; $1 billion on Ornge.

I’ll speak a little bit about whether this legislation can actually achieve that goal.", "On February 18, 2014, the then MPP for Newmarket–Aurora, Frank Klees, as our infrastructure critic, spoke at length on an identical government bill, Bill 141, for those of us who were here, which had been introduced in a previous Parliament. He spoke in favour of its principles.", "I’ll mention one issue with the bill, and that was section 7.1, as it contained a significant omission. While it detailed a specific role for architects, it was entirely silent on the specific role for professional engineers. I believe, like I would think many of us do, that most infrastructure jobs require the service of engineers. The Professional Engineers Act stipulates that any infrastructure project of 600 square metres or larger requires the services of a professional engineer. That was a startling omission, quite frankly, with regard to Bill 141.", "Our staff attended a ministry briefing on this bill on July 16 of last year. I was disappointed that we were given no slide deck to support the ministry’s presentation; only the bill and the compendium notes were provided. We asked for a copy of their presentation; they committed to sending it to us, and we are still waiting to receive it.", "In summary of the bill, it requires the minister to develop a long-term infrastructure plan which must set out a description of government-owned infrastructure assets, a description of anticipated infrastructure needs for at least the next 10 years and a strategy to meet those needs. Each plan must be made public.", "Once the bill comes into force, the government will have three years to table its first report. The plan must be 10 years in scope and must be tabled in the Legislature no later than five years after the day the previous report was tabled.", "The government must consider a list of criteria when prioritizing proposed projects for construction of infrastructure assets. Some of the specifics are: Infrastructure planning and investment should take a long-term view and should take into account the needs of all Ontarians.", "Infrastructure planning and investment should take into account any applicable budgets or fiscal plans.", "Infrastructure priorities should be clearly identified.", "Infrastructure planning and investment should ensure the continued provision of core public services.", "Infrastructure decisions should promote economic productivity, competitiveness, job creation and training opportunities.", "It’s all sounding good so far, with some amendments that we’ll provide, but the government must, as I mentioned earlier, require—the act actually says that the government must require that architects and persons with demonstrable skills in infrastructure design be involved in the construction design of infrastructure assets. Again, it leaves out the words “engineers” and “engineering”; it’s specific about architecture.", "Let me tell you why that’s very specific in here. As we talk about infrastructure, they like to talk about “infrastructure, roads” and “infrastructure, transit.” In reality, why they say “architects” here is because historically 60% of all infrastructure is bricks and mortar. It’s buildings: hospitals, schools. That’s infrastructure as well. When they talk about infrastructure, they want you to think immediately that it’s a subway or that it’s transit—all good things. But let’s be accurate here, Speaker. Why it says “architects” is because, despite all the rhetoric, “infrastructure” to this government means buildings—60% of it. Eleven per cent of infrastructure in Ontario is equipment, and 5% of infrastructure is IT. There’s about 4% that’s miscellaneous. That leaves 20% for roads, bridges and transit. That’s the reality.", "That’s why they said “architects” and not “engineers,” who would build roads, bridges and subways; it’s not all about transit, despite how they like to put that front and centre. Sadly it’s not all about transit.", "“The government must require that certain numbers of apprentices be employed or engaged in the construction or maintenance ... of infrastructure assets.” As you heard us responding earlier, Mr. Speaker, we just had a major cut in the budget of our apprentice program. Tax credits are being cut, not only for the film industry and the digital media industry, as you spoke of so well this morning in question period, Mr. Speaker, but also for the apprentice program. They rob from Peter to pay Paul. They do that all the time. It’s all they know how to do.", "The Lieutenant Governor in Council may add services covered under infrastructure or remove “physical structures or facilities from the definition.” Now we know what this whole thing is about. When it comes to the important issue of infrastructure in the province, Speaker, this is a policy that we can only pray, for a change, will be above politics. When committing to an infrastructure project, assuming that it has been planned and prioritized properly, once the decision has been made to invest in that infrastructure project, it should be beyond politics. You shouldn’t sit there with a map of the ridings in Ontario, and the colouring in them, and pick your infrastructure projects based on that, as we have so sadly seen in the past." ],

That’s what this government is about. When it comes to infrastructure, it’s all about secretly bailing out the MaRS building across the street from here—$300 million, $400 million, $500 million—and not telling us about it, leaving it to a whistle-blower to tell us about it four years later. That’s their concept of infrastructure. That’s what they think about infrastructure: pawns to move around, to be able to satisfy political requirements. That’s what needs to end in Ontario.", "I want to speak to the need for long-term planning for infrastructure—true long-term planning. The government has made reference to the importance of having an inventory of infrastructure assets in this province. I completely agree. In fact, they’ve made reference to the fact that infrastructure planning and investment should take into account, of course, applicable budgets or fiscal plans. Speaker, on paper, it sounds great. What does this mean?", "I was at an OPG luncheon today, and our table had some regional mayors. We talked about this exact issue. Somebody else in the Legislature has talked about it as well in the last hour. If your municipality is in great fiscal shape, great financial shape because you worked so hard as a mayor and as a council to keep that budget aligned, then you are punished under this program, by the way.", "I live in Corbeil, down the street from where the Dionne quints lived—just across the street from there, as a matter of fact. Billy Vrebosch has been our mayor in Corbeil for more than 30 years. While I was mayor of North Bay, he was mayor of Corbeil, where I lived. I can tell you, he treated every nickel as if it was his own. He squeezed every penny. I admired that in Billy; I still do.", "They have no debt. It’s pay as you go. I drive down the streets. My garbage is picked up. The plowing is done. He scrimped every penny to make sure that we were in good fiscal shape. Because Corbeil is in such good shape, they’re not entitled to this kind of money. He showed me the letter, and other mayors at lunch today talked about the letters that they received. The letter basically says, “Your finances are in great shape. You don’t need our money. Because your finances are in such great shape, you have the capacity to borrow, so we’re not giving you money. You can go and borrow it. The guy next to you—well, they’re not in great shape. They’ve deteriorated their finances. They can’t borrow, so we need to help them.”", "As we’ve said so often, Speaker, it picks winners and losers. In fact, it makes winners and losers, so I guess, in a sense, it mirrors this government. They like to borrow to pay for everything. It’s not pay as you go; they use the credit card to buy things instead of their debit card. When a family is in trouble, when somebody loses a job, you cut back. Not these guys. They get the credit card oiled up, and out they go on a spending spree—$2.4 billion more last year than the year before. That’s what these guys want to do. That’s their way.", "They’ve said to all these municipalities, “Look, follow our bad habits. Your finances are so good, you don’t need our money. You can afford to go and borrow. Do what we do. Go and borrow, and charge all the interest to your constituents.” That’s what they want to do. That’s what this program does.", "I want to also talk about the issue of inventory of assets. I think everybody would agree that it’s hard to make an intelligent and responsible decision about which infrastructure project should be prioritized if we don’t know the existing infrastructure inventory and the state of repair or disrepair.", "There’s no better example in this Legislature than the state of repair or disrepair of Ontario Northland. I remember when the passenger train was still running. As an MPP, I would enjoy taking the train to Toronto; 1 o’clock or 1:05, I think, was the time of the train. It was a beautiful train ride down here. You could use your laptop; there was a sandwich car; the whole thing. I remember taking the train from North Bay up to—I had to go to Cochrane, so I took the train. The engineer was a buddy of mine from school.

You don’t know what you’re talking about. You don’t know how to dig into the books.” They did not know, the government here, according to the Auditor General, that the rail workers had 14-year severances and that would account for a considerable amount of money. The government did not know that the Ontera workers had six-year severances.", "When you don’t know anything about the asset that you own, a crown agency—in this case, Ontario Northland—how can you proceed with infrastructure? They made terrible mistakes. Of course, I called the Auditor General in when we found one of the secret documents—again, back to that treasure trove we got from the gas plant scandal inquiry—that said, “Oh, by the way, we made a mistake.” This is from minister to minister. “We made a mistake. We just realized we’ve got these severances,” after you’ve announced $265 million in savings. “It’s going to cost us $790 million to let this company go.” We called the auditor in. It was a bombshell. It wasn’t $790 million; it was $820 million. That’s because they don’t know the asset inventory. They didn’t understand that. They didn’t understand the infrastructure. The easiest thing for them to do, of course, was to just shut down the railway, which is why we can’t take the train from North Bay to Timmins anymore or North Bay to Toronto.", "But this isn’t the only infrastructure bungle this government is guilty of. I’m not sure if Bill 6 will address it or not, but it’s the colossal delays with respect to the Ring of Fire. As I’ve said many times here, I’ve been to the Ring of Fire four times, and I’m so discouraged. You want an infrastructure program in Ontario that will put people to work and identify to the minister where we are going to get the revenue? You’re going to get the revenue from the jobs. There’s no greater revenue in Ontario than revenue from somebody having a job. We don’t need to have a carbon tax and we don’t need to have the pension tax and a beer tax and the aviation fuel tax. All we need is people to have a job. Sometimes you’ve got to spend a buck to make a buck. As a lifelong entrepreneur, I can tell you that you do have to do that.", "It’s so saddening to go up to the Ring of Fire, where, in 2011, the first time I was there, there were 250 men and women working. They were drilling exploration holes. It was fascinating to see. There were all these camps and all the equipment that was there. It was so exciting. My last trip, in 2014, was the most disappointing, because it was the day Cliffs was physically packing the camp and moving away. Since then, they’ve sold the camp to Noront, and since then they’ve sold the entire stake to Noront. They’ve moved out of Ontario. They’re gone, like Kellogg’s and Heinz and Caterpillar and General Mills and Wrigley. Well, add Cliffs. They’re gone because we didn’t commit to the infrastructure.", "They can talk about it all they want. I’ve been there four times. They have not spent one penny. That’s the depressing news in all of this, those jobs—not just northern Ontario jobs, the engineering firms that are here in Toronto, Ottawa, London, all through Ontario. There are firms everywhere producing drill rods, drill bits, steel, cable, food—you’ve got to feed all these people up there. All of those jobs—the 250, the exploration guys and gals, they’re all gone. The camp is just running on life support, just enough to keep the water flowing. That’s infrastructure.

First of all, on the question of the Ontario Northland, I’ve always believed it was part of the government’s strategy to underfund the Ontario Northland and to allow the infrastructure to weaken itself so that the riders wouldn’t continue using the service, so that you could make the argument to get rid of it. That’s essentially what they did.", "If we were to take that approach with GO Transit—and I argue that we should never take that approach—the same types of things would happen to the GO services that we currently have. People would find what we found in northeastern Ontario: that there was a very needed service that was being neglected.", "As a result, yes, there was less ridership, but if we would have made the investments that we had to on trackage, if we would make made the investments that we had to on new equipment, we could have actually sped up the train service from, I would argue, Cochrane down to Toronto—because the Polar Bear Express is north. We would have been able to speed up the time of that train, where more people would have taken it. We could have looked at options, such as having a night train versus a day train. There are a number of things that we could have done that would have increased the ridership on that line.", "The government did everything they could to basically frustrate people’s usage of that train. This from a government that says, “We believe in transit. We need to make investments in transit.” Where were you for northerners when you had a chance to stand up and invest in inter-city rail between our communities? You disappointed everybody by doing what you did for a number of years in order to not support that particular service, and then your argument was to privatize it.", "As the member points out, it turned out to be a real bad deal. Well, that doesn’t bode well for your Hydro deal, which you’re now trying to make, which essentially is going to be a fiasco when it comes to who makes money and who has to pay the bill at the end. It’s going to be us, the consumers and the businesses of this province, who will see our hydro bills go up yet again." ],

They did want to kill the Ontario Northland train, and that did happen. So there’s no train anymore. I will never forget one of the members across the aisle saying, “Well, let them drive.” You know what? Northerners have to drive a lot. They don’t have the sort of public transit infrastructure that some of us enjoy in urban centres, but they also have to deal with the road maintenance issues that the Auditor General recently raised—a huge concern.", "The fact that this government tried to save $36 million by contracting out road maintenance to private industry when those companies didn’t even have the equipment to do the work is quite something. It comes back to oversight—it actually always does—and it also comes back to accepting responsibility. So those 200 legal cases based on subpar road maintenance issues—some of them were deadly—have been brought to the courts. Obviously there’s a lot of trauma involved in that, and there’s no savings there; so, again, short-sighted. Perhaps, if I was feeling relatively generous, I might point out that they would have to bring forward a piece of legislation that basically mandates some level of common sense on infrastructure planning.", "I want to address the jobs and prosperity component of this legislation, though. It’s hard for me not to think of some of the short-sighted decisions that have been made, most recently in the 2015 budget. Yesterday and the day before, we’ve been talking with some of the stakeholders in this province who are very concerned around jobs, because obviously, as the former member mentioned, without jobs we will not have prosperity. In this budget, the side of the ledger that actually deals with revenue generation is, quite honestly, very weak around job creation and investment.", "FilmOntario is actually one of those stakeholders that was completely blindsided by this budget—by the tax credit cuts. You have to remember that this is an industry that really has been slowly rebuilding post-SARS. The industry will tell you that it takes around 10 years to recover from a major blow like what was delivered in the budget last week.", "Just to give you some sense of how unprecedented this is, Mr. Speaker, FilmOntario goes on to say, “While we understand the government’s responsibility to meet fiscal objectives in a balanced fashion, the approach taken in the budget to implement proposed rate cuts to OPSTC and the OCASE tax credits, effective immediately, threatens to destabilize the entire film and TV business in Ontario.”", "How short-sighted can you get? Perhaps that’s why this piece of legislation is needed, but the problem is that this piece of legislation, which charges the government to plan ahead, if you will, would not have stopped this decision.", "FilmOntario goes on to say, “The immediate implementation means hundreds of lost jobs and business impacts now, as well as shrinking volumes due to reputational damage that could result in job losses in the thousands.” This province cannot afford to lose any more jobs.", "“It is distressing to think that the government would upend a billion-dollar industry over poorly planned deployment of changes in order to save the sum of $10 million this fiscal year.”", "In fact, they won’t even achieve the $10 million. That won’t happen. Really, this cut comes directly from the Treasury Board because, if the finance minister was looking at the economic impact of a policy shift as drastic as this, hopefully someone in finance would do the math and come to the conclusion that film and television alone, in 2013-14, brought in $1.8 billion in direct investment and over 31,000 direct FT jobs, not counting the spin-off industries and jobs. We haven’t even heard from the hotels and restaurants and the car rental agencies—all of those other sector partners that are going to see a drastic negative impact.", "For them to bring forward a piece of legislation like Bill 6, saying that the government needs a law to make sure that we make good decisions—that’s essentially what this piece of legislation does—for the most part, it is window dressing. When you think of this consistent short-sightedness around fiscal planning, in this case around the Treasury Board, where for a measly $10 million but likely under $10 million, you’re compromising a very successful industry, it’s shocking.", "“FilmOntario would, at the very least, ask that the government grandfather these tax credits so that the projects that are already on the ground”—already in Toronto; they’re in production. Even in my own community of Kitchener-Waterloo, there are animators who know that those tax credits sometimes are the tipping point to job creation and to holding investment here in Ontario. I can’t speak out enough about this issue.", "But it is indicative of the way that this government seems to operate. Last year, there were 6% cuts in every ministry except for five. This year, there are 5.5% cuts in every ministry except for four. These cuts are doubling down on austerity. You will never rebuild the economy by staying focused on austerity measures. It has never proven to be successful.", "FilmOntario goes on to say, “For a long time, Ontario has been regarded as open for business to investors in our industry, and the Ontario government has been incredibly supportive and key in helping to build Canadian success stories.” It was working. The tax credits were working, and they’re a very accountable way of supporting industries. They go on to say, “But implementing the rate changes immediately without grandfathering will overnight undo trust built up over years” and our reputation as one of the most predictable and stable jurisdictions for producing film and television in the world. And, Mr. Speaker, it is not just foreign productions that are being hurt. “So many are VFX and animation, domestic co-productions, co-ventures and small and medium-size Ontario producers who choose to use the OPSTC. Companies will divert their resources to other jurisdictions. They will lay off staff. In some cases, they will close.”", "Mr. Speaker, you can bring in a piece of legislation which essentially says, “Take a long-term view.” Well, clearly, nobody was taking a long-term view when they proposed a tax credit cut for these two lines in the budget. It also says that “decision-makers should take into account the needs of Ontarians by being mindful of ... demographic and economic trends in Ontario.” Anybody who steps outside of this House and talks to people in this province will realize that people are hurting, and they can’t find jobs. Precarious, contract, part-time work is the new reality for employment in the province of Ontario.", "By their own admission in this budget, they over-predicted last year that they would create 67,000 more jobs. Of course, those jobs were not realized. It’s right here in the budget, and yet you’re going to bring in a tax credit cut for under $10 million, which is going to undermine an economic boost for Toronto, for the GTA and for other communities that really are fostering this new creative industry.", "So what’s at stake? Ontario right now “is a centre for global film and television—in part because of its skilled labour, its production infrastructure, its post-production and VFX capacity,” and, quite honestly, “Ontario entrepreneurs who run the companies that make it all happen.” This has taken 10 years to rebuild.", "“Other jurisdictions around the world, when implementing changes to tax credits, have ‘grandfathered’ productions already committed to the jurisdiction prior to the announcement. It is a common sense tax policy to make sure productions don’t have the rug pulled out from underneath them.” They go on to say that they are at a complete loss as to how Ontario would think otherwise.", "“The damage is already being done to industry trust in Ontario as a place that can be relied upon when it comes to investing in productive capacity. The longer Ontario waits to grandfather the recent cuts, the worse it will get; the destabilization could last for years.”", "What’s really astounding is that FilmOntario was meeting with this government, was coming to the table and was making suggestions and trying to be part of the conversation about what role they could play. Of course, they never thought that the cut would be immediate, mid-production. Who does that? I tell you, it’s completely irresponsible and it’s going to have long-term impacts across Toronto and across Ontario unless the grandfathering is honoured.", "In the infrastructure piece of Bill 6, it goes on to say that the government should take a long-term view. Well, there are some communities that have no choice but to take a long-term view. If you think about us in Kitchener–Waterloo, we have been living this two-way, all-day GO process—" ],

There’s no legislation that I’ve ever seen thus far that can ensure that Liberals will keep their promises.", "Aside from the language about “we’re working on it,” I just want to point out that the minister of the day at the time went on to say that one of the things that—actually, there was a lot of doubt. I should be fair in this. When the promises were made on the platform in Kitchener about this two-way, all-day, every 15 minutes, electrified rail, and a bullet train—I’m not even going to talk about the bullet train, because I think we all know how to classify the bullet train promise.", "But at the time, the experts said—and this expert, actually, is Mr. Munro. He said, “The fact that they have not released the background paper on the grounds of commercial confidentiality, well wait a minute, you’re talking about spending $3 billion of public money and you’re not prepared to give us the report that you’re justifying this with? Can you say ‘gas plant’?”", "“One of the first things we want to do if we’re re-elected is get those studies out there,” said the Minister of Transportation at the time.", "I think the key part of the sentence is “re-elected,” because this was part of their election promise.", "But Munro questioned Murray’s assertion that the high-speed rail line could make money, because this is the big thing about transit infrastructure: It is very rarely self-sustaining; it usually is very heavily subsidized. But the value in infrastructure investment, like, perhaps, a two-way, all-day GO service every 15 minutes on an electrified rail, means it’s the connectivity which actually generates the investment because it creates one cluster to another cluster.", "The community of Kitchener–Waterloo has made such a compelling business case for this investment. They even commissioned their own study and they costed it out at $396 million.", "But the plan, as it stands right now, for the record, does not involve getting the 10,000 people from Toronto to Kitchener–Waterloo; it does not happen. So Google continues to bus these people, this talent, because they have investment in the people and they want to make sure those people are safe; they want to make sure those people can get to work. This government should care about those people getting to work because those people pay taxes and they generate revenue for the province of Ontario.", "So here we are: We have an infrastructure plan for the province, the Infrastructure for Jobs and Prosperity Act, which asks us to take a long-term view. Again, many communities—my own community; Cambridge, obviously, would be another community—are waiting for GO service as well and they’ve made a very compelling case. And Niagara has made a very compelling case for their ridership.", "The longer you wait, though—and this is the key piece. The longer you wait, you lose the ridership. People are like me and they’re getting on the 401 at 4:15 in the morning, and that’s late. The intensity on the 401 in the morning coming into Toronto is pretty profound. So we have some serious concerns, obviously, about that.", "And actually, yesterday, it was interesting: The CEO of BlackBerry—his name is John Chen—talked about talent retention and how the connectivity piece is so key, because we invest in our youth. They acquire these wonderful skills to work, perhaps, in the film industry, although I’ve just outlined why I have some serious concerns about that, and they go elsewhere. They go down to Silicon Valley because they want the jobs. So we invest in them and then we drop the ball because we can’t somehow figure out how to actually follow through on a long-standing promise of two-way, all-day GO service back and forth to Toronto.", "I did think it was really important—the economic development minister referenced the Ed Clark report. Nowhere in Bill 6 would you—this new way of making decisions here at Queen’s Park, of contracting out opinions that you need to justify moving ahead with the sale of a strategic public asset like Hydro One, this legislation wouldn’t do anything to prevent that, especially a pro bono offer of help, which actually cost the people of this province $7 million.", "We, of course, support the long-term view, and that decision-makers should take into account the needs of Ontarians by being mindful of demographic and economic trends in Ontario. We’re really hopeful that this government recognizes that cutting the tax credits for the Ontario film industry and digital media is a negative return, for instance, and the apprenticeships program in the budget—it’s a $55-million reduction in the tax credit for apprenticeships. It’s right here in the budget. That’s going to hurt youth employment, because without those partnerships with the private sector, which we have always been supportive of, especially when it’s a training opportunity for youth, that slams the door in their face.", "I think we can all agree that Ontario has the highest youth unemployment in the country.

I understand: When you stand shoulder to shoulder with our Prime Minister, who has literally eradicated the work of the census and all the great statistical work that has occurred in Canada since Confederation practically, I know it’s hard to accept that, in fact, we’ve used Statistics Canada data to decide how we’re going to make these investments.", "The other day, when I spoke with respect to the budget and I talked about infrastructure as it relates to the budget, I didn’t have the opportunity to discuss the importance of making sure that you really do have an infrastructure plan generally in the province, but also as it relates to my own community.", "I ran out of time the other day, and I want to spend what’s left of my time to talk about the infrastructure investments that are at the very heart of not only Bill 6 but our government’s plan to move the province forward and to improve quality of life for people and to build up the economy and to give all of us a more prosperous future, and what that means for the people who live in York region, and specifically for people in my community.", "Since 2012, people in this Legislature will know that I have been a strong champion for making sure that three crucial infrastructure investments continue to flow into York region to specifically benefit my community. One of them is the Highway 427 extension. That is an extension of roughly seven kilometres, which will take Highway 427 from where it currently ends, around Highway 7 in the western part of my community, and extend it northbound, again, by about seven kilometres, up to Major Mackenzie Drive.", "The really fascinating thing for me now is that as the Minister of Transportation as well as the MPP for Vaughan, I’m extremely proud that it’s me and my ministry and the rest of the folks on this side of the House who have direct responsibility for making sure that we deliver that project, and we surely will.", "The other project that’s really important, of course, is the combined public transit investments. There are actually three I want to highlight that benefit Vaughan and benefit all of York and, frankly, in some cases benefit wonderful communities like Barrie as well.

That’s something that is extremely important for people in my community, a high-growth community if there ever was one. In addition to that: the Liberal provincial government’s $1.4-billion investment in York region’s Viva BRT system.", "When I think about our infrastructure plan and I think about this budget and I think about Bill 6 and I think about the ambitious plan our Premier and our government have, I actually think of my seven-year-old daughter. This is the context that I put it in. I live somewhere in the neighbourhood of Islington and Highway 7. My seven-year-old daughter, in 10 years, when she’s 17, when she has completed high school and she’s contemplating what her future might look like and she wants to connect to other parts of this region or, frankly, even other parts of this province, will have the opportunity, because of our $1.4-billion investment in Viva BRT, to spend a little bit of time leaving our home, walking down to Highway 7—because we only live about a kilometre north of Highway 7—getting on a dedicated bus running along Highway 7 taking her over to the Toronto-York Spadina subway extension, which is another project this government has roughly $870 million invested in.", "It is all about connectivity. It is all about building an integrated transit network here in the greater Toronto and Hamilton area, and it’s also about making sure, whether it’s by virtue of the investments that we are making in highways in the north, re-establishing a stand-alone Connecting Link fund, as we have done, investing in natural gas, investing in all other forms—bridges, roads etc.—" ],

I wanted to congratulate him for all the great work that he is doing to build modern infrastructure, which is part of our government’s plan to continue growing the economy and create jobs. That is why we are investing over $130 billion in public infrastructure over the next 10 years.", "Investing in infrastructure makes perfect economic sense. In fact, an April 2013 report from the Conference Board of Canada found that each dollar invested in public infrastructure in Ontario raises gross domestic product by $1.14 in the near term. In addition, our own studies show that the returns on this dollar grow to $3.10 in the long term, while supporting jobs and facilitating private investment.", "Moreover, our $130-billion investment builds much-needed infrastructure in every corner of the province and will be supporting over 110,000 jobs annually. If passed and proclaimed, this bill would require our government and future governments to regularly prepare long-term infrastructure plans. This will ensure that all governments recognize the importance of long-term planning.", "The Infrastructure for Jobs and Prosperity Act is part of our plan to continue building a well-educated and highly skilled workforce. The proposed legislation would increase the opportunities for apprenticeships for a wide variety of trades. This bill represents our government’s priorities of building Ontario up by investing in people’s talents and skills, building new public infrastructure and creating a dynamic business climate.", "Mr. Speaker, I want to spend a bit of time now discussing the important topic of gridlock and the importance of investment to the GTHA’s infrastructure.", "The need for infrastructure investment is nowhere more evident than in the GTHA. Investing in infrastructure in the GTHA is an absolute priority and necessity for our province to succeed. Gridlock is choking our growth potential. The average daily commute time for residents in Ontario is nearly 66 minutes, and gridlock costs our economy up to $11 billion per year in the GTHA alone. Our government is investing significantly to address gridlock, and I’m happy that constituents of my riding of Davenport are direct beneficiaries of these investments.", "The Union Pearson Express, which begins service on June 6, represents a component to our government’s commitment to expanding infrastructure in Toronto. This dedicated rail link will finally connect Canada’s two busiest transportation hubs, Union Station and Toronto Pearson International Airport. By 2020, Metrolinx expects the UP Express to attract approximately 2.5 million riders annually.", "The Eglinton Crosstown LRT, which has two stations in Davenport, at Eglinton and Caledonia, and at Eglinton and Dufferin, is another example of our government building Ontario up. This project, expected to be completed by 2020, represents the largest transit expansion in Toronto’s history. In fact, on April 17 the tunnel boring machines tunneling from Black Creek reached their destination point at the Allen Road. Hundreds of people watched as, late at night, the tunnel boring machines were lifted and transported to the east side of the Allen.", "I’m happy that the 2015 Ontario budget continues the great work to increase transportation options for Ontarians, specifically my constituents of Davenport.", "One particular plan which will benefit Davenport residents is our government’s regional express rail plan, the RER plan. It will completely transform public transportation in Toronto by electrifying all GO corridors and running trains all day, two ways, up to every 15 minutes. RER will deliver electrified service at about 15-minute frequency across two GO lines which cross through Davenport: the Kitchener corridor, including the UP Express, and the Barrie corridor. This network will also be the foundation for the SmartTrack proposal in the city of Toronto.", "I’m happy that our government is doing important work to improve long-term infrastructure planning. Bill 6 was introduced in July 2014, and it outlines a series of mechanisms to encourage principled, evidence-based and strategic long-term infrastructure planning. In addition, it includes measures intended to support job creation and training opportunities, economic growth and protection of the environment.", "The key components of this legislation are as follows: The bill requires that the government and the broader public sector consider specific principles when making infrastructure decisions; for example, planning being done on a long-term basis and the need for alignment with demographic-economic trends. It also includes a requirement that the Minister of Infrastructure table a long-term infrastructure plan in the Legislature, covering at least 10 years. It would be required that a certain number of apprentices be involved in the construction of provincial infrastructure assets, as prescribed by regulation.", "I’m happy to have been given the opportunity to speak here this afternoon." ],

Why? Because Ontario’s new 10-year economic plan includes over $130 billion in public infrastructure investments. These are important vital investments that will affect Ontarians’ lives every day in so many different ways. What this will do is build our province up. It will essentially result in support of over 110,000 jobs annually and will build much-needed infrastructure in every corner of the province. This is also the largest investment in infrastructure in our province’s history, so we’ve got to get it right.", "If passed and proclaimed, the proposed legislation would build on past work and ensure that current and future governments regularly prepare long-term infrastructure plans and continue to improve how the province prioritizes and addresses infrastructure needs. What does this mean? What this means is that we will have a plan. We will have a plan when it comes to how those dollars are spent. We will have a plan when it comes to building our roads, building our bridges, building our hospitals, building our schools and building our transit. We have to look beyond one-off projects and we have to plan for the future.", "Let me talk a little bit about my own riding of Halton. One of the things that we are proposing here is that we will have a plan that takes into account 10 years of projections, demographics, how things are going to grow and how we are going to make sure that we deliver the support and foundations that the people in our province need. In Halton, for example, the fastest-growing area in the country, take 10 years, a 10-year snapshot in my riding. Over 10 years in my riding, the town of Milton went from 30,000 people to close to 100,000 people. What did this mean? Well, it meant we needed strong infrastructure. We needed schools built, we needed roads built, we needed public transportation and we needed hospitals. You cannot build those things without planning. They don’t happen overnight. It takes years to plan and build a hospital. It takes years to plan and build schools. You have to take into account where the growth is happening and where it makes sense for us to build these things.", "For example, when it comes to health the people in my riding are going to have access to three very state-of-the-art facilities: a major hospital now being built in Oakville; also, an extension, an expansion in Milton; and the same thing happening at Joseph Brant, in Burlington. These three pieces need to work together to fulfill the needs of the people in my riding, and so planning is extremely important.", "This bill ensures that we will have a plan, that we will have a vision and that we will have done our homework when it comes to spending taxpayers’ money. That’s what they want. They want the homework done. This is the right thing to do when it comes to our roads, bridges and infrastructure, and the right thing to do for our children and our future." ],

On that basis, I guess we do need to have what would seem like an unnecessary piece of legislation, because of our government.", "We have a $130-billion plan for 10 years to build infrastructure—mainly highways, subways and things of that nature—and yet we’re just missing the $130 billion. Really, what we need isn’t a plan on how we’re going to do things and create jobs and tender and all that good stuff, we need a financial plan as to where the money’s going to come from.

It’s a good idea, except they’re doing it in the wrong way. They’re going to sell off 60% of it after they give shares to unions for the next 12 and 15 years, which means even less money for the public to realize.

When we were first elected in 2003, and I’ve mentioned this before in the House, we actually identified three deficits in the province of Ontario when we came into government.", "We identified a services deficit. We’ve done a fair bit to address that, I would say, by hiring 5,600 more doctors, 24,000 more nurses, opening up nurse practitioner clinics, and vastly reducing the number of people who no longer have access to a primary care provider in the province of Ontario.", "We also identified a financial deficit. You’ll remember—we hear the Conservatives talk often about what wonderful stewards they are of the finances of the province. When we came in in 2003, during very robust economic times in Ontario, primarily on the back of a very robust economy in the US and a 63-cent dollar or a 70-cent dollar, they still left with us a $8.5-billion financial deficit that was really an $8.5-billion structural deficit because they’d just sold the 407 for $3 billion.", "So they really left with us with an $8.5-billion structural deficit when the economy of the province of Ontario was red hot. No recession going on, but the financial stewards across the way still found the capacity to leave the people of the province of Ontario with an $8.5-billion financial deficit. If you’re not sure about that, just go back and check the Toronto Star headline in 2003. Toronto Star headline—very bold, very clear.", "But the point is, we have massively been investing in infrastructure—the third deficit that we identified in 2003—massively investing. This bill is not the beginning of it; this is the continuation of it. Since 2003, we’ve been making massive investments. My community and home riding of Thunder Bay–Atikokan has been a huge beneficiary of investments in roads, bridges and mass transit infrastructure. Just see the 1,200 more people who are working at the Bombardier plant in Thunder Bay today who weren’t there in 2003." ],

I remember our local member said, “We’re so busy handing out cheques we’re going to have to let it go into April because we just can’t do it, but you know that money is going to count for last year’s budget.” Wasn’t that big of them? They did that. Plus, I don’t know what they spent between October and the last week of March, but it’s probably a lot more than $3 billion. That was all about this message they have about inheriting a deficit. That’s how transparency started under this government. It was just a plan where they would tell the people one thing, promise another, do something else and then blame somebody else.", "The Globe and Mail probably has a little bit more credibility than some of the papers they quote. They talked about how the Ernie Eves government actually had a balanced budget but the trickery of this government made them put it on the books by taking another credit from the federal government a year later. That’s not the norm, the way the accounting works in this province. That’s just typical.", "We’ve heard promise after promise. We heard a Premier who came in—a candidate who signed something saying, “I will never raise taxes.” The first thing they did was the health tax. In the next election: “I will not raise taxes.” Then the GST. We also heard, “No carbon tax.” The carbon tax is on the table.", "This is a record that should be shameful in this province. That’s not the way we’ve grown up. There’s integrity, but it’s lacking in some of these governments." ],

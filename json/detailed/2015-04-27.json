We had been through a recent battle, and I would say to my colleagues over there that it was a rather acrimonious time in the Legislature.", "In one of my early meetings was another type of creature called a Liberal lobbyist. I was wondering exactly what this would be. It happened to be a gentleman named Eric Cunningham, a former Liberal MPP from down my way. We shared some of the same territory in my riding of Niagara West–Glanbrook and his in Hamilton-Wentworth. I didn’t know exactly what I was in for, but here he was, a gentleman, a consummate professional and a lot more soft-spoken in person than you’d see in the assembly. He got the game; he played it well. He gave me good advice.", "We had a few things in common, too, that were part of the conversation. He was a graduate of the University of Western Ontario, as am I.

But he got his point across. He knew how to do that. He understood the bounds that we lived within, as the PC government at the time, and he was highly effective in the work he did, because he was a professional. He cared deeply about the issues, particularly around the environment. I had a lot of respect for him. I can only imagine how much he’s missed by my colleagues who knew him across the floor, let alone his family here today.", "He came from that era before the cameras, so when the cameras were on, he was one fiery member of the Legislative Assembly. I think he thought that fighting Irishman from Notre Dame—he thought he was a little soft in his public portrayal. He stood up for his issues and fought for what he believed in, with passion.", "I think he showed an incredible affection and belief in the philosophy of the Liberal Party when, after winning three straight elections, he decided to step aside from the provincial assembly to run for John Turner at the national level. That takes some doing. That takes some guts. I can tell what kind of impact he had with the federal Liberals to see the Prime Minister taking the time to be with us here today.", "When he was in the assembly, he was a deep red. But the other part of his colours—he had a strong, strong streak of green. He always championed environmental initiatives. He was the environmental critic for a while. Clean water, clean air, parks, recreation areas—we owe a lot in the Hamilton area to what Eric Cunningham championed at the time. Of course, as well, working in the water industry made a difference in where the province went in the time ahead. I know colleagues in his party and the NDP will reflect the same thing that I heard.", "His colleagues said he loved his constituents, and they loved him back. He engendered the respect of friends, colleagues and clients for his wisdom, his thoughtfulness and his integrity. He was a proud Canadian, and a loyal, faithful, dedicated member of the Liberal Party of Ontario and that of Canada. Some say he was the kind that would fight the unwinnable battles. He relished a good fight. But he had his share of victories, and sometimes it’s the fight that’s more important, at the end of the day, when you stand on principle. We thank him for it.", "Sometimes bad things can happen to good people. That’s a bitter irony of life. It’s not so much accepting that fact as what you do about it. The sad irony is that much of Eric’s later years after leaving the assembly were tied up in a legal battle, but he still fought for justice with his heart, with his family, and what he will leave behind. There’s some justice in that some that gave his family, sadly to say, a bit of a living hell—they’re now in jail. We stand in tribute to Eric Cunningham and what he stood for, his image and his legacy.", "He was a good man, an incredible and successful politician, with great achievements in life. We stand today—and I’m proud, as a member of the PC Party—in respect for a member who sat opposite but was with us in actually making a huge difference for his community, for his environment and building bridges across the party." ],

At first glance, that may seem to be kind of tragic or unfair. But in many ways, this chapter of his life captures the essence of who Eric Cunningham was and why he was loved and respected by so many.", "In fact, the qualities that served Eric well in that fight—his tenacity, sharp mind and his willingness to stand up for his convictions and fight for what he believed to be right, even in the face of daunting odds—were the tools he brought to the job as MPP and his many years of public service after resigning from Queen’s Park.", "I didn’t have the privilege of knowing Eric Cunningham, but in reading up on him, and speaking with colleagues in preparation for today’s tribute, it became clear that he would have been my kind of guy, party affiliation notwithstanding, of course.", "I may not have had any contact with Eric over the years, but my uncle Bill Powell, the mayor of Hamilton, certainly did. My uncle only had good words to say about Eric.", "The people of Hamilton like their politicians feisty, and Eric certainly filled that bill. His passion for the communities he served and the Liberal Party were intertwined. It would hardly be a stretch to say that he was fiercely partisan—even his obituary spoke of his dedication to the Liberal Party—but it was clear that he saw it as a platform to speak up for the people of Hamilton–Wentworth and Wentworth North. He was never one to shy away from a fight, even when he knew he might not win, if it was in the best interests of the people he had the privilege to represent.", "As MPP, Eric was well regarded by his constituents, winning by increasingly comfortable margins during the course of his tenure here at Queen’s Park. And in keeping with who he was, the decision to step down from provincial politics to run federally in the 1984 election was driven by his desire to be an effective voice for the community he was proud to call home.", "Although the 1984 federal election didn’t turn out the way he would have liked, it did not diminish his commitment to public service or the Liberal Party. Not only did he serve on a number of boards and commissions throughout the greater Toronto and Hamilton area, but he was also a willing and active mentor to the generation of Liberal MPPs who would follow in his footsteps. His legacy can be seen in the chamber in the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing—another Hamiltonian, Mr. McMeekin, is there now—and the influence and impact he had had on other municipal and provincial representatives who had the privilege of knowing Eric.", "To Eric’s wife, Heather, daughter, Ashley, and son-in-law, John, thank you for being here today and for the opportunity to acknowledge Eric’s contribution to our province.

I’m pleased and proud that Eric’s wife, Heather, his daughter, Ashley, and his son-in-law, John, are here with us today to hear from members of this place about his contributions to public life, his work on behalf of the people of Wentworth North and his fierce commitment to the people of Ontario.", "We are all honoured that the Right Honourable John N. Turner, our 17th Prime Minister, with whom Eric ran as a federal candidate in 1984, is here today. Mr. Turner, I know that Eric would be very proud and pleased that you are here. Eric respected you greatly. The two of you shared many things, among them your love, affection and respect for your mothers, both of them formidable. Said Eric when his mother, Estelle, died, “There may have been prejudices out there in the workplace to the advancement of females, but whatever barriers were put in my mother’s way she moved them aside and never complained about it. She got things done.”", "Well, Mr. Speaker, the apple didn’t fall far from the tree. Eric first ran for the Liberals federally in 1974, where at the age of 24 he lost a very close race to long-time Burlington MP the late Bill Kempling. The following year, Eric ran provincially and was elected in the riding of Wentworth North, one of the youngest MPPs, as the member opposite mentioned, ever elected to the Ontario Legislature. Eric was re-elected in 1977 and in 1981, resigning in 1984, as has been mentioned, to run federally for a second time. He then entered private life and worked as a public and government relations professional, doing things that he found meaningful and in support, always, of his community and the residents of it.", "On a personal note, I was grateful to have Eric’s support and assistance. I enjoyed our conversations. He was generous with his time and his advice. Eric was a man of principle and a tenacious seeker of justice, qualities which made him an excellent MPP and much loved by his constituents.

Now, this was just one of many regular emails, calls or meetings I had with Eric. He was always busy advocating on a number of projects. I replied to Eric’s email, suggesting we could get together sometime in mid-January. Sadly, that meeting never happened. Eric Cunningham passed away in the early morning hours of January 1.", "Eric served, as you’ve heard, as MPP for Wentworth North from 1975 to 1984. In 1984, while I was mission officer with the United Church of Canada, I took a sabbatical to work with Eric in his attempt to transition to federal politics. For three weeks, we canvassed side by side, and I specifically remember that, two days before the election, Eric turned to me—we were having a sandwich together—with a smile on his face and said, “You know, Ted, we’re going to lose this election big time.” I asked him how he could smile, knowing the election was lost. He replied, “It doesn’t matter. What matters is I had the opportunity to meet a lot of great people.” That was Eric.", "He was a giant when it came to politics. He gave people who were cynical and skeptical about politics something to believe in. He loved his work, and as the honourable Mr. Hudak has said, his constituents came to love him very much indeed.", "Eric had the rare gift of being able to transform political enemies into friends. Since his return to the private sector, he constantly provided advice and wise counsel to many, including myself. We’d meet at least once a month to talk about every issue under the sun, but instead of simply pointing fingers, Eric always backed up his concerns with a potential solution. Needless to say, I respected him very much.", "There are many stories I could share about Eric, but one recent event stands out for me. It involved a young girl suffering from cystic fibrosis who needed a new wonder drug that was not yet covered by OHIP—you may remember. The government was under pressure to approve the drug, and Eric said to me—I quote from an email he sent: “How can we justify paying for in vitro fertilization, smoking cessation products and liver transplants for people who have abused their bodies all their lives, but not be able to help this 12-year-old girl?” It was a question that needed to be asked. It spurred me to lobby my colleagues at Queen’s Park to try to help this young lady.", "Speaker, I miss Eric’s friendship and wise counsel. Let me conclude with this final thought about my good friend Eric Cunningham. It is said you never pay your debt to the past until you have left a future indebted to yourself. Eric, you paid your debt to the past; the future is indeed indebted to you. We owe you big time, buddy. Rest in peace." ],

Throughout all these conversations, one thing has been very clear: People are concerned about their retirement. I have heard time and time again that there is a gap between what people are able to save and what they will need in retirement. Many people are worried they will outlive their savings. Some are concerned that they may never be able to retire at all. This concern is exactly why we’ve introduced this bill: to move to close this gap and help give people in this province the financial security they deserve in retirement. Passing Bill 56 is a critical step to giving millions of Ontarians the retirement security they want and need.", "Bill 56 lays out the foundation for the ORPP and would commit the government to establish the plan by January 2017. It has a framework for key design parameters and includes a requirement to establish an entity to administer the plan. Once implemented, the ORPP would expand pension coverage to millions of workers and ensure that Ontarians have a secure retirement income floor that they can rely on. The people of Ontario need this plan. This plan will give people confidence in their retirement future.", "The realities of life today for the workforce are much different than they were in our parents’ generation. People are more mobile than ever before. On average, workers can expect to change employers about five times throughout their careers. This makes consistent participation in a workplace plan difficult. As well, the proportion of Ontarians with workplace pension plan coverage is low and is getting lower. In 2012, only 34% of Ontario workers had a workplace plan. The numbers are even lower when you look at the private sector, where only 28% are benefiting from membership in a workplace pension plan.", "Young people are particularly disadvantaged when it comes to workplace pension plans. Their working lives involve multiple jobs, sometimes temporary or part-time, so they have a patchwork of pension coverage at best. In 2012, only about one quarter of workers aged 25 to 34 had workplace plans, compared to nearly half of workers aged 45 to 54. Young people today worry that they might never achieve the security their parents’ generation had.", "With low workplace pension coverage, people must turn elsewhere, so they rely more heavily on personal savings. However, study after study shows us that people are not taking advantage of voluntary retirement savings vehicles. In 2012, 81% of available TFSA room is currently unused. In 2013, there was approximately $790 billion in unused RRSP room in Canada—about $300 billion in Ontario alone.", "Studies from major financial institutions including CIBC, RBC, BMO and Sun Life have shown growing numbers of Ontarians who have not been saving sufficiently. In a recent poll, RBC found that only 39% of respondents put money away for retirement in 2014, and 30% had not begun saving at all. BMO found that one third of Canadians have less than $10,000 in savings. Sun Life Financial found that 60% of Canadians now expect to work past 65, up from 48% in 2008.", "For those who do manage to save, high management fees, low interest rates and unpredictable market performance have led to lower returns on their investments. Add to this the fact that lifespans are increasing. A 20-year-old today can expect to reach age 90, and one in 10 is expected to live to 100.", "While increasing life expectancy is a sign of higher living standards and better health outcomes—something we should be proud of, Mr. Speaker—it also places more pressure on personal savings, creating a need for them to stretch further, so those who have managed to put away money are worrying that they might actually outlive their savings. Many of the Ontarians I spoke to fear that they will never be able to retire at all, while others are concerned that the physically demanding nature of their jobs will prevent them from continuing to work before they are financially prepared for retirement.", "What is clear is that our 20th-century system is not meeting the needs of our 21st-century economy. This is deeply concerning for our government. We know that pensions are a significant economic driver for communities across Ontario.", "A 2012 Boston Consulting Group study found that, on average, 14 cents of every dollar of income in Ontario communities comes from pensions. Over the next 20 years, the number of seniors in Ontario will almost double, and this is a growing percentage of the population which faces low pension coverage and inadequate savings. They will spend less.", "Less spending could slow consumption and growth. This will put pressure on our economy and our publicly funded institutions, like health care and education. On an individual level, that’s concerning for future seniors, whose standards of living will decline. Collectively, it has the potential to compromise our long-term economic prosperity. That’s not good for people. That’s not good for business. That’s not good for the economy.", "Ontarians expect leadership and action to strengthen retirement security for Ontario’s workers. For younger generations, personal savings will have to stretch over a retirement period that is likely to last several decades. After a lifetime of contributing to our 21st-century economy, they will need a plan to provide them with security in their 21st-century retirement.", "In Canada, with the Canada Pension Plan, we already have a savings vehicle that’s supporting a modern and mobile labour force. Unfortunately, the federal government has shut down any and all discussions on enhancements. Mr. Speaker, in the absence of a CPP enhancement, our government is taking action. The ORPP will build on the key features of the CPP and provide a predictable stream of retirement income for life. This will ensure that Ontarians have the retirement security they worked for, the security they’ve earned and the security they deserve. That sense of security is important for each Ontarian, for each business and for our economy as a whole.", "The ORPP would be the first of its kind—a mandatory provincial pension plan—and would address the retirement needs of a modern, mobile, 21st-century workforce. The ORPP would aim to replace 15% of an individual’s pre-retirement earnings, up to $90,000. It would require the contribution rate to be the same for employers and employees, not exceeding 3.8% combined. Together with the current CPP, this would supplement personal savings and provide a secure retirement income floor for life.", "The ORPP would also be designed to ensure that benefits are earned as contributions are made, so that the system is fair for all generations. And it would pool longevity and investment risk, protecting investments from volatile markets.", "Mr. Speaker, I would like to highlight some of the key elements of the bill for members of this House. This bill lays out the rules for eligibility to participate in the ORPP. Contributions would be managed by a publicly administered entity at arm’s length from government. As noted in the bill, the administrative entity would be responsible for enrolling eligible employees and employers into the ORPP; collecting, holding and investing contributions; and paying out retirement benefits. The 2015 Ontario budget, tabled last week by my honourable colleague the Minister of Finance, introduced the legislation that would establish this entity: the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Administration Corp.", "As we move forward with the ORPP we have been mindful of the impact on business and we’re taking steps to minimize those impacts. For instance, we outlined that the enrollment would occur in stages, starting with the largest employers, and contributions would be phased in over two years. We know that business owners care about the well-being of their employees; I saw that from speaking to many businesses. Yet it’s more than that: They feel responsible to help the people who work for them to save for their retirement.", "At committee hearings, a business owner from Burlington said that the ORPP “makes sense for Ontario, it makes sense for employees and it makes sense” for his business. He believes that “it’s a reasonable cost given the benefit that it provides to our employees.”", "But the reality is that today the cost and administration involved in certain workplace pension plans have made it difficult, if not impossible, for some employers to offer them. The ORPP would allow employers—who may not otherwise be able to offer their employees the opportunity to contribute and to accumulate benefits—to help them save for their retirement years.", "It is evident that greater security for workers translates into a more confident and productive workforce. Collectively, we know that increased retirement savings will contribute to economic growth and create jobs.", "According to analysis from the former governor of the Bank of Canada, David Dodge, an enhancement of retirement savings will benefit the economy. In his 2014 report Macroeconomic Aspects of Retirement Savings, Dodge states that any short-term impact “will automatically be offset in part through the exchange rate and other structural adjustments and which should be offset by an easier monetary policy....”", "Further, he said, “In the longer run, higher household saving would enhance growth of output and incomes.”", "The research from BCG found that seniors with predictable streams of income are confident consumers. That is because receiving a set amount of money each month gives them the security to spend and contribute to their local communities.", "As members of the House can see, the benefits of this plan are numerous. That is why we are working diligently towards 2017 to make the ORPP a reality. In order to get there, it is essential to work quickly and effectively.", "As we move forward, we’re continuing to leverage the expertise of the members of our Technical Advisory Group on Retirement Security, as well as our implementation lead, Michael Nobrega. I would like to extend thanks once again to these individuals for their advice, opinions and support.", "Before I conclude, I would also like to offer thanks once again to the standing committee for its work in examining the framework legislation for Bill 56, and to those who presented to the committee. These perspectives have given us lots to think about and will help inform the final design of the ORPP. We are designing the ORPP to support the province’s modern workforce and want to ensure that Ontarians in every stage of their working lives are covered.", "We recognize that all Ontarians share the need to save for retirement. The ORPP would be designed to strike a balance to ensure people are maximizing their benefits in the long term. What I can tell you is that we are building the best plan possible for the people of Ontario. We will be considering the feedback received from submissions and consultations and will announce conclusions on the key design questions for the ORPP shortly.", "The ORPP would ensure that workers in multiple jobs or part-time jobs receive work benefits as much as possible from the ORPP. This is especially important for recent immigrants, like many in my riding of Scarborough–Guildwood, and persons with disabilities or young people who face barriers to securing well-paying jobs with workplace pension plans.", "This government is taking leadership to ensure that Ontarians can achieve the secure retirement they deserve.", "Passing the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Act, 2015, would be a major step in helping working Ontarians address the undersavings challenge. Strengthening the retirement income system is our priority, and ensuring that everyone can afford to retire is part of the government’s four-part plan for building Ontario up.", "This bill is about securing our collective futures. It is about providing more certainty for the retirement futures of the people in this province. Once in place, the ORPP would help millions of Ontario workers retire with more financial security. And after a lifetime of contributing to the economy, we think people deserve a strong and secure retirement.", "Mr. Speaker, I urge the members of this House to support the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Act, 2015." ],

I met with some people last week from the CFIB and, boy, they’re not very happy about the ORPP either. I spoke to some Home Hardware folks last week as well about what this is going to do to members of their organization and the employees in those companies.", "This amounts to another tax on the wages of employees and another tax on to employers. The question is, what is the motivation for the government? You see, the Premier keeps saying she wants to make life easier for the middle class. Well, that’s almost laughable when you see what this government has done in the last 12 years to that so-called middle class. Every time the people who occupy that class turn around, this government is making it harder for them to get by, not easier. If they weren’t taxing the you-know-what out of them—and with fees. You know, it doesn’t matter what it is; little things here and there—not enough for something to go AWOL on. Just think of additions and licensing of your vehicle, all of those things that they’ve—you know the phrase—nickel and dimed them to death over the last 12 years. But what it has done is made it harder for those individuals to put that money into savings so that they’ll have a secure retirement because you, on this side of the House, can’t seem to get enough of their money, and now you’re going to tax them further with this ORPP.", "I don’t understand it.

Something that I’ve mentioned time and time again, when I’ve had an opportunity to get up and speak to the ORPP, is that we need to make sure that there’s security for everyone, for those that work in the private sector who work 20, 25 or 30 years for a company and expect that there’s a pension for them when they retire, only to have companies close up shop and move to another country, and now these people are without their pensions. So I think that the government needs to be looking at ways to secure their private pensions. We on this side are certainly in support of providing income security for all of Ontario. In fact, we think that this was something that could have been done through an enhancement to the CPP at the federal level. But because that hasn’t been addressed now, we’re looking at doing it at the provincial level.", "Something else that’s notable is that the cost of living has gone up. So not only do we need to make sure that everyone in Ontario has money for their retirement and can live comfortably, but we need to make sure that living is affordable. What we’re seeing from the other side—from the government side—is that they are now looking to privatize hydro. That’s certainly not going to help when we already have skyrocketing bills. We have—not just seniors—but, largely, seniors who are struggling to decide whether to keep the heat and lights on or whether they’re going to eat for that day. Frankly, that’s shameful. I would hope that the government side recognizes that a move to privatize hydro is not going to help that; it’s going to make it harder for those in their retirement to be able to live comfortably." ],

An individual born in the province of Ontario in 1900 had a life expectancy of approximately 40 to 50 years of age. An individual born today, as the minister has quite rightly cited, has something on the order of—and, of course, women always exceed it by four to five years, for reasons unknown—85 or 90 years. If a working life extends, for example, to 55 or 65—whatever the number is, and of course that too floats—we are now looking at approximately one third of our life on this planet without a stream of income. That is the reason, the basis, for the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan.", "We, of course, on the government side would have been very pleased and honoured to work with other levels of government—most appropriately, of course, the Harper-Duffy Conservatives, but that was something not available to us. Our Premier—it took an entire year for them to even have face time, let alone negotiation time.

We need to define what a pension is. I think the member from Sarnia–Lambton, when he says that it’s a tax, is absolutely incorrect. This is not a tax. A pension, if you look it up in the dictionary, is actually contributions that are made by a worker, matched by their employer, and it is there for them in their retirement.

It has ignored speakers at public hearings, ignored the small, medium and large business communities, ignored financial advisers, ignored the fundamental structural budget deficit they are actually feeding and ignored the people of Ontario when they say that clearly they cannot afford any more increases in the cost of living. To many, Bill 56 is a decision point: Do they stay in Ontario or leave for a lower-cost jurisdiction?", "To clear the air, I want to dispel three main points the government cites in support of their proposed Ontario pension. The government has nearly succeeded in mischaracterizing the debate around retirement income security, but if you actually think about what members are repeating, their proof points do not make sense.", "Without the requisite cost-benefit analysis that usually accompanies the proposal stage of such a fiscal initiative, we are asked to base our support on emotional arguments. By not coming forth with real data on this initiative, the Liberals succeed in capturing the hearts and minds of Ontarians who are anxious about their own retirement.", "By the way, Mr. Speaker, I forgot to say that I would be sharing my time with the member from Haldimand–Norfolk and the member from Parry Sound–Muskoka.", "The justification points: 65% of Ontarians don’t have a workplace pension. This tells us nothing about how Ontarians, as a whole, are saving for their retirement. There are many, many ways by which individuals have chosen to save for their retirement.", "Every year people do not contribute to the maximum to the RRSP. This tells us nothing about how Ontarians, as a whole, are saving. Again, there may be tax reasons why they’re not. There may be many other complications not to have the full complement of funding for the RRSP.", "Studies show that our economy 40 years from now will struggle if retirees do not have adequate income to spend. This is not an argument for a pension plan; it’s an argument for sound economic policies. You have to ask yourselves: When does the health of tomorrow’s economy trump the health and well-being of today’s economy? When is it okay to sacrifice the jobs of today for the jobs of tomorrow? Never, actually, and today’s economy needs help. The last decade has seen the largest increase in the cost of doing business in Ontario in history, all because of this government’s policies.", "Frequently the comparison is made between the Ontario pension and the Canada Pension Plan, suggesting that it will operate in much the same way, but this is not true because of the difference in the economy of scale that’s achieved by the CPP, which allows it to provide a solid long-term return on investment. People have talked about the fact that a pension needs 40 years to mature to be able to offer the long-term support that it demands, so just even on the basis of that, it pales in comparison to the CPP. I’m hoping that I will have the opportunity later to offer a couple of other important comparisons.", "From the introduction of this pension scheme, we in our caucus have raised issues. First of all, the government hasn’t provided a plan, which is something that you would think is pretty basic. As a result of no plan, all that happens is questions. Questions abound, but with no answers. Employers have told the government that the mandatory financial contributions will cost jobs, and we know jobless people can’t pay into or collect a pension. Employers and employees alike will have less money in their pockets, reducing their purchasing power now.", "People want choice in their spending priorities and in their saving methods. The ORPP robs Ontarians of that choice. It is clear to those who understand what’s at stake that this pension scheme must be abandoned. Instead, we find ourselves now in third reading of Bill 56, the ORPP, amid huge uncertainty. I have chosen that as the theme for a number of opportunities to speak because of the fact that this is something about which people want to know a great deal, and instead, there are no answers; there are just questions.", "I began, last week, when the budget came out, to look and see what was here in the budget document on the direction of the government with regard to the pension.

We don’t know at what age, for how long, what kind of employment—is it part-time, full-time, any time?—or what kind of details there are in terms of what might constitute an eligible Ontarian.", "Going further, the paper discusses the fact that “the government has taken ... decisive actions to fulfil the commitments made in the 2014 budget.” But we find, when we look at last year’s document, that it amended the Pension Benefits Act to provide a legislative framework for the voluntary conversion of public sector single-employer pension plans into jointly sponsored plans. That tells us nothing about the private sector; that says that there’s a change in the public sector. This bill has been presented to us as something that is of interest and of concern to the private sector.", "It says, going on from there, “As part of its continuing progress to enhance retirement income security for all Ontarians”—now it’s all, not just eligible—“the government announces the following measures” in the budget.", "The second bullet point is the appointment of an expert committee. I think that happened this morning, actually. This expert committee is charged with the responsibility of considering “more tailored regulation of financial advisers, including financial planners. By enhancing regulation of the financial advice sector, the government can help consumers build a more secure retirement.” It isn’t actually—I don’t believe—part of a mandatory pension plan by the government. It does respond to many concerns about the need for financial literacy education.", "The next part that I think bears some attention is on page 138. It describes it as the “New Ontario Pension Plan.” I didn’t know we had an old one. Here, it says, “Through mandatory contributions, the ORPP would provide a secure retirement income ... for eligible Ontario workers.” It’s “intended to complement workplace and other voluntary retirement savings arrangements that will continue to play a critical role in helping Ontarians maintain their standard of living in retirement.”", "This only adds to the confusion about who’s in and who’s out, and this uncertainty. How long will it take for individuals to be required to make contributions in order to receive benefits? For those who see this as an opportunity for a pension, there is also uncertainty because there’s no idea how their money will be handled and how investment returns will be generated. We don’t even know whether this ORPP is a Ponzi scheme fraught with intergenerational inequity whereby younger participants are paying for the older, soon-to-be-retired.", "The lack of a plan has created further uncertainty as there is no definition of a “comparable workplace pension plan.” What will be the impact on the existing private sector pensions? Hundreds of thousands of people employed in Ontario have workplace pension plans that, together, amount to the trillions in assets.", "In 12 hours of public hearings, we heard 41 speakers. It was clear that the majority who spoke were opposed for a variety of reasons. One concern raised is that, without exemptions, the ORPP may crowd out or eliminate existing pension plans and retirement savings. For many people, this may mean the ORPP provides no net increase to savings or may even reduce their retirement assets.", "Without a clear plan, it’s impossible to evaluate, only speculate. For that, I want to give you some further introduction to some of the key ideas that are provided here.", "As I read a moment ago, mandatory contributions—and it is “intended to complement workplace and other voluntary retirement savings,” which is a hint maybe about the direction but certainly nothing that is going to give people a great deal of confidence in that regard.", "But before January 2017, the budget papers tell us, “the province will also introduce legislation that would finalize details of the plan, based on extensive actuarial and legal analysis and ongoing engagement with Ontarians.” So before it actually comes into play in January 2017, it says here that, prior to that, we’re going to learn something about the details. But this is cold comfort for people who are concerned, as I have identified, with some of the issues that have remained unanswered. All we’re going to know is that, before 2017, the government is going to announce some conclusions on the key design of the plan.", "We then look at the one that has attracted the most attention, the most concern, and that is the question of the 1.9% contribution. Something that no one has been able to answer for me in terms of the details of this proposal is the fact that both the employer and the employee—their contribution is tax-exempt. So without a plan, we don’t even know if the government has contemplated the impact this would have on its own revenues. It’s not a lot, but since it’s mandatory it becomes a lot, and that’s revenue that the government would normally get in a revenue stream, but now this will be exempt. I’ve no idea what this would mean—the exemptions—for millions of contributing workers and businesses. It may cost the provincial government tens of millions of lost or forgone tax revenue. People should know what the true value is and what the government is doing by creating this.", "The other point, of course, is that you’re left to ponder—again, I go back to speculate—how much will other taxes and fees have to be raised in order to cover this newly created budget revenue shortfall to appear in 2017?", "And we don’t know about administration costs. How much will it cost to provide a stand-alone pension scheme—$300 million, $400 million? With no plan in place, it’s back to speculation.", "But it’s interesting that the budget document is clearly moving forward with the creation of the administrative corporation. They may not know what matters most to individuals who feel the 1.9% coming out of their pocket, but the government is busy organizing the administrative arm.", "I think we’re allowed to demonstrate a bit of skepticism on that file because every other arm’s-length institution that the government has managed to find ways to create scandal and misuse of funds and things like that—here’s another one.", "What does the government say about that? Well, on page 148 there is the beginning of this information on the creation of the administrative corporation. I really want to emphasize that, because we’re going to start with the highest-priced people in the process. We don’t know anything about the details on how it’s going to affect unemployment in this province, but we are going to have experts and, I guess, a capital budget as well for where this will be housed.", "But here’s what it says in the budget document: “Ontario is a global leader in pension administration and management....", "“Building on the best attributes of these models”—that is, CPP and the teachers’ as world-class pension plans—“and the framework in Bill 56, Ontario is introducing legislation that would establish the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Administration Corporation”—this is where we have to put in the big pot of money to be able to create an administration—“a professional, independent pension organization that would be responsible for administering the ORPP. The government envisions the” Ontario pension administration corporation “as evolving into one of the world’s leading pension organizations.” Well, that’s certainly a tall order.", "“To support the ORPP’s strong governance framework, the government would put in place a focused interim board”—we’ve got to hire them and pay them to be the interim board—“to oversee the implementation” of the permanent board.", "“If the legislation passes, the province expects to name an interim chair ... in the coming months.” So we’re going to make sure that we’ve got the people at the top hired before we can even answer the simplest questions to the average Joe whose pocket is being picked. I think that that demonstrates in itself the kind of priority that this government has.", "Oh, and I left out another part of what has to happen: “One of the government’s initial implementation priorities is to identify potential providers”—we’ve got to have those people as well—“that could help deliver a simple, reliable and cost-effective pension service-delivery system....” Well, I hope it’s not the eHealth gang and I hope it’s not the SAMS people. I hope they found somebody else who actually knows how to do this.", "“At this time, the government is assessing a range of service-delivery options for pension administration. As part of this process, the province is proceeding with a procurement to identify potential third-party service-delivery providers for the ORPP.” So we now have to have somebody who is in charge of—well, they have to be appointed and paid, and delivered—and probably letterhead, and a few other thousand, multi-thousand, a million dollars to be able to provide a procurement to identify potential third-party service deliverers.", "That’s kind of what it looks like when you look at the budget of last week. I want to read one of the closing remarks here: “The government is committed to a smooth transition to the ORPP.” Obviously, after they got all that high-priced help engaged in this, it should.", "“For example, the province will provide employers and employees with regular updates on implementation and will ensure a simplified process to minimize administrative costs.” So far, we don’t have a really good track record with this government on meeting those kinds of objectives.", "“In addition, the government will continue to work with the business community, pension plan administrators, labour and other impacted stakeholders to create a plan that reflects the needs of Ontarians.” Well, I think that one of the things that Ontarians need is a government that is actually committed to creating a climate for investment and creating jobs in this province, and I think that that actually might be more productive than getting in very expensive help to search for more expensive help to make sure that one committee is able to do that.", "All of this, again, leaves so much open to uncertainty. I think it’s very interesting that they are going to keep businesses and other stakeholders in the loop, but that’s really not what they want. They want to know what’s happening on the ground, so to speak.", "My remarks today reflect the genuine concern that I and my caucus colleagues share about this proposal and its effect on the well-being of Ontarians. We know through public discourse, businesses from around the province and even a Ministry of Finance document that this proposal is actually a job killer. The ministry document states that with every $2 billion that the ORPP receives in contributions, 18,000 jobs will be lost. That amounts to approximately 54,000 jobs in Ontario in a year.", "The Canadian Federation of Independent Business forecasts the same negative impacts on our economy if the Ontario pension is installed. One constant is that no one is saying that the pension plan will help create jobs. The only new jobs will be in the public sector, obviously, creating another Taj Mahal and all the people who go with it, who have to get poached from the existing pension managers, the public-sector bureaucrats who will be needed to run the administration and the investment entities.", "Small business has been assaulted by this government by increased red tape and matched increased fees and taxes. They don’t have any financial cushion to absorb this proposal. Instead, they see a government bent on squeezing more money from them through increased hydro rates, mandatory pension contributions and a carbon tax, to name but a few. Businesses can only pay these when they make a profit. More and more these days, businesses are unable to make a profit; they close their shop or move away.", "Casualties of this government’s failed direction, the newly jobless, join the province’s unemployed ranks of over 500,000 people. I remind the Premier that Ontario’s jobless rate has been the worst in the country for the last six years. The last thing Ontario needs is any plan that threatens to kill jobs, never mind actually is a plan to kill jobs. Premier, unemployed people, people who will have to shutter their businesses—these are the people whose lives will be drastically affected by your pension scheme.", "Mr. Speaker, I hope this government has listened to my remarks today and those of my colleagues. We bring the voice of reason, not just emotion, to this debate. I’d ask the members of the House to vote against this bill with me. It will be another burden at best, and perhaps another boondoggle at worst." ],

They talk about the money going to the subways in Toronto. That’s fine. I know that goes over like a lead balloon down in Haldimand county. I spent a fair bit of time down there on the weekend, and there is no public transit in Haldimand county. Our need is culverts, bridges, roads and highways.", "We recognize that this pension proposal is a way to accrue more revenue. The government will have to start writing cheques 30 or 40 years down the road, but it’s going to get this government through in the interim.", "It’s a tax. It’s a tax on employers; it’s an tax on employees. It’s the same kind of tax, essentially, as all of the other taxes.", "Carbon tax, for example: We’re going to see that on the pumps, whether you’re buying gasoline or diesel. It’s going to hit natural gas and heating oil. In the discussion of carbon tax they’ve dragged out that phrase again: “cap-and-trade.” When I think of the phrase “cap-and-trade,” what comes to my mind is cap-and-trade jobs to China. That’s what’s going to continue to happen with that one.", "By selling carbon credits—it’s confusing enough for people to understand, but that’s going to bring in about $2 billion. That’s a pretty significant revenue tool, $2 billion from the cap-and-trade system to this Ontario government—again, to try to meet payroll because of the negotiated settlements around wages, salaries, pensions, holiday time, benefits, sick time; the kinds of things that accrue to public servants that do not accrue to those doing similar work in the private sector.", "Now, we know about, yet again, one of the more recent taxes on electricity. There have been so many increases, people can’t pay the bills down my way. In fact, a lot of people do their best not to use electricity. They have to try to heat their house with wood now. I know personally I went through 20 cords of wood last winter, because I heat with electricity. Year by year, under this present government, my home’s thermostat has been turned down lower and lower and lower.", "The beer tax: Okay, that’s one that they did acknowledge in the budget. That’s about the only one they came right out and made clear. They’re increasing the tax on beer. That’s no small amount of money. That’s going to suck $100 million out of people who drink beer, people who maybe cannot afford high-priced scotch or high-priced wine. So they’re going to be dinged for another $100 million in taxes.", "Part and parcel, this new pension proposal is to add more revenue in the short run. When I say “short run,” maybe over the first 10, 20, 30 or even 40 years before the cheques really start flowing out to people.", "It’s Bill 56. We’ve debated a number of pieces of pension legislation here over the years. It’s a payroll tax to fund the ORPP, the Ontario registered pension plan.", "There’s Liberal messaging that goes with this. I noticed this in the paper a few weeks ago. There was this quote to kind of justify this approach. It was crooning, essentially. It says, “When we share a little, we gain a lot.” So, you know, pay some tax, and we gain a lot down the road. It may be 40 years from now before you or I, Speaker, start drawing on this particular pension.", "It’s estimated that this particular payroll tax is going to bring in something like $3.5 billion a year. Granted, that is going to help tax-and-spend Liberals. There’s no question about that. Maybe it will help hold off the tremendously growing size of their deficit. It has grown every year for the last three years." ],

It will see both employees and employers pay matching payroll taxes of 1.9% of the total salary of an employee; it goes into this pool. So there’s a 3.8% tax. It’s going to be a new tax. It’s getting close to a 4% tax. You know, there is already a subtraction for the national program, the CPP program, as well. This is an add-on to that.", "The result: Employees will see less money in their pocket, obviously, when they’re paying another 1.9% of their salary to the Ontario government for this future plan. Take-home pay will decrease, obviously. This impacts spending priorities. There’s less money to spend, to invest, to save, perhaps, for retirement. It’s a threat to the small companies as well. We’ve certainly heard that feedback. It could be a threat to one’s job, for that matter, if it’s just that additional straw that may put a small business under. So it will impact spending priorities within our economy, like paying off your student loan or paying down a mortgage and additional discretionary spending.", "As was mentioned, public hearings were held in late March on Bill 56, the legislation that brings in this plan. A number of employers told members on the committee that they saw this mandatory 1.9% employer contribution as a payroll tax. They couldn’t afford it. Many presenters indicated that high electricity prices, increased WSIB rates, the increased minimum wage and red tape obviously all add on and contribute to the increased cost of doing business. I certainly heard that across the north in the last several days last week.", "This is a pension payroll tax that is going to make Ontario businesses less competitive and, as we were told, will force some employers to reduce hours and cut staff. Some feel threatened, coupled with the increasing cost of electricity. They may leave for Ohio; they may leave for Michigan or just go out of business altogether.", "Ministry of Finance documents: There’s an estimate here that Ontario would lose something like 18,000 jobs with every $2 billion collected by the ORPP payroll tax. I find it hard to believe why a government of any stripe would introduce a payroll tax, in this case disguised as a pension scheme, that would threaten jobs in the province of Ontario. That just seems to be the reality of the world we’re living in now within this present provincial government.", "We know there will be a new arm’s-length agency that will administer the ORPP. We’ve seen the track history of a number of other agencies through this government—Ornge air ambulance for one; eHealth; before that, the College of Trades comes to mind—that have severely eroded the trust of the people of Ontario in their government of Ontario.", "I would ask everyone here to please turn to the legislation, turn to subsection 2(1). How is this money going to be raked in? First of all, “An administrative entity shall be established for the purpose of administering the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan.", "“Duties of the administrative entity", "“(2) The duties of the administrative entity shall include the following: ....", "“2. Collection of contributions: The administrative entity shall collect from eligible employers the contributions on behalf of the eligible employers and the eligible employees.", "“3. Investing contributions: The administrative entity shall be responsible for investing the collected contributions for the benefit of the members and other beneficiaries of the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan.” We’ve got to hold them to that, Speaker.", "I continue my quote:", "“4. Holding contributions: The administrative entity shall hold the contributions, and any accruals from the investments, in trust for the members and other beneficiaries of the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan. The contributions and the accruals shall not form part of the Consolidated Revenue Fund.”", "As official opposition we asked, in the 2015 budget—we requested that this government demonstrate a commitment to abandon any thoughts of an Ontario Retirement Pension Plan altogether. There hasn’t been a cost/benefit analysis, let alone a risk/benefit analysis, for that matter. There’s no business plan to ensure that this idea makes any kind of sense at all in the first place.", "The present government have floated this proposal. It’s an idea. There is not a plan. They’ve set a target of a year and a half to race around all the companies and find out, “Well, what kind of plan do you have?” and, “Here’s the new plan,” and try to work out how this new plan can fit into their old plans, so that they can get the money that the employer was previously putting forward on behalf of the company and on behalf of their staff, their employees. I do put to this Legislature that this has not been thought through.", "If we turn to the preamble of the bill, we read: “Canada and Ontario have a strong foundation of retirement benefit programs....” Many of us take advantage of these. Some are mandatory; some are voluntary. If we had a modicum of financial literacy being communicated in our school system, I think there would be a lot more people who, once they start working, would take advantage of so many of the other instruments out there to save for their own retirement, rather than depending on the state.", "Some of the programs: obviously the Canada Pension Plan, Old Age Security and the Guaranteed Annual Income System. I’ll quote further: “However, as outlined in Ontario’s 2014 budget, several studies”—several studies; that’s not a full literature review—“have shown that a significant portion of today’s workers are not saving enough to maintain their standard of living when they retire. The reasons for this are varied: workplace pension coverage is low; individuals are not taking sufficient advantage of voluntary savings tools; and people are living longer than ever before.”", "I don’t know whether this is seen as a problem for this government, that people are living longer. However, these aren’t necessarily good reasons to add a 3.8% payroll tax.", "I’ll quote the preamble again. This is so odd, to read this in legislation. I really don’t know whether this was written by a lawyer or a legislator, but I’ll just quote. This is right in the bill: “After a lifetime of hard work, Ontarians deserve to feel financially secure in their retirement.” Now, I’ve read a lot of legislation over the years; this seems to be really pushing it. Does this make it a law?", "“Strengthening the retirement income system is not only important to Ontario families, it is critical to the future prosperity of the province.” I wanted to read that out, to give credit to this government. I don’t think a lawyer wrote that, but here’s the reason given for this bill.", "In Ontario, many employees participate in defined contribution pension plans, group RRSPs, tax-free savings accounts and other retirement savings vehicles. People buy property, improve property and flip property, sell houses, sell farms, build another one. There are other ways to save for retirement, not that we’re going to make that a law.", "Some defined contribution plans have higher rates than this particular pension proposal, so what would happen there? Obviously, the employer, when they have this choice before them, is going to reduce their contributions or maybe just walk away from the existing plan that the company had for a number of years, as it was.", "As opposition, we aren’t alone in our particular position on this. The Ontario Chamber of Commerce publicly lambasted the government for its lack of evidence-based decision-making: “At a minimum, the government of Ontario must conduct and publicly release an analysis of the impact of the new pension plan on foreign direct investment, job creation and Ontario’s competitiveness.”", "Again, why would the government consider such a plan? People are better off working. We know that. Any job is a good job, in my view, and I’ve done a lot of different ones. You’re better off working. You’re better off saving toward your retirement—better than not earning anything. Any threat to employment, any threat to business that provides the employment in this province is not a good thing, and we point the finger at this particular proposal.", "We know that under the present regime we have already lost something like 300,000 manufacturing jobs. So we’ve got a plan. It’s expected, once it gets rolling, to bring in $3.5 billion to this government. Why else would they do this? And we do know that there are so many other public sector-generated pension plans that have billions of dollars of unfunded liabilities. I predict that’s the future for this plan, if past behaviour is any predictor of future behaviour. That does not instill confidence, within the official opposition, in this particular proposal. We’ve got a proposal that is going to subtract 1.9% from people’s paycheques. It’s going to subtract 1.9% from the employer.", "In last spring’s budget—2014—the Premier unveiled this proposal for a payroll tax, particularly for those who don’t have access to a company pension plan. It doesn’t mean that they don’t have access to other instruments of saving for their retirement. We know it’s a top-up to the CPP, the Canada Pension Plan, but it will not cover those who are self-employed, those who already have pensions through their workplace or in a federally regulated place of employment—banking, telecommunications or transportation.", "It only benefits those who are working. There’s something like a million people who aren’t working in the province of Ontario. They’re either on welfare or disability. It could well be higher than that. I’ll have to check the figures on that one. This government’s war on poverty was a dud, as we know.", "This is a proposal that does have business owners especially worried, as the pension program laid out before us right now again requires both employer and employee contributions. They begin in January 2017, so they’ve set a date a year and a half from now to cut the take-home pay of the worker and cut the bottom line of the particular business that they’re working for.", "Meridian Credit Union put out a report indicating that 77% of Ontario’s entrepreneurs feel the ORPP will be the largest business challenge they’ve ever faced. They’re fearful that the plan may negatively impact their own retirement plans, and that’s also concerning in that 91% of those surveyed were concerned that the proposal before us here today would cut into their business profits. In the meantime, when that happens, then you’ve got to take a look at your hiring practices and your firing practices. You’ve got to take a look at your compensation program to prepare for the inevitable crunch.", "The Canadian Federation of Independent Business, CFIB, has dubbed the ORPP a “job killer.” I know the member for York–Simcoe just indicated that earlier this afternoon, saying that payroll taxes force employers to lay off workers, cut hiring and, in many cases, move south of the border.", "About 60% of Ontario workers don’t have a company pension plan, but, again given this government’s track record, people are not convinced that they’re ready to trust this government with another $3.5 billion a year. That’s what this is all about. It’s all about the $3.5 billion a year—" ],

We have the Canada Pension Plan. We have Old Age Security. We have the Guaranteed Income Supplement. For those at the lowest income levels, at retirement they tend to not see their income levels change too much because of the plans we do have.", "The great majority of Ontarians are saving enough for retirement, so the question is: Is this pension plan really necessary? The federal government has said that when the economy improves they’re going to expand the Canada Pension Plan. I think that makes sense. I really liked the doubling of the TFSA last week.", "I look at my own son, Stuart, who is 27 and not making much money. I talk to him and encourage him to save, because the best thing you can do when you’re trying to save for retirement is—the time value of money; the longer you do it, the easier it is to save for retirement. So despite him not making much money, we chatted with Stuart, saying, “You should either do an RRSP or a TFSA.”", "For somebody not making much money and not paying much tax, a TFSA makes the most sense because you don’t get a tax benefit; he’s not paying much income tax. TFSAs also give great flexibility. They don’t have all of the rules around RRSPs, so when you do go to use it you don’t pay any tax on it and you have total flexibility to do with it as you like. I’m really happy that the federal government doubled that in last week’s budget.", "In the short time I have available, I wanted to get on the record an article that really sums it up pretty well. It was written by Jack Mintz. It’s entitled “Ontario’s Really Bad Pension Scheme.", "“The ORPP is an expensive and poorly targeted approach to support seniors. The government should focus with more precision to help the most vulnerable.", "“The province of Ontario is soliciting comments on its proposed Ontario Retirement Pension Plan (ORPP).

The plan will provide 15% of earnings after retirement. For example, at $20,000 in income, payroll taxes annually would total $627 with a pension payment of $2,848 (or $238 per month) after 65 years of age. The ORPP payment will affect income taxes and income-tested benefits.", "“Under the proposal, an employee enrolled in a ‘comparable’ defined benefit or target plan will not need to join the ORPP. Self-employed individuals will not be able to join the plan due to Income Tax Act limitations.", "“The key issue is whether Ontarians are not saving enough. Ontario politicians maybe believe there’s a problem, but what is the evidence?", "“The best research has been done by Statistics Canada and McKinsey with large surveys coming to similar conclusions. While it is agreed that some Canadians have insufficient replacement income at retirement, it’s widely agreed that three-quarters to four-fifths of Canadians do well, even projected into the future.‎ This suggests a scalpel is needed, not an ORPP sledgehammer.", "“Canadians have been saving well over the years and there is little to presume that this behaviour has changed. Sure, interest yields are recently low but stock markets have come back since 2009. Low yields affect any saving plans including a government pension plan, which could run large unfunded liabilities. There are no magic bullets.", "“Ontario’s proposed mandatory pension scheme could do more harm than good.", "“Based on data, not conjecture, a young Canadian buys a home with a mortgage and pays off most debt by retirement. Housing equity is a significant asset of which its after-tax value is more than the combined value of Canada Pension Plan, Quebec Pension Plan, tax-assisted registered pension and retirement assets. Taking into account other financial and business assets held by Canadians, most Canadians do not need new mandatory saving plans. Some individuals require support but this has been provided by a combination of OAS, CPP/QPP, Guaranteed Income Supplement, provincial support programs‎, Medicare and low income taxes on seniors. It is far from clear an expansion of CPP, QPP or the ORPP is at all needed for the broad population.", "“In fact, a mandatory Ontario‎ pension plan could do more harm than good.", "“First, once taking into account personal taxation and income-tested programs, the Ontario plan will discriminate against low-income seniors and some others in middle-class ranges.", "“Low-income seniors will be taxed on Ontario pension income as well as lose GIS payments, 50 cents on each dollar. For a senior with $20,000 in income, barely above the measured poverty line, the Ontario pension plan will be reduced from $2,848 to $1,424 with the loss in GIS and a further $584 by federal and provincial tax payments, leaving only $740 to cover rent and food. While working, the person would pay the same payroll tax rate as others but would end up with a pretty lousy after-tax return on the asset.", "“Seniors with more than $71,592 will also be hurt by the clawback of federal OAS payments at 15 cents on each dollar of Ontario pension payment. Taking into account both this clawback and federal and Ontario income taxes, the Ontario pension payment is reduced by up to 55%!", "“Second, any mandatory scheme has bad consequences for those who do not need it. Young families trying to save for home equity will need to pay into a plan that is a less important retirement asset at their stage of life. Others who invest in businesses and other financial opportunities will have to face new taxes. Employers looking to hire more workers will now pay a new tax even if they provide some alternative retirement benefit that is ‘not comparable’ to the Ontario plan, such as a defined contribution plan.", "“Third, the Ontario plan will be expensive to operate, the reason Alberta decided not to run its own pension plan a decade and a half ago. Ontario will need to track migrants in and out of the province. It will also need to administer the plan on its own. It will also lead to large unfunded liabilities, adding on to provincial debt, if payroll taxes do not cover benefits.", "“Fourth, by exempting those employers with comparable plans—defined benefit and target plans—labour markets will be distorted in favour of unionized employers where such plans are typically found. Also, capital markets would be distorted in favour of financial firms that can provide comparable plans.", "“Finally, the Ontario government would have an enticing asset to use for industrial policy. Although the budget proposal makes clear that the Ontario pension plan will operate on market-based principles, we already see ruminations to use funds to finance Ontario infrastructure. Pension” plans “have an interest to fund long-lived assets, anywhere in the world, but pressure from the Ontario politicians could undermine prudent investor behaviour.", "“Governments do have a role in supporting our seniors. Poverty among ... seniors is extraordinarily high at 20%. Long-term care will be a serious issue in the future for many seniors living longer periods with ill health.", "“The ORPP is an expensive and poorly targeted approach to support seniors. The government should focus with more precision to help the most vulnerable.”", "That was written by Jack Mintz. I think it states it fairly clearly.", "In regard to the last point he made there, how many long-term-care-beds has this government built in the last 12 years? You can correct me if I’m wrong; I don’t think you’ve built any in the last 12 years. Maybe that would be something that would have a definite benefit for those single seniors that he was referring to that are having difficulty. That would, obviously, be of huge, huge benefit to them, and yet, the government has built no new long-term-care beds.", "In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, what has the government been saying to justify this? They have been saying that 65% of Ontarians don’t have a workplace pension. Well, this stat tells us nothing about how Ontarians as a whole are saving for their retirement. I’m one of that 65%, but I don’t think I need the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan. I was self-employed most of my life, so I had to rely on RRSPs and investments in our home and that kind of thing. There’s lots of other people in that circumstance. So that statistic really tells you nothing. Every year, people do not contribute the maximum to their RRSP—well, I’m that person as well. I don’t necessarily contribute the maximum to my RRSP, nor do I want to, because there are so many restrictions and rules that go along with an RRSP, it wouldn’t be prudent to have all your retirement investment in an RRSP. Yet, that’s another justification the government is using—a flawed logic for justifying this plan.", "Mr. Speaker, perhaps in the response to the debate I’ll get a chance to speak a little bit more." ],

I have to say that I disagreed with pretty much everything that was said by the three members to my right, with the exception of a couple of comments that I think bear highlighting.", "The first is the comment about the need for coordination with CPP, OAS and GIS. Certainly I think that will be a high priority for the implementation of this ORPP. In my community in London, we’ve seen a 300% increase in poverty among seniors who live in the city. We have a poverty rate that’s 32% higher than the national average. And it’s not just in London. Across Ontario, a report from the Ontario Association of Food Banks said that seniors and post-secondary students are the two groups of food bank users who are growing the fastest in this province. So there is a need to do something to address this level of poverty, particularly from the perspective of women. Senior women are twice as likely as senior men to end their years in poverty.", "But the other point that was made by the members of the PC caucus is around the question of trust. I do think that that is a legitimate question: Can we trust this government to deliver? We’ve seen $8 billion wasted on P3s. We saw a billion dollars wasted on the gas plants. We see the privatization of Hydro One, and it does raise some questions about trust." ],

Without action today, many of today’s workers will face a decline in their living standards in retirement. I know my colleagues across the way in the Progressive Conservative Party really don’t see that issue as important because their federal cousins have not taken a leadership role on this in a decade. In a decade, they’ve stood there in the House and have done nothing on this file. They talk about an increase in OAS when a senior can’t even buy a pack of gum with the increase that they get from their federal cousins.", "What we’ve seen is leadership on this side of the House, leadership to ensure that three million Canadians will be able to retire in dignity. I know my colleagues across the way don’t worry about that.", "They also don’t worry about facts. We’ve seen 500,000 net new jobs created by this government since the recession—500,000 net new jobs. The CFIB, which they try to quote, has even increased our SME upgrade. We are doing a great job to ensure we’re creating jobs in this province. We’re helping small and medium-sized enterprise, and we’re also making sure that we are looking after our workers and our seniors in this province.", "I know it’s hard for them on that side of the House to think about that, but they need to start picking up the phone and maybe talking to their federal cousins, because you know what? A 64-cent increase on OAS doesn’t do it. A CPP increase by the federal government would actually help everyone across the country, and would help us—all of our workers—moving forward into the future." ],

As the government has decided to split the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan into three bills, there will be many more hours to follow. Fortunately, it is a topic with a lot of area for discussion, and there are few things I would rather speak about than pensions.", "Not much has changed since we last discussed this bill at second reading. We’ve gone through the committee stage, held public hearings and reviewed the legislation clause-by-clause, but almost every amendment was voted down by the government and the bill has progressed largely in its original form. Of course, because this isn’t the most substantive piece of legislation, there also wasn’t much to change, so it’s not that surprising that what began as a shell has remained a shell throughout.", "That being said, I appreciate the opportunity today to discuss the process, to go over some of the great ideas we heard presented during the public hearings, to make note of the various amendments we proposed that the government couldn’t be bothered to adopt, and to remind the government that there are still a lot of questions to be answered about the design details of the ORPP and we want to make sure they answer them correctly.", "As the Ontario NDP critic for pensions, I am always honoured to rise and speak on behalf of the two thirds of Ontarians who do not have a workplace pension plan and on behalf of all Ontarians as they plan and prepare for their retirement, whether it is four months down the road or in four decades. All Ontarians deserve the right to retire with dignity, and it is our job as members of provincial Parliament to do whatever we can to help along the way. I believe this wholeheartedly, and I hope the government does as well.", "When an individual benefits from a secure retirement, we all benefit. Our society benefits. Our economy benefits. I could spend the next hour just listing ripple effects that ensuring retirement has, from increased discretionary spending to decreased social service and health care costs.", "Retirement security is not a goal for our society; it is a necessity. It is the difference between our province struggling and our province thriving. It is the difference between looking 40 years ahead and falling 40 years behind. This is about looking out for the youth of today, when they become the seniors of tomorrow.", "But we can’t get there on platitudes alone. Like all things, the devil is in the details, and the government left most of the details out of Bill 56. The day it was introduced, we heard a lot of lofty language from the government about the ORPP, but saw far more action on the PRPPs that they’ve co-opted from the Harper government. Naturally, Mr. Speaker, you can understand why we remain concerned and why we are watching the government so intently. They said all the right things about addressing our retirement security crisis, but we want to make sure they go about it in the right way.", "Today, I will talk about how we’ve gotten to where we are, and where we need to go. All Ontarians deserve the right to retire with dignity. Now we just need make that belief a reality.", "I would like to take this opportunity to share parts of the summary of Bill 56 hearings. The summary was “prepared to assist members in their deliberations and in their clause-by-clause consideration of the bill. It is not a complete historical record of all the evidence heard by the committee, nor a comprehensive review of the arguments made by witnesses. Accordingly, comments have been abbreviated and recommendations summarized. Submissions expressing substantially the same point of view have been grouped together.”", "Since the government didn’t seem to take these comments and suggestions to heart during committee, they might at least take them in here today. We heard from stakeholders with many and varied perspectives and fields of reference. We heard comments and suggestions on contributions, the determination of contributions on the contribution rate and on the phase-in of contribution rates. We heard a lot about employee eligibility. And as we’ve heard from the Conservatives, we heard from very different and divergent perspectives. That’s the point.", "This was my first time following a bill through committee. While it was a personally valuable exercise, we don’t see that the bill was strengthened by the process. Certainly, the government seemed determined to stick to its original plan without meaningful consideration of other options and improvements. So I am pleased to share some of those other options and improvements from many of those invested and passionate stakeholders. Here are some comments and suggestions around the idea of eligibility of employees that I am citing from the summary:", "The exemption for comparable plans under subsection 2(1) should be removed.", "If the employee exemption is not removed, then the criteria for exemption should be a list of specific criteria that ensures that robust defined-benefit and defined-contribution plans are exempt. This would focus the ORPP on those with few or no additional retirement savings.", "Well, Mr. Speaker, while we recognize that there are many strong DC plans out there, and we did hear from a number of them during the hearings, to say that any or all should be excluded doesn’t support the idea of a strong and reliable benefit into retirement. The contribution side of things isn’t what we should be comparing, especially if we’re going to look at plans to be exempt. We should be looking at the benefit. As I have said before, to think that people and their plans are at the mercy of the market—I don’t think that is what we should aim for. It is defined-benefit plans that are going to provide that predictable, more secure benefit. That is the nature of them. Ultimately, we do hope that the ORPP is going to be designed to provide the most secure and most predictable benefit to the most people.", "Some of the comments and recommendations that I would also like to share include suggestions on possible additions to the proposed ORPP. I have a list of them here, also from the summary:", "The government should take measures to offset the cost of contributions for the most economically vulnerable, possibly through a refundable tax credit.", "The ORPP should be coordinated with support programs such as the Guaranteed Income Supplement to help poor Ontarians in particular.", "The ORPP must be arm’s-length from the government and focus on getting the best return for members, not other policy objectives.", "The provincial government should work with the federal government to make legislative changes to allow the self-employed to join the ORPP.", "The design of the ORPP must ensure that this benefit does not remove Old Age Security or Guaranteed Income Supplement benefits.", "As part of the ORPP, Ontario must reach an agreement with the federal government to ensure it gains the same favourable tax treatment as the CPP. Otherwise, there will be negative implications for taxes and retirement savings.", "The government should add a two- to four-year review period following implementation to determine if there are any unintended consequences.", "The ORPP should account for part-time and contract workers to ensure they benefit as well.", "Finally, the ORPP should mirror the CPP’s administrative requirements as closely as possible to minimize the burden on businesses.", "Mr. Speaker, we also heard arguments on universal coverage versus exemptions for the ORPP. Again, I have a list I’d would like to share from the summary, voices from stakeholders that, unfortunately, we don’t see reflected in the changes in the bill:", "The ORPP should provide universal coverage to make it more compatible with the Canada Pension Plan in the event that it can be added into a future CPP expansion.", "Defined-benefit pension plans are not always lucrative enough for retirees to survive on, and employees with them should not be exempted from ORPP contributions.", "A universal ORPP would be simpler and cheaper to administer than a pension system that allows for exemptions for comparable plans.", "A universal ORPP would provide portability and fairness, and reduce pension envy from those who lack retirement savings.", "Any exemptions for comparable plans must account for differences in employment, including contract, part-time and short-term work.", "A universal plan creates fewer labour market distortions than an ORPP that allows some plans to be exempt. Exempting certain plans but not others will create a competitive disadvantage for some firms and workers.", "If the ORPP allows exemptions, it may create a problem of negative selection, where more well-off workers with existing pensions would opt out, while the less well-off remain.", "Unless it is made universal, the ORPP is not a public pension plan; it is simply a workplace pension scheme run by the government.", "I will continue with recommendations from the summary. In arguments for mandatory versus voluntary contributions:", "The ORPP should be a voluntary, rather than mandatory, program.", "In the current economic climate, people do not have the disposable income to contribute to existing voluntary retirement schemes such as RRSPs and PRPPs. A mandatory plan such as the ORPP ensures retirement savings.", "The ORPP must be mandatory to allow interest to accumulate over workers’ entire careers and to build a sufficiently secure pool of assets.", "So you see, Mr. Speaker, we heard a lot of diverse opinions. In fact, I have more. In positive consequences of implementing the ORPP, drawn from the summary:", "All businesses and organizations, large and small, will be able to provide retirement benefits to their employees.", "The ORPP allows for a larger pool of contributions to share risk and allow workers to keep secure retirement savings even if they change jobs.", "If properly modelled on the Canada Pension Plan, the ORPP will provide good returns with management fees that are lower than private alternatives.", "The ORPP will provide more portable and reliable savings than current workplace plans and RSPs.", "The ORPP can provide a significant benefit to groups who have limited retirement savings such as new immigrants, youth, the self-employed and high-skilled workers who do not save enough.", "A defined benefit plan, such as the ORPP, will provide more predictable benefits for future retirees.", "Implementing the ORPP now will increase retirement security for many Ontarians, reducing the pressure for government to provide support for retirees funded by tax revenues.", "The ORPP will help provide an adequate retirement income for more Ontarians, which can lead to better health outcomes.", "Many pension plans are already at risk; the ORPP would provide a protected source of retirement savings to help address that vulnerability.", "And guess what, Mr. Speaker? There are more comments and suggestions that we heard in the hearings, and I’d like to continue to share them. A collection of other suggestions for improving retirement savings:", "Before proceeding with the ORPP, the government should first fix existing pension problems, such as issues arising from pension splitting in the late 1990s.", "The pension system needs to serve the disadvantaged and better account for special cases with extra hardship.", "It would be preferable to expand the Canada Pension Plan instead of introducing the ORPP. The ORPP is a second-best option.", "We did also hear from the other side of the pension debate. I know we hear the same arguments from our PC colleagues. We’ve heard that rather than establish the ORPP, it would likely be more effective to encourage workers to pay down debt or increase their personal savings. We also have heard that the government would be better off by prioritizing financial literacy for Ontarians possibly through the provincial curriculum.", "While it’s interesting to hear all of the different perspectives on the issue of retirement security, I would ask: How can we afford not to have a pension plan and retirement security for those who are struggling with the burden of existing in this province right now? More than hydro—and I’m more than happy to talk about hydro, if you like—we have those struggling with student debt and barely, if at all, affordable childcare and housing. We recognize that life in Ontario is very expensive and challenging. But imagine that retirement if there aren’t safeguards in place, if people don’t have predictable income streams into their retirement. Imagine the burden on them and how little they will be able to contribute financially and personally in their local economy and in their communities.", "If public hearings are where we listen and learn from the experts and stakeholders about what we need to do to improve legislation, clause-by-clause consideration is where we turn those lessons into law, or at least that is how it’s supposed to work, though that may only apply during a minority government. Instead, what we saw was a package of amendments from the NDP and the Conservatives voted down one after the other after the other after the other—minus one PC amendment—because apparently the bill, and this may surprise you, was nearly perfect as it was.", "I will also note that no amendments were proposed by the Liberal government, even after travelling consultations and multiple days of public hearings." ],

It is also imperative that the plan more than just build on the Canada Pension Plan and it is actually designed to be easily integrated as well.", "Speaker, I know that our primary concern as members of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario is to look out for Ontarians, but as Canadian public servants, we sometimes need to expand our scope. All Canadians deserve the right to security in retirement. There is no better way to ensure that than through an expansion of the CPP. We want to make sure that the ORPP helps, not hurts, the likelihood of such an expansion.

Rather than following in the footsteps of the numerous other very successful large public pension plans in our province which have all been designed to benefit their plan members and their plan members alone, this government has made public statements about the ORPP being a large new pool of capital that could be utilized to fund large-scale transit investment.", "According to the 2014 budget, in the section entitled “Unlocking Value from Government Assets,” the government presents the following:", "“By unlocking value from its assets and encouraging more Ontarians to save through a proposed new Ontario Retirement Pension Plan, new pools of capital would be available for Ontario-based projects such as building roads, bridges and new transit. Our strong alternative financing and procurement model, run by Infrastructure Ontario, will allow for the efficient deployment of this capital in job-creating projects.”", "Speaker, there is nothing wrong with pension plans investing in infrastructure projects, but only when that decision has been made by an independent body with only the interests of pensioners, not voters, in mind. This is a concern I highlighted the last time I had the opportunity to rise in the Legislature to discuss this bill, and it is one that returned when the government voted against this amendment in committee.", "Pension plans operate with the sole objective of delivering a secure retirement for their members, and this sort of language from the government leads us to believe that they are less concerned with this principle than the dozen other holes they have dug for themselves. We want guarantees that this pension pool will be further away than arm’s length. This money is for retirement security and retirement future, not for bankrolling more dysfunctional public-private partnership boondoggles or for sinking into more scandals.", "This government is notorious for throwing good money after bad. This pension plan must be stronger than gold-plated; it needs to be steel-walled against political sticky fingers. Guarantee that for the people of Ontario, please.", "I’m going to read the third amendment that the NDP proposed at clause-by-clause consideration:", "“I move that subsection 3(2) of the bill be amended by striking out paragraph 3.”", "Let me tell you a little bit about paragraph 3. Paragraph 3 of subsection 3(2) currently reads as follows:", "“Information necessary to determine whether an employer provides a pension plan or other retirement savings plan to its employees employed in Ontario and, if so, which employees participate in the plan, the nature and level of the benefits provided by the plan and the contribution rates under the plan.”", "The reason for this proposed amendment is because there would be no need to go through the extensive hassle of collecting this sort of information if the plan was universal like the CPP. By adding this step to the process, the government is forced to incur other costs and undergo processes that simply don’t need to happen.", "And this says nothing of all the other benefits of universality that are lost by exempting certain groups from the ORPP.", "Once again, this is another example of a concern that I raised the last time I spoke in the House, but unfortunately it fell on deaf ears. It is a concern we also heard from countless stakeholders during public hearings, but the government opted not to listen to them either. For this, I will return to my comments from February.", "Mr. Speaker, I will refer back to the bill on the basic requirements of the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan schedule to elaborate on this issue.", "In order for an employee to be considered eligible, they must meet the following criteria and any other criteria specified by the not-yet-tabled next piece of legislation:", "“(1) The individual is 18 years of age or older and under 70 years of age.", "“(2) The individual is employed in Ontario and their employment is eligible employment.", "“(3) The individual’s annual salary and wages are above the minimum threshold....", "“(4) The individual is not in receipt of a retirement benefit from the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan.", "“(5) The individual does not participate in a comparable workplace pension plan as determined under the legislation referred to in subsection 1(2) of the act.”", "So let’s look again at that fifth point. To be eligible to contribute and benefit from this progressive and inclusive plan, the individual must not participate in “a comparable workplace pension plan.” What is “comparable”? What will disqualify someone from benefiting from this plan?", "Again, we look back at number 5. “Comparable” is going to be determined under the next piece of legislation. The bad news: We still don’t know what “comparable’” means. The good news: neither does the government—yet. I know that the government is deep in consultation with some of the leading minds in the field of pensions and retirement security. I know because we have been too. There are so many important things to consider. It is at least reassuring that the government hasn’t made any rash decisions.", "While it is still up for discussion, let us explore a few more ideas to consider when we are discussing comparability. What is “comparable”? As New Democrats, we were worried that comparability might be determined on the contribution side rather than the benefit side. While we never got an answer to our repeated inquiries in question period on this matter, we were glad to read in the Liberal discussion paper that defined contribution plans, or DC plans, will not be considered comparable and therefore disqualify their members from benefiting from this Ontario pension plan.", "With the amount of pressure this government will no doubt be under from the banking and insurance lobbies, I know how tempting it might be to reverse that position and do a U-turn. Defined contribution plans, though, are not comparable. They must not be considered as such, no matter how tightly they put the screws to you.", "Another issue with comparability: It says in the schedule that a worker may not “participate in a comparable workplace pension plan.” So my question is this: Are we only talking about plans or are we talking about people? Here’s my point: Some might argue that, as a teacher, my plan would be considered comparable or better, and therefore disqualify me from participating. Some might argue that OMERS, a strong pension plan, also would be considered comparable. That seems to make sense from a plan-to-plan comparison standpoint. However, from a person-to-person point of view, imagine a part-time worker in an OMERS plan. That person would receive a significantly reduced amount compared to a full-time worker contributing to the plan. That reduced amount is not a sufficient amount to live on. Do they deserve to be disqualified from participating in a plan that would allow them to live more securely?", "Also, what about workers who have only paid into comparable plans for a short period of time? Their pension benefit could be a pittance compared to someone else in the plan. I would urge the government to approach this question carefully.", "This is what it looks like from here: It looks like the government is focusing on disqualifying people to reassure the business community that fewer and fewer people will be eligible to participate. I suggested in this Legislature that the focus be on ways to include more and more people. If the goal is to provide more security, then let’s do it. If the goal is to grow the pot of money for the future benefit of working Ontarians, then let more people participate.", "What if a potentially exempted worker wants to pay in, wants to invest in Ontario? Will there be any way to voluntarily opt in? What if a worker who is close to retirement wants to pay more now to benefit more later? Will there be a way to top up and pay in? What if a worker is part-time or recently enrolled in their pension plan and won’t receive sufficient benefit? What added security can you offer them?", "The old adage “The more, the merrier” may not entirely be appropriate, but it worked for our health care system, which was once universal and proud and strong. Since, it has been reduced, undermined and chipped away at by the federal and provincial governments. It is the average individual in Ontario who is paying the price.", "There is an opportunity here. The government should not be so quick to dismiss the arguments for universality. The logistics and administrative nightmare of tracking even one individual through their career of varied employment—eligible, ineligible, comparable, not comparable, all of that—should be factored in. However, as I have said, the call from those interested in pensions is that this plan must mirror the CPP to the greatest extent possible. If it doesn’t, rather than providing retirement security for more people it might undermine the goal of expanding the CPP for all Canadians. This can’t happen.", "We concede that there are tricky details to be figured out, but starting at a place that is the most inclusive seems to be a good place to start. Everyone deserves the opportunity to live with dignity and security in their retirement. Perhaps the government might consider that everyone deserves the opportunity to participate and benefit in a plan that will ensure that security.", "On this topic, I would also like to refer to a question I submitted on the order paper on November 18. The question was this: “Will the Associate Minister of Finance responsible for the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan clarify whether PRPPs will be considered comparable and will employees of employers enrolled in PRPPs be exempted from the automatic enrollment provisions of the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan?”", "It took a while, but we eventually received a response from the government sometime in March. I will read their response here now:", "“On December 8, 2014, Ontario introduced the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Act, 2014, that would, if passed, create a framework for the establishment of the ORPP and commit the government to establishing the plan by January 1, 2017.", "“On December 17, 2014, the government released a discussion paper that set out its preferred approach on key design features of the ORPP, including the definition of a comparable plan.", "“As stated in the discussion paper, the preferred approach is to define comparable plans as defined benefit (DB) and target benefit (TB) multi-employer pension plans (MEPPs) as these plans closely align with the key features of the ORPP and the CPP.", "“The government recognizes that voluntary savings mechanisms like PRPPs will also play an important role in strengthening the retirement income system. As the minister has previously stated, our current view is that these vehicles are complementary and will not be considered comparable.", "“The government is currently reviewing submissions from the consultation process. Final decisions on this and other key design features will be outlined in the future.” It is signed by our Associate Minister of Finance.", "Just to revisit: As it says in the letter “currently,” we want a commitment. We know the government brought this bill forward to appease their friends on Bay Street. We know it is being given a head start of at least a few years and that insurance companies will have just enough time to entice employers with no-contribution piggy banks for their employees, whose personal contributions will grow a huge profitable product that will benefit industry, rather than dignity in retirement.", "As you can see, the government, as usual, has been rather careful with their language. In more ways than I can count, they leave their position open-ended and downright malleable. This is not to say that we expect the government to have all of the details of the ORPP set and ready right at this moment. But this is not a logistical question. It is a question of intentions. It is a question of priorities. It is a question of whether the government is more concerned with making the plan as strong as possible or making their friends on Bay Street as happy as possible.", "If this government wanted to give pension security a real chance, they would have waited to introduce these profit plans. I guess it comes down to priorities. It is disappointing that, time and time again, we see this government cater to their rich and powerful partners rather than real, hard-working, often struggling neighbours, families and constituents. It should be individuals who benefit financially, not only the financial industry.", "We will continue to hold the government to account so that these sorts of concessions are not made and so that Ontarians receive the most progressive plan possible going forward.", "I’d be happy to also share amendment number 4 from the clause-by-clause consideration: “I move that section 1 of the schedule to the bill be amended by adding the following subsection:", "“‘Defined benefit plan", "“‘(8) The Ontario Retirement Pension Plan shall be a defined benefit plan.’”", "This was another symbolic amendment. It is another chance to highlight to the government the reason why we favour defined benefit pension plans over defined contribution plans. There are many ways to invest money in this province. If you have money to invest you have options, and more soon with the PRPP legislation.", "There are many defined contribution or DC plans that are offered by different employers. DC plans come in many shapes and sizes. Many people are familiar with group RRSPs, as one example. Defined contribution plans are based on the contribution—how much someone puts in. The benefit that is paid out at retirement is not guaranteed. It is subject to the will of the market. If the market plunges, so too does the benefit.", "Defined benefit plans deliver a benefit to retirees based on a defined and guaranteed benefit. The benefit is secure and predictable. People can participate in their economic community freely when they trust what they have coming in. Defined contribution plans are insufficient in terms of providing for pensioners, and they are more costly to the system in the long term.", "The shift from defined benefit to defined contribution is turning out to have been a short-sighted, corporate-driven, costly shift. DC plans are easier for employers, on the paperwork side of things, and shift the risk to employers. DC plans are tidier numbers to report to shareholders. As reports like HOOPP’s Shifting Public Sector DB Plans to DC state, “If the motivation for a conversion to DC is to reduce costs, then it should be noted that shifting to DC actually increases the cost of delivering a comparable ... benefit.”", "Come to light, we are seeing the benefit—pardon the pun—in prioritizing DB plans over DC plans. Our hope is that the government will take counsel from those who are writing the reports and who actually, and actuarially, know about designing pensions.", "The fifth amendment that we put forward at clause-by-clause was: “I move that subsection 2(1) of the schedule to the bill be struck out and the following substituted:", "“‘Eligibility under the plan....", "“‘(1) An eligible employee is an individual who is employed in Ontario in pensionable employment within the meaning of the Canada Pension Plan.’” This is another amendment that was intended to focus the government on the need for the ORPP to mirror the Canada Pension Plan. The CPP is tried, tested and true, and while we accept that the current federal government is unwilling to move forward with CPP enhancements, we want to ensure that the ORPP will be easily integrated into the CPP when a new government comes along.", "In 1965, the Canada Pension Plan was first established on a single, simple principle: being a senior should not be the greatest indicator that an individual is living in poverty. It is from that initial belief that one of our country’s largest, most inclusive social programs was born. It is because of that same principle that we are all here today discussing pensions. At the end of the day, all Ontarians, all Canadians and all people deserve the right to retire with dignity.", "Too often we are told that pension plans are a luxury or they are a thing of the past, but retirement security is not a luxury; it is a necessity. The Canada Pension Plan continues to prove that collective retirement security can be delivered in an efficient, effective and reliable manner.", "Life doesn’t stop at retirement. The CPP was created on the principle that it is beneficial to all of us when our friends and our neighbours aren’t struggling and can continue to contribute to the economy after they retire. Unfortunately, though, as the world has changed around us, the benefit provided by the CPP has become insufficient. The maximum yearly benefit is $12,500, and the average senior ends up receiving less than $7,000 per year from the Canada Pension Plan.", "It remains our steadfast belief, as the government maintains as well, that the ideal way to solve the retirement security crisis is through an enhancement of the CPP. It is the simplest solution for the greatest number of people, and it would permit a number of efficiencies and securities that can only be provided on a national scale. It is too bad that our Prime Minister does not see it the same way. With CPP expansion currently off the federal table, we are left to explore other options, but I remind the government not to forget our shared belief that increasing the CPP is the ideal option. As they continue to roll out the design of the ORPP, I hope they will ensure that the plan can be easily integrated in the event of future CPP expansion.", "Mr. Speaker, I am glad that I am the critic for pensions. I am glad that I get to use my voice to call on this government to ensure that as many Ontarians as possible have security in their retirement. I have given a one-hour lead already on Bill 56. As I said, here I am again speaking for an hour on a bill that is the first of three to set forth a new social program, a new Ontario Retirement Pension Plan. I am speaking on a bill that has been through committee; however, I am speaking on a bill that, unfortunately, remains almost entirely unchanged and not strengthened by that process.", "It is terribly disappointing that this government gave little thought to the amendments put forward on behalf of stakeholders. It was actually a very patronizing process. Stakeholders were invited to participate, but ultimately, it would seem that their voices, their expertise, their investment, their insight was irrelevant and, I would say, largely unwelcome and certainly unheeded.", "As we saw in the budget, as a result of extensive input and consultation, the government is committing to further input and consultation. What a sham of a process. What a sham, and what a shame.", "Speaker, since nothing from committee hearings, minus a single PC amendment, made it into this new and almost entirely unchanged bill, I’d like to take this opportunity to further share some of what was shared in committee. During clause-by-clause, as I just mentioned, the NDP put forward amendments calling for more to be able to participate in this pension. We put forward amendments that would prioritize universal benefit rather than exemptions. At this early stage of decisions, where details have yet to be determined, why the priority to rule people out rather than allow them in?", "Sadly, as we saw in the budget, this government is concocting new ways to minimize the benefit of this proposed plan, privatizing and capitalizing on the service delivery. Speaker, if I may read to you from the recent budget: “One of the government’s initial implementation priorities is to identify potential providers that could help deliver a simple, reliable and cost-effective pension service-delivery system for the ORPP. At this time, the government is assessing a range of service-delivery options for pension administration. As part of this process, the province is proceeding with a procurement to identify potential third-party service-delivery providers for the ORPP. Costs of administering the ORPP would be borne by the plan.”", "The more money in the pool, the greater the benefit to pensioners and all the more retirement security across our communities: That should be the fundamental goal of creating this pension plan. I’m progressive. I’m a huge fan of pensions, and I will stand here in enthusiastic support of a progressive pension that will strengthen retirement security across the province. But you are wildly misguided if you think we will support any unscrupulous privatization of a public pension.", "It is interesting that, after the consultation process, the introduction and discussion of this bill at first and second readings, the consultation paper, public hearings and clause-by-clause consideration, the first reference we hear about a P3 delivery model of the ORPP is a single paragraph on page 149 of the budget. But I guess that’s what we have learned to expect from this government.", "Speaker, we’ve gone through eHealth, we’ve gone through Ornge and we know from the Auditor General’s own report in December that this government has wasted over $8 billion on public-private partnerships. Now the government wants to open the door to another with the ORPP. Occasionally, the Liberal government actually agrees with us on things, but a P3 delivery model is not going to be one of them.", "I would, however, like to read to you from Hansard, Mr. Speaker, a few highlights from clause-by-clause of the bill in committee and instances where we did agree.", "As I had said, “We hope that this plan, and any pension, is going to be worthwhile in terms of benefit.” And the member from Etobicoke North said, “I would salute the NDP voice of reason.” I appreciated that, incidentally." ],

We recognize that, right now, businesses and individuals are immensely challenged by the hydro situation. It is another chance to remind the government that perhaps we should take a closer look at fixing those problems rather than sweeping them under the rug of privatization. “Hide and sell” really isn’t the NDP way. We would encourage you to hold on, and let’s give Ontarians a fair shot at being able to afford their hydro bills. No one is surprised that this Liberal government has kept Ontarians in the dark, but it is a surprise that they would like Ontarians to live in the dark, which is pretty likely once no one can afford to keep their lights on. But I digress.", "During clause-by-clause I heard from my PC colleague that we’re all “in the same boat.” I’ll speak about what I know in terms of my riding.

We heard so many anti-pension groups and the PCs citing this stat from a McKinsey study.", "It was an interesting number, because if I recall correctly—and don’t quote me on this—it was 87% who are on track to at least maintain their current standard of living. I think that begs the question: For some of those who are currently on track to maintain their current standard of living, is that standard of living enough to sustain them in their retirement? Does that include households that are currently struggling? Does that include those who are in barely affordable accommodation?", "It’s an interesting number, and quite frankly, I think that all of us are manipulating it. But I think that when we look around our communities, if we’re talking about equity and households and their readiness, equity and homeownership—they’re wonderful things. Many of my constituents would love to be able to afford to have a home right now, but right now they’re looking for affordable housing. They’re looking for affordable child care. They’re looking to be able to afford transit to maybe get to a job that they might be able to secure.", "We also heard during clause-by-clause from the PCs, “Let’s show people how to save.” I would argue that many of those individuals who are struggling to get by and are somehow managing to make ends meet, but aren’t able to save for retirement—I would bet that they could probably teach us a thing or two about how to stretch a dollar and manage.", "I think that if we can remember that as the government is designing this ORPP, it really needs to benefit the most people in the most progressive and predictable way—again, back to including more, not kicking them out of the program. There are going to be challenges—we know that—with any new change, but we do want the most people to benefit in the long term in Ontario. If we can work towards that, I think that that should be the goal.", "While we are talking about retirement security, I would also like to talk about pension security for few brief moments. As I said before, retirement security isn’t just about promising a benefit; it is about ensuring that benefit is delivered. It should also be noted that the entire purpose of the ORPP is to supplement retirement savings, not replace them entirely. That means that there must be a strong pension system in place already, one with regulations that protect pensioners first and foremost.", "It is important to note that the ORPP will not solve all of the problems that ail the pension system in Ontario. As we work to address the retirement security crisis in this province and acknowledge the need for proactive solutions, we must also address the existing gaps in our system if we want to make the most significant possible change.", "It’s important to add new tools for delivering security in retirement, but that doesn’t mean that we can ignore the problems that are right in front of us. We need to work within the existing system as well to ensure that it is operating effectively and reliably.", "Today, two thirds of workers in Ontario do not have a workplace pension. Those that do can’t always rely that their pension will be there when they retire. According to December’s Auditor General report, 92% of all defined benefit pension plans in Ontario were underfunded at the start of this year. Over the past eight years, the total amount of underfunding of these plans grew from $22 billion to $75 billion. This is not an insignificant problem.", "The fact is, we have a retirement security crisis in Ontario. Part of the reason for that crisis is that Ontarians don’t feel secure that their pension will be there when they retire. Every day, my office hears from constituents that are concerned about the security of their pensions. Their retirement plan is based on the belief that their pension, something they have contributed to their entire working lives, will be there when they retire. But as that date approaches, that assumption appears less and less certain.", "This is a sentiment, I’m sure, that all of you have heard in your constituencies across the province. Stories from the not-too-distant past, such as Nortel or Algoma Steel, and stories that are still playing out in front of us, such as US Steel in Hamilton: They continue to remind us of the need for reform.", "The ORPP will provide a necessary supplement to the existing pension system, but that does not excuse the government from its obligations to effectively regulate workplace pensions.", "No plan is foolproof, Mr. Speaker, and there are always unforeseen bumps in the road. There need to be fail-safes built into the system to ensure that if the parachute doesn’t open, there is still something in place to cushion the fall. In the Ontario pension system, this comes in the form of the Pension Benefits Guarantee Fund, or PBGF. The PBGF was established in 1980 to ensure that when a company goes under and a pension plan is wound up, pensioners aren’t left bearing the full brunt of the impact. Under the current system, the PBGF will cover up to $1,000 per month in lost benefits for a worker. Unfortunately, as we’ve seen in the Nortel and Algoma Steel examples, sometimes $1,000 per month is not a sufficient safety net.", "For workers, this means instability, it means insecurity and it just doesn’t cut it. Often the $1,000 benefit guarantee is enough, but for a worker whose monthly benefit has been reduced, for example, by $2,000, the inadequacy of the guarantee can mean the difference between security and having to choose between paying their mortgage or their child’s tuition.", "Twice, my colleague from Hamilton East–Stoney Creek has put forward a private member’s bill calling on the government to increase the benefit under the PBGF to $2,500 per month, and twice, the bill has stalled. For a government that is trying to show support for retirement security, this seems like a pretty simple way to show it. As I stated earlier, retirement security isn’t just about promising a benefit; it is also about ensuring that that benefit is delivered.", "I should also note that my colleague from Hamilton East–Stoney Creek and I aren’t the only ones calling for this change. Harry Arthurs, the expert your government enlisted to review the state of the pension system in Ontario, first called for an enhancement of the Pension Benefits Guarantee Fund in his 2008 report. As Mr. Arthurs noted in 2008, increasing the protected benefit to $2,500 per month would simply reflect the effect of inflation on the original $1,000 benefit. Seven years later, that number needs to be reviewed again.", "While the government continues to develop the new Ontario Retirement Pension Plan, I ask that it also review the recommendations made by the Auditor General in her December report and the recommendations made by Harry Arthurs in his report in 2008. It may not be the exciting story that you’re looking for, but it is an important part of the bigger picture that you can’t continue to ignore.", "Mr. Speaker, as I said in December and said in February, I have appreciated having the opportunity to speak to this bill, but I look forward to the next one, which hopefully will have some substantive details. We hope those details are progressive, we hope they serve to benefit the greatest number of Ontarians, and we hope it is the interests of those Ontarians, and their interests alone, that are served by the final version of the design.", "As you know, New Democrats have always been strong supporters of public defined benefit pension plans, and strong supporters of a strong public consultation process. This is a great example of when public consultations have spoken strongly in support of public defined benefit pensions. But it appears that the government was not listening during that process and believed that the conclusions they had already come to were infallible. From a lot of the stunts we have seen this government pull, it appears that they might think they are infallible in general, but Ontarians are not so easily fooled. Disregard of public interest will catch up to you.", "We are asking for the government to try to redeem itself, to put its best foot forward on this bill and design a strong, progressive public plan. All Ontarians deserve the right to retire with security, so let’s make sure that we give them the right plan to do so. Thank you very much." ],

I have brought forth twice the Pension Benefits Guarantee Fund increase, which was shot down by the present government and the opposition party.", "The reason I did that was that in 1980, when this was brought in, when a person retired their pension could be anywhere from $700 to $1,500, so it was reasonable. But with most people who are retiring out of major manufacturing companies in a unionized atmosphere, their pensions are anywhere up to $3,000 or better now. A thousand dollars falls quite short of what they would need when a company leaves Canada, absconds, goes back to the States, attacks their pension plan and attacks their benefits. That’s what happens. So they end up with 30% of what they had, which was deferred wages, which they had negotiated over the years in their contracts to have some kind of protection when they retired. It’s almost fraudulent, what’s been going on with these companies not living up to their pension commitments.", "Also, what’s missing in this ORPP plan—there are a lot of things missing which in my original plan would have been a lot different. What does a person who’s in their fifties or early sixties do when they retire? Because this will do absolutely nothing for them. It’s absolutely useless to them. Now, if they were able to buy credits, if they were able to take their 1% RRSPs which are doing nothing and buy credits back into the pension plan, to take them back to age 30, 35 or 25—wherever they would get a benefit—they would end up with $600 or $700 or $800 a month, which would be tangible and feasible. It’s something they could put their hands on so they may hang on to their house or be able to pay their hydro bill and all the other bills. None of that was dealt with in here.", "I sat down with Harry Arthurs. He came and talked to me because of my experience in pensions from years ago, when I went to Ottawa and lobbied on pensions. He came, and we had long discussions—two and three hours—and Harry and I kind of picked each other’s brains. He had a lot of my suggestions in the bill that he put forward for this government, and a lot of those things did not show up. That’s unfortunate." ],

Speaker, I can remember very clearly back to 2008, when the greatest recession since the Great Depression started to take hold in Ontario and, obviously, right around the globe. I remember very clearly, as well, the remarks that were being made at that time from the federal level, public comments that were characterizing what was going on in 2008 as a good buying opportunity. People’s pension plans, life savings and investments were going down the drain overnight, their retirement income security was being wiped out, and the federal government was publicly talking about there being good buying opportunities for people out there.", "Now, they did eventually come around and take a different approach in terms of supporting the auto industry, like we had already begun to do. The point, Speaker, is that it was way back then—fully six and seven years ago—when as a government we first began asking the federal government to take what seemed like a practical and pragmatic approach to enhance the CPP. This didn’t just start six months ago or a year and a half ago with us, in the last election as part of our platform. We began advocating on this with the federal government and asked them to use the vehicle that already existed, to enhance the CPP. Over four, six, seven years the federal government has consistently decided that they do not want to do that. That’s their choice, but let’s be clear: We’ve been doing that for six or seven years. This didn’t just start now. It makes sense that that should be the vehicle. They’ve decided they won’t do it, hence the legislation here before us today.", "I would say to my friends in the official opposition that when you characterize this as a tax and that’s why you won’t do it, I guess to you then the CPP is a tax as well.

I contacted many of my constituents about your plan on January 5, 2015; I notified them of your government’s public discussion period and provided information on how they could participate.", "“The response toward your plan that we received was universally negative.

No doubt you would have heard such questions if your discussion had included the ‘broad range of perspectives’ you say you are interested in hearing.

Our employees value their current workplace plan and have expressed their concern at the notion of having to save in a new plan. Moreover, at a time of economic fragility, the ORPP would cut into wages and employee benefits in Ontario, and businesses’ ability to sustain employment and invest in new growth. It would weaken Ontario’s competitiveness, and may incent some businesses to focus on job creation and investment outside our communities and province rather than here.", "“I reiterate the importance of exempting organizations such as ours from mandatory participation in the ORPP.

I cannot fathom reasoning for even considering such a plan. At a time when the manufacturing sector of Ontario is under siege I cannot imagine why we’re considering legislation that will impose further overhead cost onto businesses and particularly manufacturers. It is bad enough that we have the amount of union-negotiated labour rates that make us uncompetitive and the imposition of tremendous amounts of legislative reporting; now we’re imposing a backhanded tax that is viewed by many as a method for the current provincial government to obtain additional cash flow so as to internally fund the rampant spending, inefficiency and waste that we now, and have for several years, witnessed. If the government is 10 times as efficient in administering this retirement pension plan as they have been with our tax dollars over the last decade or so, the poor workers who have had their paycheque further reduced by pension deductions, believing that they will have additional pension income in the future, will be sadly and sorely disappointed.", "“In my limited number of discussions with representatives of companies, both domestic and international alike, there is not an overall air of confidence about the economy in Ontario and in the legislative/administrative trend of our current government.”", "That’s signed by Bill Nelson, broker of record for Coldwell Banker realty in Mount Forest.", "Speaker, I know that there have been all kinds of cautions by our caucus on this type of legislation, expressing the concern that this is a job killer, and expressing concern that it’s just another tax that this government is implementing on workers in Ontario to feed their appetite for more money all the time. Yet we see a government that is not willing to manage the money they have coming in. Our debt keeps going up, and this government keeps asking for more and more money all the time. That’s what we think this is; in fact, what I know it is.", "I also have a letter from a constituent of mine. It’s from a small bus company owner, John Chapman, of Newry Coach Lines. I might add that it’s a small school bus line that he’s fighting to save because of this government’s RFP program that has put countless bus owners out of jobs because of its failed process.", "He writes: “I am opposed to the creation of this new Ontario pension plan for a host of reasons. The most significant of my reasons for opposition to this plan is, with the rocky economic times that Ontario is in, why would the government encumber businesses with a 1.9% payroll tax. In actual fact that is all this amounts to. Also, with so many workers in Ontario working for minimum wage jobs, why would this government take 1.9% of their wages when the majority need the money to pay their ridiculous hydro bills?”", "Right on the mark.", "“I am also opposed because I do not recall Ontario becoming a ‘granny’ province where Big Brother knows best. The people of this great province have more than enough faculties to make decisions regarding their own retirement and how they plan to fund it. If the argument regarding this point is that the poor do not have the means to fund their retirement then I propose a different solution. Instead of just issuing social assistance cheques that get cashed at the Beer Store or the local convenience store, issue vouchers for food, heat and hydro and leave the people some of their social assistance funds for retirement instead of” what they’re buying at these stores." ],

Let the businesses of Ontario be competitive in the marketplace without any additional taxes. Lastly, quit trying to be in business when clearly no one at Queen’s Park has any idea how to compete in the private sector.”", "These are pretty strong words, but that just emphasizes the frustration that businesses have with this government. How many businesses have left Ontario in the last number of years? Quite a few. And as I believe was mentioned previously, some of these pensions they’ve taken with them—because they’ve left Ontario because we’re not competitive anymore. And you people aren’t listening; your government isn’t listening.", "Our hydro rates are uncompetitive. That’s forcing these businesses out. Certainly, we have letters all the time in our riding office about ordinary people not being able to pay their hydro bills. Wouldn’t it be nice if we were competitive with energy rates in this province so that people would have some more money to save? Isn’t that a novel idea? That’s what people want to do: They want to save their money. But every month, when they get their hydro bills, they keep going up and up and up. In fact, I believe there are more increases coming this year, as the energy minister has stated previously.", "The government’s solution to this is to add another cost to business, and also another cost to the people of Ontario. Why don’t they look at what they’re doing now and try to manage it better? That’s what a business would do. If a business is having an issue with making money or staying afloat, they will look at what they’re doing and try to introduce some things that may work better in their businesses. They just don’t add costs, because it just won’t work. This is something this government has an issue with.", "I’m not going to read this whole letter—it’s quite lengthy—but it’s from a fellow in the riding. He runs a couple of restaurants, and he has much the same story. If he has to start paying for this bill, it’s going to cut his profitability down. Also, the other part of it is that it’s going to take money out of his employees’ pockets, which certainly is not going to help them.", "Again, if the minister had let us know about this meeting, or even if she didn’t want me there, if she had notified the businesses in Perth–Wellington that she was coming—instead of the day before—she would have heard all this. She would have heard this side of the story. Unfortunately, she didn’t do that.", "It’s quite depressing when these things happen around Ontario, because the government wants “openness” and “transparency”—those are a couple of words they’ve been throwing around here all the time—and yet when this happens, we certainly don’t see it, and people in my riding don’t see it.", "I wrote this letter a couple of months ago. I have the invitation here that was supposed to have been sent out; it only got sent out to a couple of people. There is no answer from the associate minister as to this letter here in more than two months.", "I would suggest that the associate minister doesn’t have a plan. There’s no plan here. But how can you devise an effective plan if you don’t listen to all sides of the story? They don’t want to do that. They don’t want to do that, because their whole issue here, their whole game plan here, is to have more money come in. That’s it. That’s all it is. Really, I would think that anybody who’s going to benefit from this pension plan years down the road is going to have to have a real worry about whether there is going to be any money there, because of this government’s spending habits.", "Certainly, there needs to be more consultation on this, and they have to start listening to those such as the people that sent in the letters to me. They have to start listening to those people, because they haven’t been doing it in the past and it doesn’t look like they’re going to do it in the future. They’re putting in too many roadblocks for businesses in Ontario to succeed. If businesses succeed, their employees succeed. This is something that this government, for some reason, just can’t understand." ],

This is from the Auditor General, who we, of course, put great faith in. She says, “FSCO has limited powers to deal with administrators of severely underfunded pension plans....” In fact, she goes on to say, “FSCO’s federal counterpart has legal authority to terminate a plan, appoint a plan administrator or act as an administrator, while FSCO can only prosecute an administrator ... after it orders the windup of a plan.”", "Interestingly enough, there’s a piece of legislation which FSCO has been asking for for some time, and this government could put it in place." ],

They didn’t elect a Liberal there; they elected a Conservative. Naturally he’s going to be canvassing those people in his riding and many questions have come forward from his constituents. He probably is looking for answers to give his constituents both for and against the pension plan, and this government has ignored him.

We’ve got to make sure they’re okay.”", "Speaker, 74% of the people in this province don’t have the money to retire. Do you think that’s going to change? Do you think they’re not going to need help? Yes, I would have loved to see the CPP enhanced; that would probably have stopped this project, but it didn’t happen. We’ve been after them for years to enhance CPP. The money is there but they don’t do it because they want to use it for other things. That’s what the bottom line is. In EI, there’s lots of money there that they’re moving to other efforts.

They can’t even afford their hydro bills. They can’t afford food. Where do they think they’re going to save money if there’s not an alternative way of doing it? I commend the government for moving ahead with this. However, I wouldn’t have done it exactly this way. I had other things I would have liked to have seen, like buy-back credits so all people could participate, not just the people at 25 and 30 years old who will eventually benefit from this. The ones in their fifties and sixties won’t at this point.

This has been a long-standing issue. I share the concerns of the party across the aisle that the federal government, certainly under Mr. Harper, has not been receptive in any way, shape or form to broadening the conversation around expanding the CPP. There is already a built-in administrative model there that actually is operating very well, but it needs to be modernized; it needs to be updated. In the face of that lack of leadership, I would say, from the federal level of government, I think that it is incumbent upon us to do something here in the province of Ontario.", "I’m actually proud that this bill builds on some of the ideas that we had brought forward in previous Legislatures, but there are some concerns as this piece of legislation moves through. I know that there are several design models of it and three different pieces of legislation that will come forward. But anyway, we’re pleased to support this bill in principle, and we look forward to seeing how it could be strengthened, although we did try at committee and that was not received very well, which I think is unfortunate. Everybody who was participating in that debate was trying to make this legislation stronger and improve it through the legislative process.

That receptive feeling and that working in a more collaborative model, if you will, was very much present, I feel, in the minority government setting, and it’s just not here anymore. In fact, we were able to actually move a lot of great things forward during those budget processes. We certainly tried for auto insurance; we tried really hard. Unfortunately, that side of the House chose not to honour those commitments. But I guess if you get some snow tires now, you’re good to go, maybe literally and figuratively.", "Specifically, though, as I mentioned, the ORPP legislation largely mirrors the Ontario retirement plan that we brought forward in 2010. As we all know, two thirds of Ontarians do not have a workplace pension. Certainly, as the finance and the Treasury Board critic, you certainly give me lots of opportunities to criticize, but I can’t help but be reminded of this on a daily basis by countless emails and phone calls that I receive from constituents. I think some of those concerns have already been fairly articulated.", "People in the province of Ontario are obviously having a hard time finding work. They’re having a hard time finding affordable housing. Transit costs have gone up. Education—post-secondary and college—has gone up. Some of those doors which should be open so that we can actually follow through on this vision of a shared prosperity actually might be realized.", "Since I’ve been here—two and a half, almost three years coming up in September—the intensity of the concerns that I hear from constituents on the affordability of life and the ability to actually save, as I mentioned in my two minutes, is very much connected to the nature of work in the province of Ontario.", "It’s worth noting that in the 2015 budget, the government came forward and basically showed in a table that they over-predicted that they would create 67,000 more jobs in the province of Ontario. That’s very much connected, I think, to the cost of energy, to some taxation burdens that people face and that the government has not recognized the cost of living, quite honestly.", "But that 67,000 jobs that they predicted they would create in the province of Ontario—I mean, it kind of just proves that they’re just as bad at predicting job creation as the former leader of the PC caucus. But that’s very much connected to the revenue that is supposed to be coming into this place, and it’s very unfortunate. But you can’t blame people for not saving for a retirement plan when they can’t find a job. The two obviously go hand in hand.", "I can’t help but look at the ORPP Act from this lens: It is around closing the growing inequality gap in the province of Ontario, which has costs attached to it. Those are health care costs. Those are justice costs. I would love to see and I would love to be able to support a piece of legislation that actually is going to close that gap.", "As we know, there are too many Ontarians with insufficient workplace pensions, struggling to make ends meet once they retire. As I mentioned, the Auditor General had identified in her annual report, which I continually bring up, that the issue around pensions is a growing issue in the province of Ontario. She made a point of putting it through in her December 9 report that was made public: “The underfunding of defined-benefit pension plans in Ontario has become significantly worse over the past decade, and the Financial Services Commission of Ontario (FSCO) should more effectively monitor these plans.”", "It’s worth noting that “as of December 31, 2013, 92% of Ontario’s defined-benefit pension plans were underfunded; in other words, they would not have enough funds to pay full pensions to their members if they were wound up immediately. This is a huge risk to the millions of members of those plans and their families.”", "Certainly there are ways that the government can actually strengthen FSCO, because FSCO has limited powers to deal with administrators of severely underfunded pension plans or those who do not administer plans in compliance with the Pension Benefits Act.", "The significant finding is that “FSCO’s federal counterpart has legal authority to terminate a plan.” The Ontario version does not.", "It’s also uncertain “whether FSCO’s Pension Benefits Guarantee Fund, designed to protect members and beneficiaries of single-employer defined-benefit pension plans in the event of employer insolvency, is itself sustainable.” This came up at committee. This is something that is a long-standing issue. In fact, it’s a growing issue. It’s not a surprise issue, like the sudden surprise around infrastructure in the province of Ontario. The Auditor General has raised the flag on these pension plans, and those are key issues of value for money and service delivery highlighted by the Auditor General.", "But it is up to us in this House—and we have the capacity to make legislation stronger—to ensure that we have a progressive, defined-benefit public pension plan that ensures our seniors can retire and live with dignity. The only way to do this is through a publicly funded, defined-benefit pension plan, and it’s imperative to ensure that this is the norm. We have the opportunity to build something that will serve and protect all workers at all stages of their careers, be it young people entering the workforce, mid-career professionals or those near retirement. But I have to tell you that the key piece to this is governance.", "Earlier today, I had the pleasure of having a finance briefing by the very committed people from finance. I think almost 32 of them came in. We went through all the schedules of the bill that we had questions about. And of course we had questions about the ORPP. I think the member from Oshawa really highlighted where our concerns were coming from. You’ll notice on page 149 of the 2015 budget: “At this time, the government is assessing a range of service delivery options for pension administration. As part of this process, the province is proceeding with a procurement to identify potential third-party service delivery providers for the ORPP. Costs of administering the ORPP would be borne by the plan.”", "This is the first time, really, that we heard of this third party and this procurement process to get an administration in. But we do know that it will be called the administration corporation. These were questions that we had for the financial staff, all of whom, in their own right, I think care deeply about getting this right. It is worth noting that this administration corporation would not be subject to the Corporations Information Act. And—this is really interesting—there’s no explicit mention of minimizing investment risk in its mandate. So in order for this to be successful, there has to be some understanding around risk management.", "It’s also worth noting, under schedule 10, that an act of an officer is valid despite any irregularity of his appointment or defect in his qualifications. That’s the same as CPPIB for directors but not officers. So the board of directors, under schedule 18, can set the recommended remuneration framework for directors. Directors are going to be able to set their own remuneration on this administration board. I think that should cause some concern. It’s right here that people who are sitting on a board get to set their own pay. Yes, especially because it’s money that can actually be going back into the pension plan. But it is worth noting that the money collected and received is not public money, and if the money is invested, the increase in value is not public money.", "We were just trying to navigate through what seems to me a very haphazard sort of effort to create this new corporation. I think that, going forward, there are a lot of questions out there about this. I mentioned in my original comments on the legislation that when I was knocking on doors during the election, there were people who said, “I need a pension. I don’t have a pension, I don’t have a job, but I need a pension.” They really do feel that very soon they’re all of a sudden going to get a pension. So that’s a concern.", "Obviously, this budget didn’t disclose a lot of details on the ORPP design, and the government says it’s still considering feedback from its recent consultations. We’ve heard about this consultation process, though, and obviously there’s some concern that not all voices are truly being respected throughout the process.", "As I mentioned, the bill is the first of three pieces of legislation that the government plans to introduce. We’ve already seen two versions of this. Obviously, the concerns that we’ve had along the way have to do with the government’s model, around the integrity of the plan, to make sure that at the end of the day the people who were originally intended to benefit from this plan actually are.", "If you look at some of the examples in other provinces—for instance, this came out just in February, but it was from BC. The headline reads, “Public Sector Salaries: B.C. Investment Management Corp. Dominates Top 10 List Again. Senior investors received pay increases of more than 20% each.", "“Seven of the 10 highest-paid public servants in B.C., including one who made $1.5 million, work for just one agency: the B.C. Investment Management Corp., which invests money on behalf of public sector pension plans.”", "The concern is that whoever this third party is, whoever this new administration corporation is—and we did ask a specific question on this. We wanted to make sure that—well, it was an early question. It’s an early question: Will the salaries and compensation for these investment managers be tied to performance? Because that’s the model in BC, and you can see where the money is going from the fund. It’s going to the top.", "I think that this is actually a recurring theme in the province of Ontario. We have not been able to get this government to look at those upper echelon CEO public sector salaries, which really is incredible because if someone is on ODSP in this province and they make so little money—it’s under $629 a month—but they were allowed to work and make up to $200, this government somehow can figure out if that person has made $215 and that additional $15 gets clawed back. But they can’t figure out how to ensure that a university president, for instance at the University of Western Ontario, can’t get two years’ salary to the tune of $900,000.", "It’s a source of frustration, obviously, because when you follow the money in this province—first of all, it’s not straightforward to follow the money in this place. I think it’s designed that way. When you follow the money, you can see that the people at the top are doing okay, The banks are doing okay. These are concerns for us, and we’ve red-flagged them.", "We also would love for the government to look at ways to actually strengthen the economy and, as I already mentioned, protect pension members.", "I have to go back to the alternative financing and procurement approach by Infrastructure Ontario. In the Auditor General’s report, she referenced that—because this speaks to where the money is going and who has priority status in the province of Ontario. While the goals and the principles of the ORPP we fully support, we are nervous and we have very valid concerns about the mechanisms that this government will employ to ensure that those pensions are actually there for the people who they’re designed to serve.", "The AG, of course, was very critical of the financing—the financial structure, if you will—around infrastructure development. She says: The AFP “approach used by Infrastructure Ontario assumed that the public sector would not have been able to successfully deliver 74 infrastructure projects on time and on budget. Specifically, Infrastructure Ontario’s AFP approach assumes that the risks of cost overruns and delays are about five times higher when the public sector manages infrastructure projects.” However, “the AFP approach assumed that it would be reasonable for taxpayers to incur an estimated $8 billion more (including $6.5 billion in higher financing costs) to have this work done by the private sector on time and on budget.”", "You can see why we are nervous, that in the budget this government is looking to contract out in some variation of that, some design of contracting out, to a corporation to manage the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan. We want to make sure that every dollar that goes into that plan gets to the people who need it most. That’s the relevance around this piece.", "While I’m here, I might as well mention that Infrastructure Ontario’s Loan Program made a higher-risk loan of $216 million to a subsidiary of the MaRS Discovery District, a not-for-profit organization, but the ultimate costs and benefits of the loan are unclear.", "So the due diligence, the fiscal responsibility of designing and managing a plan like the ORPP—you can’t blame us for having doubts about this government’s ability to navigate and to design a plan with the people at the front of the process.", "That said, we support it in principle, but we obviously would love to see the current pension plan structures, the underfunding of the current pension plans—that needs to be addressed. FSCO needs to be strengthened in legislation to protect current pensioners. There is actually a piece of legislation on the books that has already received royal assent. It just needs to be called. There’s no need to do extensive debate on it.", "We are very concerned about the administration corporation of the ORPP and the integrity of that process. We want to make sure that there is some fiscal due diligence. Actually, that was the one amendment that was secured at committee for this piece of legislation. It’s incredibly important.", "I look forward to hearing the responses from my colleagues in the House today. I think we all share the belief that we have to get this right. Even though the PC caucus thinks it’s wrong, we still need to get it right." ],

His insurance company knows he’s retired, so why the heck are they charging him $50 for a wage replacement policy that he cannot possibly ever receive? The government knows this. The government isn’t doing anything to help pensioners in Ontario and retirees in Ontario who have to pay this clause—it’s hidden in there—to get wage replacement when they don’t qualify for wage replacement. Someone is getting ripped off. He says it’s him; he says it’s every pensioner and retiree in Ontario.

I want to remind everybody in this chamber that much of this conversation is about how to improve the lives of Ontarians as they retire, because there’s enough evidence, where I come from in the health care sector, that there’s a relationship between a good pension and the health of a community.

So there’s a strong relationship between health and finance.", "The other piece here is, for the opposition to continue to criticize this particular bill, saying that it’s not properly done, this and that—they have to listen to the evidence, because at the end of the day, there’s research after research.

A good public plan is one that remains in the public domain, because it should be fully not-for-profit.

At the end of the day, when they impose this pension tax on top of the businesses, it’s either they’re going to have to rejig their pension and get rid of it or they’re going to have to lay off people, which is probably more likely going to happen.

They’re still at a $12-billion deficit. Over the next two years their interest payments are going to hit $13 billion.

So it’s not like the other side of the House, where they don’t care about what is going on today. They’re worried about the future down the road but they can’t get their fundamentals right in order to make a better economy down the road. What they’re actually doing is hurting Canada as a whole and hurting the chances of the federal government actually making the changes to the CPP when the economy strengthens. As long as Ontario is weak, Canada is not going to reach its full potential. This government has no plan to make Canada any stronger.", "First of all, this pension that they’re talking about, the Ontario pension plan, is not going to start for a few years anyway, before they start collecting the tax from the people.

That is a fallacy, and the fact is that it’s going to be at least 40 years for help to come. If this government would take its abilities, its ideas, its thoughts and actually work to improve the economy, work to decrease the cost of living for people so that they could have money to put away for pensions on their own and help improve the economy of Canada by making Ontario strong again, then the government would have time to fix the CPP and make the necessary changes down the road, which would only probably take another year or two, but they’re talking about implementing a tax now that’s going to hurt businesses, cause job losses and that’s not going to have any effect for 40 years.", "At the end of the day, we can’t be guaranteed that this money the government is collecting is actually going to be in that pot, because we know they have $130 billion they want to spend on infrastructure and they’re out of money. There’s only one other way to get it and that is to tax the people, move the money around and put an IOU in that bank account at the end of the day, because this government we cannot trust to deal with their money.", "Instead of waiting a few years, this government is going to create a whole new bureaucracy in order to manage this fund, which is another cost factor. Where is that money going to come from to create this bureaucracy and run it? Is it going to come from the 1.9% from the employers and the employees, or is that another tax or another cut somewhere else in another ministry in order to pay for the creation and operation of this bureaucracy? This is just becoming a huge possibility for a scandal, going forward.", "What I think the government should be doing, instead of going down the road of an Ontario pension plan, is in fact looking at ways to improve people’s lives with less cost of living. Lower the cost of living. We’ve seen this government, over the past 13 years, erode the people’s ability to earn money, keep their money and invest in their own pension plans or invest in their businesses, as they grow, so they have that as their pension as they move on and sell off.", "What have we had?

That’s not a tax, in their opinion, but that’s going to hurt business, cost jobs, and at the end of the day, our groceries are going to be higher; our gas is going to be higher.

With a lack of revenue at the provincial level of Hydro One, they’re going to be unable to continue to pay down that debt, so what are they going to do?

They will no longer invest in this province. I have a factory that employs over 700 people in my riding, in St. Thomas. It has been there for a number of years. I’ve got a sister plant, Presstran, right near it. Both are Formet companies, at the end of the day—Magna companies.

We can talk about social engineering if you’d like, but if this government would stand up instead of being an adversary to the federal government, sit and work with them, saying, “We will do our part. We will get the economy going. We’ll get the economy stronger. We will ensure that Ontario is competitive in this marketplace. We will ensure that they have their fair share of jobs and growth. We won’t be a cancer to Canada”—because of the way they are managing this province. Instead of that, they’ve said, “We don’t get enough.”" ],

I find that this government is so closed-minded they’re not even open for possible changes. Now they’ve gone ahead with the pooled pension plan, which I think is a great idea. That’s the avenue they should have probably gone to strengthen it and allow businesses to create their own pension plans going forward. Instead, they’ve come forward here with this retirement plan.", "But one amendment passing through, I think, is kind of ridiculous; that any bill would go through this House and one amendment passes. I think it’s quite shocking that a government would think they’re that perfect in drafting legislation. Obviously, they haven’t listened to all the concerns of all those who testified or the opposition parties for the fact of only one amendment to get through the House, and that’s quite unfortunate for the people of Ontario and Canada as whole.", "As I said earlier, this pension plan is going to have a negative impact for the province of Ontario. I know the pages here—as the member from Windsor–Tecumseh mentioned earlier, this is really for them. However, I’d rather work to have a better Ontario today, so your parents can maintain their own jobs, so your parents can afford your education, so that this government can ensure there are jobs for you, whether you go into a skilled trade or go to university. I would prefer that for you, so that you can have the money to invest yourself and have your own pension to be strong going forward, being able to afford your own family, being able to have more than one child, being able to live wherever you want in this province, being able to stay in this province at the end of the day. Too many youth are heading out west; they’re heading down south because this is not the land of opportunity anymore. This government is driving this province into the ground, and they need to stop. They need to stop.", "I’m sure if you sit at home and talk to your parents about their energy rates—I hope you do, after sitting here for a few weeks. Sit down and talk to them about how the energy rates—if, in fact, the government would quit increasing energy rates every three or four months, what they could do with that money. I think that’s a great discussion to have, instead of listening to them saying, “We’re doing this for 40 years.” I’d rather do for you today so that you have a future tomorrow, not listening to, “We’ll do this for you 40 years down the road.” I think that’s a poor way to go.", "Sorry, Mr. Speaker, I’m addressing the pages in front of me." ],

The only way it would help them is if they were allowed—and I brought this forward four years ago; I talked to Harry Arthurs for hours at a time and we picked each other’s brain because I had done some lobbying in Ottawa on pensions. We believed in that time that you should be able to buy credits. In other words, if I’m in my fifties and my RRSPs are paying 1% and it’s not doing anything in the bank, then I can take my RRSPs or any savings I’ve had and transfer them into premium payments, so at 65, I would have something—$500, $600, $700 in a defined pension plan.

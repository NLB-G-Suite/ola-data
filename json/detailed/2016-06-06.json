We do this to reflect on how much we owe our war veterans, the greatest generation, and to teach future generations about the importance of this act of remembrance.", "I remember, growing up, hearing stories from my grandfather, who was in the United Kingdom during the Second World War. My grandmother, who I introduced last week, the one who had just turned 102, gave birth to my father during a bomb raid during the Second World War. I think every family has stories they hear from loved ones, these stories about heroism, the struggle that they shared, and how it resonates with all of us. I strongly believe that it is our responsibility to share these stories with fellow Canadians so that they too know the cost that was paid for our freedom.", "So it is my privilege to stand here to express my sincerest gratitude to the veterans who are among us, and to those who have since passed away, for the sacrifices that they made for the cause of justice and liberty. We know that without this sense of duty and responsibility, our world would be a much darker place today.", "There can be no doubt that the D-Day landings, which took place exactly 72 years ago, stand as one of the most important historical turning points of the 20th century. Not only were the D-Day landings among the most complex and challenging military engagements in history; they were also a defining moment for our country and the beginning of the end of a brutal and horrific war.", "We now know that the success of Operation Overlord, by no means certain at the time, would seal the fate of Nazi Germany. We also know the special responsibility that was placed on Canadian shoulders during the operation. Our allies tasked Canada with taking Juno Beach. It was a task that our air, sea and land forces took with valour and determination.", "The Royal Canadian Air Force bombers participated in the extensive bombing campaign in the hours leading up to the invasion. The Royal Canadian Navy deployed over 100 warships, manned by 10,000 Canadian sailors, to support the efforts on D-Day. This included minesweepers that cleared the paths to allow landing craft to reach Juno Beach, all while under constant attack from German shore guns.", "The 3rd Canadian Infantry Division and the 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade then landed at Juno Beach, where they faced a formidable enemy with superior tanks and weapons. But they broke through the Nazi defences, establishing a beachhead. They pushed further inland than any other Allied army that attempted to land during D-Day.", "As American historian Stephen Ambrose noted, “Insofar as the opposition the Canadians faced was stronger than at any other beach save Omaha, that was an accomplishment in which the whole nation could take considerable pride.”", "Ultimately, our forces suffered 5,500 casualties during the Normandy campaign. By the end of the first day, 359 Canadians had lost their lives on Juno Beach, 574 were wounded and 47 were taken prisoner. We honour their sacrifice.", "Canadian soldiers would go on to fight throughout western Europe, helping liberate the Netherlands and Italy. Indeed, Canadians went on to fight alongside our allies until the final victory was achieved, and returned home having secured Canada’s reputation as a courageous country and a reliable friend.", "Many of our veterans returned home to Ontario and laid the foundations for the growth and development that our province would experience over the next several decades. Today, the Legions they helped establish continue to be important gathering places for veterans and the community.", "Without the dedication of our veterans, it is clear that Ontario would not be the same great place that it is today. Please know that your sacrifice will never be forgotten.", "Once again, I extend my sincerest thank you to the veterans who are here with us today and who took the time to travel to Queen’s Park. Thank you for your sacrifice, your courage and your bravery. Your service has made our province and the world a better place. We shall not forget." ],

The event is also known as D-Day. It marks one of the largest seaborne invasions in the history of the world, and as has already been said, it was the turning point in this battle.", "It is important to note that Canada had a tremendous participation in this action: 14,000 Canadians went ashore on Juno Beach. Put in perspective, a country of only 11 million had contributed one million soldiers—men and women—in uniform. It’s a mark of our spirit as Canadians. It’s a mark of our ability to punch well above our weight.", "Canadians suffered great loss; there was terrible suffering. We must remember this great loss and this terrible suffering, but we have to remember the legacy that Canadians left. Canadians are known around the world for their tremendous fighting spirit—their indomitable spirit—and it’s something I am truly honoured to be here to share with you. I have to share with you, as well, that we are tremendously honoured that our veterans are here today, and we acknowledge them and thank them so very deeply for their sacrifice.", "It’s important to keep in mind that Canadian soldiers, and all Allied soldiers, weren’t fighting a war of conquest. They weren’t fighting a war to expand territory. They weren’t expanding their domain. In fact, this was a war based on three very powerful principles: Those who gave their lives gave their lives for the protection of democracy, of freedom and of justice. That is the legacy our Canadian soldiers and all soldiers left behind, a legacy of making their contribution to defending those principles in the face of fascism; in the face of the horrible actions of Nazi Germany. This was our stance in defence of these very powerful principles, which are Canadian principles.", "The veterans and soldiers who gave their lives fulfilled their duty to support these very powerful and important values. Our duty is to remember their sacrifice, their great loss, their indomitable spirit, and the cost and value of our important beliefs. We have a duty to remember. That is our duty that we must fulfill.", "Moving forward, it is even more important that, like those who can tell their real-life stories of what they faced, what they suffered and their great victories, we have an even more important responsibility to keep their memories alive. Personally, my great-grandfather fought in both World Wars as part of the Sikh regiment in the British army. My father tells me stories about his sacrifice and the great commitment of people around the world to fight for justice, freedom and democracy.", "The actions that were contributed by Canadians reverberate to our current day. Those who gave their lives made our society stronger, more vibrant, more free. They fought in the face of hopeless odds, and that is one of the elements that makes the Canadian story so powerful: The losses suffered by Canadian regiments are among the most in the entire British component of the forces that attacked. They show that spirit, that dedication to the important principles we all hold so dearly, and they gave their lives to defend those values.", "So, at the minimum, we must come together every year to remember their sacrifices, to remember their commitment, to remember their dedication. It is truly an honour for all of us in this House to share our thoughts on this important day to commemorate their sacrifice and to commemorate those lives. I’m truly honoured to be able to share my thoughts today on behalf of our leader and all New Democrats. Lest we forget; we must always remember." ],

You may remember it:", "When will they ever learn?", "I rise today, both humble and grateful, to pay tribute to an important moment in time, June 6, 1944: D-Day and the pivotal invasion of Normandy.", "It was a day of extreme bravery and tremendous loss. It was a day that would ultimately lead to the end of a terrible war and the destruction of a tyrannical empire that threatened the peace and stability of the entire globe. Fourteen thousand men of the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division hit Juno Beach as part of the largest seaborne invasion in history. Many were seeing their first combat action of the Second World War. They represented all regions of Canada, the east and the west.", "On the eve of D-Day, General Henry Duncan Graham Crerar, commander of the Canadian army, conveyed this message to assault forces preparing for battle: “I have complete confidence in our ability to meet the tests which lie ahead. We are excellently trained and equipped. The quality of both senior and junior leadership is of the highest. As Canadians, we inherit military characteristics which were feared by the enemy in the last Great War. They will be” even “more feared before this war terminates.”", "General Crerar, who was born and raised in my beloved Hamilton, was right. No one who considers the events of the first hours of D-Day can fail to be impressed by the accomplishments of the Canadian assault battalions. Due to overcast skies that morning, most of the elaborate support fire failed, leaving infantry combat engineers and armoured troopers to overcome the enemy by direct fire. It took incredible courage just to keep going. Words cannot do justice to the individuals who rose to the challenge and led assaults on deadly enemy positions.", "Despite landing last and facing heavy resistance, Canadian forces reached further inland that day than any other nation participating in the D-Day assault. But let us pause for a moment and imagine those solemn minutes right before the landing craft gates opened on the beach sectors dubbed Mike and Nan. With the sounds of bombs exploding and bullets deflecting off armour, imagine that moment when a man must reach deep inside his soul, come to terms with fate and make the decision to run into a hail of enemy fire, ready to lay down his life for the betterment of future generations. Three hundred and forty Canadians died that day, June 6, 1944, with the Queen’s Own Rifles from Toronto suffering the most casualties.", "In the days and months that followed, at Caen and onward to Falaise, 5,000 more Canadian men would make the ultimate sacrifice. The men who died were more than just uniforms with names; they had stories, loved and were loved, and had plans for their lives after the war.", "We stand here today a free nation, these privileges earned by the soldier and donated to all of us. They traded their tomorrows for our todays. It’s impossible for us to comprehend the sacrifices made, not just by those who perished on foreign battlefields, but by those who survived and came home. Thank you.", "As the sands in the hourglass leave us standing here today with fewer and fewer of our brave heroes left to honour and thank, what can we do? What must we do? What I believe it is our duty to do is to never, never forget, and to learn. The comfort we grant our veterans is the assurance that we recognize the sacrifices made and our vow to let no generation of Canadians ever forget, for it is only by accepting the advice of our veterans that there is no glory in war, only sacrifice and suffering, that we can avoid another generation paying the same price.", "I’ll leave you with another quote from General Crerar, who said, “War is so very truly hell, and this yard-by-yard fighting finds it at its worst. The gains are so small when it comes to distance—it just resolves itself into a case of counting corpses; if we have fewer than they, it’s a ‘victory.’”", "That’s one hell of a measuring stick, isn’t it?", "To those D-Day veterans joining us today, thank you.", "Back to flowers: May the flowers of remembrance and appreciation for all who served in the name of freedom continue to bloom in our hearts, for that would be truly the most important victory of all." ],

In fact, on June 2, the CN Tower was lit up red and white in honour of Deafblind Awareness Month. The month of June is chosen in part because it is the birth month of Helen Keller, who was a champion to people who are deaf-blind around the world.

Together, they accomplished great things.", "Over the last year, I’ve had the opportunity to visit a number of agencies that provide services and supports to people who are deaf-blind, such as the Lions McInnes House in Brantford and the Bob Rumball Associations for the Deaf in Milton. I’ve met with staff and I’ve seen first-hand the care and personal attention individuals working in the sector provide to clients each and every day. The services and supports being provided to people who are deaf-blind are critical to their well-being, their daily activities and their future goals. Les services et les soutiens offerts aux personnes sourdes et aveugles sont essentiels à leur bien-être, à leurs activités quotidiennes et à la réalisation de leurs objectifs d’avenir.", "At my ministry, we have made progress in the past few years to improve the intervenor services program. Intervenor services enhance communication between individuals who are deaf-blind and their community, using their preferred method of communication to assist them to live as independently as possible in their daily living activities. Since 2004, we have tripled funding for the program, and we have worked with the sector to establish a policy framework to define strong program principles, objectives, eligibility criteria and the scope of intervenor services. We are now focused on working with the intervenor services sector to develop a more consistent, fair and accountable approach to funding.", "We have also forged a strong partnership with the sector through our Intervenor Services Human Resource Strategy, launched in 2014. Two weeks ago, I attended the second Intervenor Services Human Resource Strategy annual conference. The strategy is a broad, sector-led human resources project designed to increase recruitment and help develop the talent and the skills of intervenors and agency management staff.", "For someone who is deaf-blind, communication barriers can seriously limit access to activities most of us take for granted, such as going to the bank or visiting the doctor. By breaking down these barriers, we’re helping build a more inclusive Ontario, one in which all Ontarians have better access to their community. En éliminant ces obstacles, nous contribuons à bâtir un Ontario plus inclusif qui favorise l’accessibilité pour toutes les Ontariennes et tous les Ontariens au sein de leur collectivité.", "In closing, I encourage all honourable members to participate in the activities of Deafblind Awareness Month, and to join our government in building a province where people of all abilities can participate to their fullest potential." ],

It relies on partnership with the private sector, our municipal partners and the federal government.", "Since I became minister, I have made it a priority to build strong relationships because I believe that we will achieve much more working together than we would apart.

Now, we know that different sectors have different perspectives about how inclusionary zoning should be tailored in Ontario. So, in the coming months, we will continue to consult with our stakeholders on the framework to support inclusionary zoning. That includes the development sector, municipalities, the federal government and other key ministry stakeholders as well.", "We’re also proposing changes to the Development Charges Act to exempt secondary suites in new homes from development charges at all. That’ll make it possible for a young couple, maybe each earning $40,000, who can’t afford a $600,000 or a $650,000 house to acquire that home, sufficient in the knowledge that they have a projected revenue stream of $17,000 to $20,000. They could become homeowners. There would, as a result, potentially be a ripple-up effect. Secondary suites are a source of affordable rental units for many low- to moderate-income renters. These proposed changes would help to increase the supply and range of affordable housing options in Ontario communities.", "Our proposed reforms to the Residential Tenancies Act and the Housing Services Act would, if passed, also help to modernize social housing. They would support vibrant, mixed-use communities and encourage a more healthy mix of rent-geared-to-income and market rent tenants.", "By recognizing new and innovative forms of municipal housing assistance and increasing local flexibility to manage housing assets, we would empower our dedicated service managers who have all done 10-year housing plans, which is helpful, to provide assistance in a way that best meets their diverse needs.", "Our proposed changes would also help to make rent-geared-to-income rules simpler and fairer. For example, tenants could not be evicted when they cease to be eligible for rent-geared-to-income assistance after paying market rent for 12 months or more. Currently, Ontarians in need of rental assistance rely on various programs across the province, many of which are tied to specific units. So if you get a job somewhere else, you’re almost in a prison; you can’t leave because if you go somewhere else, you fall to the bottom of the list. This way, we’re hoping to build a credit that is portable to people directly. Currently, that’s the situation.", "Over the coming months, we’ll also be working with our municipal partners to develop a framework for a portable housing benefit that would allow people to have more freedom to choose where they live—closer to family, social support networks, schools and employment opportunities—because housing benefits should be paid directly to the tenant, with subsidies tied to the person and not to the unit. We believe this is the way to go.", "These are just some of the reforms we are proposing to improve access to stable housing for our citizens. For the first time in a long time, I think all three levels of government have a shared sense of purpose. The stars are lining up, but there are still a few clouds in the sky that we’ve got to clear away. We do that by working together, talking together and scheming together, and giving expression to that shared sense of purpose together, so that we can serve the people who, on a good day, are really what it’s all about for us.", "We’re going to work together. We’re going to take meaningful actions to transform Ontario’s housing system and end chronic homelessness in 10 years—now nine years, because it has been a year that we’ve been working on it, right?", "Mr. Speaker, this panel of reforms will indeed help to achieve these goals. It’s not the whole answer; we’re still working on the whole answer. That takes a whole-of-government approach, and we’re taking that approach to get this situation sorted out to the betterment of Ontario.", "I urge all members, please, to support this bill.

I do want to commend the minister for at least recognizing that point, but thus far, his approach hasn’t worked.", "Every year the wait-list for social housing hits a record high. There are now 171,000 Ontarian families waiting for affordable housing. Since the government released the Long-Term Affordable Housing Strategy in 2010, the list has grown by approximately 20,000 families. There are units boarded up because they need so many repairs they are unlivable, and housing money has been diverted to pay for trips all over the world. Clearly, the plan isn’t working.", "The government continues to create policies that increase the cost of living in Ontario, including the cost of housing. Families that were barely able to get by now can’t make ends meet without assistance, seniors are being forced out of their homes, and now the government has introduced a bill which proposes to put the cost of affordable housing on renters and new homeowners.", "In other jurisdictions, inclusionary zoning has included government incentive programs to ensure that the increased cost isn’t just piled on to the neighbours, but this government still doesn’t know if there will be programs here or what they will look like. The government doesn’t know who will be eligible for the units or how the price will be determined.", "This bill says inclusionary zoning will be mandatory for prescribed municipalities, but the government doesn’t think they will use that section and they can’t say who would be prescribed and who wouldn’t. They don’t know what the standards for these units will be or even whether they will be up to the municipalities or the province. In fact, the government started consulting on these major issues after they introduced the bill.", "Mr. Speaker, as I said, Ontario is already facing an affordable housing crisis. We can’t afford to get this wrong. The 171,000 families waiting for social housing can’t afford it, and neither can those Ontario families who are barely making ends meet. Housing affordability is a complex problem, but we need to take the time to consult and get it right." ],

Throughout it all, we rely very heavily on what we see and what we hear, and in truth, we take much of that for granted.", "That is why it is important that we recognize June every year as Deafblind Awareness Month—June being chosen, of course, as we’ve heard previously from other members, to coincide with the remarkable life of a deaf-blind woman, Helen Keller.", "Deaf-blindness is a unique condition. The Canadian Deafblind Association and the Canadian National Society of the Deaf-Blind estimate that it occurs in one in every 10,000 Canadians. According to DeafBlind Ontario Services, 7,000 Ontarians are deaf-blind. We should reflect on that, Speaker. Imagine for a moment the impact the loss of both sight and hearing would have on each and every one of us; 95% of what we learn comes through our eyes and our ears. That is the world that 7,000 Ontarians live in.", "But thanks to the work that was started about 25 years ago by a group of parents of deaf-blind children, there is a network of supports that strives to ensure that all people who are deaf-blind live rich and meaningful lives. Key to this is the work of the intervenors, professionally trained individuals who mediate between the deaf-blind person and his or her environment to enable him or her to communicate effectively with and receive non-distorted information from the world around them.", "Each deaf-blind person will have their own degree of deafness or blindness. As such, the work of the intervenor varies from person to person. Naturally, other senses, such as smell and especially touch, become much more important and facilitate effective, meaningful interaction. With ever-improving technologies, such as tablets and smart phones, intervenors are able to open up many more opportunities.", "I want to recognize the excellent work done on behalf of deaf-blind individuals, particularly the families and the organizations that provide advocacy and the support of over 200 trained intervenors." ],

In fact, the legislation requires that, so we’re being proactive there.", "With respect to campaign finance, many submissions cited the need for greater clarity of campaign finance provisions and suggested simpler, clearer rules and prescribed forms—red tape stuff, clean that up.", "On third-party advertising, the input varied. Some submissions asked for third-party advertising to be completely banned and some supported the development of a framework to regulate it.", "On the topic of accessibility in municipal elections, we heard that we need to continue to enable municipalities to eliminate barriers that prevent voters from casting their ballots. We also heard of the success of alternate voting methods in some municipalities, such as telephone and Internet voting.", "The accuracy of the municipal elections list was a common concern. Most election lists are a concern, no matter what level you’re at, it seems. An inaccurate voters list causes significant challenges for voters, municipal staff and election administrators both leading up to and on voting day.", "We also heard other suggestions such as shortening the municipal election campaign period—that was very common, by the way; I don’t think anybody didn’t make that comment, hardly anybody—and examining the requirements to become a candidate in order to help reduce the number of candidates who don’t seem all that serious about running for election.", "To sum up, Mr. Speaker, we heard that the rules governing how municipal leaders are elected needed to be more modern, more transparent, more accountable and flexible enough to allow for local choice.", "But the discussions did not stop there. We heard hours of debate by members of all parties. Over the past few weeks, at standing committee, we have heard from a number of individuals and organizations across Ontario proposing changes. Speaker, we listened. We listened.", "After hearing these views and perspectives, our government brought forward amendments to the bill to make it even stronger.

Can you hear them?", "I want to thank all members of this House for their contributions to this bill.", "Now, I believe any dialogue about modern municipal elections must include discussions on corporate and union donations. This is one of the areas where we made changes coming out of the standing committee. I applaud the groups and individuals that have fostered and pushed this conversation forward.", "One of the changes we originally proposed under Bill 181 would have allowed municipalities to ban corporate and union donations, but only if their councils choose to do so. At standing committee, we heard that giving municipalities the option to ban corporate and union donations was a step in the right direction, but that we needed to go one step further.", "So, to respond to what we heard and to align with strong action we are taking provincially on electoral finance reform, we brought forward amendments that would make it mandatory to ban corporate and union contributions to council candidates in every municipality across the province. The ban would also apply to contributions to school board trustee candidates. This change makes Bill 181 even stronger. It would create an even playing field for all candidates and encourage candidates to seek a broad base of support from within their constituency. A ban on corporate and union donations is something that the city of Toronto has had in place for some time—for the past two elections at least—and they seem to think it’s working well.", "The province also proposed similar changes provincially by proposing to ban donations by corporations and unions under the new proposed Election Finances Statute Law Amendment Act. Boy, isn’t that a mouthful. We recognize the need to be consistent in this area and extend the same reforms to the same citizens when they vote at the municipal level. Both provincially and municipally, the government is responding to interest in modernizing the democratic process.", "Then we addressed third-party advertising. Throughout our consultation and debate, we have heard about the need to ensure that the rules governing how municipal leaders are elected are transparent, accountable and flexible enough to allow for local choice. To increase transparency in municipal elections, we are proposing a framework to regulate third-party advertising so as to increase accountability for advertisers and to ensure more fair and transparent support. This would include setting contribution and spending limits. Third parties would also have to specifically identify themselves on signs and advertisements. Candidates would not be able to direct a third-party advertiser on where they should focus their efforts or what their advertisements should say. Sounds a little bit like the States, doesn’t it, the super PAC; you know, candidates can’t talk to—or they’re not supposed to, anyway.", "Corporations and unions would still be able to register as third parties and would be permitted to make contributions to third-party advertisers, but requiring them to register as third-party advertisers will provide greater transparency during the election period. We all want that, right?", "During standing committee, we also brought forward an amendment to change the definition of third-party advertising—this is important—so that it covers only advertisements supporting or opposing candidates during an election. It would not affect advertising on issues. So if you want to fight for a clean environment, you can do that.", "The proposed definition of third-party advertising will allow charities and groups that do public outreach on issues as a matter of normal business to continue their issues-based advocacy work throughout the election period. We feel that’s important, and we feel these amendments—so we listened again—will be important for this bill, will strengthen our bill.", "Mr. Speaker, this bill is about striking a balance. We want to ensure that the rules governing municipal elections are consistent across Ontario. But we also recognize that all communities are indeed unique and there is no one-size-fits-all solution. By proposing a framework to govern third-party advertising and by changing the definition of third-party advertising, we hope to create more consistency around how local elections are run in Ontario while still remaining flexible to local circumstances.", "Let me turn to the issue of ranked ballots—you know, government is as easy as one, two, three. If this bill passes, Ontario will become the only jurisdiction in Canada to currently provide municipalities and voters with an alternative to the first past the post system. Once again, we’re being bold, taking the initiative.", "The details for a municipality wishing to adopt ranked ballots, including consultation requirements, voting and vote-counting procedures and reporting requirements, would of course be set out in regulation, and we’ve got lots of time to do that between now and 2018. We’ll be sharing some of those details today.", "Proponents of ranked ballots believe this method of voting can make election campaigns more civil. I agree with this outlook. Ranked ballots send a strong message to members in a community: “Your voice matters”—replace some of that cynicism, give people who believe in nothing something sacred to embrace and to believe in.", "As I travel around the province, visiting municipalities on my Building Bridges tour, I’ve been talking to people in communities all across Ontario. I think I’ve been in 207 municipalities, meeting with councils and councillors. I haven’t been there to plug our government. In fact, I always start out by saying, “I don’t want to hear the good things about our government. I want you to tell us how we can improve things because with critique we can do something about that.” They seem a little taken aback by that approach, but do you know what? It has worked. We’ve got some great ideas, and that’s what good government should be all about, Mr. Speaker, don’t you think? I know you do, because I know you well.", "For example, in the recent municipal election, in a ward very close to where I stand today, a councillor was re-elected with only 17% of the vote. I don’t refer to this as a way to delegitimize anybody or the current system. However, a ranked ballot election would have afforded the winning candidate a much higher percentage of the vote and the accompanying broader mandate.", "Student Vote runs mock elections in our schools while the real ones are happening. Their analysis of the 2014 municipal election—their election, that is—noted that students were far more willing to vote for non-major candidates. I lose all the time in the school elections to the Green candidate. I don’t know who it is, but often we lose to the Green candidate.

In this way, candidates would be encouraged to be on time.", "I also want to acknowledge that we’ve heard a fair bit about contribution limits. We recognize that there are a range of interests held by many different groups and members of the public. During the review, we wanted to take all of these views into account. Through standing committee, we heard that some members of the public are concerned that the current contribution limits are high while others view them as appropriate and others think they’re too low. So we had to struggle with that.", "On campaign length—we heard a lot about that in the campaign. The idea was echoed during our discussions in standing committee. Ontario, just for the record, has the longest nomination period of any province in Canada. This contributes to campaign fatigue amongst candidates and voters. John Tory told me he went to something like 800 meetings. The same people showed up at every meeting to ask the same question. He said he could have sent a tape with the answer. They could have just played the tape, right? Anyhow, there was a lot of fatigue attached to that.", "Based on what we heard, we are proposing to shorten the municipal election campaign by 120 days. Candidates would be able to register between May 1 and the fourth Friday in July instead of January 1 to the second Friday in September in the year of the election. Shortening the length of the nomination period would give municipalities more time to prepare ahead of the election should they choose to use ranked ballots. That’s another benefit.", "On accessibility—another issue that I’ve spoken about—we’re acting through the bill to make sure that clerks are able to prepare accessibility plans to identify, remove and prevent barriers that could affect voters and candidates with disabilities. Municipalities must produce a plan to do so. That’s novel, right?", "On the voters list, we’re going to continue to work on improvements to the list because the accuracy of the municipal voters list was a concern and we heard a lot about that during our consultations. An inaccurate voting list just causes significant challenges for voters, municipal staff and election administrators, both leading up to and on voting day.

We are proposing to give municipalities the option to use ranked ballots in future municipal elections, starting as early as 2018. Again, we’re giving the municipality that option; ultimately they will make that decision. Ranked ballots will not be mandatory for municipalities.", "Supporters of ranked ballots say that they have the potential to give voters a great say in who is elected and may result in elected officials who better reflect the diversity in their communities. In my years working here at Queen’s Park and back at home in Northumberland–Quinte West, I have come to understand at first hand the need to have a voice on local issues and the local democratic process.", "Most of the public input that we received favoured allowing municipalities that option of using ranked ballots for future municipal elections, and we continued to hear about ranked ballots during standing committee—a number of times. I want to acknowledge some of the feedback that we heard in standing committee on ranked ballots.", "We heard some say that municipalities should be required to put a question on the ballot before changing their voting system to a ranked ballot election. Yes, we’ve heard that. We recognize that changing the voting system is a big decision for a municipality and its citizens, its residents. But we also recognize that municipalities are a responsible and accountable form of government, and they are in the best position to make those decisions based on the interest of their communities. In some cases, some rural communities, that might not be there. In some other rural communities it might be there. The same with cities, Speaker.", "Our job is to provide municipalities with a range of tools to provide flexibility for local needs and circumstances. We feel that municipalities are capable of determining whether a question on the ballot regarding ranked ballots is the best way to consult their communities, and they do have that choice.", "To ensure that the decision to use ranked ballots is supported by local residents, regulations would set out a minimum standard to consult before a municipality could implement a ranked ballot. Municipalities will still have the option to put the question on the ballot, such as in a referendum, should they choose to do so.", "Our proposed legislation will give municipalities the flexibility to consult in a way that works best in their own community, once they have met the minimum standard that will be set out in regulations. In giving municipalities the option to use ranked ballots, we are allowing more choice at the local level as to how municipalities elect their leaders, because every community is unique, and a one-size-fits-all approach doesn’t always work.", "Regulations for ranked ballots will also set out:", "—conditions, limitations and procedural requirements for municipalities;", "—rules governing ballots, voting procedures, the counting of votes, recounts and reporting the results; and", "—deadlines when decisions around ranked ballots have to be made, so that municipalities have enough time to prepare for the 2018 municipal elections.", "To come up with a proposed method to implement ranked ballots and decide on details such as ballots, voting procedures, the counting of votes, recounting and reporting issues, we listened to what we heard during the public consultations. We also held a number of meetings with key stakeholders, including the city of Toronto; the Association of Municipalities of Ontario, AMO; and municipal clerks across the province. We also looked closely at the experience of other jurisdictions that use ranked ballots.", "We were able put through some other amendments during the amendment section of the proceedings.", "A vital part of small, rural communities, like the ones I come from, is our volunteer firefighters. Back home in Northumberland–Quinte West, I see it first-hand. The current provisions in the Municipal Elections Act allow volunteer firefighters to run for municipal office without having to take a leave of absence or resign if elected. During committee, we also heard about the need to restore the exemption for volunteer firefighters who wish to run for municipal council. As I mentioned, particularly in small and remote communities we heard that changing the legislation might discourage volunteer firefighters from running for office or make them unable to perform their duties while running for office or after being elected. By restoring the exemption for volunteer firefighters, we will ensure that potential candidates can participate with minimal interference in their day-to-day activities.", "I want to talk a little bit about the overview of the ranked ballots. As you know, Mr. Speaker, there are two kinds of elections used in Ontario: single-member and multi-member. I have both in my riding with the eight municipalities I represent.", "Single-member elections are elections where only one candidate will win, such as the election of a mayor or a ward election where one person will be elected to represent the ward. Multi-member elections are where more than one candidate will win a seat, such as when council members are elected at large—that is, when they’re elected by voters in the entire municipality, instead of any one specific ward—or a ward election where two or more people would be elected to represent it.", "Speaker, I can tell you that in the riding that I represent, we have a real combination. We have elections for mayor and, in some cases, elections for deputy mayor; we have single elections for wards; and then we have election for mayor plus a possible election for deputy mayor, but not necessarily. In many cases, they’re appointed. Then there’s the election at large.", "If Bill 181 passes and a regulation is made by the Lieutenant Governor in Council, ranked ballots could be used by municipalities in both kinds of elections. With ranked ballots, voters could rank their choice from their most preferred to least preferred candidate. When using a ranked ballot in a single-member election, a candidate strives to get at least 50% plus one of the votes. In a multi-member ranked-ballot election, the number of votes needed to be elected will depend on how many seats are being filled. In a ranked-ballot election, there may be multiple rounds of counting before a candidate is declared the winner.", "It is important to note that ranked ballots are not being considered for school boards at this time. School boards often span municipal boundaries. Each municipality conducts elections for four types of school boards: English public, English separate, French public and French separate. As a result, separate consideration will be needed for ranked ballots for school boards. This may be revisited after the 2018 election, as we would normally do. In the meantime, if a municipality decides to use ranked ballots to elect council positions, voters will still use the current voting method to vote for their trustees for school boards.", "Yes, ranked ballots will require education and training for everyone involved in the municipal election: candidates, voters and election workers. Municipalities have opted in the past to make other changes to how they hold their elections, such as Internet voting. I can tell you that when I was first elected mayor of the amalgamated municipality of Brighton, it was the first time we used vote by mail. There were a lot of skeptics out there, there were a lot of questions and, yes, there were some hiccups. But at the end of the day, that’s still exercised today. As a matter of fact, in some other municipalities in my riding, they use vote-by-phone and through the Internet. So we’ve come a long way.", "As part of the education system, they will do outreach before any municipal election and will presumably do the same for ranked ballots. There will be a process of education, and this is one of the things that they will provide that education for.", "Our government currently produces guides for municipal candidates and electors, and provides training upon request for clerks. This would not change. Any changes would be part of the training process. These guidance materials will be updated and expanded to include information about ranked-ballot elections.", "Municipalities already have a lot of flexibility in the way they structure their councils and run their elections. Introducing a ranked ballot as an option for municipalities would only add to the range of options available. For example, many municipalities divide their territory into wards, and each ward elects one or more representatives to council. Some municipalities do not use wards and choose to elect their entire council at large. Others use a combination of wards and at-large representatives.", "Municipalities also have a number of choices in the way voting works. A municipality can make decisions on how voters cast their ballots. By default, municipal voters cast their ballots in person at a voting place. However, as I mentioned a minute ago, a municipality may decide to use alternative voting methods to cast their ballots, and many municipalities have decided to do so already. For example, voters may have the option of voting online, by mail or via telephone.", "The option to use ranked ballots in municipal elections provides another choice for municipalities looking to tailor their municipal elections to their local needs and circumstances.", "Speaker, in conclusion, Bill 181 is about ensuring that the rules governing how our municipal leaders are elected are transparent, accountable and flexible enough to allow for local choice.", "The option to use ranked ballots, along with other proposed changes that Minister McMeekin and I have outlined today, will enable us to take a big step forward in making our municipal elections more modern and transparent. I join Minister McMeekin in supporting Bill 181 and I urge all members to vote for the passing of this piece of legislation. Thank you, Speaker." ],

Despite what was said in this Legislature and to the media, we were disappointed in committee to find that the government voted down every single one of our amendments and refused to add requirements for public consultation regarding electoral reform and regulations.", "The government even voted down amendments which would have helped municipalities to consult with the public. For instance, there are a number of places where this legislation moves the deadline earlier for municipal councils to put questions on the ballot. These questions are examples of clear, objective, measurable public consultation. When a municipal council has an issue that they believe should be decided by the people, we should make that process as easy as possible. Instead, this government just made it harder. We put forward amendments to move these deadlines back and give council as much time as possible to decide to put a question on the ballot, but the government voted our amendment down.", "Municipalities are already leading the way on public consultation using ballot questions. In the 2011 election, numerous municipalities used this tool to consult on electoral reform.", "East Gwillimbury asked if residents were in favour of the existing electoral system of electing four councillors at large.", "The township of Stone Mills asked whether residents were in favour of replacing the system of electing council representatives by wards with a new system of electing council representatives at large.", "The city of Kitchener and the region of Waterloo asked whether residents supported Kitchener and Waterloo councils engaging in discussions about the advantages and disadvantages of merging the two cities.", "Ajax, Pickering, Scugog, Uxbridge, Brock, Whitby and Oshawa all asked residents if they were in favour of changing from electing their chair by appointment of regional council to elections by general vote of the electors.", "These municipalities and others all recognize that electoral reform should be approved by the people. That’s a fact this government seems to have forgotten. During second reading debate, our caucus was very clear that we could not support a bill which allows the candidates being elected the sole authority to determine the electoral system. There must be a requirement to consult with the people through a referendum.", "Elections belong to the people, and it should be up to the people to determine how the elections are run. As I said, municipalities are a mature order of government. We recognize that. That is why we believe they should be held to the same standard as other governments.", "When Ontario, British Columbia and Prince Edward Island proposed changing the electoral system, they all had referendums. In 2007, this government understood that when it comes to electoral reform, there is a need for a greater level of consultation through a referendum before changing how people vote. In fact, the report from Ontario’s Select Committee on Electoral Reform, which included the current Premier, stated:", "“Legitimacy must also apply to the process by which electoral reform is achieved. If the process is unimpeachable, even those who disagree with the eventual outcome can accept it as legitimate. Such judgments are at the heart of democratic decision-making. A key ingredient in that process will be measuring public support through a plebiscite or referendum, about which more is said below.”", "American cities that have changed to ranked ballots or instant run-off voting, have held plebiscites, often in the form of a voter initiative question on the ballot. The city of London, England; New Zealand, Great Britain—around the world governments have recognized the need to hold referendums before changing an electoral system.", "A Toronto Star editorial in January said, “Referendums on voting change have already been held in three provinces, setting a precedent of sorts. All failed, and some reformers are so hell-bent on dumping first-past-the-post that they are urging the Liberals to be ‘brave’ and move ahead on their own hook. That makes no sense. The lesson of past referendums cannot be that the people are too blind or foolish to see the light; it must be that those who want change have to do a better job of persuasion.”", "The city of Toronto passed a motion last October which stated very clearly they did not want the option of ranked ballots, but that if the province was to proceed anyway, there should be a requirement for a referendum.", "During the committee hearings, Halton region councillor Mike Cluett said, “I can’t stress of enough the importance of seeking comprehensive public input and holding a referendum before any changes are made. Direct voter input about how we vote in elections is critical and I personally can’t support a bill that takes democracy away by allowing a government to change the way they are elected without appropriate consultation. As elected officials we have a responsibility to consult the voters in the province of Ontario.”", "In their submission to the Municipal Elections Act review, the city of Markham said, “A provincial referendum or some method of formal public consultation on ranked ballots should be conducted prior to amending the Municipal Elections Act to permit ranked ballots.”", "Mr. Speaker, we put forward an amendment to require a referendum that was based, in part, on An Act to provide for a referendum on Ontario’s electoral system, the bill the Liberal government brought forward when they were proposing electoral reform. The amendment would have allowed municipal councils to hold a referendum at the same time as a municipal election or in a separate vote. It also would have given municipalities the flexibility to determine whether a threshold of 50% or 60% was appropriate for their municipalities. Despite all the requests from MPPs, presenters in committee and municipal officials, the government voted down our amendment.", "One of the things we heard very strongly in committee is that there isn’t universal support for ranked ballots. I was surprised how many people came to express concerns about ranked ballots or recommend that there be a referendum before municipalities were allowed to change the voting system.", "Patrice Dutil, a professor of politics and public administration at Ryerson University said, “There is absolutely no evidence whatsoever that the transferable vote has ever made any difference to turnout. There is no evidence of this. In this period when we are talking constantly about evidence-based policy, I’d like to see a study, any study, that shows that STV has ever made a difference.”", "He went on to say, “No municipality should have the right to change the voting system without going to the people, period. In fact, I’ll go so far as to predict that any change to any municipal system this way will be challenged in the courts, and it will be challenged on constitutional grounds. There should have been more research on this. I’m very disappointed that there wasn’t.”", "Another presenter at committee, John Pepall, stated that “preferential voting is fundamentally flawed and irrational and should not be allowed.”", "Councillor Justin Di Ciano spoke at committee, on behalf of the city of Toronto, regarding concerns with the ranked ballot system. He said, “Under our current first-past-the-post system, every ballot is counted, every voice is heard and the candidate with the most votes wins. Under ranked choice voting, the winner is defined as the one who wins the majority of what are called ‘continuing ballots’. This means if a voter uses all of his or her three rankings on candidates who do not have a chance of winning, that ballot will be exhausted and not part of the continuing ballots.”", "Councillor Di Ciano cited an example from San Francisco where counting went on for a number of rounds, and there were so few ballots left where someone had selected a candidate still in the race that the winner actually received only 24% of the votes cast, even including all the people who had picked her as second or third choice. Councillor Di Ciano also pointed out that since ranked choice voting was implemented in San Francisco, the number of women elected to council has actually decreased by 20%.", "During his committee presentation, Stephen O’Brien from the Association of Municipal Clerks and Treasurers of Ontario said, “I would like to highlight some of the concerns that clerks have about this change. As you can see on slide 6 of the materials, more than 75% of the clerks that we surveyed indicated that if their council decided in favour of using ranked ballots for the 2018 election, they would not feel prepared to do so.”", "Fred Hahn, president of CUPE, said during his presentation, “The proposal to allow ranked ballots comes without any prior discussion and without sufficient research to determine what effects that change would have in municipalities. So we propose that this section of the bill be removed, and that a more open and separate consultation on the process of electoral reform in municipalities be undertaken.”", "By the end of the committee, we had to wonder whether ranked ballots are really something that people want, or whether this is just another idea that Kathleen Wynne came up with at her kitchen table.", "Even the Liberal member from Durham raised a concern about ranked ballots during the committee. He said, “It’s something that I am not quite sure is the best way. The analogy you used when you use political parties—I have seen some terrible leaders be elected because of ranked ballots, so that’s really not a great analogy ... you don’t necessarily get the best candidate by ranked ballot.”", "Since the last time I had the opportunity to speak to this bill in the Legislature, there has been an election of the mayor of London, England, which was conducted by ranked ballot. There are two things I want to point out about that election. First, the voters in London voted to change to that system; it wasn’t simply imposed upon them. Secondly, despite what the people say about ranked ballots resulting in kinder, fairer campaigns, by all reports the campaign for mayor of London was incredibly negative. As the member for Etobicoke North noted in the House, the “election was not without its controversy. The usual suspects did speak in the usual way....” No candidate should have to deal with negative comments based on their race, but it is clear that ranked ballots don’t solve that problem.", "During clause-by-clause, we asked the government about some of these questions and what research they had done. I was disappointed in the fact that they weren’t able to provide any research or evidence to the committee at all.", "When I asked whether the government had done any research on the question that had been raised on whether ranked ballots resulted in higher error rates in areas that are low-income or that are highly multicultural, the parliamentary assistant couldn’t tell us. I asked whether the government did any research into the impact of language barriers and whether changes to a system that requires more explanation would make it more difficult for cultural communities to vote. Again, the government members on the committee couldn’t answer. One of the presenters said that ranked ballots actually resulted in less diverse councils. I asked whether the government did any research into whether that was true. Again, they couldn’t answer.", "A decision to change the electoral system is not one that any government should take lightly. It should be well researched, thought through carefully and must be approved by the people. It appears that the government decided to proceed with this bill with very little research. There is no evidence that they have looked into the impact on multicultural communities. There is no evidence that they have done any research into whether it is true that the error rate increases in lower-income neighbourhoods.", "Mr. Speaker, I hope I’m wrong. I hope that the government didn’t ignore the impact on these groups. If the government has done the research, I would like them to table it with the Legislature before we vote on this bill.", "Over the last two months, a number of questions and concerns have been raised that, so far, no one seems to be able to answer. When there is this much debate over ranked ballots, it would be irresponsible for a government at any level to proceed without requiring a referendum. It should be up to the people to decide which system they think is the best.", "During his presentation to the committee, OPSEU president Smokey Thomas said, “Given the vagueness in the current bill, I would definitely recommend a change to require that any municipality that opts to change its voting system must hold a referendum of citizens prior to making that change.”", "Bill Tieleman, who led the “no” side in the BC referendum on electoral reform, spoke to the committee and said, “Where I have an objection with the proposed legislation is that it does not give voters a mandatory and required referendum on an electoral system change. I think that’s a requirement. I think there are two areas where it is required in a modern democracy: one on constitutional change, and the other on electoral system change, because it has such an impact for such an extended period of time.”", "He also said, “Every electoral system has pluses and minuses, advantages and disadvantages and all sorts of things that we can and can’t see into the future. That’s why I think it’s important to have that fulsome debate with voters participating and giving them the final choice and not having it by elected officials.”", "As Cathrine McKeever, one of the presenters at the committee who spoke strongly against ranked ballots, said, “If you are so convinced this is the perfect system, why not allow the voters an opportunity to agree with you?”", "Gloria Kovach, a former city councillor from the city of Guelph and a former president of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities, talked about the need for a referendum and pointed out that Guelph had held one when they were considering electoral reform. She said, “They first held a referendum via ballot in 1988, on the issue of changing from an at-large voting system to a ward system. There was resounding support for that change. The change came into effect in the 1991 municipal election. It didn’t cost any extra money to do this, and we heard what the citizens wanted. Yes, there were some unhappy people after it. However, even they recognized the democratic process that had brought about this change.”", "In fact, no municipal official has stated that they don’t want public consultation. After the bill was introduced, I received an email from a northern mayor that said, “Elections are supposed to best represent the views and wants of the people voting, not those that serve the people. As such if my municipal voters desire to have a ranked ballot vote I would support it.”", "I received an email from a mayor in southwestern Ontario who said, “This bill should not pass. We as voters should have a say in this process. I hope you will voice all the concerns in this matter.”", "A mayor in eastern Ontario wrote, “I agree that some aspects are good in the proposed changes but once again this current Liberal government wants to remove democracy from its citizens.”", "The mayor of Kingston said, “Changing how our voting system works is an important decision. We need to understand the pros and cons of moving to a ranked ballot, and most importantly, have discussion and debate across the community.”", "During the second reading debate, a number of members mistakenly stated that this bill would require a public meeting before a municipality changed to a ranked ballot electoral system, and it does not.", "In fact, whenever the government had the opportunity to add public consultation to this bill, they voted it down. They voted against our amendment to require a referendum and did not put forward a single amendment of their own to require public consultation. They even voted down our amendment that would have required a minimum of 90 days of public consultation on regulations regarding ranked ballots.", "The government isn’t willing to commit to a standard of public consultation on the change to the ranked ballots or even consultation on how those elections will be run. We have said repeatedly that elections belong to the people, and these people should get a say in how these elections are run.", "As the deputy clerk of the municipality of North Grenville, Katie Valentin, said, “The one that’s gotten the most publicity is of course the new act will allow the option for ranked balloting. Unfortunately, the way the bill is written, all it says is ‘We’ll give you the option; all the details about how you can implement that will come later in regulation.’”", "When we put forward amendments that were requesting them to clarify how some aspects would work, the government said those details would be coming out in regulation in due course. It’s hard to believe that this change is about engaging people and improving democracy when this government refuses to listen to the people of Ontario, municipalities or other members.", "It’s disappointing, because the Minister of Municipal Affairs repeatedly said that he would consider ways to make this bill better. In this Legislature he said, “I’ve already asked staff to go over all the points that have been raised and to specifically come up with a response and/or a change, given those points have been raised. I think the member opposite knows that I’m sincere when I say that. So when we get standing committee, this is about coming up with the best possible bill we can, and we will do that.”", "Even after the bill went to committee, the minister repeated that commitment to Now magazine. He said, “You raise it, we talk about it. I make a commitment to revisit and look at it. We put our best minds to it, and we come up with what we think is best. Then we present it to the public, and the public comments and says, ‘You’re full of hooey’ or ‘We really like this.’ And if we’re full of hooey, then we revisit it again. Right? ’Cause that’s called democracy.”", "That would be democracy, but that is not what happened. We heard from people. They asked for changes to this bill. The PC caucus listened and put forward amendments that would make the bill better, amendments that would increase public consultation, add better definitions, reduce hardships on candidates and ensure that good people could run for office and would strengthen the section on accessibility for people with disabilities. The government voted down every single one.", "They voted down amendments that were requested by multiple people who appeared before the committee. They voted down amendments that would have given the minister regulatory powers. They even voted down an amendment that would have added a definition from Bill 201, the Election Finances Statute Law Amendment Act, 2016.", "Mr. Speaker, the opposition has an important role in pointing out where the government has missed the mark and working to make the legislation better. We take that role seriously; that’s why we put forward amendments.", "I want to take this time today to go through our proposals to strengthen this bill. For instance, Bill 181 contains a section regarding making municipal elections more accessible for voters with disabilities. Now, I want to acknowledge that we support the government’s goal in this. But during committee we heard that more was needed to make it stronger. During committee, John Rae of the Council of Canadians with Disabilities said, “Subsection 2 provides that the clerk shall prepare a plan regarding the identification, removal and prevention of barriers. That is a useful framework, but that’s all it is: a framework. In order to be successful, it must be added to and made more robust and prescriptive.”", "We put forward an amendment that said the minister, by regulation, could prescribe standards for the plan. This simply gave the minister more power to reduce barriers for people with disabilities if required, but the government members of the committee voted it down.", "We put forward an amendment that would require that the clerk’s report after the election include a report on the implementation of the plan that they had developed to reduce barriers. This would ensure that for the future it was identified what worked and what didn’t.", "We heard that Elections Ontario has developed a list of accessible locations which could be of assistance to the clerks as they are planning their voting locations. We also heard that people with disabilities need to be involved in the developing of that plan. During the committee, John Rae of the Council of Canadians with Disabilities said, “In the disability rights movement, sir, we use the phrase, ‘Nothing about us without us.’ It’s the clarion call of the disability rights movement.”", "We put forward an amendment to address this which read, “In preparing the plan, the clerk shall consider input from accessibility advocates and any resources available from the Office of the Chief Electoral Officer of the province of Ontario regarding barrier-free locations.” This amendment would have ensured that the clerks had resources that could assist them in reducing barriers while ensuring that they have the flexibility and authority they need to create the plans that work for their municipalities. But once again, the government voted against this amendment.", "During his presentation, John Rae also said, “It has been suggested that the most important act any citizen performs in a democracy is casting one’s vote.” The government had a chance to strengthen this section of the bill to ensure that people with disabilities are able to vote, and they refused.", "Mr. Speaker, we put forward an amendment to add a definition of “minister” to the act. This was an amendment that was actually recommended by legislative counsel. The Municipal Elections Act has 40 references to “a minister,” and Bill 181 has approximately 10 more, but nowhere in the act or in Bill 181 does it define which minister. The legislative counsel we were working with recommended this to make both our amendments and the act as a whole clearer, but the government voted it down.", "We put forward a motion to amend the definition of “third-party advertising” to include advertising that takes a position on “an issue with which a candidate is associated.” The parliamentary assistant on the committee said, “Chair, this is way too broad. I recommend not supporting it.”", "To be fair, before we voted on the amendment, I pointed out that the definition actually came from the bill that the government had introduced just two days before, Bill 201, the Election Finances Statute Law Amendment Act, 2016, and yet the government members of the committee still voted against the amendment. It’s hard to believe that the government members were really considering the amendments when they voted against adding their own definition to the bill.", "It’s also hard to believe that the government was really listening and considering amendments when they voted against one that the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing had told the media he supported just days before.", "In committee, we heard from a number of presenters that unpaid labour which is provided at the direction of an individual, corporation or trade union is a problem in municipal elections. We heard stories of so-called volunteers who had actually been hired by companies for the sole purpose of volunteering on campaigns full-time.", "Liberal MP Deb Schulte said in her presentation, “You need to include ‘volunteer hours’ that are paid for by external individuals as a contribution from that individual and make it subject to the same limits.", "“I have experienced this directly, the boosting by a developer that’s not declared by the candidate.”", "The concern was also expressed by Campaign Fairness and Professor Robert MacDermid, who said, “I want to be very clear what this is. This is not people who are volunteering to work on a campaign in their off-working hours; this is people who are being paid to work on a campaign by their employer and being paid to work on the campaign of their employer’s choice.”", "He went on to say, “This represents a huge black hole in municipal campaign finance, and probably in campaign rules at other levels as well. I would estimate that it’s hundreds of thousands of dollars that go unreported, undisclosed and unlimited.”", "On May 12, QP Briefing interviewed the Minister of Municipal Affairs about this issue. The article says, “McMeekin said Thursday he believed the bill said the opposite—that the pay should be considered a campaign contribution—and he would ‘fix it’ if he was wrong.", "“‘Well, I think if that becomes a substitute for direct developer or union influence, to send a whole shift off to work on putting somebody’s signs up or deliver brochures, that could have the ability to do exactly what we don’t want to see done,’ said McMeekin. ‘If that’s the case, I’ll revisit that.’”", "“Asked if he believes that ‘loophole’ should be closed in the forthcoming legislation that will ban corporate and union donations in provincial campaign financing, McMeekin said it should be covered.", "“‘If it’s not, we’ll look at that again,’ McMeekin said.”", "I was happy to hear that, because it was one of the areas of the bill that we believe should be fixed. The minister and his office later clarified and said that he would listen to the recommendations of the committee.", "This committee heard from many people who recommended that these paid volunteers be banned: a former municipal candidate, now an MP; a political science professor who has extensively studied municipal campaign finance; an organization that is dedicated to ensuring that municipal campaign financing is fair.", "One week after QP Briefing interviewed the minister, we put forward an amendment that would have made paid volunteers a campaign contribution, but when it came to clause-by-clause, the government used their majority to block an amendment that, only a week before, the minister had stated he thought was already in the bill and, if not, committed to fix it.", "I would welcome an explanation on what happened, because from this side of the House, it’s difficult to understand. Perhaps by then they realized that the government had created the exact same loophole in section 1 of Bill 201, the Election Finances Statute Law Amendment Act, the government’s new political fundraising bill.", "Mr. Speaker, that was not the only loophole in this bill. There were also concerns raised by the third-party-advertising section of this bill. We heard from a number of presenters, including the Ontario Nonprofit Network, that if the bill didn’t contain an exemption for organizations that spent below a certain threshold, this legislation would be open to a court challenge. The NDP critic introduced an amendment to address that and the government voted it down. He proposed a threshold of $1,000, but in debate he said that he would be willing to amend to it $500 or any other number. Instead of working with him to find the right number, the government simply voted it down.", "That is particularly interesting, given that Bill 201, the Election Finances Statute Law Amendment Act, 2016, introduced by the government two days before clause-by-clause, includes the following exemption for third-party advertisers: “A third party shall apply for registration under this section immediately after having incurred expenses of a total amount of $500 for third-party political advertising during a period referred to in section 37.10.1.”", "We put forward a number of amendments to improve the rules on third-party advertising. We put forward an amendment to increase transparency by requiring the municipal clerk to make the list of third-party advertisers public. But once again, the government members on the committee voted it down.", "There are a number of circumstances where an individual with a lot of resources has influenced campaigns. We put forward an amendment to ensure balance and fairness by limiting the amount that an individual could contribute to their own third-party advertising campaign to $5,000. Again, the government voted it down. That means if a wealthy individual decides they don’t like a specific councillor, they can create a third-party advertising campaign against that individual and there’s no limit to the amount that they can contribute.", "There’s another loophole in Bill 181, which states, “If the spouse of a registered third party is not normally resident in Ontario, the spouse may make contributions only to the registered third party.” This clause allows someone who is not a resident of Ontario to make unlimited donations to a third-party campaign. This would allow someone who doesn’t live in the municipality or even Ontario to have a significant impact on the election. We don’t believe that is right, so we put forward an amendment to remove this clause, but again the government voted it down.", "We also heard at committee that the current limit on contributions up to $5,000 a campaign within a single municipality is too high and can result in a single person having a large influence in a smaller municipality. If there are a number of third-party advertisers who have the same goal, contributing a total of $5,000 to them has the same result as contributing $5,000 to one.", "We put forward an amendment which limited the contribution to third-party advertisers within a municipality to $3,000, except in Toronto, where it would remain $5,000. But again, the amendment was voted down.", "As part of our efforts to make third-party advertising more transparent, we put forward an amendment to create more of an incentive for third-party advertisers to file their financial statements. Under Bill 181, the rules have been changed so the candidates don’t receive a refund of their nomination fee until they have filed their financial statements after the election.", "That’s a change that we support. We believe the same should apply to third parties. We put forward an amendment to require a registration fee of $100 for individuals or non-profit corporations registering as third parties and $500 for unions and corporations. Similar to the nomination fee, the cost for registration would be refunded to third-party organizations if they filed a financial statement as required. This would have added accountability, but once again, the government members voted down our amendment.", "The government says that they want a shorter municipal campaign, and we’ve heard that from across the aisle today. But anyone who has read the bill knows that under Bill 181 they have actually made it longer. Nominations will now close about six weeks earlier, the fourth Friday in July, instead of the second Friday in September as in previous campaigns. This would result in a campaign longer than the one for the last federal election.", "The longer campaign will not only be exhausting for the public; it will create hardships for all of those people who are forced to take a leave of absence from their jobs to run for office. As Gloria Kovach, a former city councillor from Guelph and the former president of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities, said during committee hearings, “I have been involved with women across the country on increasing women’s participation in local government. One of the barriers that I heard time and time again was the cost and financial concern of campaign. The consequences of extending an active campaign period may indeed negatively impact diversity on municipal councils.", "“While 13 weeks of advertisements, signs, debates and fundraising is well exhausting for the general public, it has a far bigger impact on persons who are required to take a leave of absence to run for municipal office. These aren’t just municipal employees—or perhaps volunteer firefighters, as I know this committee has heard in the past. There are often people who work in other industries who are required to take that time off during an election campaign. It’s just prohibitive. It will be a barrier and it will discourage good people from running for office.”", "During his presentation to the committee, Gary McNamara, the president of AMO, said, “However, debate in the Legislature has raised some legitimate potential issues around the withdrawal date of the fourth Friday in July. The concern is that this earlier date may disadvantage volunteers and others who can’t afford a longer leave of absence from their jobs to campaign.”", "This longer campaign will not only create challenges for candidates; it will limit the ability of municipalities to function because the Municipal Act restricts the decisions that council can make after nomination day.", "Unless based on acclamations, three-quarters or more of council will stay the same. After nomination day, council is prevented from appointing or removing any officer of the municipality, hiring or dismissing any employee of the municipality, the disposition of any real or personal property of the municipality which has a value exceeding $50,000, and making any expenditure or incurring any liability which exceeds $50,000. This means that from July until the new council is sworn in, the municipality can’t function properly. When this concern was raised in committee with Gary McNamara, the president of AMO, he agreed with the fact that this period would be lame duck.", "The government has stated that more time is needed due to the ranked ballots, so we put forward an amendment to move the end of nominations to the fourth Friday in August instead of the fourth Friday in July. That would allow an additional two weeks compared to previous elections to give clerks the time they need while ensuring minimizing hardships to potential candidates. But, despite the fact that the July date will cause challenges for municipalities and that AMO agreed that the close of nominations should be moved later, the government voted down our amendment.", "While the government is forcing candidates into a 13-week long campaign, they aren’t giving them some of the tools they need. Under Bill 181, there is a gap of about six weeks when the nominations are closed but the candidates don’t have the information that they need to contact voters. While this is frustrating for most candidates, it creates a significant challenge for people running to be school board trustees, particularly for French or Catholic school boards. We put forward an amendment which would require candidates to receive a copy of the voters list when nominations close, but the government voted it down.", "Bill 181 gives municipal clerks new responsibilities for reviewing financial statements to ensure that contributors have not exceeded either their maximum contribution to a single campaign or to multiple campaigns within the municipality. We support the additional oversight, but we heard that there are challenges, because some financial returns don’t have enough information for the clerk to determine whether it is the same individual. If there are two John Smiths listed on the financial statement, each with a maximum contribution, and there are no addresses provided, how can the clerk determine whether this is the same person or two separate people?", "During the committee, Professor Robert MacDermid said, “I would also argue that clerks or compliance audit committees should also be given the power to ensure that the campaign statements are complete. In my experience in looking at thousands of these, about a quarter of them—and the statements of many sitting council members—are not complete.”", "We put forward an amendment that would give the clerk the authority to request more information when a financial statement is not complete. This would ensure that they have the tools they need in order to fulfill the responsibilities that the government has given them, but, like all of our other amendments, the government members on the committee voted it down. The third party put forward an amendment to deal with this problem as well, and once again, the government voted it down.", "Another one of the concerns that was raised in committee was what happens in the event of a tie with ranked ballots. During his presentation, the mayor of Oakville said, “On the question of ties, theoretically, it’s possible for there to be a tie at some point in a ranked ballot system, depending on the counting method used. There are about five different known counting methods. I’m expecting that the government will probably prescribe the counting method, but in the event of a tie—right now, we have this flip-a-coin, draw-a-card, game-of-chance approach to breaking the tie. In a ranked ballot system, what would be wrong with having the tie go to the one with the most first-place votes?”", "We put forward a motion to ensure that the person who was the first choice of more people would be the winner. I think that people would have a difficult time arguing that there is a more democratic way to settle a tie. In fact, in the rules regarding counting preferential ballots, Robert’s Rules of Order states, “In the event of a tie in the winning position—which would imply that the elimination process is continued until the ballots are reduced to two or more equal piles—the election should be resolved in favour of the candidate or proposition that was strongest in terms of first choices (by referring to the record of the first distribution).”", "The city of Aspen Instant Runoff Voting Procedures Manual states, “The first tiebreaker shall be based upon the number of first choice rankings, with the candidate with the largest number of first choice rankings being determined the winner of the tiebreaker.”", "It seems logical and democratic that in the event of a tie, the winner should be the person who was the first choice of the majority of people, but once again, the government chose partisanship over democracy and voted down the amendment.", "There are also concerns about the method for the count. Previously, a judge had the ability to order that a recount be done in a different manner than the original count, if he or she was of the opinion that the manner in which the original count was conducted contributed to the doubtful result. Bill 181 exempts ranked ballot elections from this clause, meaning that if a ranked ballot election is counted by electronic tabulators and the result is flawed, there is no ability to change the method to get accurate results.", "There are a number of problems that can occur with electronic tabulators. You could have a thousand people vote and the machine only register 200 votes, but there is no ability to have a hand recount to ensure that those other 800 votes count. When San Francisco switched to tabulators for the instant runoff, they found that the machines would only read certain types of ink.", "There is also a huge potential for a need to hand-count certain ballots because the machines are unable to read voter intent because of confusion with the new ballots. One of the concerns raised in committee was that since school board trustees are not subject to ranked ballots, when voters get to that section of the ballot, they will be confused. A hand count might be able to pick up voter intention from the fact that there is a “1” beside one of the trustees’ names, but if the machine doesn’t, that vote won’t count.", "We raised this on second reading, and the concern was confirmed in discussions with experts as we prepared for clause-by-clause. We put forward an amendment to fix this problem and ensure that all votes would count, but once again, the government members on the committee voted it down.", "One of the other concerns we raised on second reading was that new section 41.1 of the act gives the minister power to overrule any part of the legislation by regulation. We understand that there are some circumstances in which a minister needs to prescribe certain things by regulation. We support the section that gives him the flexibility to define what is a residence for the purpose of determining who can vote in a municipal election, because we recognize that there are some unusual situations that the legislation could not contemplate, such as people using a barn or storage unit as an address. In fact, we proposed two amendments that would have given the minister more regulatory authority: one to strengthen the accessibility section of the bill and one to allow the minister to define advertising. That was something that Smokey Thomas, the president of OPSEU, pointed out was needed during his presentation.", "During the committee hearings the representative from Sustainable Vaughan stated, “My work advocating for the community is at risk due to the ambiguity in the definitions of both ‘third party’ and ‘advertising’ within this bill.” The government voted down our amendments on specific regulatory policy. Instead, they voted to keep the broad regulatory power that allowed the minister to overrule any part of the legislation by regulation. As the parliamentary assistant said again, “I recommend voting against this motion, because the provision is included as changes may be required to certain sections of the act for the purpose of implementing ranked ballots for elections starting in the year 2018.”", "Mr. Speaker, I think the parliamentary assistant captured our point precisely. The government hasn’t fully researched this issue, so they don’t know all the changes required to the act. Rather than researching it properly and having full, open and public debate in the Legislature, they are passing the legislation, knowing full well that they may overrule parts of it later behind closed doors, with no public scrutiny.", "Regulations should not be used to avoid public scrutiny or consultation on legislation, and they shouldn’t be used to make up for legislation that isn’t well researched and well written.", "We saw over and over during this process that the government hadn’t properly researched or thought through this bill. The afternoon before clause-by-clause, we received a package of amendments submitted by the government which would ban union and corporate donations to all municipal candidates. We supported the intent of these amendments, but I want to point out that there was a concern from municipalities that the government had reversed position at the last minute, which left no time for consultation.", "Less than a week earlier, in providing the clarification to Queen’s Park Briefing on his position on paid labour, the minister said in a statement, “In consulting on Bill 181, it was important for me to respect the rights of municipalities to decide how they proceed forward with using ranked ballots or banning corporate and union donations as well as third-party advertising.”", "During second reading, the minister said, “Furthermore, I believe that any discussion about modern elections must include the option to ban corporate and union donations. Where have I heard that before? It’s important that our cities and towns undertake this important conversation with their citizens.”", "I can understand why municipalities were caught off guard by the new amendments. As Mississauga Mayor Bonnie Crombie said in a Toronto Star article, “Consultation with all municipalities is necessary when making changes of this magnitude and I would welcome the opportunity to provide feedback on these brand new proposed amendments [to] the legislation currently being debated.”", "During the committee presentations, the president of AMO said that banning corporate and union donations should be left up to the municipalities, but that if the province was to ban them for all municipalities, they should also increase the individual donation limits to reflect the fact that this will result in increased challenges for fundraising. It seems that on this issue the government simply ignored AMO’s advice.", "They also ignored comments from presenters that there should be a greater requirement for candidates to demonstrate a minimum level of support before nomination papers are accepted. We heard that it would assist voters in being able to identify the candidates and learn their issues.", "Under Bill 181, candidates are required to get 25 signatures to run for office. We put forward an amendment to require that those signatures be from the area where the candidate was running. A councillor would have to get the signatures of 25 people in their ward in order to run. We also put forward an amendment that would increase it to 100 signatures to run for mayor in the city of Toronto. The government members of the committee voted that down because the parliamentary assistant said that they wanted “a consistent process across the province.”", "Mr. Speaker, this is interesting because Bill 181 doesn’t actually create a consistent process. For instance, under Bill 181 the limit for donations for everyone other than the mayor is $750 but for the mayor of Toronto it is $2,500. We understand that. Toronto is unique; because of its size, it leads to more expensive campaigns. But I’m not sure there’s another municipality in Ontario that had 65 candidates run for mayor. As the presenter pointed out, that created challenges for voters, and I’m disappointed that the government wasn’t interested in working with us to solve them.", "There were a number of other amendments we put forward to solve problems with the bill. While some are small, technical fixes, they can create real challenges for candidates. For instance, Bill 181 requires that both candidates and parties provide advertisers with contact information for the person responsible for advertising, including business addresses. We all know from our own campaigns that some of our volunteers are people who are retired or not working. Sometimes these are people who have the time available to take on major roles in a campaign. We put forward an amendment to clarify that addresses could be a home address if the person did not have a business address. But once again, the government voted it down. The government also voted down an amendment that the clerk of the city of Toronto requested to make the compliance audit committee more efficient and effective.", "Mr. Speaker, there’s one section where the government listened. Section 22 of Bill 181 removed the clause of the Municipal Elections Act that allowed people to continue to serve as a volunteer firefighter while running for municipal council. I’ve never heard an explanation from the government of why they put that in the bill, but I’m pleased that during the clause-by-clause it was voted out.", "I also want to point out a couple of things that municipalities raised that still aren’t addressed in this bill. Two of them may not require a legislative change, so I hope to government will move to address them. The first is the accuracy of the voters list. We’ve heard over and over about the challenges with the list. This is probably the number one request from municipalities: that the government look at ways to make the list better. I want to acknowledge that Bill 181 makes the process for removing deceased people easier, and we were happy to support that, but much more needs to be done before the next municipal election.", "As AMO said in their submission on the municipal elections review, “Inaccuracies, errors, and omissions on the municipal voters list have been raised by many municipalities, election after election. These result in mistakes that aggravate voters, can frustrate voting behaviour, and question the capabilities of municipal elections staff and the process. AMO supports the need to improve the municipal voters list to safeguard the integrity of local government elections.”", "During their committee presentation, Stephen O’Brien, the chair of the Association of Municipal Managers, Clerks and Treasurers elections act advisory team, said, “Following the last several municipal elections, one of the biggest priorities for clerks in this province has been the poor quality of the municipal voters list. As you can see on slide 4 of the presentation materials that we’ve provided to you, when AMCTO surveyed its members last May, 92% of them indicated that Ontario needed a new approach to the voters list.”", "The second change—and it’s one we heard about from the mayor of Barrie, a councillor from Toronto and others—is the need to have more resources to help guide candidates. When they are struggling to fill out financial forms correctly or trying to make sure they are following all the rules, there is no one who is willing to give them advice. It seems often that the only guidance they receive is to tell them to call a lawyer, which is an expensive way to get an answer. Provincially, we have the ability to call Elections Ontario. We’re able to get guidance in writing to ensure that we follow all the rules. Municipal candidates are asking for a resource to help them with similar advice.", "I know the ministry has been conducting a review of the Municipal Act, and I hope that the last request I want to raise will be part of that review. We received a number of requests to shorten the so-called lame-duck period between the election and the first meeting of the new council. AMO recommends that municipalities be given the flexibility to hold the first meeting between 18 and 39 days after the election to suit local circumstances. We hope to see that change in the upcoming bill.", "We also hope that in upcoming bills we will be able to work together to ensure that municipalities get the changes they need.", "I’m disappointed in this bill and the committee process that it went through. I’m disappointed that the government put forward a bill that clearly wasn’t ready, where government members, including the minister, were confused about what was actually in the bill and where they claim that broad regulatory powers are needed because they don’t actually know how the ranked ballots will be implemented or whether they will need to overrule parts of the legislation that we are debating today.", "I’m also disappointed in how little respect the government had for input from others, both from the public and other members of this Legislature. People travelled to appear before the committee. They did a lot of work to prepare their presentations, and the majority of their time, it seems, the government simply didn’t listen. As a result, we missed opportunities to add transparency and accountability, as well as opportunities to make municipal elections more accessible.", "We put a lot of work into preparing amendments based on those presentations and our analysis of the bill. We attempted to fix a number of problems that it created, and the government members simply voted down every single amendment, even those based on a government bill or that were supported by the minister’s comments just a week before.", "I understand how the critic from the third party felt near the end of the clause-by-clause when he said he was so disappointed by the previous vote that he did not even wish to continue, and withdrew his last motion.", "What’s most disappointing is that the government did not agree to public consultation through a referendum before a municipality can change their electoral system. It shows a lack of respect for the people of Ontario.", "As the organization Defend Democracy said, “Canada’s electoral system is the basis of our democracy. Considering the potential impact, no one government or political party has the authority to fundamentally alter our democratic system. If our system is to be reformed, it is up to the people of Canada to decide directly through a referendum.”", "Elections do not belong to the Liberal Party, this government, or even a municipal council. They belong to the people, and we cannot support a bill that attempts to override the right of the people to determine how they elect their government.", "With that, that ends the presentation, but, Mr. Speaker, you did notice that I mentioned in my remarks the president of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities. I just got a note here from the Speaker’s chair that Mr. Clark Somerville is the new president of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities. He takes over in June, and we want to congratulate him on his new position.", "Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, for allowing me the time to make this presentation, and thank you very much for giving me that information to be one of the first to welcome him to the presidency of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities." ],

So, yes, it’s about time you guys got caught up. He is from Halton, right?", "Seriously, it’s always a pleasure to be called upon in this House to represent my constituents in Windsor–Tecumseh. This bill, Bill 181, amends the Municipal Elections Act, and it is of interest in my riding.", "For me, at the core of this bill is the intent to get big money—corporate money, donations from developers—out of municipal politics. Quite frankly, it doesn’t belong there and it never has, but it has crept in as part of the accepted practice of doing business for many people in some parts of the province. That’s because election campaigns can be very expensive to run. Over the years, people seeking influence over candidates exploited that. Slowly, ever so gradually, this trickle of corporate money became a flood in some areas. Developers knew that if they could claim their money actually helped a candidate win an election, then they could expect that candidate to take their calls, listen, and perhaps—just perhaps—be persuaded to vote for whatever issue the corporate funders were pushing at that time.", "I am by no means saying that this has corrupted every municipal politician who has ever accepted funding from a developer. In fact, in my two municipal elections I had several people from the development industry make campaign donations—it could have been $100; it could have been $200. I never ran very expensive campaigns, and I never felt beholden to anyone that made a contribution to my campaign. But in some areas of the province, there is certainly the perception that developer money—big money—controls the votes on council.", "As a matter of fact, at committee we heard from a federal member of Parliament who ran three times in the municipality of Vaughan. Deb Schulte is a former Vaughan and regional councillor in York region. She told us that back in 2010 an anonymous attack campaign was launched against several sitting members. There was so much time, effort and money put into that negative campaign that several incumbents lost their seats. Because of this, what happens is, for those who win a seat, according to Ms. Schulte, there’s always the threat that, if you don’t play along, you’ll be targeted in the next municipal election.", "The MP for King–Vaughan told us that after that election, when she wasn’t the target, she was told flat out by someone trying to exert his influence over her on planning and development issues, “We put you in, and we can take you out.” That’s exactly what they did to her: Someone in the development industry paid for and ran what she described as “an extensive and expensive attack campaign” against her the next time out. They did it in such a way that no one could figure out who was pulling the strings or who was paying the bills.", "She told us that she wasn’t a bitter losing candidate. After all, she’s now a sitting member of Parliament in the Trudeau government, and she feels she got there because people in her riding knew that what had been done to her in the last municipal campaign was wrong.", "Big money has had a big say in who was elected municipally in certain parts of the province for far too long.", "We heard from Robert MacDermid, who teaches political science at York University. He is, without a doubt, one of the experts in this province on municipal campaign finance. He has connected the dots, so to speak, because of the many studies he has conducted in this field. He’s done it for two decades. He’s looked at thousands and thousands of campaign statements filed by municipal candidates.", "He’s worked with the grassroots group, Campaign Fairness, as they focused on the 12 or 13 municipalities that share the Lake Simcoe watershed. Some of the winning candidates in those areas get 80% of their donations from the development industry. Others aren’t so lucky; they only get 60% or 70%. Of course, a few get none at all. Professor MacDermid says what that has led to, because of the developer influence on council decisions, is unregulated urban sprawl in many of those municipalities where development interests are greatest. His research shows that although many of the big developers actually live in the municipality of Vaughan, they fund municipal campaigns in all of the surrounding areas in the watershed as well. In fact, when I asked him how widespread a problem this has been, he said that development money from Vaughan is given to candidates in 20 or 30 other municipalities in southern Ontario.", "So the timing is right for this section of the bill banning corporate donations at the municipal level. It’s an issue whose time has come.", "By the way, Speaker, the bill will ban donations from labour unions as well, and just so you know, after years and years of looking at financial statements filed by municipal candidates, by comparison, Professor MacDermid says that union donations are trivial. There’s not much there and what there is is small potatoes.", "That sentiment was echoed by Fred Hahn, president of CUPE Ontario. CUPE, as you know, represents 250,000 workers across the broader public sector in Ontario; 80,000 of them are municipal workers, and they have another 55,000 at various school boards in the province. His studies show large corporations donate between 40% and 50% of all the money raised in municipal election campaigns. By comparison, Mr. Hahn told us at committee that union contributions range in some municipalities from 1% to as high as 10%.", "To quote Fred Hahn, “This legislation empowers municipalities to ban both corporate and union donations, and it appears to imply that the role of unions and corporations is relatively equivalent. Despite the apparent false equivalency created by this legislation, we are supportive of it in principle, including the sections that ban both union and corporate donations.”", "We heard very similar words from the president of the Ontario Public Service Employees Union. Warren Smokey Thomas said, “We often hear the phrase ‘corporate and union donations,’ as if corporations and unions are somehow equivalent ... players in democratic debates, and as if they both spend about the same amount of money trying to influence the outcomes of elections. This is not the case.”", "He went on to say, “Let me say at the outset that we wholeheartedly support eliminating the influence of big money on municipal elections. If there’s any organization in this province that has done and said more than OPSEU on the way big money corrupts government decisions, I haven’t heard of it.", "“But corporations and unions are not the same, for two reasons. First of all ... unions are democratic; corporations are not. Their structure is authoritarian....", "“Corporations as a group donate far more to political candidates than unions ever do.", "“At the municipal level, as I think we all know, the big issue is not campaign donations from working people and their unions; it’s donations from developers.”", "Speaker, Smokey Thomas concluded that part of his presentation with this: “The positive effect of banning corporate donations will, we believe, be much greater than the negative effect of banning donations from democratic organizations like ours. On balance, it will lessen the impact on big money on elections, and that’s a deal I’ll take any day of the week.”", "Speaker, just for your edification, corporate and union donations for municipal campaigns were banned in the city of Toronto in 2010. It hasn’t posed a problem there, so it shouldn’t create issues any place else in Ontario.", "Next up, we at the committee level had to wrestle with the concept of a voluntary ban or a mandatory ban on corporate and union donations. Initially, the bill said that municipal councils would be able to decide for themselves whether such a ban was acceptable. In other words, it would be voluntary and up to them. However, we heard from a number of witnesses who said that that just wouldn’t work. They feared that with councillors beholden to the development industry, especially since some of them were getting 60%, 70% and 80% of their campaign contributions funded by developers, there would be no way that those mayors and councillors would vote to turn off the financial taps. If the intent was real, if the purpose was to get rid of corporate influence on municipal candidates and to get big money out of municipal campaigns, then we had no choice. Voluntary wouldn’t work. The ban had to be mandatory.", "I want to compliment the Liberals on coming to terms with that. What we have in that section of the bill, I believe, is somewhat groundbreaking. I believe that it is the most democratic thing we have done with this bill. We’ve taken a major step towards getting big money out of municipal campaigns. Now that’s not to say the more creative and the more determined of the big money boys won’t find ways to continue to insert themselves into municipal campaigns, but it is a start, and it’s a good one at that.", "Before I say too much about the good stuff that’s in this bill—I wouldn’t wish to disappoint the members opposite who expect me to say some not-so-good things, especially in my role as opposition critic for municipal affairs and housing—let me touch on something that I think should have been in this bill but it isn’t. That, quite simply, is that we’ve missed an opportunity to be creative, to be progressive and to open up our democratic process to hundreds of thousands of newcomers to our province.", "They come here from all over the world, some from our neighbour along our southern border but many more from much more far afield. They come here to work. They come for a safe refuge, in some cases, to escape war, to escape oppression and to find a better home for their families.", "They work. They buy homes or rent apartments. They pay municipal taxes. They use our municipal services: our transit systems, our libraries and our schools. They may join the parents’ club or the church choir, or they may help coach our soccer teams.", "Permanent residents: Many of them take great pride in their new neighbourhoods. They commit themselves to building up the areas in which they choose to live. After everything they’ve been through in their homelands, they see it almost as a duty to take part in neighbourhood events. They participate in the life of a community. They celebrate life and they celebrate freedom. They are affected by the decisions and actions taken by their municipal politicians. Why shouldn’t they have the same right to hold those municipal politicians accountable by exercising their vote? They may or may not be on the path towards Canadian citizenship, but the bottom line is this: They pay municipal taxes and property taxes. They pay them, and yet we deny them the vote for the people who decide on their municipal services. They pay their property taxes, and yet they have absolutely no say. That isn’t right.", "The city of Toronto knows that. Councillors in Toronto have been asking for the right to allow permanent citizens the right to vote for the past three years. In fact, Toronto councillors believe that they should have the right to vote in provincial elections, as well.", "Now, let’s think about that for a moment. Let’s look at our recent history if we could—well, relatively recent leadership election history, held by my good friends in the Conservative Party. There was a party insider, Ms. Elliott, the former member from Whitby–Oshawa. She was supported by the vast majority of the PC caucus. Then there was this outsider by the name of Patrick Brown—a federal member of Parliament from Barrie. No one gave him much of a chance. He only had what—three, maybe four members of the provincial caucus who said they would support him?", "So what did Mr. Brown do? He assembled a team. He courted supporters in groups and neighbourhoods not normally associated with his party in any big way before. He reached out to newcomers from other countries, folks who spoke languages other than English and French as a mother tongue. He promised them a say in how things were done in Ontario. He said, “Your vote is important, and so are you.” And, well, the rest is history.", "Mr. Brown won that leadership race. There was no one at the door on voting day saying, “Show me your proof of Canadian citizenship.” It didn’t happen. You had to be 14 years old and a resident of Ontario. So those who voted were residents of Ontario. They paid their municipal taxes. They used municipal services. They exercised their new right to vote in a leadership campaign and they helped elect someone who nobody gave much of a chance to just a few months previously.", "So why, pray tell, if we value the votes of non-residents in that case—voting for the leader of a political party—if we grant them the right and the ability to vote for the leader of a provincial political party, why do we deny those same people from voting for their school board trustee, their city councillor or their mayor? There’s a problem with that picture. We could have fixed it with these proposed amendments and we didn’t. We allowed that opportunity to slip through our fingers.", "Now, this isn’t just a Toronto issue. City council in North Bay has voted in support of giving non-residents the right to vote in municipal elections. North Bay is doing what it can to attract newcomers up that way. They see this as an opportunity to get people from other countries to consider their region.", "I was reading a story the other day by John Michael McGrath, writing for TVO.org. He was quoting Meg Ramore, the local immigration partnership coordinator for the North Bay and district multicultural council. She was saying, “The more welcoming North Bay is to newcomers, the more newcomers will come to North Bay and bring their talent, their families, their money. Employers are screaming for people, and we’ve seen newcomers are willing to come here.”", "Electoral rules get updated all the time, Speaker. I don’t have to tell you that. Until the 1960s, only homeowners could vote in Ontario. That right was granted to those who were renters, not owners, just 50 or so years ago. As John Michael McGrath reminded us in the article I just quoted, non-Canadian British subjects could vote in our municipal elections into the 1980s.", "There’s also a Desmond Cole article I was reading last month. He was talking about the former campaign, I Vote Toronto. The intent of that campaign was to convince then-Premier Dalton McGuinty to extend voting rights to non-citizen permanent residents. Mr. Cole writes:", "“The idea that allowing non-citizens to vote will ‘devalue’ the franchise of citizens is a naked appeal to privilege. In Canada’s good old days, white, male, Anglican property owners of a certain age were the only people eligible to vote.", "“There is no doubt that as others gained the franchise—women, indigenous people, religious minorities, people living with disabilities—the value of each privileged, God-fearing white dude’s vote diminished.” That, Mr. Cole says, “was a good thing.” He sees immigrants to our province as the backbone of Ontario’s economy and the source of much of its growth.", "Mr. Cole points out that when it comes to extending the municipal vote to non-residents, Ontario is lagging behind the times, because officials in Halifax and in five municipalities in New Brunswick have made the same request of their provincial governments. It’s an idea whose time has come, but unfortunately not at this time and not in this province, whose Liberal government still tries to spin the tired line of being the most progressive ever.", "I know that we may take the right to vote for granted; voter turnout at the municipal level in Ontario hovers in the 30% range in many locations. Some politicians see extending voting rights to non-residents as an idea to boost that percentage, but it also sends a powerful message to people from other countries who maybe never had the right to vote: “Not only do we welcome you to your new home, but we value your opinion and we want you to have a say in how we run our schools and our municipalities. You are the ones using our municipal services; you should have a say in how we do that.”", "I have great respect for the Liberal member from York South–Weston. I hope to hear in the next few weeks that she has been rewarded for her talent and her hard work by being named to cabinet. But during our committee hearings, the member for York South–Weston, Ms. Albanese, said that she believes extending municipal voting rights to permanent residents is “an important issue” and that it “merits conversation and consultation.” Then I asked the Liberal government—the proposed amendments were put in there for public debate, for consultation: “Why, knowing that the Toronto and North Bay councils were already asking for this, and knowing that politicians on the east coast are way out in front on this issue, didn’t you include this as a possibility at this time?” This was the time to do it. This was the time for public discussion. This was the time to put such subjects on the table, along with everything else, and have people have a say.", "You could have left it open as an option for those municipalities that chose to do so. It could have been put in as a voluntary suggestion. Instead, it was ignored, so debate was stifled. That, to me, is a shame.", "Speaker, that is one of the failings of this bill. I won’t belabour the issue; I know the time is short. But I would hope that others over there agree with the insightful member from York South–Weston that this is an important issue and does merit more debate and more consultation.", "Let’s talk about ranked balloting. We talked a lot about ranked balloting at the committee. Again, ranked balloting is not a top-of-mind, burning issue for most municipalities in Ontario, but it does have very passionate supporters who see it as a long-overdue concept. They see it as a very democratic reform. They say we’ve been using the first past the post system for far too long.", "They see municipal councillors being elected with less than 20% of the votes, and they see that as wrong. They want more votes counted: your second choice, should your first not receive 50%, or your third or fourth until one candidate gets support from more than 50% of all the votes cast. They see this as a possibility for more people of colour, more women, more young people being elected; in other words, more new newcomers and fewer incumbents.", "Detractors say, “Hold on a moment. This is a fundamental change in the way democracy works in this province—or has worked for 150 years.” They say, “We can’t touch that with a 10-foot pole unless we hold a referendum of all the people first.”", "We were told by one of the delegations that such a referendum in Toronto could cost as much as $15 million. Obviously, the cost would be much, much less in smaller towns and cities. Some even call for a referendum that wouldn’t be valid unless one side or the other won a super-majority, meaning not 50% plus one but 60% or even higher. To further complicate matters, some detractors say that such a referendum wouldn’t be valid unless the voter turnout was 50% or more. Obviously, the concept of a ranked preferential ballot has touched more than just a few buttons around here.", "The intent is to allow municipalities the right to deal with the idea as they see fit—leave it up to them. If they want to hold a referendum, let them hold a referendum. If they don’t, if they just want to take it to a public meeting and make a decision, let them do it that way. If they don’t want to touch it at all, then they don’t have to touch it at all. That’s the voluntary approach taken with this. After all, as my friend the mayor of Tecumseh, Gary McNamara, who is also the president of the Association of Municipalities of Ontario, says, “Municipal governments are mature orders of government” and “municipal governments are the most open and accessible order of government in Canada.” He says that when it comes to ranked ballots, leave it as a local choice for the municipal leaders to make on a case-by-case basis.", "Speaker, in most cases the call for ranked balloting comes from cities with high population counts. Eighty-five per cent of Ontario municipalities have fewer than 50,000 residents, and for the most part this is an issue that has rarely surfaced. That’s not to diminish the concept in any way. I recognize the difficulties and complexities that voters in large metropolitan areas face when trying to determine who to vote for. It’s different in our small towns and medium-sized cities.", "If those who advocate for ranked ballots see it as a means of enhancing democracy, I can’t argue with that. I do believe, however, that this is one of those circumstances where we can’t take a cookie-cutter approach and mandate that municipal councils must adopt ranked balloting. It must be left up to individual councils to decide if they want to go that route.", "I know that at one time in Toronto, city council under a previous administration was in favour of the concept. Times have changed. At committee, we were told by a councillor assigned to speak on behalf of the mayor and council—or at least a council committee looking into this—that “ranked-choice voting suffers from a number of democratic shortcomings which cannot be overcome.”", "In fact, ward 5 councillor Justin Di Ciano says, “Contrary to what Torontonians and the broader public have been led to believe, ranked-choice voting does not guarantee a majority result. RCV is a plurality system, just like first past the post. The federal United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has gone as far as ruling that ranked-choice voting is not a majority system and in fact remains a plurality system.”", "So it doesn’t look like a ranked ballot will be coming to a polling station in Toronto any time soon. That’s not to say we won’t see it in Ottawa, Oakville, Kingston, London or anyplace else that has been looking into it. Maybe, if it gets adopted and has proven a success in some of those areas, it can be revisited in Toronto. Who knows?", "Speaking of revisiting, there is part of the bill that concerns the Association of Municipal Managers, Clerks and Treasurers of Ontario. It’s the part that puts the onus on the city clerk to oversee the campaign financial statements filed by the candidates. This puts the clerk in a bit of a conflict of interest because the elected councillors automatically become the employer—the boss, if you will—of the clerk. It’s expected normally that they would have a good working relationship—even cordial. They see each other a lot, and they have to work together.", "So what happens if the clerk, in looking at the filed financial statements, uncovers something wrong: either something that was perhaps meant to be hidden or not accounted for, or something embarrassing to the new councillor or the incumbent such as, I don’t know, say, a contributor has given too much money, more money than the limit allowed? When the clerks were surveyed by their association, only 21% of them said that they would feel comfortable fulfilling that responsibility of blowing the whistle on the new councillor or the incumbent councillor.", "You see, Speaker, the clerk is supposed to blow the whistle and take action against their boss. This puts the clerk between a rock and a hard place. According to Stephen O’Brien, the clerk in Guelph who’s also the chair of the association’s Municipal Elections Act advisory team, “This new requirement puts the clerk in an impossible situation. They must on the one hand build a positive working relationship with council, while on the other hand monitor campaign contributions to those very same councillors—and bear in mind that we’re also appointed and serve at the pleasure of our councils. While collaboration with members of council is important for the healthy functioning of a council-clerk relationship, it places the clerk in a potential conflict whenever they have to deal with election compliance.”", "The clerks hold the view that such oversight properly belongs to an ad hoc audit and compliance committee, at arm’s length from the clerk and administrative staff. It’s hard to argue with that. Why would you intentionally, as this bill does, put the clerk in an impossible situation—between a rock and a hard place—having to blow the whistle if they find something that shouldn’t be there in the audited financial statements? Why not have someone outside, someone giving the authority to audit the campaign financial statements—have them, if there’s a problem, blow the whistle and bring it to city council for determination.", "Indeed, one of our witnesses is a former MPP, a former school board trustee and a long-time former city councillor in Ottawa. Alex Cullen told us that in Ottawa a blue-ribbon panel was appointed for just such a role, the outside audit compliance committee role, appointed by city council. One of its members—get this, Speaker—included a former Chief Electoral Officer of Canada. It doesn’t get much better than that. They acted on a complaint from a citizen on a campaign reporting irregularity. They did the compliance audit, they held a public hearing, and they found an incumbent councillor guilty as suggested by the citizen. The blue-ribbon panel recommended unanimously that the candidate be prosecuted. But the candidate in question was an incumbent and the clerk declined to prosecute.", "Mr. Cullen’s view is that such matters should not lie with the discretion of an employee of council. He was a councillor in Ottawa for 16 years, and he believes the relationship between a clerk and a council is normally too close to rely on this method of oversight. And yet that’s what we’re stuck with.", "There’s no reason for it. There’s no reason why the government couldn’t see this coming. There’s no reason why the government didn’t listen when they heard from the association of clerks, managers and treasurers of Ontario and say, “Oh, jeez, we weren’t thinking about that. This is a problem. How do we fix it?” The way to fix it is to strip away those responsibilities from the clerk and give it to an outside blue-ribbon panel, if you will, appointed by city council, to look at any suggestion of indiscretion on behalf of any candidate when they file their financial compliance audits. It could have been an easy fix. Instead, it’s going to be a headache right across the province for a lot of clerks and treasurers, a lot of people who have to work with the councillors who are coming in and who have bungled in some way their financial accounting.", "Let me just touch on third-party advertising for a moment. That’s another major issue we had for the committee. Speaker, I must say, in many ways, some of us were left wondering about the timing of this bill and the provisions in there—and we’re talking municipal politics. In many ways, the issues are identical to the ones being considered not just at the municipal level but for provincial elections as well. At times, it felt like we were a sounding board, a trial run, if you will, for pending changes to the provincial act to amend the way we do our provincial business.", "Third-party advertising: It’s not nearly as big an issue at the municipal level as it is during provincial or federal campaigns. What we have is what some people see as a six-month gag order imposed on groups that may have a burning desire to wade in during a municipal election campaign. There’s no low-end spending threshold that would exempt small community groups from taking a side.", "We know—we’ve talked about it in this House before—the problem in British Columbia, that there’s no low-end limit there. That law has been challenged. It has made its way all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada. In British Columbia—and this is at the provincial level—for example, if you even have a bumper sticker that takes a position on one of the platforms of one of the parties in the provincial election, like “Save the trees,” “Save the whales,” whatever it is, if they wanted to prosecute you for having that bumper sticker or for wearing a T-shirt with a political statement on it, they can do it because there’s no low-end spending limit. A third party, a charity, a non-profit group or anybody that prints off some literature and hands it out in their neighbourhood—“Save the trees,” “Save our park,” whatever it is—if they don’t comply and register as a third party, they face legal action because there’s no low-end spending limit. We tried to make that a point here.", "We know—we talked about this before—that the government of Ontario has asked for intervenor status in the federal court, at the Supreme Court, for the BC court case, and we’re wondering why. But now, when they bring in this bill and don’t have a low-end spending limit on it, it makes you wonder: What are they trying to stifle? Why is there a gag order going to be imposed on any third party? Why are they trying to gag citizens from having a voice during municipal elections? We’re only at the municipal level now; we’re not talking provincial. But if they get away with it at the municipal level, does that mean they’re automatically going to do it at the provincial level as well?", "Are we going to be allowed to speak out during municipal campaigns on any issues? With what’s before us right now, no. It’s for the duration, from the time you file your papers to the time of the election. That’s six months.", "I mentioned earlier, as the member from Oxford has also mentioned, that Robert MacDermid, who was one of the witnesses at committee, teaches political science here in the city at York University. He has warned the government already that this will be subject to a court challenge in the Supreme Court because it goes against our Constitution and freedom of speech. You can’t shut somebody down for six months and prevent them from speaking out during the term of a municipal election. He’s already warned the government. When we tried to put in a low-end spending limit by way of amendment to say, “Look, guys, just look at it this way—save yourselves some trouble. If these groups want to speak, if they want to run off some literature and pass it around in their neighbourhood, allow them to do it,” and the answer was, “No, we’re sticking to what we have.”", "There is a favourable section in the bill dealing with the disabled. We heard from John Rae, who came from a disability group. He said that the legislation makes it mandatory for the clerk to develop a barrier-free plan for polling stations at any place that will be hosting meet-the-candidates meetings. That’s absolutely correct: We have to make Ontario barrier-free. We have not been doing enough in this province since we introduced the Ontarians with Disabilities Act. Talk to David Lepofsky, one of the world’s experts on disability issues, and he’ll tell you that we’re in real danger of not meeting the deadlines that that act has placed on the government. We’re just not doing enough to get action.", "In this bill, the clerk is mandated to come up with a plan to make sure that any polling station or any community meeting room where there will be meet-the-candidate nights, evenings, afternoons or breakfasts must be barrier-free. The clerk has to go out and physically examine the circumstances of those situations and come up with a report. The problem with that section of the bill is, that report on how well we did comes in after the election is over, as opposed to mandating that it’s an ongoing process and that the reports come in during the campaign so any action that needs to be taken is actually taken before we get to voting day.", "Mr. Rae said that if you want to be really barrier-free, you have to look at the technology that we have to vote with; you have to consider methods other than the traditional methods. He wants that included as part of that report as well because, to be barrier-free, perhaps you do boost voter turnout if those with disabilities register in advance and want to vote with a PIN number over the phone, over their computer or by some method other than actually going to a polling station and filling in a ballot. That plan could have been improved, and perhaps it will at some point. But right now, it isn’t.", "I must say, there was a feeling amongst many of the people we spoke to that the bill was rushed, that it was being pushed through in a hurry for some political purpose. There’s even a section towards the end that they seem to tag on there that’s basically a notwithstanding clause, meaning notwithstanding anything in the bill, the minister, at the minister’s discretion, can disregard it all and do whatever the minister wants to do. I suppose one could say that the intent is for the minister to be able to recover from anything that has slipped through unnoticed but discovered as a problem later that needs to be fixed. But it could also be seen as being there as a backup plan in case of political fallout or a funder revolt or anything that would allow the minister to change the wording to something more suitable to those who objected to something that was in the bill.", "We heard from a number of people from Toronto, from Ottawa, from elsewhere, who spoke of the need to allow municipal candidates, should they so choose—to allow the name of their political party to be on the ballot, meaning that it could say, “Percy Hatfield, Green Party of Toronto” or “Toronto Green Party” or “Independent” or whatever. They wanted the ability, through the legislation, to identify at the municipal level whatever political party or civic party they belong to.", "They didn’t get very far with that suggestion, but they feel it is a strong, democratic motivation to increase the vote, to say to the voters, “Look, you know what the Toronto Green Party stands for or the Toronto Civic Party, and I’m a member of that party so I stand for everything that they stand for.” They think they would increase the voting turnout by that. They believe they would get more people elected who are normally more on the fringe on the ballot because people don’t know their name; they’re not an incumbent and they’re not normally written about in the newspapers or heard on the radio. So they think they would have a better chance if they could identify by party.", "You wouldn’t necessarily have to call yourself a Liberal, a Conservative or a New Democrat. I suppose you could, if you so chose. But if you wanted to be known as a Green Party candidate or a Toronto Civic Party candidate—they wanted that ability. They wanted it in Ottawa as well.", "We had a political science professor come in and say, “Look, if you really want to increase the turnout,” because we know it’s not very good in municipal campaigns, “hold your municipal elections on a Sunday.” In the old days in Ontario, referendums and elections were held on Sundays. He said, “Most people aren’t working on Sundays.” Some people are. We have to respect that.", "But when you hold an election, when you hold a polling station in a school, for example, it would be easier for the school administrators to hold elections on days, be it a PD day or a Sunday—if you could think ahead and close the schools the day of the municipal election, because you have the security issues. You don’t want strangers wandering around the classrooms. You have the janitorial/custodial issues, as well.", "Very good suggestions—and what better time to think about times we vote, be it on holidays, be it on Sundays, be it on days when the schools are closed, because, as you know, Speaker, in many municipalities, most of the polling stations actually are in our elementary schools or our high schools. If you could do it on days when they were closed to the students, that might help in terms of security and so on.", "Some people thought there should be term limits on the number of terms you could actually serve on council. The other side of that coin is that, other than, I suppose, the Canadian Senate, which has an age limit, there is no real term limit that I’m aware of in Canada. But that’s not to say that it’s a bad idea. I mean, we all have our shelf life and a best-before date, and some people have been around—be it federal, provincial or municipal politics—a long time. The idea of term limits, I believe, is something that we could have a discussion about.", "There was also a suggestion by my friend from Oxford, who suggested that we can’t make any changes at all unless we have a binding referendum on the way we do a democratic process in Ontario. The barb tossed back in his direction was that, back in the Harris days, when the Harris government regionalized many of the municipalities and squeezed them down into one across the province, nobody thought then to do it by referendum first to see what the people who were going to be affected felt about that. But that was just one of the barbs that was tossed out there.", "What else? The voters list. Gosh, the municipal voters list is as bad as the provincial voters list, which, I’m sure, is as bad as the federal voters list. Of all the brains that we have in all the three orders of government, surely, through MPAC, driver’s licences or health cards or whatever it is, with all the modern technology we have in the world today, why can’t we come up with a suitable, acceptable, practical list of voters? It just seems like they are so outdated.", "It’s not just in one area of the province; it’s right across the province, Speaker. No matter where you go, you talk to anybody in this chamber, you talk to anyone on their town council or their city council, the voters list is absolutely—I wouldn’t say “useless.” I mean, it does have many names that are there, but you really have to dig down deep to find out exactly what the most up-to-date information is.", "I just want to compliment, as well, when I think about it, the chair of our committee, the member for Etobicoke–Lakeshore, Mr. Milczyn. He did an excellent job at the committee level, guiding us through the presentations of those who came to speak.", "I know that there was a city councillor from Toronto, Jim Karygiannis, who used to be a federal Liberal member of Parliament, who came. He spoke about the need for almost a municipal returning officer, available to answer questions, as we have at the provincial level, when candidates run at the municipal level and they have questions on “Is this allowed, or do I have to do something different?” There’s really nobody at the municipal level that he found who could answer those questions, be it around fundraising: “How much can I raise? Where can I raise it? What gifts can I write off after?”—all of those questions. There was nobody really at Toronto city hall when he was running who could answer those questions for him.", "I know that I found the same thing, time and time again, when I was on city council in Windsor. I would say to the city solicitor, “Do you think I’m in a conflict on this because of this or that?” He would say, “If you think you’re in a conflict, declare a conflict. That’s the easy way out.” He said that his job was to advise the city on municipal matters; it wasn’t to advise individual councillors on whether they had a conflict or not.", "What we’re faced with here is an act that is going to change the way municipal elections are run in Ontario. Some of the improvements are going to be accepted; some are going to be challenged, as we’ve heard; some will make some people happy and won’t make others happy; and some will be totally ignored, but that is to be expected.", "Municipal candidates know what they have to do. They used to be able to register in January. They won’t be able to do that anymore, so they can’t start collecting money for their campaigns until much later in the year. It was put to the committee that that gives the incumbents an advantage and newcomers a big disadvantage because they can’t go out and actually raise money. They can’t even distribute literature, because they can’t spend money on their own literature to say, “I’m going to be running.” It doesn’t mean you can’t hold a news conference and say, “At the first opportunity, I will be signing my application form to be a candidate for mayor or to be a councillor in this or that ward,” but they can’t do it in January anymore.", "I used to take advantage of that when I ran. You’d register early and get noticed every time somebody else jumped into the race. They’d say, “So far the only other candidate is,” and list the one or two who had registered. I saw it as an advantage to get my name out there. But now, with this change in the legislation, you won’t be able to do that until much later in the year. We’re going to hear pros and cons on that.", "I know you’re also going to hear more about the number of names it takes on your nomination form. You’re going to hear more about the cost: If you want to run for mayor in a major municipality, you should have to pay a lot more, to try to weed out fringe candidates. Incumbents certainly like that idea; people who like to run and have their voice heard, maybe not so much.", "All in all, I think that for the most part the bill has some things in it—I mentioned earlier about getting big money out of municipal campaigns. I think that is the biggest move we’ve made with this proposed legislation—long overdue. I mean, there’s just no need for it, and if we can clean up that aspect of municipal councils, then I think we’ve really accomplished a lot.", "As I said earlier, I don’t mean to impugn motives or impugn reputations by saying that if you’ve accepted money from developers, you’re automatically a bad guy or a bad woman. It’s just that the perception in some municipalities is that developers are calling the shots, that urban sprawl is getting ahead of urban planning, and that we should be doing more infill and concentrating more on the inside and building a stronger core before we extend outward. This bill, perhaps, will curb some of that enthusiasm for developers to fund so many candidates.", "That’s not to say that candidates who have been funded by developers were beholden in any way. If I were a developer looking for somebody to donate to and I knew that Randy Pettapiece was going to be elected—he always gets elected, and he always gets elected by 20,000 votes—then why wouldn’t I give money to Randy Pettapiece just so that he could return my calls, perhaps, when I want a call?" ],

That’s not to say that if you don’t do that, you can’t establish a relationship with anybody you didn’t fund, but I think the bottom line is that big money is coming out of municipal campaigns.", "In the same way—I don’t have a crystal ball in front of me. I do have a glass of water, from which I’ll take a drink. But in the same way we’re going to do it at the provincial level, the same way that they’ve done it in Toronto and the same way they have done it in Ottawa, it’s time to get the big money—corporate money and a little bit of union money—out of our campaigns, and do it in a different fashion.", "Some municipalities already offer a subsidy on the number of votes earned or received. You get a certain dollar amount—maybe not quite a dollar—back for every vote that you receive, and that helps fund municipal campaigns. It helps fund people who otherwise perhaps wouldn’t get money from certain segments of the industry, people who take an interest in municipal politics. That’s a good thing. That’s something that may be expanded. There may have to be caps and limitations put on that sort of thing, but at least this bill gets us started in the right direction on that.", "I’ll go back to the missed opportunity we had on looking at other ways this bill could have been improved by talking to newcomers to our province and giving them an opportunity for a vote. I really hope that the government will at some point take this as a serious suggestion and try to work it in there, because we have so many newcomers coming to Ontario. We ask them to come here. We rely on their skills, their expertise, their training. We want them to feel welcome. We know it could take three or four years or more to get citizenship papers. The last I heard, the tests were becoming much more difficult than they used to be; the pass rate is going down. Our municipal elections are only every four years, so it’s not something that can’t be done in the future. But to leave it out there as something we don’t want to talk about at all, I think, is wrong.", "It’s the same with the other suggestions, be it putting the party name on the ballot or voting on a Sunday or a PD day. I think there are ways that we can improve the bill, even without legislation now, but through regulation. When it comes to the way we conduct our municipal business, the way we conduct our municipal elections and the way we finance our municipal campaigns, I think there are lessons learned, and we can learn from them.", "I still do feel bad for the clerks and treasurers, the clerks who have to do the financial audit compliance on the campaign statements filed by candidates. They really will be between a rock and a hard place, because they have to blow the whistle on anything they find that didn’t work out or wasn’t up to the exacting standards that each candidate had to comply with. Believe you me, reporting on your campaign donations and contributions—depending on how many you get, of course, but if you’re getting a large number, then you have to be very exact. That’s one of the most important parts of any campaign, provincial, federal or municipal: You have to keep account of the money. You have to account for everything that is brought in and everything that is spent. By putting that onus on the clerk, when the clerk has so many other duties, as opposed to an outside audit compliance committee, I think the government has made a mistake. I hope that they can see fit between now and the passage of the bill, when they put it into regulation, that that duty can be reassigned to somebody else: somebody more arm’s-length, somebody who doesn’t have to deal with, on a daily basis, the councillors they are scrutinizing and reporting on.", "Those are just some of the ideas, Speaker. I know that there are lots of other ones out there.", "As I say, you can expect a court challenge on the gag order that the third-party advertising puts on people for six months, that tells you not to say anything about anything going on in the municipal campaign. That is something, again, that the government could have looked at, didn’t look at, but still has time to improve, should they so decide. But it’s one of the areas that we need to turn our attention to because the purpose behind these bills, I believe, is to get them right, get them right as much as we can the first time out, and try to improve, as we go along, any of the legislative changes that we get there.", "I don’t want to eat up any more of your time, Speaker. I probably went on too long, but I want to thank you for the opportunity to stand in the House on behalf of the good people in Windsor–Tecumseh and have a say and try to bring some of attention to some of the issues this afternoon." ],

  "text" : [ "I rise today to continue debate on Bill 156, the Alternative Financial Services Statute Law Amendment Act. The proposed legislation represents a complex issue regarding the alternative financial services industry in this province. The government’s motion is far-reaching and will amend the Consumer Protection Act, the Collection and Debt Settlement Services Act and the Payday Loans Act.", "Unfortunately, this legislation does nothing to address important issues at hand. Unless amended, this legislation will only make things worse. As many of my colleagues have already stated, this bill is just bad legislation. We can’t support this bill until the concerns we have raised regarding the amendments are recognized and understood by this government.", "One of the biggest problems with this legislation is that this bill is more micromanaging than creating a safer and more informed consumer environment.", "This government has a history of micromanaging. As my colleagues well know, it just loves red tape. The issue of micromanaging and creating excessive regulations goes hand in hand with the MO of this government. In fact, their own special adviser, Ed Clark, was quoted in the Star as saying, “Ontario has 380,000 regulatory requirements for businesses, almost double the number in some provinces.”", "He went on to further say, “While the number is staggering, the structure and complexity of compliance is even more problematic.”", "This type of approach makes Ontario less competitive. Who is going to want to move to this province and do business if they have to go through all of this red tape? Who would want to move a business to a province with one of the highest numbers of regulations in North America? Under the Liberals, we are seen as one of the slowest places to do business in the world.", "I was reading an article in the National Post by Philip Cross. He talks about the micromanaging and red tape created by this government. He tells a story about Ontario’s ladder law. This new law requires anyone working with a ladder in the building and trades association to take an online government course at a cost of $29. Can you imagine? You graduate from a trades school, and the Liberals think you need to take a course on how to use a ladder. I’m sorry, but any contractor who can’t use a ladder probably shouldn’t be in the trades business.", "Another example from a few years ago was the requirement to force all barbers to obtain an occupational licence with a $140 fee attached. As Mr. Cross pointed out in the article, “The market has always protected the consumer from barbers who either can’t trim properly or lack a rapport with customers, by quickly driving them out of business.”", "Many of my colleagues have highlighted the need for financial literacy. In fact, the member from Leeds–Grenville expressed concern that money management should be part of the secondary school curriculum. The need for education starts with our youth.", "An article in MoneySense from November 2013 provided a shocking statistic, that “39% of Ontario high school students feel ill-equipped when it comes to money” management. “Parents and teens want financial education in the classroom.” According to a new survey for the Investor Education Fund, 84% of Ontario parents and 70% of teens agree that “students aren’t prepared to manage their money after high school.”", "“Financial education was introduced in the Ontario school curriculum for grades 4-12 in fall 2012. One year later, more than a quarter … of parents don’t think it’s being taught and more than half … say they aren’t sure if it is.”", "Education is key. Students need to leave high school knowing how to spend their money while living on a budget.", "Our leader, the member for Simcoe North, has rightly identified that portions of this proposed legislation are incomplete. Further amendments are needed. I quote from an article in the Toronto Star in December 2015 about Ontario’s plans for tighter rules for payday loan companies:", "The “Progressive Conservative leader … said he was disappointed in the lack of specifics in” the minister’s “announcement and is looking forward to more detail.” I imagine he’s just as disappointed today.", "“I think government has a role to play to make sure people aren’t taken advantage of,” said the member for Simcoe North. I couldn’t agree more.", "Since coming to power in 2003, this government has hit Ontario families with continual tax increases such as the health tax, eco taxes, the hidden hydro tax, the electronics tax, the tire tax, increased taxes on tobacco and wine, increased airline travel costs, increased fees on driver’s licences and health cards and hunting and fishing licences, the Ontario Registered Pension Plan and the cap-and-trade program, leading to increased costs of 4.3 cents per litre on fuel and 3.3 cents per cubic metre on natural gas, while at the same time the government is eliminating tax credits for programs like the tuition and education tax credits, the children’s activity tax credit and the Healthy Homes Renovation Tax Credit in the 2016 budget, and delisting OHIP services for eye exams, chiropractic services and physiotherapy.", "The list goes on with increases and mismanagement to include continuing to force Ontarians to pay for the ridiculous Drive Clean program e-test fee, a program about which the Auditor General said in 2012, “Vehicle emissions have declined significantly since Drive Clean’s inception in 1999, to the point that they are no longer among the major domestic contributors to smog in Ontario.”", "This is in addition to continued increases in hydro rates associated with their green energy policies.", "We have issues concerning Bill 156, the Alternative Financial Services Statute Law Amendment Act. The government claims there would be increased protection for consumers in several ways. However, adding rules to keep people with money problems from accessing legal ways of obtaining emergency cash without providing them with a clear path to financial stability may well drive them to the illegal loan market.", "From reviewing the content of this bill, we call on the government to amend this legislation. This legislation is short on details, long on rhetoric and, simply, legislatively incomplete. We look forward to further clarification. To reiterate what many of my colleagues have been advocating: If the Liberal government would focus more on eliminating the waste and mismanagement in how it runs the Ontario economy and stop nickel-and-diming Ontarians, perhaps then individuals would not have to turn to these institutions in times of dire need." ],

I thank him for his contribution to the debate this afternoon and appreciate the feedback from all sides on this particular issue and on Bill 156. I look forward to further discussion on this at committee, and reinforce that our government is committed to making improvements to specific areas through Bill 156: cheque-cashing, rent-to-own services, debt collection, instalment loans and, of course, payday lending.", "We’ve just recently concluded a consultation publicly on the Regulatory Registry around different rates of borrowing.

  "text" : [ "Minister, I would say it is fairly clear that this legislation is well-intended, but it does not quite hit the mark or achieve the goal. In fact, it is a tricky matter of what needs to be done to make things right. I would say that the fact there is even a need to consider such amendments to legislation like this—and to be talking about payday loans—is an indication that we’ve got some serious problems in the province, where people are desperate for credit and are forced to go to non-conventional sources of money, such as payday loan cash establishments, because they’re unable to get credit at conventional banks and other places or with their credit cards.", "Those indications would indicate that we have people in need of money—perhaps because they can’t find good work, perhaps because we have high unemployment in Ontario—and that we have an ailing economy which is forcing people to do things as a last resort, like payday loans. Those are really the problems that we need to be addressing and fixing. It’s the economic health of the province of Ontario. This is nothing but an indication that our economy is sick and needs to be remedied. It’s taken a long time to get in this much trouble, and it’s going to take quite a while to get back out of this major hole that we’re in." ],

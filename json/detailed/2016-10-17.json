Every day, these teachers work tirelessly inside and outside the classroom. They are dedicated to our students’ success and are passionate advocates for their safety and security. It is because of their efforts that we have been so successful in our schools and have seen so much progress over the past 13 years.", "I’d like to take this opportunity to share a few of those highlights.", "The percentage of students in grades 3 and 6 who are meeting or exceeding the provincial standard in reading, writing and math has significantly increased since 2002-03.", "In 2015-16, 71% of EQAO assessments of student performance in reading, writing and mathematics in grades 3 and 6 combined met or exceeded the provincial standard. This is an increase of 17 percentage points since 2002-03.", "We’re also seeing more students graduating from high school than ever before. Back in 2004, only 68% of high school students were graduating within five years. Today, 85.5% of our students are graduating within five years and moving on to their initial post-secondary destination, including apprenticeship training, college, community living, university or directly into the workforce.", "This means that approximately 190,000 additional students have graduated than would have if the graduation rate had remained at the 2004 level. Students are entering a fast-paced global economy that is far more challenging and interconnected. That is why we need to support the development of a highly skilled workforce.", "This is a shared responsibility, and we will work with our partners, including employers and educators, to help build a strong and dynamic workforce. Our progress is the result of a collective focus by our entire education system to pursue ambitious goals for our students.", "This focus has formed the foundation for our renewed vision for education: Achieving Excellence. Achieving Excellence builds on the good work that we have done and establishes four ambitious goals: achieving excellence, ensuring equity, promoting well-being, and enhancing public confidence. Mr. Speaker, we have been able to make significant progress on all these goals because of the commitment, professionalism and dedication of Ontario’s teachers.", "Our teachers have also been instrumental as we implement new and exciting initiatives that will take our education system to the next phase of student success. For example, all four- and five-year-olds now have access to full-day kindergarten, the most significant transformation in our education system in a generation. Since the program began, Ontario’s full-day kindergarten program has enrolled more than one million students. This is an important milestone, and one that we are very proud of, as it is about investing in our earliest learners—the future of our province. About 260,000 four- and five-year-olds are benefiting from full-day kindergarten annually in approximately 3,600 schools across the province, saving families up to $6,500 per child in child care costs.", "Full-day kindergarten also makes it easier for parents to fully participate in the workforce, which helps increase opportunity and strengthen the economy. This innovative program features the expertise of both a teacher and an early childhood educator in the classroom. This unique program represents one of our biggest investments and one of the most significant transformations of our education system in a generation. We know that full-day kindergarten supports the continuum of learning and better prepares our children for grade 1. We know that success of full-day kindergarten can be attributed to the enthusiastic teachers who have embraced the goals of the program. They have worked tirelessly to prepare their classrooms to accommodate their young students throughout the day and they have worked closely with the early childhood educator in their classroom to build a cohesive and effective team environment.", "The Protecting Students Act ensures our schools and learning environments remain a safe place for all students in Ontario. Mr. Speaker, it goes without saying that everyone in this Legislature knows what kind of incredible influence a teacher can have in the lives of our children. In fact, I am sure everyone here today can recall a teacher of their own who was instrumental in their life and helped to put them on a path to success.", "When I arrived to this country from Jamaica, it was cold. I was not used to bundling up every day. My kindergarten teacher, Mrs. Perden, created a warm and welcoming classroom for me and she taught me to store my coats and boots and hats and mittens in my cubby. Her classroom was a special place, a place where I felt safe and included.", "A great teacher can make the words of a good book come to life. A great teacher can show you how an abstract math problem can have a real-world application. A great teacher can use inquiry to motivate a deaf child to learn to communicate in multiple languages and ignite a passion for learning. A great teacher can see the potential for success in every child.", "Mr. Speaker, this describes the vast majority of teachers across Ontario. It is what sets our publicly funded education system apart from so many other jurisdictions. Whether our education sector thrives is based on the quality of our people, and we are privileged to have some of the best people right here in Ontario. Our teachers work hard every day supporting all of our students, including students from indigenous communities and students with special education needs.", "Along with quality, dedicated teachers also ensure our students are able to learn in a safe and accepting environment. Students who feel safe, welcome and connected to school are more likely to succeed academically, and they cannot be expected to reach their full potential in a school environment where they feel intimidated. This is why we need the Protecting Students Act to become law.", "As a citizen of Ontario and the Minister of Education, I want all children in Ontario to feel safe and protected when they walk through their school doors each and every morning. That is why our government has taken a number of steps to increase the safety and security of our students. For example, we introduced the Accepting Schools Act nearly four years ago. The act requires all school boards to take preventive measures against bullying, consider tougher consequences for bullying in certain circumstances, and support students who want to promote understanding and respect for all. But more than any other legal requirement, the legislation sends a strong message that respect and understanding for all students, regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, disability or any other factor, are important components of a safe and inclusive school environment.", "We were incredibly pleased as a government that so many teachers were some of the first people to be enthusiastic supporters of the Accepting Schools Act.", "Mr. Speaker, we have had an ongoing commitment to student safety in Ontario. It is a commitment that continues through to today with the Protecting Students Act.", "While we know that the vast majority of teachers are committed to the success and safety of their students, we need to ensure that in those rare circumstances when discipline is necessary, teachers, students, parents and administrators can count on a disciplinary system that is transparent, fair and effective.", "The Ontario College of Teachers is an independent regulatory body that is responsible for regulating the teaching profession in Ontario, including disciplinary proceedings. These proposed changes would help give the college the tools it needs to ensure there is a transparent process in place when disciplinary action is required. It would also give the college an increased ability to protect our students when there may be an immediate danger to a student.", "Most of the proposed changes in the bill reflect recommendations from a review of the college’s investigation and disciplinary procedures conducted by the Honourable Justice Patrick LeSage. LeSage’s report contained 49 recommendations to modernize the Ontario College of Teachers’ investigation and disciplinary practices. Since the release of the report, our government has been working closely with the college to address all 49 recommendations. For example, back in January 2013 the college began posting the outcomes of disciplinary proceedings on their website to ensure these decisions were open and transparent to the public. We’ve continued to work with the college in other areas where they could take action to address the recommendations on their own.", "I want to acknowledge the leadership at the college, not only for asking Justice LeSage to conduct the review, but also for moving quickly to address his recommendations. However, while the government and the college have been working hard to address many of the recommendations, some of the recommendations require legislative changes. The Protecting Students Act would address the remaining recommendations. The proposed legislation and subsequent regulations in the Protecting Students Act, Bill 37, would improve the college’s disciplinary processes, reduce the potential for conflicts of interest, and help increase the protection of our students.", "Mr. Speaker, I know that the associate minister and the parliamentary assistant will go further into details about the legislation, but I want to take this opportunity to talk about a few key elements of the bill.", "First, the legislation would, if passed, ensure that a teacher’s certificate is automatically revoked if they have been found guilty of sexual abuse or acts relating to child pornography. This is an area where we are actually proposing stronger provisions than what Justice LeSage originally recommended. While Mr. LeSage did not recommend mandatory revocation of a certificate, we don’t believe there is any reasonable circumstance where there is a confirmed case of sexual abuse or child pornography, where a teacher should be able to keep their teaching certificate.", "There’s also a provision in the bill that would prevent an individual from reapplying to the college for a teaching certificate for five years if they have been found guilty of sexual abuse or child pornography. While someone could reapply after five years, there would have to be a public hearing of the discipline committee to determine whether or not their certificate should be reissued. In addition, a notation of every revocation of a certificate of registration is kept on the college’s public register forever.", "Mr. Speaker, the five-year time period is an increase compared to the minimum of one year as currently provided in the Ontario College of Teachers Act. The five-year time period is also consistent with other regulated professions in the health sector.", "Another component of Bill 37 would allow the college to move swiftly and decisively if the college has reasonable grounds to believe that a child is at risk of harm or injury. If such a case arises, the college would have the ability to suspend a member’s certificate and notify the school board immediately so as to limit the risk of the teacher remaining in the classroom.", "Mr. Speaker, these are examples of the provisions in this bill that would improve the protection of our students and enhance the efficiency and transparency of Ontario College of Teachers disciplinary processes. These are processes that we know the vast majority of teachers will never experience, and only in rare circumstances do our teachers require disciplinary action. But in those rare cases where they do, there needs to be a process in place that is fair, effective and transparent. Teachers need to know that if there are allegations made against them, the discipline process will not drag on unnecessarily. And it is important for parents to know that the college has taken swift and appropriate action when discipline is required, especially in cases involving sexual abuse or child pornography. By improving the disciplinary process for these rare circumstances, we can increase the already strong public confidence in the vast majority of teachers who dedicate their lives to helping our students succeed every day.", "This proposed legislation, if passed, would strengthen the authority of the Ontario College of Teachers to take action, while ensuring the process is open and transparent for everyone involved.", "Mr. Speaker, this is one more example of our commitment to improve student safety and well-being so our children have every opportunity to succeed.", "I look forward to the support of all members of this Legislature on this very important piece of legislation.", "Now I am pleased to have my colleague the Associate Minister of Education responsible for child care and early years, Indira Naidoo-Harris, speak to how the bill is aligned with our child care strategy." ],

While the recommendations from Justice LeSage were directed at the Ontario College of Teachers, they were also applicable to the College of Early Childhood Educators, as their mandate is to govern and regulate early childhood educators. Therefore, amendments to the Early Childhood Educators Act were included under the Child Care Modernization Act to align with the anticipated amendments to the Ontario College of Teachers Act. The amendments to the Early Childhood Educators Act came into force in August 2015, and the College of Early Childhood Educators has already implemented these provisions under the act. Further amendments to the Early Childhood Educators Act have been introduced in this bill to ensure a more complete alignment with the proposed amendments to the Ontario College of Teachers Act.", "If passed, the proposed legislation would ensure greater transparency, accountability and efficiency in the disciplinary practices at the Ontario College of Teachers and College of Early Childhood Educators, to increase public confidence and child and student safety. That’s why we’re here today and that’s what we’re here to talk about.", "Our government is committed to providing a high-quality and accessible child care and early years program. The Child Care and Early Years Act provides a new legislative framework to support a more responsive, high-quality and accessible child care and early years system that will better serve Ontario’s children and families. But it is not just about policy and legislation. We want to ensure that families have easy access to affordable and high-quality child care.", "Mr. Speaker, every child deserves the best possible start in life, and it is our responsibility to make sure Ontario families have the right supports so children can grow and learn in a healthy environment. We want to make everyday life easier for families all across Ontario. We want to give more parents the choice: the choice about whether to stay home or to go to work, and the choice in terms of giving them peace of mind, having them know that their children are in a safe learning environment.", "That’s why we’re creating 100,000 new child care spaces over the next five years across the province for our zero-to-four-year-olds. This is an historic investment, one that will transform the way we deliver child care in Ontario. This will help to meet the demands of a growing and changing province, and it will help more working families in Ontario to access quality, affordable care.", "We know that today, approximately 20% of zero-to-four-year-olds in Ontario are in licensed child care, and it’s estimated that demand is much higher. Our commitment is about adding another 100,000 spaces that will have a significant impact for these young children. In fact, it will double the number of spaces for this age group, providing access to 40% of Ontario children under the age of four, and it will help people in their everyday lives. It will help them by promoting early learning and development while helping more parents find the care they so urgently need.", "We’ve heard from parents, we’ve heard from caregivers and families, and we’ve heard from our child care and early years partners. What we’ve heard is this: There are not enough licensed child care spaces for the parents, families and children who need them. That’s why we are investing in our children’s future and the future of Ontario.", "I want to point out that our commitment to create 100,000 new spaces will result in school-based, community-based and home-based child care expansion across the province. Increasing the number of child care spaces will involve new construction as well as retrofitting existing excess space. We will work closely with our municipal partners to increase the number of spaces by looking at community and workplace settings.", "Mr. Speaker, I can tell you that our plan to create 100,000 new child care spaces is just part of our long-term child care plan. Our government has been working very hard to modernize our child care and early years system. This is all part of our promise to students and parents that Ontario will continue to develop a world-class child care and early years system to match its world-class publicly funded education system.", "Since 2003, our government has increased the number of licensed child care spaces in Ontario to almost 351,000. That’s an increase of 87% over that time. In fact, in just the past three years alone, the number of licensed child care spaces has increased by more than 56,000 spaces. This increase is because we are committed to building a child care system that helps our children thrive and gives parents the support they need in their daily lives.", "In April 2015, the province announced $120 million spread over three years in new funding, dedicated to building safe, high-quality licensed child care spaces in schools across Ontario. Of this amount, $113 million has been allocated, resulting in nearly 3,800 new licensed child care spaces coming soon to local communities in Ontario. This is great news, Mr. Speaker, and news that we can all be proud of.", "Since 2003, we have doubled child care funding to more than a billion dollars annually. That’s a significant amount of money, but we’re prepared to do more. This is an astounding investment in the future of our children and our province.", "But it’s not just about investments in child care spaces; it’s also about investing in the people who work to provide high-quality, licensed child care programs in Ontario. I want to share with you some of the investments we have made in the people who support our children, the dedicated people who care for our kids and keep them happy, safe and healthy.", "In 2016, Ontario is providing an additional $1-per-hour wage increase for eligible child care workers who qualify in the licensed child care sector, bringing the total wage increase up to $2 an hour, plus benefits, since January 2015. The province is also providing an additional $10-a-day increase to home child care providers who qualify in 2016, bringing the total increase up to $20 a day since January 2015.", "Our Wage Enhancement Grant and Home Child Care Enhancement Grant for early childhood educators and other child care program staff will (1) help close the wage gap between registered early childhood educators working in full-day kindergarten programs and registered early childhood educators and child care professionals in licensed child care settings; (2) stabilize licensed child care operators by helping them retain registered early childhood educators and other child care program staff; and (3) support greater employment and income security.", "To continue to build a high-quality, accessible child care system, we need to invest in the talented and dedicated people who make it the best system that it is. We not only need high-quality educators supporting our children, we also need positive learning environments that are safe for our children to grow. Families should have confidence in our child care and education systems. This bill is about ensuring that the integrity of the education and early childhood professions are upheld.", "I would like to take a moment now to recognize the work of registered early childhood educators. Registered early childhood educators are trained professionals specializing in the early development and learning of children, and are registered with the College of Early Childhood Educators. They work directly with children in schools, in licensed child care settings and family support programs. They are the ones that we entrust our children with. They are the ones that we put our faith in. They are the ones on the front lines, shaping our kids and our future generations.", "Registered early childhood educators have many important roles and duties. They are responsible for planning and leading activities to stimulate and develop the intellectual, physical and emotional social growth of our young children. Registered early childhood educators are dedicated to continuous professional learning to provide high-quality care and education for children and families.", "In fact, Mr. Speaker, I’ve been meeting with many early childhood educators over the last few weeks. I want to tell you that they are really dedicated to the children that they work with and to ensuring that they keep on top of some of the most significant pieces of research that are out there.", "In addition to the amendments to align with the recommendations from Justice LeSage, we’re modernizing our child care and early years system with strong policy work and a new legislative framework. Recently, we filed phase 2 regulations under the Child Care and Early Years Act, the groundbreaking legislation that took effect in August of last year. It ensures that families have increased access to safe and high-quality child care.", "Some of these regulations have already taken effect, while others will come into force next year and beyond. One of the key regulatory changes that will take effect in September 2017 relates to the expansion of before- and after-school care. This change will be extended to children from six to 12 years old where there is sufficient demand from parents and families. Sometimes parents need to leave for work early in the morning, or they can’t be there when the school bell rings at the end of the day. They need flexible hours, so this is an important step in increasing access for this much-needed care for kids, right up until age 12.", "Another key priority for us is supporting First Nations, Métis and Inuit children in Ontario. Investing in early learning programs with indigenous partners is an important part of our commitment to families. In fact, this year alone, the ministry is providing $27.7 million in child care funding to 77 of the 103 First Nation communities across Ontario. Ontario recognizes the value of culturally appropriate early years and child care programs in First Nation, Métis and Inuit communities.", "As announced on May 30, we are also working with indigenous partners to increase the number of licensed child care spaces and culturally relevant programming off-reserve, and we are discussing with First Nation partners how to best expand child and family programs on-reserve and to make these important supports available in more communities. This is one of many steps in Ontario’s journey of healing and reconciliation with indigenous peoples.", "Part of our modernization of the early years system involved making everyday life easier for parents when it comes to child care. As of September 1 of this year, our government ended the practice of charging parents fees to be on waiting lists for licensed child care and home child care agencies. Parents said that this practice was—" ],

We listened to Ontario’s parents and banned these unjustified fees, and we introduced changes that will require licenced child care providers to develop a public wait-list policy that clearly explains how children on a wait-list are offered admission. It’s about transparency.

In fact, the number one recommendation from our recent gender wage gap consultation was to increase access to affordable, high-quality licensed child care—and we’re responding.", "Investing in child care also helps to reduce poverty.

The pillars are access, parent choice and flexibility, affordability, and, of course, quality.", "Our investments in child care priorities are about investing in the future. The work we are doing is incredibly exciting and is so important for Ontario families. We’re building on the great work that we have done in a child’s earliest years and right through their entire school career. We want to ensure that our students are successful so that they can grow and develop into confident, capable and caring citizens.", "Our government must remain committed to improving public confidence in our early years and child education system and to protecting children and student safety. We’re in the midst of one of the most significant transformations our child care and early years system has ever seen, all aimed at supporting the healthy development of our youngest learners.", "I am confident that we are building a system that is high-quality, seamless and more accessible for Ontario’s children and families.", "I encourage the members of this House to support this important bill that will improve transparency and accountability in the public interest and will ensure that our children are safe.", "Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the parliamentary assistant now outline some more specifics on this very important bill." ],

  "text" : [ "Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I am pleased to add my voice to those of the Minister of Education and the Associate Minister of Education in support of the Protecting Students Act.", "Our teachers are professionals who are committed to the safety and success of their students. As the representatives of the government of Ontario, we too are committed to the safety and success of our children and students, and also our teachers.", "As the government, we have the responsibility to introduce the Protecting Students Act. As the Minister of Education has so eloquently pointed out, this important legislation will improve the investigation and disciplinary processes of the Ontario College of Teachers. It will make the disciplinary process of Ontario educators clear and transparent. It will also reduce the potential for conflicts of interest. As the government, we would not be doing our due diligence if we did not recognize that sometimes there are complaints and that sometimes discipline is required for one reason or another. So for the very small percentage of teachers who require disciplinary action, we need to ensure a process that is conducted in a way that is respectful of our educators’ rights and is also thorough and consistent.", "Before the Honourable Patrick LeSage’s recommendations were released in 2012, there was great scrutiny of the disciplinary practices of the college. At that time, in 2011, the college was criticized for not being transparent enough about disciplinary decisions and also for the substance of some of those decisions. At that time, the media reported that the Ontario College of Teachers was protecting the identity of teachers who were disciplined. They said that the disciplinary action was inconsistent and that the college was continuing to list those teachers in good standing on the public register.", "This is why the college commissioned the Honourable Patrick LeSage to conduct an independent and comprehensive review of its disciplinary processes, including the publication of information relating to teachers’ misconduct. His review concluded that the transparency and accountability of the college needed to be strengthened.", "It was clear that we needed to give the college more tools to strengthen its disciplinary practices as well as open up those processes so they can be transparent to the public. That is why this bill is so important, and it will do just that, if passed. If passed, this bill will bring into law the obligation to publish details of these cases, including the outcomes and the names of teachers who are disciplined.", "The recommended amendments demonstrate our government’s ongoing commitment to improving public confidence in Ontario’s education and early years systems and will go far to protect our students and children.", "Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to touch on a few of the important elements in the bill as they relate to protecting our teachers.", "If passed, the proposed act and subsequent regulations will help address any perception of conflict of interest at the college. Ontarians expect the college to govern the teaching profession independently, because even the perception of a conflict of interest has the potential to erode some of that public confidence in our publicly funded education system.", "Ensuring public confidence is one of the four goals of our government’s renewed vision for education. It is something that we take very, very seriously, and so one way we protect our educators from the perception of conflict of interest is by restricting the ability of union officials to sit on the college’s committee panels. The proposed bill would provide the regulatory authority for the college to implement this.", "I want to emphasize that only a very small proportion of teachers are found guilty of offences requiring disciplinary action by the college. Our government accepts that LeSage’s recommendations strike the right balance between student safety, increased transparency and accountability, and also increased efficiencies with the process.", "We believe that our education partners agree that these recommendations are intended to only enhance and improve existing practices of the college.", "The bill would also help improve communications between school boards and the college, particularly when a school board has restricted the duties of a teacher. If passed, the Protecting Students Act would also allow the college to share information with the school board if the subject of a complaint poses an immediate risk to a student.", "If a complaint is made against a teacher by someone other than the school board, there is the risk that the board may not be aware of the complaint until the college has completed its investigation into the allegation. We think that this is too great a risk to take—Mr. Speaker, I have seen this first-hand, being a trustee with a school board—especially if the safety of a child is in question. By improving the communication between the college and the board, the school board can take the appropriate action locally to ensure student safety.", "One example of this is that the proposed amendments indicate that certain acts of professional misconduct would result in a mandatory revocation of a member’s licence. These include sexual acts or a prohibited act involving child pornography. And if a teacher’s certificate were revoked for some form of sexual abuse or misconduct, the proposed amendments would mean that the individual in question would not be eligible to apply for reinstatement for a minimum of five years.", "There would also have to be a public hearing. Currently, a person who has had their certificate revoked may not apply for reinstatement for a term decided by the disciplinary committee or, if no term is set, for at least one year.", "The act would also permit the college to disclose personal information to other regulatory agencies and to the police, to assist in their investigations. We think that this is a reasonable step that will ensure co-operation between agencies and better protection of the public.", "Another way the act will improve transparency at the college is by publishing all decisions of the disciplinary committee on the college website. In cases where allegations have been determined to be unfounded, the teacher will have the option of including the decision in the college’s official publication.", "The proposed bill would also ensure that the college resolves cases more quickly and efficiently, while maintaining a rigorous investigation process. For example, the investigation committee would be expected to review and dispose of most matters in 120 days, while allowing for some flexibility to account for circumstances beyond the control of the committee.", "Mr. Speaker, teachers, as well as parents and administrators, need to know that all complaints will be addressed in a timely manner. This provision will help the college avoid unnecessary delays in resolving cases.", "I want to point out that the college council has agreed with all of the 49 recommendations from the LeSage report. They have also provided modifications to the recommendation that prohibits members of specific committees, including the investigation, discipline and fitness-to-practise committees, from holding an elected or appointed union or association position during their tenure on those committees. The modification states that the restrictions be applied to all council members, and that additional prohibited positions for appointed and elected positions with federations or professional associations include positions directly related to the protection of the profession, other than at the school level.", "The college agrees that these recommendations need to be taken very seriously, and that incorporating them into law is a great way to enhance public confidence in our government and our publicly funded education system.", "We also think it is important to recognize the distinct responsibilities of our principals and vice-principals, particularly in disciplinary proceedings, so the proposed bill would require that when hearing a matter relating to the conduct of a principal or vice-principal, an investigation or disciplinary panel include a principal or a vice-principal. We believe that it’s reasonable to expect that if a principal or vice-principal is the subject of a complaint, part of the disciplinary panel will include someone who is familiar with the role of a principal or vice-principal and will be able to offer that important perspective during proceedings.", "The bill will also provide greater clarity as to when the dispute resolution process should be used. Relatively minor complaints that might normally result in only a caution, reminder, advice or admonishment of the teacher could be directed to dispute resolution by the registrar of the college. This frees up more of the college’s time and resources, allowing them to spend more time on more serious complaints, which would be sent through the normal investigation processes.", "There would also be a greater clarity about when complaints could not go to dispute resolution, including cases of sexual abuse or child pornography. While all disciplinary cases require an open, transparent investigation process, cases of this nature quite rightly require it even more.", "Mr. Speaker, these are some of the key components of this bill that will improve the safety of our children and give the college the tools it needs for those rare circumstances when discipline is required. It is important for Ontario families to be confident that appropriate action has been taken in cases like these, and it is important for teachers to know there’s a fair, transparent and effective process in place.", "I believe the proposed provisions in this bill strike the right balance between student safety, increased transparency and accountability while improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the process used by the college now.", "In certain places, our government’s proposed approach goes further than the recommendation of the LeSage report. For example:", "—recommending mandatory revocation of licences for specific acts of sexual abuse and acts related to child pornography;", "—extending the mandatory revocation and reinstatement requirements to acts relating to children who are not students enrolled in school;", "—extending to all employers of college members the requirement to report teacher professional misconduct to the college;", "—adding a provision limiting the risk of a member remaining in direct contact with a student when a complaint is made by someone other than the employer, if there’s a reasonable possibility of a child being at risk during an active investigation; and", "—working with the council to develop regulatory provisions relating to holding positions with unions or associations, to be extended to all members of the college council and roster panellists and not only the elected council members on the committees for investigation, discipline and fitness to practise.", "Mr. Speaker, I know we can all agree that Ontario’s children are our most precious resource. Our schools must support safe and healthy learning environments where students can succeed and reach their full potential, and part of how we can ensure that these learning environments exist is by supporting the proposed Protecting Students Act.", "I encourage all members of this House to support this very important bill.", "Mr. Speaker, I know we can all agree that Ontario’s children are our most precious resource. Our schools must support safe and healthy learning environments where students can succeed and reach their full potential. That’s something that’s very important.", "This bill is here to protect students as well as teachers. As we all know, our teachers in Ontario have done a wonderful job in nurturing and preparing the proper learning environment for our students. That’s not in question. We all support our teachers. Without good and fine teachers, some of us, or all of us, wouldn’t be here in this Legislature today.", "But as we know, as in any profession, there are a few bad apples that surface once in a while, and we have to make sure that we protect the safety of our children. That’s paramount. If one child happens to be in an unsafe environment or their rights aren’t protected, that’s one too many.", "Mr. Speaker, I am supporting this bill. As a former school board trustee and as someone who considers himself somewhat of an advocate for the rights of children, I support this bill and I am looking forward to further debate." ],

Within our communities, we see what I consider a good system, working through the OPP and parole officers. They all work together to shine a spotlight on offenders. They have systems in place of risk management, systems to monitor offenders and mitigate risk, but the concern obviously is in our schools and in our child care centres. It’s long overdue for our child care system and our school system to get up to speed.", "LeSage was well over four years ago. The questions are out there. I have a question presently: Are there convicted offenders with our kids now? The law hasn’t passed. It has been debated, off and on, for the last several years. Are convicted offenders moving from board to board? Are they moving from school to school? Is someone fired and then they reapply somewhere else? This is permissible under the present law.", "We know, based on the original legislation that was debated here, that the bill is now being amended to require a hearing if an offender wishes to be reinstated to again work with children. That was our objection to the previous legislation: Someone could be reinstated after something like five years, even though they were guilty as a convicted offender. Again, the question is raised—there would be a hearing. I’d like to know: What would be in place with respect to the membership of this hearing board? Would it have experts on sexual abuse or experts on child pornography to make these kinds of decisions on reinstatement?" ],

This legislation reflects the reality that childhood sexual abuse is, in almost all cases, perpetrated by someone who is not a stranger to the child. Often it is a family member or a close family friend. It may be a father, an uncle—someone who is within the child’s intimate circle. Sometimes it’s someone in a position of trust, like a Scout leader, a priest, sometimes a doctor and, as we are discussing here today, sometimes a teacher. It is important that we have legislative protections like this bill that we’re talking about here today to help children heal from the abuse that they experience and to protect children from predatory conduct on behalf of any of these perpetrators.", "This legislation is important to strengthen the disciplinary processes that are in place by the Ontario College of Teachers, and it is also important to ensure that children are protected in the future. I was a trustee in 2000 and was around when Justice Robins released his report and am glad to see that we’re moving forward with this bill today. Thank you." ],

The intent of the advisory is to help members identify the legal, ethical and professional parameters that govern their behaviour and to prevent sexual abuse of students and sexual misconduct.", "Generally, the term “sexual misconduct” is used in the advisory to refer to any behaviour of a sexual nature which may constitute professional misconduct. It is a wide net, Speaker, and it should be. It should be.", "Written in 2002, it speaks to the point that sexual misconduct and abuse has gained greater public and professional scrutiny, not only in teaching, but also in other professions, particularly where people are in positions of trust and moral authority.", "Members of the college are to demonstrate care for and commitment to students, looking out for their interests and reporting allegations of misconduct of a sexual nature. The advisory states that the relationships that teachers form with students are professional, and they must recognize the trust that the public places in them. They must respond professionally to victims’ allegations by collaborating with other professionals charged with carrying out the investigation.", "The advisory speaks to awareness of not only professional standards, but also other provincial legislation and regulations and the Criminal Code. A successful teaching career hinges on understanding the legal, ethical and professional parameters of behaviour. Ignorance of the legislative framework and the Criminal Code provisions provides no excuse.", "The standards as outlined in the advisory state in no uncertain terms that engaging in sexual abuse of students or sexual misconduct is a form of professional misconduct and will lead to an investigation and disciplinary action. Teachers are cautioned that the consequences could indeed include suspension or revocation of a member’s certificate of qualification. Further, the advisory states that professional misconduct of a sexual nature could involve a member’s own students, other students or children, or even adults, if the discipline committee of the college “determines that the behaviour amounts to an act defined as professional misconduct.”", "Speaker, what’s clear is that all of us should be aware that the behaviour demanded of teachers comes to them in very specific terminology in this advisory issued by the Ontario College of Teachers, their governing body. Teachers are encouraged specifically to avoid objectionable conduct or comments, whether or not the affected students appears to be offended by the comments; sexual harassment of non-students or co-workers; and threatened reprisals for rejecting sexual advances.", "The advisory goes on to say that regardless of the age of the student and whether there are any criminal law considerations, a member engaging in or attempting to establish a sexual relationship with a student is unacceptable. In fact, it states further that “any conduct directed to establishing such a relationship may constitute professional misconduct.”", "Ensuring that the relationship remains professional rests completely with the teacher—completely with the teacher. As a consequence, the warnings in this advisory are wide-reaching and spare nothing in their descriptions, as they should. For example, the activities need not be overtly sexual but may nonetheless demean or cause embarrassment to a student based upon a student’s gender, race or sexual orientation.", "Finally, I would quote from a paragraph of the advisory entitled, “Using Good Judgment.” It states, “Members understand that students depend on teachers to interpret what is right and wrong. This judgment can be difficult when certain acts seem innocent but may be considered later as a prelude to sexual abuse or sexual misconduct.”", "Then there’s another group: all of us—the parents and grandparents. As parents, I feel that we are better equipped today to prepare our children and grandchildren for risks. We’re more informed and we have better tools with which to educate them. There is certainly a risk in instilling constant fear but, to be fair, we must deliver a message today that is more direct, powerful and meaningful than the one delivered by most parents of my generation.", "Not only are teachers equipped with the tools necessary to effectively deal with the issues of morality, but parents are also given more effective means to address these issues with their children. It’s within this contextual backdrop that we examine the bill itself, fully equipped with the knowledge of the standards created by the teaching profession itself for its members. So we take a step back. Why do we need new legislation, and what is the genesis?", "For me, one of the single most imperative functions of society is to protect the most vulnerable in our society. Our children are our future, and we must do all we can to make sure that they have a chance to grow and prosper, and to do so without fear of harm.", "In 2011, the Toronto Star published a series of articles that looked into issues around the disciplinary measures taken by the Ontario College of Teachers. Specifically, they found that there was less and less transparency around how these issues were being dealt with. In the Star’s words, they found that, “more and more, the identity of bad teachers is being kept secret.” There was one case cited of a teacher who verbally assaulted students for five years before being caught. He received a three-month suspension and then was cleared to teach. If this was your son’s or daughter’s teacher, you’d have no idea that his or her conduct had been under investigation.", "In its series, the Toronto Star cites many different examples of this type of behaviour and conduct, and in many cases the identity of the teacher who received discipline remained secret, and the way their case was handled wass done with little or no transparency. Of the 49 cases published in 2010, 35 did not identify the teacher.", "Turning to August 2011, Patrick LeSage was retained by the Ontario College of Teachers to conduct a review into their intake, investigation and discipline procedures and practices. Further, he was also asked, more specifically, to examine and consider issues including communication and publication practices, impartiality and timeliness of adjudication, training and legal support, appropriateness of disciplinary outcomes, confidentiality and the handling of concerns about its members.", "Bill 37, the Protecting Students Act, seeks to amend the Ontario College of Teachers Act and the Early Childhood Educators Act in order to continue, as it should, to implement the recommendations stemming from the LeSage report, which was released in 2012.", "The government is right to point out that the majority of the recommendations are made to the Ontario College of Teachers on how it conducts its affairs as the self-regulating body. However, there are still many recommendations that deal with legislative and regulatory matters that must be handled by the Ministry of Education.", "This is the third time the Liberal government has brought forward this bill. When this bill was first introduced in 2013 as Bill 103, the Ontario Progressive Conservative caucus did not feel it went far enough. At that time, my caucus offered support for the bill as a good first step, though we certainly felt that there were elements missing from the bill that needed to be entrenched in legislation.", "Now, however, we’re pleased to see that Bill 37 will ensure that a teacher’s certificate is automatically revoked if he or she has been found guilty of certain forms of sexual abuse or acts related to child pornography. This addresses perhaps the most alarming of the outstanding recommendations in the LeSage report, recommendation 32, which stated, “The penalty for sexual abuse or sexual misconduct by a teacher involving a student should almost invariably be revocation of the member’s teaching certificate.”", "Sexual abuse and exploitation of children are unacceptable crimes on one of the most vulnerable population in our society. There should be zero tolerance—zero tolerance—for these types of acts. There’s no place for child exploitation in this province, or any part of society for that matter, and we expect all individuals, regardless of their profession, who engage in this behaviour to be brought to justice.", "But, despite some improvements reflected in Bill 37, the question arises: Why has it taken the government so long to move this file? The recommendations from the LeSage report were made four years ago, in 2012. While the Ontario College of Teachers has taken steps to address the recommendations aimed at them, what’s clear is that the government has introduced this bill three times and has gone no further. There have been three education ministers since the LeSage report, and each tabled a bill which aims to address the recommendations. But at the end of the day, little concrete action has occurred since 2012.", "As you read the LeSage report, the recommendations were pointed, and they were very concerning. Considering these recommendations were made more than four years ago, it’s incumbent upon this government to take action to address them swiftly and appropriately.", "I would like to go through some of the specific provisions of the bill at this time.", "I feel there’s often confusion in understanding the sanctions imposed through the workings of our criminal justice system and those imposed, for example, through the Ontario College of Teachers. The powers and duties of quasi-judicial bodies like the Ontario College of Teachers are too often blended with criminal proceedings, and this legislation, in my view, helps provide some needed clarity.", "First and foremost, if there are proven allegations of guilt subsequent to the prosecution of a criminal case dealing with sexual abuse or child pornography, there’s an automatic revocation of a member’s certificate. The Ontario College of Teachers has no option, and I believe that this is the right step to take.", "Second, in the past, a teacher could reapply to reacquire teaching status after one year from the date that the licence is revoked. Under the proposed legislative changes, when there has been a finding of sexual assault, the teacher cannot reapply for a period of five years. This step alone will serve to eliminate confusion for teachers, parents and everyone involved with our system of education. It turns tones of grey into more distinct shades of black and white.", "Timeliness is also altered under the proposed bill, and it’s important to understand what exists today and how it may change. Under the current Ontario College of Teachers guidelines, it attempts to have a complaint brought against a member within four months of it being reported. If it finds that the alleged misconduct warrants the “professional misconduct” label or an incompetence finding, then it refers the matter to a disciplinary panel. The hearings are quasi-judicial and could result in licence suspension or revocation.", "But once the proposed bill is passed, this investigative process can be skipped altogether when there has already been a criminal connection to allegations that align with those before the Ontario College of Teachers.", "There are currently teachers before the self-regulatory body’s disciplinary committee. Of those accused, there are some who have been allegedly involved with physical contact with students. Before a case usually makes it to the college, school boards currently conduct their own investigations. It’s important to note, though, that the boards also have their own disciplinary process, which could result in a teacher being suspended, returned to work or fired. Since the timelines of board and college investigations are different, a teacher could potentially be back at work or discharged by the time they’re facing an Ontario College of Teachers hearing.", "Speaker, it is our hope that the proposed legislation will eliminate duplication and help to streamline the process. It’s not only critical for the victims and their families, but it’s also important that the accused be treated with fairness in an open and transparent fashion.", "But it’s very important for all of us to recognize that in most cases, the accusations do not automatically lead to criminal charges or convictions. The standards established for appropriate conduct in a school setting may be distinct from those firmly set out in the Criminal Code of Canada. In other words, the bar may be lower in the school setting than it is for criminal prosecutions and convictions.", "The goal is to protect students and, in so doing, to ensure that the established process is fair and transparent for all parties, including the accused. It’s my understanding that the Ontario College of Teachers welcomes these changes in Bill 37: greater transparency in investigations and disciplinary matters, faster complaint resolution, and making the complaint process more accessible to the public.", "College CEO and registrar Michael Salvatori said, “We are committed to ensuring that our teachers are supporting the success and achievement of our students. And that is why we have been working with the government to strengthen the disciplinary processes at the college. In the rare cases where discipline is required, teachers, parents and students will know that a fair and transparent process will be in place.”", "The public needs to know that a process is in place that will create prompt reaction and resolution. They don’t want to be kept in the dark. What’s clear out of this discussion, Speaker, is we no longer live in 1968, a time when events like those we’re discussing were kept in the dark or worse, not even recognized as conduct that was unbecoming or damaging. But we’re in a new age, where information is available instantly, where sharing is seamless and where at last we have recognized the damaging impact of inappropriate conduct.", "There is an awareness today that requires the action contemplated by Bill 37, the Protecting Students Act, and we cannot afford to wait any longer. Unless we are prepared as a society to constantly seek ways to improve our safeguards, then we are failing to exercise proper oversight.", "Speaker, in preparing to speak to this bill this afternoon, I thought about my granddaughters and I asked myself, “What would I want to happen if they told me of an action by a teacher that appeared to be inappropriate, either through comment or physical contact?” For all of us, including me, this is a moment of extreme emotional intensity. My overriding concern would be that there was a system in place that would deal expeditiously with the matter, that I would have the opportunity to understand what was happening as the process played itself out, and that the penalties suited the offence. We owe it to all parents and students to have these protections in place, and we owe a duty to teachers too—of which my daughter is one.", "Again, in my preparation for this statement, I also thought about the accused teacher, his or her parents or spouse or children. It’s equally important that we improve the system by removing as much doubt as we possibly can. It should be equally fair to the accused, and by expediting procedures and better identifying penalties and timelines, we can ease the emotional strain.", "It’s easy to think about the trauma to the abused, but we should never forget to think about the trauma to the teacher who may have been wrongly accused of an event.", "This bill is long overdue, and it’s time that we helped safeguard those who are most vulnerable. This bill aims to address the remaining recommendations of the LeSage report from 2012, which made nearly 50 recommendations to the government and the Ontario College of Teachers over issues of transparency at the college.", "To quote Mr. LeSage, “It has become clear to me that two primary challenges face the college: transparency and efficiency. Many of the issues raised with me during the consultations which I will address in this report can largely be resolved if transparency and efficiency become a focus of the college.”", "Further, the LeSage report talks about issues concerning lack of clarity around reporting and the triggers for doing so for the college. This is certainly something Bill 37 tries to rectify. Yet we’re sitting here, four years after the recommendations from the LeSage report, and these challenges still exist. Certainly there needs to be more clarity enshrined in legislation and regulation.", "Yes, Mr. LeSage made recommendations in 2012, and as I said at the outset of my remarks, we’re on our third education minister and this bill is still at second reading. It’s not as though the government is running up against resistance. We all understand, in this place, the need for these recommendations to be implemented, and now. The Ontario College of Teachers registrar said, “We are delighted to see the introduction of this bill as we are committed to the timely resolution of discipline matters and to timely public reporting.”", "Earlier this afternoon, across the aisle, my colleagues the Minister of Education, the Associate Minister of Education and the member for Durham spoke about the features of this particular bill. I listened carefully, very carefully, to what each had to say. I’m optimistic that this is an opportunity to see Bill 37 continue to make progress.", "But, Speaker, at the end of the day, it’s not just Bill 37. We’ve seen a number of bills reintroduced within the context of the throne speech and the government’s claim to be seeking a new direction. But as I look at that order paper, it’s essentially the same order paper that I viewed in May. What’s clear in your review of that is that there’s no coherent legislative agenda and certainly no cohesive direction.", "Time and time again, we’ve seen this government create expert panels, or commence expert reports, only to commission further reports to examine the findings of the reports.", "Speaker, at the end of last month, CityNews ran a segment asking the government what had happened with the Protecting Students Act. The government’s answer: to table the bill a week later in the exact same form as what had been tabled before the House was prorogued and we had the speech from the throne. We heard from the government in that story, the CityNews story, that they take this issue seriously and that it’s a priority for this government.", "When I contrast that particular statement with other examples, the Tony Dean report comes to mind. Buried deep within the halls of the advanced education and skills development ministry, one might wonder if we will ever hear what the government is going to do about the conclusions reached by Mr. Dean and how it will address the recommendations that are already in that report. But again, it begs the question as to whether the government commissions these reports with any intention of implementing the policy suggestions contained in the finished products.", "Speaker, government is about priorities, and there is perhaps no better way to look at a government’s priorities than by looking at what legislation it moves forward, and when and how, and what it chooses to leave on the order paper. We’ve seen little evidence of the new direction, so while I remain hopeful for Bill 37 and it being moved to a standing committee, the proof will be based on the government’s actions.", "I want to stress that I believe the overwhelming majority of teachers, including my daughter, are there to excel, to teach our next generation and to ensure that they’re on the path to success. Teachers are entrusted to shape and mould the minds of tomorrow. They’re called upon to go above and beyond for our children.", "The American educator and author Peter Drucker said this when discussing the teaching profession: “Teaching is the only major occupation ... for which we have not yet developed tools to make an average person capable of competence and performance. In teaching, we rely on the ‘naturals,’ the ones who somehow know how to teach.” Speaker, I like that quote because it speaks to the monumental task that teaching our future generation is, one of the highest callings in the entire public service.", "While we’ll be supporting this bill as it moves to standing committee, we will continue to monitor and evaluate the bill as it moves to committee and to look, as appropriate, for proposed amendments where and if we feel that the bill can be strengthened.", "Thank you, Speaker, for the opportunity to rise here in the Legislature as the official opposition critic for advanced education and skills development and debate Bill 37." ],

Following the release of the LeSage report, our government worked immediately with the Ontario College of Teachers to support the college’s implementation of the recommendations that could be implemented without legislative amendments. Recommendations that deal primarily with internal OCT operations and procedures have already been implemented by the OCT through bylaw or policy, but there have been several recommendations that require statutory or regulatory amendments. In doing so, we want to make sure that we hear from all people in regard to this important thing about keeping our children safe.", "I wanted to say one last thing, too: that while the LeSage review was under way, our government worked with the Ontario College of Teachers to bring greater transparency and confidence in the system." ],

This legislation was first introduced as Bill 103 in 2013; then again in May 2016 as Bill 200, and, finally—oh, sorry—yes, as Bill 200; and, finally once again this fall, as it is before us as Bill 37.", "New Democrats support this legislation and are glad to see this bill has once again been introduced in the Legislature. We will be working to ensure that it is tough, protects kids, provides a fair process for those accused of misconduct and includes appropriate penalties for those found guilty of misconduct. I’ll be returning to these points throughout my time here today, Speaker.", "Since this is the first day of debate on this legislation, I think it’s important to highlight that the provisions in Bill 37 that talk about disciplinary actions for teachers’ misconduct will really only be applied to a small minority of our educators. The vast majority of Ontario teachers do not see disciplinary action taken against them. The debate on this legislation is important and many of these precautions, protections and disciplinary actions are necessary, but at the outset of this debate, I would ask that members in this chamber refrain from judging or making generalizations about all teachers by the conduct of some.", "In this province, we hold teachers to a very high standard, and, in almost all instances, teachers exceed our expectations each and every day. They are exemplary professionals who work tirelessly, both inside and outside the classroom, to deliver quality education and teach life skills to our next generation of leaders.", "Teachers and all education workers are active members of our communities and often give back by organizing local food drives, breakfast programs and charity runs.", "As the mother of two children, one a graduate of the public education system and one who is currently in high school, I have seen this dedication and commitment first-hand. From kindergarten to grade 12, teachers and education support staff shape our children into the curious, compassionate, generous and thought-provoking people they become, and for that, I want to personally say thank you.", "Our teachers and all our education workers are some of the best advocates for quality education in Ontario. Whether it’s the ongoing fight to reverse short-sighted cuts to education funding, forcing the government to keep the commitments it made on class sizes, or the ongoing efforts to improve health and safety, all education workers across Ontario are leaders in the struggle for quality education as well as a safe working and learning environment. We must remember this throughout the discussion on Bill 37.", "Perhaps one of the most talked-about provisions of this legislation is the obligation of the college to revoke a teaching certificate when teachers are convicted of sexual abuse or child pornography. Currently, when teachers are found guilty of sexual abuse or child pornography, a discipline committee of the Ontario College of Teachers will typically revoke their teaching certificate, but it is not mandated to do so.", "Moving forward, we must remember that it is only in the rarest of circumstances that members of the college will act in such a way as to cause their certificate to be revoked on these grounds. I cannot stress this enough. There is no question that children need to be protected from misconduct and abuse in schools, and I think the legislation before us today achieves this goal.", "We all, whether MPPs, parents or teachers, recognize that we must have proper oversight and measures in place to ensure crimes are punished and kids are protected. New Democrats are committed to making every school in Ontario safe for every child. We need to prevent bullying, misconduct and systemic problems that let kids fall behind.", "This is an important bill and a very important discussion. It also allows us to consider other ways we can improve our schools through greater funding equity and more supports for teachers. For instance, while this government underfunds special education, all of those in the classroom suffer. Students are not given the opportunity to succeed. Some are even sent home because the school does not have the resources necessary to support students. Rather than providing education workers with the tools and resources they need to do their job effectively and safely, teachers are wearing Kevlar jackets and shin guards as a precaution against classroom disruptions.", "For those who aren’t aware of what Kevlar is, Kevlar is the same material that our police officers, our border agents, those within corrections—it’s the same material that goes into the bulletproof vests that they wear on the front lines.", "While we are glad to see legislation introduced today that works to protect students in areas of sexual assault and professional misconduct, more must be done to reduce bullying and in-classroom violence. These two are areas that must be improved upon, to protect everyone in the classroom. Requiring education workers—and that’s important, because right now, they are required—to wear Kevlar is not a solution.", "Speaker, we’ve heard stories about students who have been involved in a physical altercation through no fault of their own. We’ve had a special education student who has had something happen in order to trigger a behavioural incident, and other students within the classrooms or within the school are then triggered by that behaviour, and it adversely affects everybody in that school—not just the student who initially triggered, but all of those around them. Making our education workers wear Kevlar in the school system is not the answer to the problem. The government adequately funding a system so that students have the supports they need, so we don’t see these behavioural issues—that’s the solution, and that’s the direction the government should be going in.", "I’d like to commend all teachers, education workers, parents and families for their advocacy for and desire to have a system of special education supports for students based on individual student needs, not numbers, as we are currently seeing.", "Speaker, we’ve seen that across the province, whether it’s in our urban areas or in our rural areas, more and more boards are being forced to look at closing a great number of their schools rather than looking at how those schools service the community and service the children in that community. We’ve seen more and more schools laying off or firing the staff that would assist children with special education needs. In turn, that means that those left in the classroom with these students don’t have the resources they need to be able to reach these individuals.", "Now, one of the questions we must ask about this legislation is why it has taken so long to reach this stage of the legislative process. After all, the report that this legislation is based on was released in 2011, and the initial Protecting Students Act was brought forward in 2013. If this government truly believes that this legislation is necessary, why haven’t they made it a priority over the past three years? Why was cancelling gas plant contracts more of a priority than passing the Protecting Students Act? Why was prorogation more of a priority than passing the Protecting Students Act, when it was before this chamber as Bill 200 just this spring? Speaker, at every turn, this government has shown that while they like to talk about what they are doing for parents, for students and education workers, they will always put their own interests first.", "As I have stated in the introduction, this bill has appeared before this chamber in various forms dating back to 2013. It actually predates my time as an MPP. In 2011, the Ontario College of Teachers appointed the Honourable Patrick LeSage to review its investigation and disciplinary procedures and dispute resolution program.", "For some context, the College of Teachers officially opened on May 20, 1997. Prior to the establishment of the Ontario College of Teachers, the Minister of Education had the power to cancel or suspend a teacher’s certificate. To guide and inform these decisions, the minister considered recommendations made by the relations and discipline committee of the Ontario Teachers’ Federation, acting pursuant to the Teaching Profession Act. In part, this was a response to the 1994 report of the Royal Commission on Learning, For the Love of Learning. The report, in part, argued that the teaching profession should be self-regulating, similar to doctors, nurses and other professions.", "On July 5, 1996, the Ontario College of Teachers Act was proclaimed into law and the college was created. The mandate for the college, as outlined in the act, was to license teachers in Ontario, set and maintain standards for the teaching profession, implement a disciplinary process, as well as accredit teacher education programs. Today, anyone teaching at a publicly funded school in Ontario must be a member in good standing of the college.", "In general, the objectives of the college include:", "—to regulate the profession of teaching and to govern its members;", "—to develop, establish and maintain qualifications for membership in the college;", "—to accredit professional teacher education programs and ongoing education programs offered by post-secondary educational institutions and other bodies;", "—to issue, renew, amend, suspend, cancel, revoke and reinstate certificates of qualification and registration, including additional certificates for supervisory officers;", "—to provide for the ongoing education of members of the college;", "—to establish and enforce professional standards and ethical standards applicable to members of the college;", "—to receive and investigate complaints against members of the college and to deal with discipline and fitness to practise issues; and", "—to communicate with the public on behalf of the members of the college.", "The full objectives of the college are outlined in the Ontario College of Teachers Act.", "As I’ve stated earlier on, prior to the establishment of the college, the Ontario Teachers’ Federation had a much larger role in disciplining and the revoking of teachers’ certificates. That said, we still have an Ontario Teachers’ Federation today. It seems necessary to further clarify the roles of the Ontario College of Teachers and the Ontario Teachers’ Federation. We need to ensure that both are, at all times, acting within their established mandates. I’ll return to this point later on.", "Over the years, the college has conducted a number of reviews to determine how it is meeting these objectives and how it carries out its responsibilities. Often, these reviews are conducted by an independent expert and focus on various aspects of the college’s mandate and practices. In 1999, the Honourable Sydney L. Robins, former judge for the Court of Appeal for Ontario, conducted a review, Protecting Our Students, following the conviction of a teacher in 1996 for sex crimes that spanned 20 years. The report stated that these crimes “represent the ultimate breach of the trust reposed in a teacher.” It became clear that the educational system had failed its victims. Justice Robins made 101 recommendations to ensure that those crimes did not happen again. Those recommendations specifically addressed teacher-student sexual misconduct in the elementary and secondary school system.", "Children are our most precious asset. Schools must provide a safe and welcome environment where our children can grow as learners and future leaders. As Justice Robins stated, “When a school environment is poisoned by sexual crimes or harassment, it is of fundamental concern to us all.”", "The report uncovered a reluctance on the part of teachers to report suspected misconduct by a colleague, a failure to act upon the disclosures of misconduct and the transfer of a suspected perpetrator from school to school. When the classroom environment is poisoned by sexual misconduct, the victims must have fair and transparent recourse. The issues raised in Justice Robins’s report sparked the need for change in Ontario.", "It would be very remiss of me not to again mention that these circumstances are very, very rare. To quote the Robins report directly: “The vast majority of teachers are unquestionably highly dedicated and caring professionals who seek to ensure a safe learning environment for their students. They are no doubt appalled by” improper conduct.", "Speaker, I think that most of my colleagues in this caucus have heard stories about the things that teachers do above and beyond the school day. I recently heard a story of a teacher from Toronto who helped his students put together an art installation for Nuit Blanche. Everybody from the area knows how difficult it is to get accepted to be an exhibitor. This particular teacher spent, I believe, 16 hours of his own time overnight. These installations are up overnight, so the teachers and the other artists camp out overnight with their art installations. This is outside of classroom time. This is not stuff that is funded through the ministry or through the school boards to the teachers. This is something done on their own time. There is also a cost to the teacher because the teacher then puts forward the money for the art supplies.", "We’ve heard many other stories just recently, again, here in Toronto when the children returned to school in September and how hot it was in the classrooms because, as we know, many of the schools do not have adequate heating and cooling—and that’s something I’ll address later on in my comments. The students were actually getting to the point where they were so hot, they couldn’t concentrate in the classroom. We’ve seen reports across the province where students were actually passing out in their classrooms.", "This teacher went out and out of her own pocket spent $500 in order to be able to put an air conditioner in a classroom so that her students could be comfortable and do what it is they came to school to do, which was to learn.", "We have teachers who spend nights at home, when they should be spending time with their families, marking report cards, marking tests, preparing lessons for their students. Time and time again, we’re hearing of more and more teachers who are spending their own time and their own money in order to provide our students with the education that they need and they deserve. That’s not something they should have to be doing on their own. That’s something that should be supported by the government, but unfortunately it’s not.", "Again, the disciplinary mechanisms that we are discussing today really only apply to a very small minority of educators. In 2000, the former government took steps to amend the Child and Family Services Act to require teachers to report all suspicions they have that a child is in need of protection.", "On September 29, 2011, the Toronto Star reported that the Ontario College of Teachers was granting anonymity to teachers who pleaded guilty or no contest to certain allegations. Cases of misconduct ranged from helping students cheat on tests to inappropriate verbal ridicule to physical abuse and sexual misconduct.", "The college was found to publish a summary of some cases on its website and in its newsletter without identifying the teacher. In other cases, no information was ever made public. The Toronto Star did not find that these instances were used in cases of criminal sexual assault but indicated that “they are still serious abuses of trust.”", "The use of teacher anonymity was growing. In 2008, there were 38 cases published; only five did not identify the teachers. In 2009, 43 cases were published; 20 did not identify the teachers. In 2010, 49 cases were published; 35 did not identify the teachers. Ultimately, this led to widespread criticism of the college.", "The Star investigation led the college to admit that there had been failings, stating, “We have not been as open and transparent as the public expects.” And, “If there are any flaws in our practices, we want to fix them.” Speaker, the public must have confidence in the college and in the disciplinary process for teachers’ misconduct.", "In 2011, the college made the decision to review all practices and procedures related to the investigation and discipline mandate. To this end, former Chief Justice Patrick LeSage and K. Lynn Mahoney were commissioned to conduct this review. The report was completed and received in May 2012. Primarily, it focused on transparency and efficiency. In broad terms, these were the two main areas the college was asked to address.", "The final report contained 49 recommendations and ranged from amendments to provincial legislation to changing the college bylaws. According to the Ontario College of Teachers, the changes were designed to ensure that the college makes information about discipline hearings available sooner; reports discipline outcomes faster; shares more information with school boards, police and other regulators; and names all those found guilty of professional misconduct.", "This legislation before us today, Bill 37, is meant to implement the recommendations outlined in the report. This legislation strengthens the process of charging and sentencing professionals with misconduct and does work to improve transparency. Students must be protected and families must have access to an accessible and transparent disciplinary process.", "However, as I’ve stated in this chamber before, true transparency does not come at the expense of due process. The two principles can and do co-exist in many professional colleges. This is a model that we hope this legislation will achieve.", "As legislators, I think it’s important that as we examine the legislation, we ensure it captures the spirit of the report’s recommendations and objectives. To do this, I think we first need to look at the recommendations individually. I’m going to go through some of the recommendations, and if I have time at the end, I’ll go back and talk about the ones that I hadn’t addressed already.", "“Recommendation 1: The college should develop a communication strategy to increase public awareness of the college and its mandate. This would include explaining the distinction between its role and responsibility and that of school boards.", "“Recommendation 2: Section 28.01 of the college’s bylaws requires a complaint to be in writing. The bylaw should be changed to accept complaints made in a form other than writing....", "“Recommendation 3: To ensure consistency in reporting by school boards, the college must better define ‘restrictions on the member’s duties’ (section 43.2 of the Ontario College of Teachers Act) which initiates the school board’s reporting obligation.", "“Recommendation 4: Legislation should require the school board to provide the college with all relevant information relating to a complaint within a defined time frame.", "“Recommendation 5: School boards should provide the member a copy of the reporting letter they send to the college pursuant to s. 43.2 and s. 43.3 of the Ontario College of Teachers Act. For public complaints, the college should advise the member as soon as practicable of the complaint. The member should be kept apprised of the status of the complaint and provided with an updated summary of all relevant information known to the college,” which is on page 26.", "“Recommendation 6: The college should not grant members indeterminate time to reply to a complaint. The act should be amended to permit a maximum of 60 days to reply. The college should proceed if no response within the prescribed period,” which is on page 27.", "“Recommendation 7: The college should only in exceptional circumstances place an investigation in hiatus pending criminal or children’s aid societies investigations. College investigations should only be put on hold if it is expedient and efficient, or if the police or children’s aid societies request the college to do so.", "“Recommendation 8: There should be a legislated obligation for other public agencies to provide the college with a person’s record, if failure to disclose it is likely to cause the person or another person physical or emotional harm and the need for disclosure is urgent.", "“Recommendation 9: The statutory duty of confidentiality in section 48 of the Ontario College of Teachers Act should be amended to permit disclosure to bodies that govern a profession inside or outside of Ontario, and a police officer to aid an investigation undertaken with a view to a law enforcement proceeding or from which a law enforcement proceeding is likely to result.", "“Recommendation 10: There should be a greater mutual sharing of information between the college and school boards.", "“Recommendation 11: Section 48 of the Ontario College of Teachers Act should be amended to permit the college to provide a member’s response to a complainant. A summary only of the response should be provided if the response would exacerbate the tension between the member and the complainant.”", "I’m going to just flip through and skip through, because there are 49 recommendations here. As I said, I’ll go back to more if I have time at the end. Just bear with me, Speaker.", "The success of this legislation can be evaluated by how well it reflects all of the recommendations that I just listed and those that I didn’t have an opportunity to. For the most part, this legislation does an adequate job of capturing the spirit of the LeSage report, with a few exceptions that I’m hopeful the government will clarify and possibly improve upon as this legislation continues throughout the legislative process.", "The legislation before us today requires that all notices of hearings are published on the college’s website. In particular, this bill amends subsection 23(2) of the Ontario College of Teachers Act by adding “for every hearing of the discipline committee, a notice of hearing and a notice of the day and time of the hearing, together with a link to the notices as published on the college’s website.”", "While recommendation 29 of the report does state that “the notice of hearing must be posted on the college’s website when it is served on the member,” it’s important to note that Justice LeSage saw the predicament of making a hearing public before the member is actually proven guilty of any transgression. The report states:", "“The issue of posting a notice of hearing containing lengthy and specific allegations, which are later withdrawn or on which the member is found not guilty, troubles me. It is important that there be a public record of the discipline committee and the matters that are dealt with. It is equally important, in my view, that a member, who has been either found not guilty or has had allegations withdrawn, should not be required to continuously face a public record of allegations on which he/she has been cleared. I do not have an easy solution to the conundrum. Some members would say—there was a ‘public record’ of the allegations against me—there should also be a public record of the allegations having been withdrawn or dismissed by the discipline committee. There is also the problem, if no mention of the results is posted on the register, the public may continuously remain aware only of the allegations and not know the result or if the matter is still outstanding.", "“I suggest this issue be resolved by discussions between counsel for the unions/association, who normally represent teachers/principals/vice-principals, and the college.”", "One of the questions we must consider as the bill continues through the legislative process is whether the conundrum, as Justice LeSage states, between the duty of the college to inform the public and respect for due process is adequately addressed by this legislation.", "I would add that the proliferation of social media makes information that at one time may have been limited to the college’s website more widely available as it is shared across social media platforms. I think everybody in this room who has ever been on one of the social media platforms, whether it’s Twitter, Facebook, Instagram or whatever the case may be, sees how quickly information can travel, even if it’s not proven information or factual information. Justice LeSage was concerned about how quickly information can spread and possibly affect a fair and due process for a member who would be accused of inappropriate behaviour.", "Now, if public allegations outlined in a notice of hearing and the decision of the disciplinary committee were shared equally, this wouldn’t necessarily be problematic. However, I would go so far as to speculate that more often than not, the notice of hearing will be shared more widely than the ultimate decision of the disciplinary committee, especially in cases where the member of the college is exonerated of the charges. We must also consider the time between the publication of the notice of hearing, any pre-hearing, the hearing and the ultimate decision. Some teachers’ federations report that members can wait up to four years for hearings to be scheduled. Obviously this is too long and forces the educator to face accusations in public without being able to defend themselves in a reasonable length of time.", "These concerns are compounded upon when the college withdraws the allegations in advance of the hearing. Justice LeSage noted an increase in withdrawn allegations after hearings were scheduled. From 1999 to 2001, only one such instance was recorded, while in 2011, 30% of all matters dealt with by the discipline committee resulted in notices of hearing withdrawals.", "I think if we’re going to publish notices of hearings online, we should take every reasonable precaution to ensure that these hearings will come to fruition. I would also argue that the recommendation to publish the notice of hearings is intended to inform the public about the hearing and increase public awareness about the hearing, rather than to inform the public of the merits of the allegation itself. These would be matters to be determined at the hearing.", "Justice LeSage references the importance of public participation when he states, “Currently, the hearing date and a summary of the allegations are posted 10 business days prior to a hearing. This is not sufficient. Interested parties, including the public, can only be informed as to when a matter will be heard if they check the website every single day. The notice of hearing must be posted when served on the member and the website must disclose each step of the process and be updated with every scheduling change.”", "In this paragraph, we can see that the intention of the recommendation to publish the notice of hearing on the website is to inform the public of when a hearing will take place, rather than informing the public on the merits of the allegation. This position is further expanded upon by Justice LeSage, who goes on to state that “the notice of hearing must contain a concise statement of the material facts and allegations, but not the evidence. The evidence is to be presented in a public forum where it will be heard and weighed by a trier of fact.”", "Here, the report cautions against any other body than the discipline committee as the trier of the facts. To this end, any evidence is meant to be examined in the appropriate venue and not the so-called court of public opinion. Publishing highly specific particulars in the notice of hearings may undermine the points raised by Justice LeSage. We need further clarification to ensure that the concerns with publishing the notices of hearings outlined by Justice LeSage are, in fact, remedied in this legislation.", "We must also ensure that the language outlining the timeline to publish a notice of hearing is consistent with the language outlining the publication of a decision and/or a withdrawal of a hearing. However, while the wording of this legislation stresses urgency when publishing a hearing on the college’s website, that tone is not carried over and used when discussing the removal of the hearing from the site.", "For instance, schedule 2 of the bill states, “The registrar shall post the notices and links referred to in clause (2)(b.3) on the register and on the college’s website promptly after the notices are served upon the parties to the hearing, and may remove the information from the register after the proceeding has concluded.”", "Here, we can clearly see the double standard that exists in the present form of the bill. The word “promptly” is used in reference to posting a hearing on the college website, but the word “may” is used when discussing the removal of the information after the hearing has concluded.", "Informing the public and impacted parties about disciplinary hearings is critical to maintaining public trust in the college. To do this, any notice of hearing must be removed when the hearing is concluded or withdrawn, so as not to misinform the public. Again, any notice of hearing must be removed when the hearing is concluded or withdrawn, so that we don’t have misinformation out there for the public.", "Speaker, as with the provisions around the publication and removal of the notice of hearing, we must ensure that the language describing the disclosure of information is consistent and clear. As in criminal proceedings, the investigation process of the college must include early and full disclosure of documents related to the hearing. This standard is set in both criminal and civil proceedings. Justice LeSage makes references to this in his report when he states, “Disclosure should occur as soon as possible, beginning at the investigation stage and continuing throughout so the member or, as is usually the case, member’s counsel is made aware as soon as practicable what the member is facing or potentially facing. The earlier in the process full disclosure is made, the greater the likelihood that the matter will, in the public interest, proceed in an expedient and fair manner.” If members of the college are better informed about the complaint against them, then they can give a more thoughtful and informed reply.", "It’s in society’s best interests to ensure both sides of the complaint are fully informed, so long as doing so will not put either the complainant or person or body moving the complaint at risk of harm.", "Bill 37, as currently written, may give the registrar discretion to provide only a summary of the complaint rather than the details required by the members of the college. This section can be clarified by the government and must ensure that members of the college are provided, to the fullest extent possible, information about the complaint brought against them.", "Another aspect of this legislation that requires further clarification involves the publication of criminal proceedings of members of the college. This piece of the legislation is likely a response to recommendation 37 of the LeSage report, which again states:", "“The college’s legislation or bylaws should be amended to allow for the placement on the register of undertakings and information about the results of relevant criminal proceedings involving the member.”", "Here we see Justice LeSage express a clear binary: Either the legislation governing the college or its bylaws ought to be amended. I trust Justice LeSage would have stated that both should be amended if he believed that to be the case. The college has already amended their bylaws to implement recommendation 37 in 2012. If this amendment is already captured in a bylaw, why is the government including it in this legislation?", "Bill 37 also amends the Ontario College of Teachers Act to require that the college post on the public register “information respecting any current or previous criminal proceedings involving a member that are relevant to his or her membership, including any undertakings of the member in relation to the proceeding.”", "While we can see how the public ought to know about criminal charges in areas that are relevant to the teaching profession, the language of this section of Bill 37 could be further clarified. This amendment seems to imply that any criminal proceedings are to be published on the public register. Any criminal proceeding could include criminal charges that have yet to be resolved in court. This information is already published to a large extent online through the Ontario court dates website, usually updated the day before a proceeding.", "I’m glad to see that the current version of the legislation attempts to address this concern by making reference to the current or previous criminal proceedings that are no longer applicable or relevant to the member’s membership. However, I still think a more robust explanation of relevant versus non-relevant criminal proceedings would be beneficial.", "Furthermore, some clarification is required on the extent that previous criminal proceedings will be published. Will this provision be applied retroactively, meaning that the senior teacher who was involved in a criminal proceeding 20 years ago will now see these proceedings published on the public register? What about in instances where a pardon was granted? Is it fair to publish the proceedings even though a pardon was given? These questions largely remain unanswered, and I hope that throughout the course of the debate my colleagues across the floor can clarify these questions.", "There is value in knowing the relevant criminal past of any educator. Teachers know that they are always on duty. The courts, including the Supreme Court, have made it clear that teachers are, in a sense, always role models, that they do not necessarily check their teaching hats at the schoolyard gate and may be perceived to be wearing their teacher hats even off-duty. But clarity is key. For instance, is a criminal conviction related to the possession of marijuana considered relevant under this act? What about after this government’s federal counterpart honours its commitment to legalize the substance? Will it do more harm than good to publish a teacher’s previous marijuana conviction when possession becomes legal in Canada?", "Overall, we support this legislation. It’s important and necessary. I hope this government will clarify the concerns that I’m raising today to ensure this legislation is as clear as possible as we move forward.", "Another point I would like to raise fits with the theme of due process I was speaking of earlier when discussing the publication of notices and hearings. Recommendation 3 of the LeSage report states:", "“To ensure consistency in reporting by school boards, the college must better define ‘restrictions on the member’s duties’ ... which initiates the school board’s reporting obligation.”", "Bill 37 attempts to implement this recommendation and adds clarity to the restrictions. The bill states:", "“(a) restrictions on the age of students, grades or subjects that a member may teach or supervise;", "“(b) restrictions on a member’s eligibility to teach without supervision;", "“(c) restrictions on a member’s participation in or supervision of extracurricular activities;", "“(d) restrictions on a member’s assignment to duties that relate to teaching or education, which may be done by reassigning the member to duties that are not related to teaching or to education; and", "“(e) any other restriction prescribed by the regulations....", "“The requirement to report under subsections (1), (2) and (3) applies to all terminations, suspensions and restrictions imposed in the circumstances described in those subsections, regardless of the length or severity of the penalty.", "“For greater certainty, this section does not apply in the case of suspensions or restrictions imposed on a member’s duties for reasons other than professional misconduct.”", "However, there may still be some unforeseen circumstances, most notably when a member of the college is assigned home with pay whilst an employer completes an investigation. This investigation may be related to matters of professional conduct, but the relieving of a member of his or her duties while an investigation is completed is not a punitive measure. The very fact that the member is sent home because of an investigation means that this is not a punitive measure. The investigation could very well exonerate a teacher and result in no discipline or restrictions.", "Will these cases be reported to the college? If the government’s answer is yes, I would ask how reporting these instances fulfills the intent of the LeSage report—due process must be respected.", "Speaker, I’ve been speaking in great detail about the LeSage report, but there’s an ongoing issue among stakeholders in education with respect to the Ontario College of Teachers.", "If you recall, at the outset I listed the mandate of the Ontario College of Teachers as listed in the Ontario College of Teachers Act. In an effort to act on its legislated mandate, the college may, at times, encroach upon the mandate of the Ontario Teachers’ Federation or that of its affiliates. I think there is an opportunity to use Bill 37 to clarify the mandate of the Ontario College of Teachers as it relates to the Ontario Teachers’ Federation and its affiliates. I hope the government will consider adding language to clarify the college’s mandate, particularly around education of members and communication with the public.", "I hope the members of the government here today will take these concerns seriously. This is necessary legislation, and I think that addressing these points I raised over the past few minutes will only improve this bill before it is enacted into law.", "I’m relieved that this legislation includes a requirement that the registrar or deputy registrar understand French. In disciplinary proceedings, a grasp of language is fundamental to an interpretation of both facts and governing legislation. It is not enough for the most senior directors of the college to rely solely on translated material. A grasp of both French and English is critical to ensuring the successful implementation of Bill 37.", "Les membres de l’Ordre des enseignantes et des enseignants de l’Ontario ont le droit d’utiliser le français durant la durée des procédures relatives aux mesures disciplinaires. Notre engagement envers ce droit linguistique est profond et non superficiel. L’exigence de cette loi stipule que les cadres supérieurs de l’Ordre des enseignantes et des enseignants de l’Ontario doivent comprendre le français et ainsi respecter l’apport des enseignants au sein des conseils scolaires de langue française partout dans la province.", "The requirement for the registrar or a deputy registrar to be fluent in English and French is long overdue.", "Unlike previous versions of this bill, the legislation before us today in Bill 37 also amends the Early Childhood Educators Act, 2007. Overall, these changes make the ECE Act more consistent with the changes to the Ontario College of Teachers Act, also outlined in the legislation. I think this is an appropriate and obvious addition to the Protecting Students Act, and I’m glad to see it in Bill 37.", "Speaker, I listened to the associate minister’s comments on her government’s commitments to child care as she spoke to the portion of the bill that amends the Early Childhood Educators Act. I would like to again thank all ECEs and child care workers in Ontario. I think it’s important that we have a government that provides them with the tools they need to do their job effectively and to ensure Ontario families have access to robust, affordable child care.", "While the minister spoke at length about changes that her government made to child care in Ontario, I must point out that the young families who could barely afford child care before this session started in September are still in the exact same predicament.", "The throne speech to begin our new session of Parliament said nothing about making child care more affordable. When families cannot afford child care, every aspect of their lives becomes more difficult. Too many parents are forced to take on and carry huge credit card debt. This is high-interest debt that they can’t pay down. It makes it more difficult for families to save for a house or to move to a larger apartment to accommodate their new family. Today, thousands of parents in Ontario still cannot afford child care. As I’ve stated in this chamber before, child care spaces cannot be discussed in isolation of affordability and accountability.", "We see this government talk over and over again—it’s mentioned in this bill as well—about openness and transparency, about oversight, about how important it is for the public to know not only what the government is doing, but what every ministry within the government is doing. Yet we have seen that when the independent officers of this Legislature, such as the FAO, the Auditor General—the list goes on—bring forward concerns, specifically over the sell-off of our public hydro asset, where they’ve been actually telling the government that it’s a bad move and they shouldn’t go forward with it, this government, time and time again, has said, “We don’t really respect your view, and we’re just going to charge ahead and do what we want.”", "I really hope that while we’re talking about a bill that’s about openness and transparency and the public having very important information as it pertains to our educators—again, I want to point out that it is a very, very small portion of our educators who would ever fall within this legislation and do something that they really shouldn’t do. While the government is expecting this kind of legislation for teachers and other education workers, I would expect that the government not just talk the talk, but walk the walk themselves and listen to our independent watchdogs, who time and time again advise them on what they should or should not be doing as it pertains to the best interests of people within Ontario.", "Speaker, New Democrats think that it’s time for this Protecting Students Act to become law. I think that a more rigid interpretation of the LeSage report will help clarify some of my concerns and work to strengthen this legislation as it continues to go through the legislative process.", "Because the Minister of Education and the associate minister did spend a great deal of time, rather than specifically addressing the legislation before us and the very serious nature of it and actually taking the opportunity to recognize that not everybody in this province has time to sit at home and go through this proposed legislation word by word—there are many who may not understand what this means and would like to seek clarification. In the interest of the government being open and transparent with the people of Ontario, I really think that the minister, the associate minister and the parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Education, instead of standing over there and singing their own praises, really could have spent the time discussing, like I did, the details of the bill: what’s in place now and what this legislation would mean, not only to the parents and children in the province but to our educators. They could have taken the time to go through and explain to Ontarians what this legislation means. Instead, what they did was, they stood up and they patted themselves on the back, campaigned from the other side of the room and talked about how wonderful they are.", "So while they did that, I’ve gone through the bill at length, and I could do more. I could continue going through the recommendations. I believe there were another 37 recommendations I didn’t read. The people at home are probably happy that I didn’t. I’m sure that some of the people in this room are happy I didn’t, but I would be happy to share with anybody who would like to see it. If there are people at home watching and they want more clarification on the bill, you can certainly contact my office. I will forward you a copy of my hour of debate here, including all of the recommendations, and take the time to go through.", "Instead of finishing off the recommendations, I’d just like to address some of the things I heard from the Minister of Education, the Associate Minister of Education and the parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Education. You would think that with the three of them working on the file, they would be getting things right; clearly, they’re not. So I’m going to address some of the things they brought up, since they think they’re doing such a wonderful job with our education system.", "They talked about test scores and how test scores have gone up. That’s fantastic. When students do well, I think what the government should be doing is standing up and applauding the educators and education workers who are working in the system with the students—with very limited resources, I might add—and doing the best job that they possibly can. So when students succeed, I think the government should be spending more time applauding those in the education system for the work that they’re doing rather than applauding themselves and patting themselves on the back.", "Year after year, the Liberals claim to be investing in education, but year after year, what we see is a government not spending dedicated education dollars. Over the past three years, the government has not spent money that they’ve allocated for the education system—but have chosen not to spend. They’ve not spent more than $1 billion, so when it comes to actually investing in education, the Liberals are falling short. That is money that could have gone back into the classrooms, to actually serve the students and the education workers that this legislation is addressing.", "When we’re talking about protecting students, one of the best ways to protect students is to make sure they have the resources they need in the schools and in the classrooms, in order to be able to concentrate on the task at hand and receive the education they need. That is more specifically, if you will, to students with special education needs. We see more and more students with special education needs who are not getting what they need, and some will act out. You’ll see behavioural issues. That’s certainly not a way that we want to be protecting students. We want to protect them by giving them everything they need to be safe at school and to succeed.", "Families understand that Liberal cuts to education will mean fewer supports for students, as I just pointed out. There will be more layoffs and even more school closures across the province. Up in Sudbury, up north, the public school board up there is actually facing a closure of 25% of their schools. That’s huge. In my area, we’ve seen school closure after school closure after school closure. We’re seeing it across the province. Although they would like to put it on trustees and say that it’s the trustees that decide to close the schools, ultimately it’s this government that forces the trustees to close the schools because of lack of funding. So although they’re talking about investing in education, when they’re talking about investing in education, they need to actually be investing in schools. That would be a great start.", "The Premier promised not to cut education, but she has clearly broken that promise to families. In fact, families in Windsor and Essex county and across this province are mobilizing, and they’re actually planning a rally to come to Queen’s Park and let the government know exactly how they feel about the fact that their good community schools are being closed and that their students are not receiving the supports they need when in a classroom.", "At a time when we should be investing in students’ future, the Liberals are cutting critical programming and forcing students to pay the price. Twenty-five school boards received less funding under the Special Education Grant, totalling more than $8 million. So I would suggest that rather than cutting $8 million specifically from special education and choosing not to spend a billion dollars on education—a billion dollars you promised to spend—and rather than making school boards choose to have to take a portion of their already tight and stretched budgets and spending that on Kevlar vests, shin guards and protection by armed guards for teachers and other educational support staff, rather than forcing boards to do that, you should actually take the money you promised to invest, take that $8 million that was earmarked for special education, and actually put it into the system so that our teachers and our support staff don’t have to wear the equivalent of bulletproof vests in the classroom. While you’re protecting the education workers, you would also be protecting the students, because as you’re giving them more and more supports in the classrooms, you’ll find that those behavioural issues will start to subside, because especially students with special education needs would be getting the support they need, rather than struggling.", "Speaker, in Toronto alone, boards will be dealing with more than a $2-million shortfall in their budgets. Schools across the province are crumbling, and they’ve reached a tipping point. The Ontario Auditor General said that more than $14 billion is currently needed to repair our schools, which means investing $1.4 billion per year for the next 10 years.", "Now, I’m sure that once the public really lets that sink in, that our schools are in need of $14 billion in repairs, going into an election, the government will probably promise that they’re going to forward that money, and they’ll probably say they’ll do it over the next five years so that they’ll have to get re-elected to do that. That’s a little trick they like to do on the other side of the room.", "As I pointed out earlier, classrooms are sweltering in the summer, which is why we found a teacher who took money out of her own pocket to put an air conditioner in her classroom so that students were not passing out and were not preoccupied with being hot in a sweltering classroom and were actually able to concentrate on the education that they need and they deserve.", "In the wintertime, we’re finding that students are having to put coats on in their classrooms. Students should not have to wear their winter coat in the classroom. It certainly doesn’t help them learn when they’re cold.", "New Democrats believe that all children deserve a high-quality education. They should be able to go to schools that are properly maintained, safe and offer good learning environments, where students can actually focus on learning.", "While the Auditor General says that more than $14 billion is needed in school repairs—and, as I pointed out, that’s $1.4 billion per year for the next 10 years—there are independent community groups that have done the math and put that number closer to $15 billion. This total—this is important to point out—doesn’t include future upkeep and renewal needs. This is only addressing what the schools need and the boards need as of right now. If they were to forward the $14 billion to $15 billion right now and the boards could fix everything that they need to fix, this wouldn’t address the future needs for next year, the year after or five years, 10 years down the road.", "In June, the government announced $1.1 billion over a two-year period for school repairs—$1.1 billion over two years for school repairs. This announcement fell short of what was needed based on what the Auditor General called for. But, as I pointed out, when we’re talking about openness and transparency and public accountability, the government talks a good talk but they don’t necessarily walk the walk. When the Auditor General comes out and says, “This is what’s going on: Our schools are in a state of disrepair. We’re at a tipping point here and you need to do something,” the government just says, “We’re doing a wonderful job actually. We’ve invested all kinds of money into the education system. They’re doing just fine. They don’t really need any extra help.”", "As I pointed out, the government has closed hundreds of good neighbourhood schools over the past decade. Now the government is actually fast-tracking the process to close schools and limiting community input. That’s interesting because as they travel around while they’re in committee and they discuss things with the public and they get public input and really take that to heart, they’ve actually fast-tracked the process so that when it comes to facing school closures in their own community, in their own neighbourhoods, we have citizens who now have less input into that process. How can the government say that they welcome more input but then create a process that invites less input and limits input?", "They talk about being focused on community hubs, but instead they’re limiting community participation and clearing the way for even more school closures. Decisions about local schools must always be made with the best interests of each child and the community as a whole. It cannot solely be based on dollars and cents.", "School closures can’t be forced on communities to meet the minister’s bottom line. As I pointed out, there was $1 billion that was promised for the education sector that wasn’t forwarded. That’s money that they could have put in to keeping schools open so that school boards have an opportunity to seek community partnerships and keep the schools open.", "The revised guidelines for the public accommodation reviews were released on March 26, 2015, at the same time as the 2015-16 Grants for Student Needs. As I pointed out, in those new public accommodation review guidelines, the government has taken away community input on closures of schools. I don’t think that anybody in the community who has faced a closure of their neighbourhood school appreciated or expected the government to limit their voice. They certainly want to be able to have as much opportunity as reasonably possible to have a say on what it means to their children and to their community to have their school closed. Basically, the government has said, “We don’t really want to hear that. We’re going to cut off input on that.” We see that here in debate, when they try to shut down debate all the time.", "When it comes to rural schools—like any community school, but especially rural schools—the government has to recognize that schools are more than just bricks and mortar.", "As I said, up Sudbury way, the public board there is looking at closing—25% of their school inventory is under the threat of closure because of the lack of funding from the ministry and the lack of foresight, or insight, from the government to recognize that when you close all these rural schools, these students are then put on buses—sometimes for an hour each way—" ],

As a parent of three children—they’re all in their 20s now, but over the years, through elementary and high school, they had the benefit of excellent, selfless teachers who taught them very well. I think that we are truly blessed in the province of Ontario to have one of the best education systems in this country and, I will say, in this world.", "I also agree with her, when it comes to so-called problem teachers, that we’re talking about a very small minority of educators.

Our responsibility is to protect kids in this province.", "But, Speaker, when it comes to the welfare of children and the record of the NDP, it’s important to note these facts: The NDP voted against investing in child care. The NDP voted against giving early childhood educators a raise of $2 per hour. The NDP voted against our measure to provide more than $11 billion over the next 10 years for school repairs and building new schools. I heard the member saying she was in favour of this. Why did they vote against our bill? In the last election, the NDP promised to slash $600 million from the education and health care budgets.", "So while we appreciate the member’s support on Bill 37, when you look at their overall voting record on education in Ontario, it’s disappointing and, at best, it’s confusing.", "Our goal is to protect the safety of all students in Ontario.

I don’t see anything in here that makes those people accountable who falsely accuse a teacher of something they didn’t do. There is nothing in here to protect people who are accused by other people of wrongdoing. That’s wrong. There should be things in here for that. That’s not there. Hopefully on committee, you’ll do something about that.", "Secondly, I think we have to educate the parents sometimes. “Little Johnny wouldn’t do that”—well, little Johnny did do that, and little Johnny is guilty of being a bad boy or a bad girl in school. The parents have to be responsible too, to understand that these things can happen. It’s not always the teacher’s fault.", "As far as protection of the kids, there’s no doubt about it. They should be protected 100% from any kind of abuse in their school setting.

In his report, he concluded that the Ontario College of Teachers’ transparency needed to be strengthened and noted that the Ontario College of Teachers was not obligated by law to require publication of details of outcomes or the names of teachers who were disciplined. He recommended that this no longer be permissible, with the exception of publication bans to protect victims.", "What we’re really talking about is a bill enacting a series of measures that’s very similar to the way in which such professionals as doctors, lawyers, optometrists, dentists and others are governed. This takes the Ontario College of Teachers, treating it as a peer group among other professions, and asks the Ontario College of Teachers to elevate its standards to bring them up to an equivalent of the standards that are practised in other professions.", "In many respects, this answers the question of how you get the bad actors in the teaching profession out of a position in which they can cause harm. In amending the Ontario College of Teachers Act, what this bill does is much more precisely define what misconduct is, what conduct is out of bounds and what must or can be done about it.", "This isn’t the first time that this bill has been before the House. In fact, its first try before the House came in the 40th Parliament, where it came before the House just prior to the election of 2014 and, of course, died on the order paper when the election of 2014 was called. It was, in fact, reintroduced and must again be reintroduced because the legislation died on the order paper at prorogation.", "Now that it’s had a chance to attract some comment and to give rise to some debate, what this amended legislation does is protect the principle of the presumption of innocence and to ensure that everyone accused of impropriety is treated fairly, and that they know what allegations have been made and understand what the resolution process is. Indeed, it implements the recommendations made by Justice LeSage to strengthen the disciplinary processes for teachers and also for early childhood educators.", "Following the release of Justice LeSage’s report, the ministry did work immediately with the Ontario College of Teachers to support the college’s implementation of those recommendations that could be implemented without legislative amendments; in other words, to take a lot of the easy stuff that didn’t require coming into this chamber to change, and to say, “Look, you can make all of these changes under the legislation that governs the profession right now.” Indeed, those changes were made.", "While the LeSage review was under way, the Minister of Education in fact worked with the Ontario College of Teachers, which resulted in immediate action being taken to bring greater transparency and confidence in the system.", "As of January four years ago, in 2012, the Ontario College of Teachers began to post outcomes of disciplinary proceedings on its website—again, a major step forward.", "Justice LeSage’s recommendations strike about the right balance between student safety and increased transparency and accountability, and also increased efficiencies in the processes. I think this is an important point, because Justice LeSage noted a general concern with the relationship of the unions or associations with members of council who sit on investigation, fitness-to-practise and discipline committees.

We’ve had an absolutely awesome number of teachers who have been involved in their lives, and they’ve made just enormous differences to their academic success. I want to put that out there. That is very, very important to say.", "This is not about speaking about the majority of teachers.

I think it’s a little bit outside of the bill in question, but we have made quite a number of investments in our schools. I had the opportunity to do an announcement with the Premier and the Minister of Education at Holy Cross secondary school, and we were able to see an absolutely beautiful learning commons room that was created for the students there and we had a chance to chat with the students in that room. It was absolutely fantastic.", "So we are investing in infrastructure in our schools. It’s just not the correct thing to say that we are not. I digress—I didn’t want to steer too far away from the bill but I did think that it was important to mention that. We’re all elected by constituents from our ridings, we represent them to the best of our ability, we advocate for them, but I think it’s important to say what we see, and I am seeing investments in our communities and across the province and I think that it’s extremely important to reiterate that.", "The third party also mentioned that we didn’t talk about what was in the legislation. I beg to differ; we did. I’m just going to review a few of those items. This legislation will amend the Ontario College of Teachers Act to require the automatic revocation of a member’s certificate by a discipline panel if the member is found guilty of sexual abuse or acts relating to child pornography. Obviously, this is not happening frequently. This legislation is going to apply to very, very few people, but it’s important that we protect our children.", "It will also require the publication of all decisions of the discipline committee on the OCT website. It will set clear rules for the use of dispute resolution. It will provide employers with clarification regarding the reporting of members whose duties have been restricted. This is also very important. It will provide the authority to the OCT to disclose information about members to the police and other regulators. It will also improve timelines for the investigation and consideration of complaints.", "I do feel that we are setting out a comprehensive process and I think that we have looked at many different aspects of the bill, but when it comes down to protecting our children against sexual abuse and child pornography, we cannot do enough. I’m going to end my time there. Thank you. Merci. Meegwetch." ],

Again, it’s a pleasure to rise, on behalf of my constituents in Cambridge, to add a few more comments to the debate today.", "I know I’ve said a few times that I’ve had children in school for decades, and I really mean it. My daughter started kindergarten in 1990 and I’ve had a child continually in elementary and high school ever since. My youngest is in grade 8. I want to, again, give a shout-out to the teachers that have really inspired my own children to succeed. Because I’ve had kids finish and who are now in the working world, I know how important it is, not only for a stellar education, to have those individuals day by day inspire and teach my children and to be able to give them the start that they need in life.", "It’s not just parents who do this—but I know, as a parent, that the safety of our children in school is of paramount importance to all of them. Because I live in a rural area, I’ve always been putting my children on a bus in the morning to get to school. I know at the end of the day, when we catch up, I want to make sure that they’ve had a safe environment. I think all of us in this House agree on that particular thing. I don’t think you’ll hear anybody not wanting to make sure that our children are safe.", "We also need to ensure that the integrity of the teaching profession is a top priority for the government. Not only is it a top priority—I know that the Ontario teachers’ college has gone ahead and instituted part of the recommendations from the Patrick LeSage report, but there are a few others that we’re just needing to address right now.", "It’s also the perception of safety. That’s paramount to parents. You want to make sure that you feel your children are safe in this area, and that gives us the confidence that our schools are safe. It’s also safety of the children. Each child going to school needs to make sure that they feel safe at school, that they’re not bullied, but they are safe at school and have a safe place to go to—to their parent or another adult that they trust—if something happens at school.", "I’m very proud of the proposed Protecting Students Act. It would make the Ontario College of Teachers disciplinary processes more efficient and help better protect students and teachers. We want to make sure that all Ontario families continue to have the confidence that their children are safe and protected in school.", "I also wanted to address the fact that because I’ve had children in school for many, many years, I have a unique perspective, perhaps, in this House about how the education system has grown and changed over the years that my children have been going to school. For instance, my daughter, who started school in 1990, went into high school in 1999, just as the grade 12 double cohort came in, and she was in a lower grade. I remember that year, in 1999, those children in grade 9 had no textbooks. My daughter was small, and she shared a desk and a chair with another student. That year, because there were no textbooks, the teacher had to actually photocopy the work that the kids were doing. She didn’t have enough money to actually have a copy for each child, so she doubled up those children and had a buddy system, so each buddy was able to get the required homework and they had to share. That made it difficult for my family. Not only were we rural, I was working 12-hour shifts, so I wasn’t able to actually transport my daughter to and from the town to be able to work with her buddy. She had to do a lot of that work on the phone. She calls it now one of her lost years of high school.", "So I’ve seen the investment, over and over again, since 2003, when this government has put in billions of dollars into rehabilitating the schools, not only with a safe learning experience, with enough textbooks, with enough equipment in the room, with enough desks and chairs for the students, but I’m also having a few schools in my riding renovated right now with the new money to make sure that the schools are up to standard.", "As I said, I know that we all want to protect our children here at school. I’ve been able to see, year over year, how we’ve been benefiting and investing in our children’s education and the environment that they’re learning in. We know there’s more work to do. We continue to increase the budget to ensure that those issues that I talked about, with my own family in the mid-1990s with the lack of resources, never happen again. So I’m very proud of this bill and certainly want to add my support to it." ],

Today is the first day at Queen’s Park for some of our new pages, and I think that if there was ever a timely act to be debating for a group of people from grades 7 and 8, this would probably be the bill, because it talks about an environment that they’re really familiar with, and that is the school system.", "Often, I think with the lives we lead as parents, sometimes you’ll find a child will spend more time with their teacher than they will of their waking hours actually with their own parents or their brothers or sisters.", "It’s a way, I think, of making the Legislature a meaningful experience for the young people, to be talking about what is happening in the education system.", "When you go into the grade 5 classrooms—which I know a lot of us do because that’s when students first experience civics in the curriculum—you start talking about schools and you talk about schools a couple of hundred years ago, perhaps, and you realize that the public education system is very much in its infancy. But when you talk to younger people—they think about the 1700s or the 1800s and they talk about school then, public education would have been a very remarkable experience for a young person then, because chances are, if you were a very ordinary person, you didn’t get to go to school. It was one of those rights that was only afforded to the very rich, to the very privileged. But I think, over the years, what has been true is that every generation tries to leave the world a better place for the generation that comes after them—that’s, obviously, their children and their grandchildren—and the vehicle we use to do that is the public education system. That’s where the skills training takes place. That’s where you learn about civics. You learn about all the skills that are going to carry you through life. It’s important that we pay attention to that environment and we understand that there are a lot of young people who enjoy their school year. They come into contact with adults who are teaching.", "The teachers in the province of Ontario, I’m convinced, are second to none when it comes to the quality of education that they impart to our young people. That goes for all the school systems that are publicly funded, and even into the private education system.", "Ontario, I think, takes public education very seriously. In order to do that, we need to ensure that when our young people are in any other environment outside the home—but also including the home—but publicly when young people are in areas where they come into contact with adults, we need to know that there’s a system in place that ensures that they’re safe and there’s a system in place that ensures that they’re in a healthy environment, and, as I said, Speaker, a very safe environment. That’s why we need to have a bill such as Bill 37, that ensures and provides the confidence to parents that when their child is at school, they will be protected; that there’s a level of protection that they should be afforded and they should anticipate; and that, when claims are made or when charges are made or when there’s suspicion of some impropriety, there’s a fair system that deals with that quickly. There’s a justice system that gets brought into place that has all the elements of a good justice system and ensures that the issue—whatever the issue may be—is dealt with very seriously. It’s dealt with in a way that all the facts come out. It’s dealt with in a way that young people are able to express themselves properly.", "Bill 37, because of the consultation that has taken place on this bill, is one that I think all sides have had a say on, and now it’s in the House. It’s designed to ensure that those years that our young people spend in the education system—that there’s a level of accountability.", "Teaching, as I said, is a profession that we all admire. I think we probably all know somebody who is a teacher. I think, probably over the years, we know teachers who have made a big difference in our life, Speaker. There are a lot of positive things that come out of the teaching profession. There are a lot of positive things that are imparted to our young people.", "What Bill 37 does is say, “When you go into that environment, there’s a level of protection that’s afforded to you as a young person and a level of accountability that’s expected of our teachers.” I think it’s a well-prepared bill. I think it deserves the support of all members of this House." ],

I went to Chatham Collegiate Institute. It was a great school, as a matter of fact. Of course, my kids went to The Pines, the Ursuline College.", "One of the things I liked about the Ursuline College was the fact that it had a dress code. I really liked that idea simply because of the fact that it didn’t matter whether you came from a very well-to-do family or a not-well-to-do family; the children were all wearing a uniform. There’s something about behaviour in uniforms which I think is very appealing to even the conduct of how these young people act. I didn’t see that in this particular bill. It’s maybe something that we as a caucus, when this bill passes second reading—and we’re going to support this bill, but we do have some amendments that we would like to see put in there. That might be one that I would like to see put in as well.", "We talk about self-esteem and we talk about the safety of our children. We talk about that teachers have a responsibility.

I suppose if we asked our pages if they have a favourite teacher, they probably do, and maybe even a not-so-favourite teacher.

I’ve had a couple of those friends who have been accused, I would say falsely accused, by troubled students, but it leaves a scar on their career, a black eye on their reputation. This bill, I would hope, is meant to do something about that. Nobody wants to see anybody’s reputation ruined. On the other hand, if you’ve done something wrong with a student, then the appropriate action should be taken against you for that. As long as due process is followed—and that’s very important, Speaker: due process. We all have the same rules and regulations to follow, and as long as due process is followed, this will be open.", "I just want to say again, as others have said this afternoon, the vast majority of educators in this province are decent people who nurture and care for our young ones, very caring individuals, who spend their own money on school supplies and so on.

It’s extraordinarily important that we have as good protection in our schools as we would in any organization—with volunteers and background and credit checks and all those things—but particularly with teachers, with their professional designations, that, should there be issues that come forward and there are convictions, they are removed from their certificates and they’re no longer licensed, so that they can’t go and teach in other parts of the province or the country.", "I’m particularly interested in the comments from the Minister of Labour. This demonstrates the class of this individual member, that he can take a bill, reflect so clearly and refer it to the pages who are here for their first day. This is really important, to have the pages here to hear about the debate, in order that they, as they move further in their education, know and their parents know that they will be protected. Because that is part of the importance. As parents—and I had two children of my own who went through the system—we want to know they’re safe, and I think this bill will go a long way to giving parents that reassurance." ],

There’s not even the money in the school system anymore to print off work sheets for these students in class.

It was a rather intimidating thing. Some members might understand what I’m talking about. But that would be considered abuse these days. That would be considered abuse because society has changed.", "So I guess, when we are trying to recognize sexual abuse, maybe back 50 or 60 years ago, whenever it was, if some of these things were done, it was just kept quiet. Hopefully the child would get over it, and hopefully the teacher got through life without too many more problems. But the problem is that it would never end if somebody started on this path of sexual abuse or child pornography.", "I was very fortunate to be with the member from Haliburton–Kawartha Lakes–Brock this year because of something I did that had to do with her bill, the Saving the Girl Next Door Act. I helped her out a little bit with it, so I was invited to the OPP headquarters in Orillia with the member, and we had quite a talk. I’ll tell you, it was very eye-opening to talk to the police there and understand what is going on in this world, or in this province, pertaining to sexual abuse and this type of thing. The stories they told us are very frightening and they are very sad.", "The problem with this type of thing—I’m not a psychiatrist, but I would consider it an illness when people do this or are caught doing this. Certainly the victims take a long time to get over that. I remember as a young fellow, we were brought up kind of that if something was going wrong, you sucked it up, if I can use that term, and got on with life. Some things are very hard for you to be able to do that, and certainly it would be very difficult, if you were a victim, to try to get over some of these things that can be done to you by certain people.", "But as we progress through time, we are in the age of technology where you can sit and use your electronic devices to get information. That’s the good part about it. Something like an atomic bomb—using nuclear energy is great for producing electricity, but it can also be used to kill people, so there are two sides to that. It’s the same with technology. You can use it for the greater good, but it can also be used for doing things that are very disgusting to society.", "I think because of technology, people who are skilled with the use of this type of thing have been able to find people who are abusing young children more easily, and so this has come out in the forefront of society in general. These programs they are using can search through cyberspace, and as I understand it they can find people who continually go to a certain website to look at these things and they are able to narrow it down and find them.", "As a child, when you go to school, you’re brought up to trust your parents and you’re brought up to trust people in authority. As a child, you go to school and that trust is there for the most part all through your schooling, but there is the odd time that, because you trust an authority figure, you can fall into harm’s way if there’s somebody there who chooses to deal in this type of thing.", "I find it surprising that the bill would require employers to inform the college when they have restricted a teacher’s duties or dismissed him or her for misconduct. I would have thought that would have been a requirement anyway, without being put into a bill. I guess I’m naive, but I would have thought that that was normal practice; that if somebody is doing these types of things, automatically they would be reported.", "It also says in here that it provides the authority to the college to disclose information about members to the police and other regulators. I would have thought that would be a normal practice. I would think that in other institutions, other than a school situation, that is being done. The longer it takes to report criminal activity, the harder it is to prove it, because you have a certain timeline there where a case can grow cold. So I would think that that’s something that if it has to be put in place in this bill, is something that’s a good part of that bill—that the authority is given to whoever should report these things.", "The new bill, as I understand it, will ensure that a teacher’s certificate is automatically revoked if he or she has been found guilty of certain forms of sexual abuse or acts relating to child pornography. I think this is an important part here. It will be automatically revoked if he or she has been found guilty. I think we’ve got to be careful with this type of thing. As I stated earlier, some of us know of cases where false accusations have been put forward and ruined people’s careers. For whatever reason, these things have been done. So I think anybody who is involved in this type of thing on the—can I say the management side of this?—has to be very careful that things are true, that the facts are true before anything progresses. That’s why I was surprised that it provides authority to the college to disclose information about members to the police. I would think that would have been something that would have been done sooner, sooner than later, because the timelines of crimes—as I say, the longer they get, the harder it is to prove things. So if there is a case of abuse or child pornography found, then the police should get involved as soon as possible. They are trained to investigate these types of things and find out whether the allegations are true or false. But, again, in this bill, that puts that in there so the authorities can be a little bit more confident that they’re doing the right thing.", "We need to protect our children as much as we can. There is certainly nothing wrong with the school of hard knocks. Children have to be able to make mistakes. That’s how you learn. But when you’re dealing with this type of thing, you’re usually dealing with a grown-up, and your trust in that grown-up—until it’s broken—usually doesn’t go away. And these predators, as I would like to use that term, know how to gain a child’s trust and maybe make them do things that they wouldn’t normally do.", "You know, as has been said by all sides of the House today, this isn’t a big number of people that get involved with this thing. It’s just a few people in society that get involved with this type of thing. So we are not dealing with huge numbers. But that one or two people that are involved in this thing can affect a lot of people because of the tools they have at hand, such as the Internet and using those types of things.", "That’s not the only abuse that can happen with the Internet. We hear of bullying over the Internet where if a certain few want to pick on somebody, they’ll text messages or do whatever or they’ll take an inappropriate picture and throw it on the Internet to bully people. That’s been going on for a while and this House has taken measures to try to stop that type of thing. I do believe that education does not only start and stop in a school, and that probably parents should be more aware of what their children are doing with their electronic devices.", "My children are all grown.

I think that part of the bill should be commended.", "I think that when it gets to committee, there are some amendments that I’m sure we are going to put forward. Some examples could be a public website that would list those individuals who have had their certificates revoked for certain kinds of sexual abuse. That just helps get the information out there. I don’t have an issue with that. If you’re going to engage in this type of behaviour, I think people should know about it. It could be your neighbour next door. You don’t know that. It could be somebody down the street or somebody on the other side of the country who is engaged in this type of thing.

The amendment, which proposes a new subsection 37(3), would mean that certificates could only be reinstated without a hearing if the revocation or suspension has resulted from professional misconduct that involves sexual abuse of a student, sexual misconduct or a prohibited act involving child pornography.", "Also, section 43(1) is an amendment that allows for a new regulation-making authority that would allow the council to make regulations relating to members’ professional learning about their duty to report under the Child and Family Services Act, which requires reporting to a children’s aid society if there are grounds to believe that a person will harm or sexually molest a child.", "Section 49(7) would be an amendment so that the notice of hearing or other specified information would remain on the website whether the notation of a decision or resolution is still applicable or not.", "I think there are a few things in this bill that are good. There are certainly some amendments that our party would like to see in the bill. The bill has been on the books for—it was first introduced, I believe, in 2013, so it’s something that I think all parties have debated quite a bit in the past and would support. I think it’s important that this time it get through the committee process, so that it has a good shot at making it through this Legislature before just over a year from now.

Par exemple, assurer la sécurité de nos enfants et de nos élèves tout en protégeant l’intégrité de la noble profession d’enseignant a toujours été et demeure l’une des priorités de notre gouvernement. Aussi, monsieur le Président, comme vous le savez, le projet de loi 37 est une étape de plus dans notre partenariat avec le collège des enseignants de l’Ontario dans l’amélioration constante des pratiques et processus assurant la discipline de nos enseignants.", "Speaker, first of all, I appreciate and recognize the perhaps unusually civilized tone with regard to the remarks from all sides on Bill 37. I think, as all of us will appreciate, this is of course a very delicate issue and matter.", "Reading through some of its particulars with regard to, for example, the disciplinary issues, the process of analysis of the particular case and yes, hopefully being able to deal with things such as vexatious or frivolous concerns, it really brings to mind that perhaps we’re bringing teachers up to the standard that physicians are held to.", "As you can imagine, physicians, who unfortunately on occasion do kind of transgress some of these boundaries, are brought forward to the College of Physicians and Surgeons and other bodies. There is an entire mechanism, a whole kind of disciplinary process, which has been in place and which does seem to work. Yes, there is a long delay of the law, as always, but I think what we’re really attempting to do, in the interests of the integrity and safety of our students and of course le contraire, the reverse, the integrity and safety and protection of our teachers—let’s support Bill 37." ],

I don’t know how often that happens, but it is incumbent on us as we draft this legislation to ensure that those kinds of protections are in place as well.", "Last night, my wife and I watched Indictment: The McMartin Trial. It’s a film. It’s based on a court case in California, where members of the McMartin family were charged and jailed—I think they were all jailed. One was jailed for alleged sexual molestation and abuse of children in their preschool.", "This ended up being one of the most expensive and longest-running criminal trials in US legal history. Their guilt had already been established by the media, aided and abetted by the state prosecutor or county prosecutor and what was portrayed as an unprofessional therapist who assisted the children to fabricate stories of abuse, devil worship and what have you. The defender is played by the actor James Woods. It’s a film well worth watching. The accusations were made back in 1983. The trial ran from 1987 to 1990. All charges were eventually dropped after years of sex abuse hysteria, $50 million and a seven-year trial.", "So I suggest, as we work on Bill 37, the Protecting Students Act, that it doesn’t go far enough. It’s incumbent on us to make sure we are protecting all concerned." ],

I think that we all support this bill. But there are some things that other members have expressed, and I would also like to re-express them. Teachers, regardless of how old their students are, are placed in a position of trust and responsibility, and the vast, vast majority of those teachers take that trust and that responsibility very seriously and do an excellent job. In some cases where that doesn’t occur, the rule of law should be very strict, which this bill attempts to do.", "But in classroom situations and in situations where you’re dealing with children and with their parents, we have to be very, very careful about false accusations and vexatious accusations, because once the accusation is made and made public, it’s all about the first headline. Everyone in politics knows that. It’s all about the first headline, and that’s something that could ruin a lot of very innocent people who are actually the ones trying hardest to do the best job.", "That’s why I think that we’re all taking this bill and these remarks very seriously, because this is an incredibly serious issue. I hope that we can continue, as this bill goes through the process, to make sure that things are in place to make sure that people aren’t unduly hurt when they are falsely accused." ],

They are trained to handle this type of thing. I don’t think a school board wants to—they only have to get involved so far, and the police can sort out whether it is a false accusation, without the publicity and that type of thing. We have to be very careful with this because, as has been pointed out, it could ruin people for something they didn’t do.", "I really believe, as we all do, that this is something that happens once in a while. It isn’t something that’s rampant through our system. True, our police forces have units dedicated to this type of thing, where all they do is look for predators. But it’s mostly because of the tools they have—the Internet and whatever else. They have to keep up with this because this is how a lot of this is perpetrated. I think that’s why society is more aware that there could be problems.", "Unfortunately, it has happened in our school system. There have been cases that we know about where this type of thing has happened, so we have to be vigilant that it doesn’t happen anymore and, if it does, get it to the proper authorities and make sure that the investigation is thorough and try to get this type of thing stopped—although that might be a difficult thing to do, as I said, with technology." ],

There was at one point a public education system in this province which was incredibly rich. It was enriched, and its goal as a system—of systems across the province, really—was to enrich the lives of children in the province of Ontario, recognizing that when you get education right, a lot of other things fall into place: Justice falls into place, health care falls into place, mental health, the economy. When children enter an education system and that system is well funded and the roles and responsibilities of the people contained within that system are well understood and are incredibly clear, children reach their potential, families realize their potential, and communities are strengthened. So my true passion really, as I entered into the political field, had to do with getting education right.", "Now, there have been a lot of comments all afternoon about the context of the role that resources play in our education system, mainly funding. I do want to just look at Bill 37, Protecting Students Act, 2016, through the lens which is a mandated, legislated responsibility that school boards have for the well-being of children. Now, this was a new, added responsibility that school boards found themselves with, in addition to, of course, balancing the budget and ensuring that financial resources were allocated in a responsible manner within the means that they have as local school boards.", "We have seen—and I think it warrants a comment—that the local autonomy of school boards across this province has been greatly diminished over the years by a centralized motivation, if you will, a centralized movement, in particular that was started in the Mike Harris years and now has been very much continued through the McGuinty-Wynne years. That is, a lot of the directives for education in the province of Ontario are very much tied from this place to the local school boards. That has affected, in many respects, the culture of teaching, as has a very litigious environment that school boards find themselves in, which has changed even the very basic relationships that we see in our schools.", "The major shift also happened with Bill 160, when principals and vice-principals were removed from their respective unions. That changed the hierarchy, if you will. It changed the work environment; it changed the strata of responsibilities in our schools, which in turn affected accountability.", "Bill 37, Protecting Students Act, of course, aims to address some gaps that have existed for four or five years now—well-known gaps because of various media reports, because school boards came to the table, because the Ontario College of Teachers also was found to have some weaknesses contained within that institution that needed to be addressed. The 49 recommendations—I think 49 recommendations, in total—look to address these problematic areas.", "But as we review how we got here, I think it is important to address some of the financial circumstances which have changed education fundamentally in the province of Ontario.", "I grew up in Toronto and I went to Earl Haig and Earl Beatty and Harbord Collegiate. I did spend one year out in Nova Scotia, where I really did have the opportunity to see what a “have-not” province and a “have” province looked like, especially from an education and a health care perspective. So I bring that context to this debate.", "But we must remember that when you follow the money, you do follow the real priorities of any government: NDP, Conservative or Liberal. I must say that in 1995, in the 1994-95 budget, when the so-called Common Sense Revolution was in full flight, $1 billion, 5% in the first year, was removed from education. It’s important to benchmark that piece of information because, in truth, when you remove that much money from education, you actually embed the inequities across the province which were already starting to show their face.", "Following that, Rozanski came out in 2002. The Rozanski report identified several areas where the funding model was found to be lacking. The 2002 date is important because some of the recommendations—in fact, many of the recommendations from that report, which addressed the Common Sense Revolution, the $1-billion reduction in funding and the funding model as it existed at that point in time—have never been addressed by this government and some of those recommendations included having an effective model for distributing funding between rural and urban boards and large and small boards.", "We see this play itself out in today’s province. If you are a small rural school board in the province of Ontario, you are still fundamentally dealing with a student-enrolment-driven funding model. So the fewer students you have in your school system, the less funding you have, which really moves against this whole concept that public education is the great equalizer.", "Rozanski also recommended that the structure of cost benchmarks should be addressed. This has also never happened, Mr. Speaker. This actually means—does the per pupil funding reflect the per pupil cost? It obviously costs a lot more money in some jurisdictions to educate a child than it does in other jurisdictions.", "Then, of course, there was a recommendation, which has also never been honoured, that we address the local flexibility of expenditures for school boards, because there was this premise, there was this thought at one point in the history of this province that locally elected school boards really know their boards the best and are elected to serve their students and honour that work, In order to do so, they did require some local flexibility. That was a Rozanski 2002 recommendation as well.", "The special education funding envelope: The complex needs of special education students right now in the province of Ontario, have grown astronomically, in part because we have a better understanding of some of the complex special education needs of children, and in others because there are some basic human rights—there have been charter challenges to the education system in the province of Ontario, recognizing that every child has the right to attend school, regardless of their ability and regardless of their challenges. Quite honestly, there’s a lot of money attached to some of those children, as it should be. They should be funded. They have the right to attend their school system.", "Finally, some of my colleagues from rural and northern boards will recognize that the student transportation funding model has never truly been addressed in a comprehensive way. The Peel District School Board, for instance, has been disadvantaged now going on 11 years because the funding model was really just built in. It was baked in. The inequity was baked into the funding model for the Peel District School Board. They will tell you very clearly what happened with that.", "So how does this all relate to Bill 37? There have been tensions in the school system, and when the Ministry of Education legislated this concept of well-being on school boards, the general consensus and the general question was, “Well, how are you going to measure well-being?” Who’s going to measure well-being? Who is going to define well-being when we have incredible amounts of students who struggle? One in five children, Mr. Speaker, struggle with mental health.", "That all leads up to 2003, when there was the promise of addressing these gaps, which were well researched. The evidence was there. Then, of course, we run into the 2003 promise of having an “education Premier” and embedding and infusing all of this new funding. But the truth of the matter is, if you look and follow the funding, that gap has never truly been addressed. It has never kept up with the rate of inflation. It has never kept up with the—", "Interjections." ],

We made the case. We did the documentation. We spent the money. The administrative process was extensive but they didn’t like that and so they scrapped it. When boards could actually make the case to the ministry that these students required this funding, the ministry didn’t like the fact that they were going to have to foot the bill, so they scrapped the ISA five-year funding, which is really unfortunate." ],

What I’m basically making the case for, and it’s well documented, is that our schools have become incredibly complex. The pressures that exist in those schools are very well documented.

In fact, there have been cuts to education in subsequent years. It’s interesting because when Mike Harris made 5% cuts to the education budget, back in 1995, there were people on that front lawn and they were burning his figure in effigy. You were here; I’m sure you remember that. Those were tense times. When the Liberals introduced a budget that had 5% cuts across the board, people were afraid to speak out against that. It’s really incredible that there’s this disparity between those two stories.", "In Bill 37—we are here because obviously there have been well-publicized cases where trust has been breached between staff and between vice-principals and principals as well. I think it’s really important for us to understand the disciplinary process that’s attached to Bill 37. Teachers know that they are always on duty. I can tell you this from personal experience. They are professionals, and they uphold high standards of conduct. What Bill 37 means to address is the gaps: the transparency gap, the accountability gap and, really, a call for justice, if you will.", "Having gone through the system, many of us perhaps know personal stories. I can tell you that when the accusations made against a teacher, a principal or a vice-principal are in fact false, the reverberations in the community are incredible. They are incredibly negative. They destroy relationships. They compromise the integrity of the profession because there is this black mark. Even when those accusations are proven to be wrong, the damage is done. The damage is done when that happens, when false accusations happen. Even when there is justice for that individual, the damage is done.", "I can tell you from personal experience that my own community is dealing with a situation where they thought they knew someone in the education system, and it turns out that they did not. I am witnessing it first-hand: the cycle of trauma, the disbelief, the anger, these emotional ups and downs that the community is experiencing—because everyone will question themselves. They question themselves; they question their involvement; they question what action they might have taken to prevent these issues from happening. Quite honestly, the pain is really quite long-standing, regardless of the outcome at this point in time.", "The need to have an open and transparent process which puts the student at the centre and guards the rights of those employees who are contained within that system—who, quite honestly, have a massive responsibility, given their legislative responsibility for well-being—can be very overwhelming. I’m hopeful that Bill 37, when it does get to the amendment stage, actually can address some of the gaps that are contained within this legislation.", "I would just close by quoting the former president of the Ontario Public School Boards’ Association.

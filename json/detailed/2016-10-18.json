  "text" : [ "Yes, it’s appropriate that we say good morning. It’s like being in school here with all the pages.", "As a former teacher for over 20 years, I have some interesting reflections about Bill 37. I would like to share some of the highlights of this legislation that’s before us. The bill is called the Protecting Students Act and, if passed, the bill would make important amendments to the Ontario College of Teachers Act.", "Most people don’t know unless—if you’re in the teaching profession, you would know about the Ontario College of Teachers. It’s an autonomous governing body that deals with teachers’ standards and proper accreditation. It’s also a disciplinary body that deals with issues with teachers in schools.", "The interesting thing about the Ontario College of Teachers is that it really tries to raise the standards and expectations of our teachers across the province of Ontario. We sometimes take for granted the critical importance that our teachers, schools, school volunteers, parent groups and CSAC groups play in education across this province, and this bill is basically trying to update and ensure that the Ontario College of Teachers and its focus are up to today’s standards, you might say. It builds on achieving excellence for teachers, ensuring equity and fairness, promoting well-being and enhancing public confidence in education.", "I don’t know if you are familiar with the riding of Eglinton–Lawrence, Mr. Speaker, being from Chatham-Kent, the beautiful part of Ontario where all the soybeans, corn and tomatoes come from, but in Eglinton–Lawrence we have a very interesting phenomenon in that the public schools in Eglinton–Lawrence, many of them, are in some of the highest-priced neighbourhoods—probably, in part of my riding, one of the highest-priced neighbourhoods you’ll find anywhere in Canada. It’s not unusual to pay $2 million, $3 million, $4 million, $5 million, $6 million, $7 million, $8 million, $9 million or $10 million for a home, and that’s another issue about home affordability.", "But the interesting thing is that many parents will want to live in parts of Eglinton–Lawrence near one of our great public schools. In other words, in some communities, you will see where people will buy an expensive, exclusive home and then send their kids to private school. Private schools—I don’t know if you are aware of it, Mr. Speaker. It’s not unusual to pay $20,000, $30,000 for tuition for one year, whereas with a good public school system, we have people basically lining up to enrol their sons and daughters in our public schools.", "Our public schools in Eglinton–Lawrence are generally filled to the rafters. You almost can’t get in. There are waiting lists to get in. I’m talking about schools like John Ross Robertson, John Wanless, Blessed Sacrament school, Lawrence Park Collegiate, Forest Hill Collegiate and John Polanyi public high school. These schools, again, are public schools, yet people will pay the high price of real estate to be near one of those public schools, to be in that area, so they can send their kids to schools like John Wanless, John Ross Robertson, and Blessed Sacrament. That is a very positive reflection on the quality of education that students are getting in our public schools, because we have involved parents and we have excellent teachers and excellent principals. Therefore, we have this great desire to attend these public schools.", "Those public schools, again, are part of the public school system. You don’t have to pay that $20,000, $30,000 to go to one of the private schools. That’s a reflection on the excellent quality of teachers we have in our education system, whether it be the public board, the French board, or the Catholic board.", "They are not perfect in terms of delivering what is described as quality education, but on the other hand, they have an open-door policy. In a private school system, they can pick and choose their students, so they won’t take the struggling student. They won’t take the student who is maybe academically challenged. But our public schools will accept all comers, so that means our teachers have to deal with the reality of their community. They take in the bright students, the students that are struggling, the students with special needs. They take all comers. Yet despite that, where they can’t pick and choose like the private schools, they achieve great results.", "In my riding, in the Fraser Institute grading of schools across Canada, some of my schools, like John Wanless and John Ross Robertson, come up in the top 10, beating out the best private schools in the country in their scores.", "Those are the types of things you’re not going to read about in the newspapers or see on television, but those are the behind-the-scenes efforts of all of our teachers, our school boards and our parents that are making our public schools great places to learn.", "In this legislation here, what we’re trying to do is to ensure that the best standards are met by our teachers, to reinforce these standards and to ensure that parents know that there is a body like the Ontario College of Teachers that works at this on a daily basis behind the scenes.", "It’s not a glamorous job. It’s not one, as I said, that makes the headlines unless something, an abnormality or something, goes on that’s out of whack. But generally, this is the day-to-day work of the Ontario College of Teachers that is going on and has gone on, and now we’re just trying to update that to ensure that there’s a proper regulatory body in place with a disciplinary system. As you know, whether it’s students or whether it’s teachers, there are always, as I said, exceptions to the rule, and we have to be ready to protect the greater student body. We have to ensure that we have these standards in place.", "The college has had very robust, you might say, agendas over the past years. I know that a few years ago we had the esteemed Judge Patrick LeSage, who put forward the report with many recommendations, looking at the disciplinary practices of the college of teachers and also the modernization of the college. Justice LeSage is one of the most renowned jurists, certainly, in Canada, and he put forth these recommendations. So the government has continued to work with the college of teachers to address all of 49 recommendations of Justice LeSage.", "Now, as you know, most recommendations can be very technical, can be much more challenging than you think. So it’s not as if, when these recommendations come forward, they could be introduced overnight. But they are being introduced and phased in to the process of the Ontario College of Teachers. This is an ongoing activity, and this is something that would, again, I think, benefit the teaching profession.", "Ultimately, when you have a teaching profession that is meeting high standards, obviously students benefit, but this is not something that day-to-day parents deal with because, as you know, day-to-day parents are rushing to get their children to school, get them to after-school programs, going to work. You know, it is very, very difficult for parents to—especially in today’s world, it’s difficult to get a stay-at-home parent. It just can’t happen, especially when you’re paying all the bills and you’re trying to take care of your job and career at the same time. So therefore, parents rely on schools, rely on the college of teachers to ensure that the focus in our schools is appropriate for their sons and daughters and that this is the highest of standards. That’s something that parents really don’t get involved in unless there’s some circumstance where there needs to be a parental intervention, which happens from time to time.", "As you know, our principals across this province deal with this kind of issue on a daily basis, and they have a very, very difficult job as principals, because they’re not only managing staff—they could have 10, 20, 30 teachers and staff. I mentioned here the other day that one of my granddaughters goes to a school, Runnymede public school in Toronto, where there are over 1,100 children in that public school. The interesting thing is that people are lined up to go to that school. It’s one of the best schools in the city. Despite its size—I think they have seven junior kindergartens. It’s in the Bloor West area of Toronto.", "People want to go to that school because it has such good teachers and such good results. And so people want to go to this public school. You can imagine—I don’t know how many; I think they’ve got five or six vice-principals in that school and a number of principals. But you can imagine you, as a principal, being the chief administrator in a school with 1,100 children. We are challenged enough as parents when we’re trying to deal with our two or three or four kids in our household. We’ve got so many interesting activities our children get into. You can imagine being responsible for a school of 1,100 little boys and girls. Every day, they come in and they’re scraping their knees, they’re having issues with learning mathematics etc. That’s what goes on in our schools across the province of Ontario. Every day, there are families depending on our schools to give their children the best possible tools as they grow up.", "That’s why this legislation attempts to continue to ensure that there are the proper standards in place to protect students, protect schools and protect families in an educational setting. That is what this bill is trying to do. It’s trying to ensure that when something is off the rails in terms of a teacher’s behaviour there are rules in place and discipline in place to take care of that.", "It is not an easy thing to do in any profession to impose mandatory, arbitrary rules and benchmarks. It has to be done in collaboration with the teachers. It has to be done in collaboration with the principals and the Ontario College of Teachers. That is the process and that is the framework of this bill that is before us today. The disciplinary processes are never easy, as you know, in any profession, but they have to be there. I think parents expect that if there is something that is not kosher, as they say, there is a responsibility of some disciplinary body to intervene. That’s what the Ontario College of Teachers is doing. So this legislation tries to enhance that regulatory regime that the Ontario College of Teachers deals with.", "While I’m here talking about education, as I mentioned, there are schools in one end of my riding in which the property values are quite high, but then people of very moderate means live in another end of my riding. In some of the areas around Avenue Road and Yonge Street, I have some fabulous schools. I mentioned Ledbury school, which is another great public school in my riding.", "Also, I have a school called Joyce Public School. Joyce Public School is in an area that has really been through a challenging, at-risk period, but because of the principal and the staff at Joyce Public School, and the trustee, it is one of the most sought-after schools in the city of Toronto. At Joyce Public School, the teachers have put together a program—Cheryl Paige, the principal, was amazing. She put together a program of teaching math through music. She combined math and music. I’ll tell you, the test results and the achievement of the kids in that school were just through the roof. So you have people who may not live in the area of Joyce Public School but want to send their kids to Joyce Public School, which is, as I said, in an area where people are of very moderate means, and half to three quarters of the students come from a family whose parents don’t have English as a first language.", "The beauty about walking into these schools is—I don’t know whether you have this in Chatham-Kent, but I’m sure you have a variety of different situations in Chatham-Kent. Just this past Christmas, I was at a school where my brother teaches. It’s called Archbishop Romero high school. It’s just outside of my riding. It’s in the Rogers Road and Weston Road area. Again, almost 90% of the kids are sons and daughters of recent immigrants. In that school, they were doing a fundraiser for a local charity. Every student was from a different country, spoke a different language—every student. If you look at the spectrum, you’ll see they come from China, the Philippines, Ecuador, Mexico, Guatemala, Grenada—they come from everywhere. Every student is from a different background, yet all these students were coming together, raising money for a local charity, for a food drive, and all having a great deal of fun with their teachers and principal. Where else in the world could you find that but in Canada, in Ontario? You go to some of these other countries and they’re very homogeneous, not to say they’re bad. But I walk into these schools and, as I said, the whole world is represented.", "That teacher has to be cognizant of the cultural background and the language challenges of each and every student. That isn’t easy. If you know that everybody is from Hamilton and they all come from Ancaster, you’ve got a certain—but even there, there’s a lot of diversity coming. Everybody is moving to Hamilton, I hear. It’s becoming the hot place in Canada to move to.", "Just getting back to that challenge the teachers have, the diversity—" ],

This Bill 37, the government’s education bill, is the first piece of education legislation which the government has introduced in quite a long time. We support it and sincerely hope that students will be safer once these amendments to the Early Childhood Educators Act and the Ontario College of Teachers Act are passed into law.", "There’s another education matter that I need to address to the Minister of Education and her staff today, who I know are monitoring this debate. That is a concern I have received from a constituent, Jeff Baechler of Georgetown, which we repeatedly raised with the former Minister of Education. It deals with the accreditation of teachers, which of course falls under the responsibility of the Ontario College of Teachers.", "Mr. Baechler writes that the implementation of the two-year teacher education program is unjust and inequitable. He has repeated the point that concurrent teacher education students, who are students simultaneously enrolled in two programs leading to two degrees, are being treated differently than students who are studying to be teachers via the consecutive teaching education route; in other words, seeking to obtain an undergraduate degree before they study for a bachelor of education degree. These concurrent education program students, if enrolled before 2015, are in effect exempted from the new two-year teacher education program, while the future teachers taking the consecutive education route must study for two years to receive their bachelor of education program.", "We have repeatedly raised this issue with the government on Mr. Baechler’s behalf. I appreciate the research he has done and I admire his persistence. At the very least, he is entitled to an unbiased review of his concern and a satisfactory explanation. I urge the new Minister of Education to review this matter with a view to seeking a solution which is fair both to concurrent and consecutive teaching education students, and respond to Mr. Baechler. Thank you very much." ],

I had an hour yesterday to discuss the bill before us, Bill 37, but there’s always more to add so I’m happy to have the opportunity to do so.", "The member from the government side spoke at length about schools in his riding and the importance of our education system and kids being safe while at school and how important that is to the students, to the parents and, frankly, it’s important to the large majority of education workers. So I want to make it clear from the top that this legislation before us would actually only touch on a very, very small minority of educators. Most of them would not ever see any disciplinary action under this bill because most of our teachers—again, the large majority of our teachers do a very, very good job of not only educating our children but taking good care of them and making sure that they’re safe while at school.", "I think an important parallel—because the member was speaking greatly about schools in his riding—is that when we’re talking about the safety of students, we need to talk about not just those who are put in charge of the care of the students while they’re in the buildings, but the actual condition of the buildings that students are in. Often those conditions are not safe.", "We’re looking at a $15-billion repair backlog that the government is not addressing. We’re finding heating and cooling issues in schools, so kids are cold or they’re too hot and they’re passing out. We’re finding that roofs are failing, so we’re having leaking roofs. In some extreme cases, roofs and ceilings are actually falling down in gymnasiums while students are in the gym.", "I think the government needs to do a better job of actually taking care of the entire education system, rather than standing up and just talking a good talk." ],

I have always thought that we need to be measuring our success as a society by our kids’ success in school, because that’s fundamental to how they manage later in life.", "The honourable member’s wise words talked about a broadened approach to finding some creative ways to bring peace to the schoolyard and to deal with discipline in a collaborative way with our teacher friends, all the time celebrating that virtually all of our teachers have come through this collaborative arrangement to see children not as children of modest means, but rather as boys and girls of unlimited potential. As long as we can continue to support that, we’ll do well.", "The best way to do that, of course, is to work collaboratively with our educators and those who have a profound interest in making sure that our kids succeed. The best way to do that, of course, is to ensure confidently that they’re protected and that the recommendations of Justice LeSage are implemented as quickly as possible.

There’s absolutely no place for child exploitation in this province or in any part of our society, for that matter. We expect all individuals, regardless of profession, who engage in this abhorrent behaviour to be brought to justice.", "We’ve actually suggested as well that there are some other potential amendments. One would be creating a public website that lists individuals who have had their certificate revoked for certain forms of sexual abuse or acts relating to child pornography. That way parents can go on and they can be assured in their own mind. That’s the most important thing—making sure that the children are safe, first of all, in an environment that allows them to have that safe and comfortable feeling, but also allows parents, as we want to ensure that for our children, to know.", "Any member of the college who is accused of an act of misconduct will be subject to immediate leave without pay. In lieu of transparency, unless the teacher has been the subject of death threats or the like, there will be a public hearing. If the act against the student is punishable under the Criminal Code for five years or greater, section 23 would include additional details such as the address of the member who committed the crime in order to serve and protect the public interest.", "As I’ve said all along and as I believe, I hope this bill is trying to address the safety of the children. Ensuring there’s an environment where they can thrive, grow and learn, obviously, is the most important fiduciary responsibility of all of us as legislators; but more importantly, it’s all of us thinking as parents, what we would want for our children and our schools.", "I’m pleased to see the members continuing to push it forward.

I was just recalling my father—the member from Windsor West mentioned it’s not just teachers that make a great school. My father was a caretaker in a local school in Toronto. He had been a steelworker for many years, until the plant closed down. Then when my dad got a job as a caretaker, he thought he’d died and gone to heaven, from working in a foundry to working in a school. He just loved the job. He would work the night shift. That was the greatest job he ever had, and it was a joy for him, going to work every day.", "I remember an incident. One time, a grade 6 teacher came up to me and said, “You know, your dad saved my teaching career.” I said, “What do you mean?” He said, “Well, I was just a beginning teacher, and I was having problems with disciplining the kids.” Basically, the kids, as they can, can take over a classroom, so this new teacher was really in deep trouble. My dad heard of his concern, so my dad marched into the classroom one morning and to each student, he said, “If you don’t behave and obey this teacher—I know each and every single one of your parents, and I’m going to tell them that you’re not behaving. Believe me, your parents will take care of you if you don’t behave.” Ever since my dad, as the caretaker, marched in and read the riot act to help out this teacher, that teacher said the kids’ behaviour totally turned around. So that was an interesting anecdote.", "It takes more than just teachers. It takes the caretaker staff, the support staff. Everybody makes for a good school." ],

We need to put every best effort forward to ensure that our most vulnerable are protected.", "In that regard, the safety and security of our children and young people is a very serious matter. As policy-makers, we have an obligation to ensure that we do all we can to address potential threats to that security in a timely, responsible manner.", "I’m going to talk about timeliness in a moment, because we need to give recognition where recognition is due. I’m pleased to say that the PC Party of Ontario recognized this early in the 2000s. I’m glad that finally, today, in 2016, we’re getting back to seriously putting forward legislation that will make a difference. Because at the end of the day, when our students jump on the school bus or walk to school and enter that institution, we put our trust in our educators to ensure that our children are cared for, protected, nurtured and respected so that they ultimately can have the best learning environment possible.", "As figures of authority, we look to teachers to guide our young people into the future in a positive, healthy way. As a result, teachers have a level of influence that is unmatched by any other profession. Most of our teachers understand that importance. There is responsibility and hard work to keep the confidence of parents and their charges. But when that trust is violated in extreme and profound ways, it has serious, long-lasting impacts for the student.", "As I mentioned, to children, teachers are authority figures who have a significant degree of influence. They not only assign grades but report behaviour to parents. Students who are being exploited may thus feel pressure to comply with a teacher’s demands, for fear of negative repercussions. For younger students, they may also fear getting in trouble if they don’t comply with their teacher’s wishes.", "At the end of the day, when we take a look across the province, we all agree in this House that our teachers are the most important resource. We all appreciate the good that they do in order to help our young people become productive, happy members of our communities.", "In fact, as you may recall, I have many friends and family members myself who are part of the education system, both here at home in Ontario and abroad in places such as China, Kuwait, Thailand and South America, just to name a few.

They have come forward with every best intention, but unfortunately, just like any basket—or bushel basket, I’ll say—of apples, there unfortunately could be the potential bad one. So we do need legislation that addresses this particular issue, and Bill 37 does get to that.", "As we take a look and drill down on Bill 37, we in the PC Party of Ontario wholeheartedly agree that this legislation is indeed needed. We’re glad, as I mentioned before, to see the Liberals are finally taking steps to address such a serious subject.", "As I hinted just moments ago, it was actually the PC Party of Ontario that established the groundwork on this matter, going all the way back to 2002, when former Minister of Education Janet Ecker introduced Bill 101, the Student Protection Act. At that time, Minister Ecker took steps to remove potential threats to children from the classroom by amending section 30 of the Education Act. Her particular work read as follows:", "“On becoming aware that a teacher or temporary teacher who is employed by the board has been charged with or convicted of an offence under the Criminal Code (Canada) involving sexual conduct and minors, or of any other offence under the Criminal Code (Canada) that in the opinion of the board indicates that pupils may be at risk, take prompt steps to ensure that the teacher or temporary teacher performs no duties in the classroom and no duties involving contact with pupils, pending withdrawal of the charge, discharge following a preliminary inquiry, stay of the charge or acquittal, as the case may be.”", "I thank Janet Ecker for her efforts back in 2002, and I’m glad to see that the essence established at that time by the PC Party of Ontario has transcended the years and has finally landed in Bill 37.", "I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention that back in 2002, among several things, Bill 101, the Student Protection Act, also amended the Ontario College of Teachers Act with regard to the obligations of employers in reporting offences. At that time, it specifically stated:", "“An employer shall promptly report to the college in writing when the employer becomes aware that a member who is or has been employed by the employer,", "“(a) has been charged with or convicted of an offence under the Criminal Code (Canada) involving sexual conduct and minors;", "“(b) has been charged with or convicted of an offence under the Criminal Code (Canada) that in the opinion of the employer indicates that students may be at risk of harm or injury; or", "“(c) has engaged in conduct or taken action that, in the opinion of the employer, should be reviewed by a committee of the college.”", "As you can see, Speaker, we on this side of the House absolutely take this matter seriously. Unfortunately, the government’s earlier versions of this bill have been sidelined due to their other priorities. That’s where it gets frustrating, Speaker. The very essence of Bill 37 needs to be embraced and championed through this House in a timely manner. But unfortunately, for instance, when the Premier introduced—actually, before I get to that, I want to just make sure everybody listening today understands that in the last 13 years, this particular piece of legislation has been introduced to this assembly no less than three times, beginning with Bill 103 in 2013, and again as Bill 200 in May just this year. Now, for the third time, we’re debating it as Bill 37. Each time, the government failed to get this job done, but we’re committed to a safe and protected environment for our students, so we want to see Bill 37 get right across the finish line this time around.", "When I think about why Bill 200, introduced just this past spring, fell off the order paper, I would be remiss if I didn’t mention that I feel it’s very much a shame that the Premier’s own self-interest caused this bill to die on the order paper the second time around when she prorogued this government in September. We may have been much further ahead on this issue had it not happened.", "I want to take a few minutes to share with you some headlines that emphasize how important it is that we treat this issue in a timely manner and get the job done once and for all. These headlines are sad, but it emphasizes the point that we’ve lost time on this bill and we need to get it done.", "For instance, in the Toronto Star on July 2016, a headline was published: “Ottawa Teacher Charged with Sexual Assault of Student.”", "In June 2016, in the Toronto Sun, a headline was published: “Peel Teacher Accused of Sex Assault of Student.”", "In March 2016, in the National Post, there was an article and a student was quoted: “‘She Would Stalk Me’: Ottawa Teacher’s Aide Pleads Guilty to Sexually Assaulting Male Student for Years.”", "Another headline: “Teacher Charged with Sex-Related Offences Involving a Student.” That was published by CTV Ottawa in May 2016.", "In April 2016, the Ottawa Sun published a headline that read, “Female Teacher with Ottawa Catholic School Board Charged with Sexual Assault on Student.”", "In the Windsor Star, in the summer—July, specifically—we learned of another headline: “Windsor Elementary Teacher Charged with Sexual Assault.”", "I think these headlines speak volumes about the effect that inaction can have.", "Unfortunately, as I said, we have seen this bill come to the floor three times now, and unfortunately, when the legislation has not been acted upon in a timely fashion, we’ve had these headlines hit the papers. It’s very, very sad. I think while the government delays and stalls progress on these changes as noted in Bill 37, the lives of real people, our children, our future, are being impacted in ways no child should have to experience.", "I implore the government of the day to work with us to get this legislation through. It has been too long and it’s time to get the job done." ],

  "text" : [ "Thank you.", "Education seems to be a file that this government stumbles on time and time again. I’m reminded of one example in particular from earlier this year when the former Minister of Education refused, for weeks, to provide families and students who benefit from demonstration schools with answers on whether or not they would remain open for the 2016-17 academic year. While the minister eventually agreed to keep them open and operating for another year, there was no offer for a long-term solution for families looking to plan for the future.", "Again, I share this today because it’s pertinent. Inaction creates instability, and our children, our future and their families deserve to have the respect and timely action that will make a difference in their learning environment and in their confidence in their future. Again, I impress upon this government: Let’s get this job done. Let’s work together. We can do this. Let’s not let it die on the floor or let it get lost in the committee process.", "There’s another example that I’d like to share as well coming from my own riding of Huron–Bruce, and it impacts my friend’s riding of Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound as well. Again, Bill 37 is about enabling a secure learning environment for our young people, but I would be remiss at this time of the debate not to touch on the fact that a secure learning environment and the future of communities are dependent upon a government that understands the important pillar that education plays in all of our communities.", "In the north end of our riding we’re hearing a lot about the potential closure of Paisley Central School and Chesley District Community School. Chesley District is a K-to-12 school, and Paisley Central School is well-attended and there’s economic development initiatives happening that show that growth is going to be happening in that community, propping up the enrolment levels at Paisley Central. We need to have proper attention paid to our institutions. The fact that we’re talking about safe, secure learning environments for our students—I have a letter from Dale Steinhoff from Paisley. He touches on a couple of other elements in his letter that I would like to share with the floor at this time. He writes, “Unfortunately, the Paisley accommodation review, like those others recently held throughout Grey Bruce, appears to have a predetermined outcome and the views of the local electorate are paid very little heed.”", "Again, my riding of Huron–Bruce actually takes in the hinterland, the greater Paisley area, if you will. The school proper is in the great neighbouring riding of Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound.", "Dale goes on to say that he has “every confidence that the administrators at the board office and the province have all their ducks neatly in a row to ensure that this closure is carried out.” It makes him concerned. He goes on to say, “It is unfortunate, but our pleas appear to be falling on deaf ears. I write this letter with the hope that there’s someone in a position of influence who appreciates that Paisley is on the verge of something very good and to close the school now would make absolutely no sense.”", "It is shameful that this government has allowed our education system to fall into such disarray.", "I would like to return to the bill and provide more background, if you will, on how we can amend and fix some of this frustration, address the disarray that this constituent addressed in his letter and talk about the proposed changes that we need to debate for Bill 37. We have to have a context of how all of this has come to be.", "I know my colleague from Whitby–Oshawa provided a similar background yesterday, but I want to ensure that we’re all on the same page today. Here we go, in terms of the context. In 2011, the Ontario College of Teachers commissioned the Honourable Patrick LeSage, former Chief Justice of the Superior Court, to review its intake, investigation and discipline procedures and outcomes, and its dispute resolution programs.", "Within these areas, Mr. LeSage was specifically asked to consider issues including communication and publication practices, impartiality and timeliness of adjudication, training and legal support, appropriateness of disciplinary outcomes, confidentiality and the handling of concerns about the college’s members. His 76-page report established 49 recommendations, which I am glad to see have all been included in Bill 37.", "I want to focus on three of them that I believe are especially important. The first recommendation is 32, which states, “The penalty for sexual abuse or sexual misconduct by a teacher involving a student should almost invariably be” the stripping “of the member’s teaching certificate.” He goes on to state in his findings that “anything less brings disrepute on the college and the profession.”", "We feel that we have amendments that would help strengthen the legislation and ensure that proper punitive measures are being taken at every stage of the process. We hope our amendments are given serious consideration, as I mentioned earlier, when it gets to the committee process.", "Also of important note is Mr. LeSage’s recommendation 34, which states, “Decisions, including those that flow from dispute resolution agreements of the discipline committee, must be published and available on the website and the name of the member must be included.”", "Transparency is paramount. It’s something that this government just can’t give lip service to. It is essential in ensuring that parents are able to make informed decisions about where they choose to enrol their children, which is why we’re advocating that the government take this a step further and create a public website that lists individuals who have had their certificate revoked for certain forms of sexual abuse or acts relating to child pornography. Pornography is a huge issue that I am glad my colleague and my seatmate from Haliburton–Kawartha Lakes–Brock is addressing very seriously in Bill 17.", "Going back specifically to what we’re addressing today, we believe that the amendment would make it easier for parents to see which members of the college have committed an offence against a student. No longer would parents have to search the entire college database of suspension for various reasons. Rather, they would be able to see the list of individuals who have had their certificate revoked specifically for sexual misconduct charges.", "Thirdly, and by no means the least, is recommendation 24, which would require that timelines be set for drafting, reviewing, signing and serving notice of the hearing. In his rationale, LeSage emphasized: “If the discipline process does not quickly and appropriately deal with matters of professional misconduct and incompetence, the public interest is not being served.”", "Speaker, that comment could apply to many other issues that this government is mismanaging, but I’d be remiss if I went in that direction, so I’m going to stick with the fact that in terms of recommendation 24 from LeSage, he went on to say, “School boards have expressed concerns about outstanding complaints. When decisions remain pending for a lengthy period, significant costs are incurred. The teacher is placed on administrative leave. The school board must pay a supply teacher. The delay in the communication of decisions can be a distractor in the work of schools and school boards. Additionally, teachers who are under investigation, and who choose to move to another school district, create difficult situations for school boards during the reference checking process. While recognizing the complexity of the process, timely information is critical. Like the school board, the member who is the subject of the discipline proceeding deserves an early conclusion to outstanding allegations.”", "Speaker, with these changes, we believe that we are on a positive track to protecting students and ensuring that our classrooms remain a safe environment where they can learn and grow, free from fear.", "All that said, we believe there are still some areas which could be strengthened. One in particular that we’ll be bringing forward in committee is to see those who are employed by a school board, by way of a letter of inclusion, face the same standards, penalties and processes as members of the college. School boards often employ people such as sports coaches and second-language instructors who do not possess a teaching certificate but who possess a letter of permission. We feel that they too should not be exempt. They too should fall under the same standards and repercussions as their teacher counterparts, because they too are in a position of trust and influence." ],

I won’t go into any detail here about how far back that is for me, but, believe me, it was a number of years ago. I still remember those civics classes and those days, and there are certain teachers over the years, whether it was in grade school or in secondary school, who made an impression on me. Whether it was on history or civics or those types of courses that we took, it made a big impression on us.", "They also outlined the 49 recommendations that were made as part of the LeSage report. Certainly, the college of teachers itself asked for the review. They recognized themselves that there was an issue either in the public’s eye or in their own administration, but they had issues with—in any occupation, there’s a certain number of people who need discipline, bad actors, whatever word you want to use.

We’re here talking about our students. We’re talking about the climate in which they learn, the environment that they learn and grow in, and we want to ensure that that is always the strongest, best and safest environment it can be. Teachers and education workers do a phenomenal job every day. It has been very heartening to hear during the debate that members from all parties recognize the important work that they do every day; that teachers are social workers, they are mentors and they are role models. They are, of course, educators. They inspire. They guide. I think everyone in this room remembers their teachers: the good, the bad, the strict, the fair, the fun, the eccentric. We all remember our teachers. Sometimes we had a year that we really enjoyed our teachers, and other years where we did a lot of personal growing. But that’s how we become who we are in our education system along the way, and we value the work of those who have shaped our understanding, our thoughts and our learning environments. All of those teachers, though, while they’re all so different, what they all have in common is that they’re in positions of influence, authority and trust.", "I’ll tell you, though, that teachers, just as much as parents, want to keep their kids safe, so they bend over backwards to ensure that that happens. They will spend the money that the government won’t when it comes to art supplies, when it comes to sports equipment, when it comes to new shoes or food or whatever it is that they need to pay for to protect students’ futures and their potential. They advocate. They have a duty to report. They work with parents. They work with special education supports in schools. It really does take a team in our schools to ensure that students have the best opportunities.", "But this bill is about exceptions. It is a strong piece of legislation that we support and recognize as being necessary. This bill talks about what happens when a teacher in a position of trust hurts, harms or abuses any of our children. There is never a place where our children should be at risk, and today we are discussing our schools and our classrooms. Certainly, there should never be harm in our schools and classrooms.", "This bill makes changes—it amends the Ontario College of Teachers Act and makes changes that will affect a very small number of teachers—but it really is so important. This is necessary legislation, and we absolutely support it. We want it to be tough. We want to protect our kids. We want to ensure due process, as we’ve heard over and over again. We must have proper oversight and measures in place to ensure crimes are punished and kids are always protected.", "A bit of history, Mr. Speaker: In 2000, there were changes to the Child and Family Services Act that required teachers to report all suspicions that they had if a child was in need of protection. As a teacher, I knew that I had a duty to report. We all did.

There’s trust and integrity that is involved, and so it makes me sick to my stomach to imagine any who would harm our most precious, our students.", "Back in 2011, the Toronto Star brought to light failings in the Ontario College of Teachers.

There were a number of changes that needed to happen at that time, and the Ontario College of Teachers did take action. It hired retired Judge LeSage, who investigated and put forward a 76-page report with 49 recommendations.", "At that time, the education minister said, “We are not waiting to take action.” Well, Mr. Speaker, here we are; and this is the third time that an incarnation of this bill has been brought forward.

We know that teachers are always on duty. They’re professionals in positions of trust, and they must uphold high standards of conduct. When they fail to, they absolutely must be held accountable.", "The Ontario College of Teachers has a role and that is to maintain public trust in our education system, to investigate, to discipline and to conduct public hearings while maintaining a fair due process and operating within their mandate.", "The government has a role and that is to act effectively and swiftly when it comes to the LeSage report recommendations. But as I said, here we are four or five years later. This should be a matter of principle. We’re talking about safety and security, egregious misconduct and sexual abuse. So three bills and almost five years later, that sounds like a matter of politics, and that is unfortunate.", "I don’t know what the government wants, but I know that parents want kids to be safe and students want to learn and grow in safe classrooms. New Democrats want that too. I would imagine all members of this House want that. We want tough legislation to ensure that guilty individuals are appropriately and fairly disciplined and kept away from our kids. We also need to ensure due process for the accused. We want stricter but fairer penalties.", "Teachers are accused of any number of things on a regular basis in today’s schools. That is the truth. Unfounded, frivolous, vexatious and malicious accusations are not uncommon, unfortunately. I taught for almost 10 years, and there was never a year, there was never a school, where I didn’t bear witness to career-damaging false accusations directed at great teachers. That is, unfortunately, the nature of the business. Everyone deserves due process; however, if found guilty, then no one deserves to be let off the hook when it comes to our kids.", "This bill, Bill 37, is called the Protecting Students Act. I would say that there are a few items missing. My colleague the critic for education has brought forward a number of issues when it comes to infrastructure, the school repair backlog and the unbelievable heating and cooling issues—the situations within our schools. We’ve talked about what chronic underfunding has led to. Really, it’s jeopardizing the learning environment. It’s jeopardizing learning.", "I mentioned that teachers will reach into their own pockets and into their own hearts when it comes to school supplies, when it comes to food, when it comes to providing not the extras but the fundamentals—that they are filling in the budgetary gaps for this government. But it has reached a tipping point because, when we realize that so much is missing, our students are not being protected; their best interests are not being protected.", "So I worry that this bill is a little bit of a misnomer—well, not a misnomer, but we’re missing something here; we’re missing an opportunity. Much like the Putting Students First Act was a great title—it was a great title, but it didn’t put students first; it robbed teachers of sick leave and, among other things, stole the right to freely bargain contracts, you may recall. It imposed a contract instead.", "Now, by the way, after a charter challenge, the courts have found that Bill 115 was unconstitutional. Now, this government has a chance to make things right, a chance to remedy this illegal wrong. This government has done so much damage to our education system; I wonder where they’re going to begin. With language like “putting students first” and “protecting students,” you would almost be optimistic; you would almost think they were sincere in wanting to make education better.", "However, since losing the charter challenge, this government’s offer is to apologize and stick teachers and students with the status quo. The status quo isn’t serving our students. Since it was against the law to forcibly take away the right to negotiate, this government’s remedy suggestion is to politely offer to take away the right to negotiate. Speaker, actually, wouldn’t that still be illegal? Just a question. I find this government unbelievable, and we will watch this play out. Instead of strengthening education or protecting learning or students, they seek to undermine and damage just to save a buck wherever they can.", "I would say that we’re also missing an opportunity to protect students. I’m hearing, in my community and across the province, a distressing issue: One of the priority issues right now is violence in our schools. Bill 37 chooses to omit it. As a teacher and as the critic for community safety, I am concerned. We see escalating violence and a lack of funding for special education. We’re not doing what we need to protect our students in our classrooms. We have Kevlar in our classrooms. We have evacuations in our classrooms. We have teachers who are mandated to wear Kevlar hoodies and shin guards. This is real, in our elementary classrooms.", "Mr. Speaker, you’re telling me to wrap up. I’ve got so much more to say. Okay, fine. I will finish with, “Shame on this government.” I think that students need protection from this government. That’s how things have turned out. Isn’t that a shame?" ],

Funding has become so restrictive that local CASs have been forced to cut any unmandated programs, there is no training allowance available, workers have been forced to reduce physiological assessments, offices are vacancy-managing mandated programs, and enrichment options formerly available to children have been cut.

This has forced the CAS to use privatized group homes more often for longer periods of time. Financially, a private home can cost between $100 and $300 per day per child. A foster family, on the other hand, is paid $29 per day per child. Beyond the obvious higher cost of group homes, we must ask, what is best for the child?", "Recent office closures have been concerning as well.

This is a week that is dedicated to driving change, to stopping the clock on teen deaths on Ontario’s roads, and to finding solutions that work, community by community.", "I am absolutely thrilled to recognize one of MTO’s very important road safety partners, Parachute. Representatives from Parachute are here, as I mentioned earlier today. I want to thank Parachute for leading this critical campaign and for all the work they do to help prevent injuries and save lives.", "Sadly, Speaker, the statistics show that teen drivers are overrepresented when it comes to injuries and fatalities on our roads. They are about 40% more likely to be killed or injured in motor vehicle collisions as compared to the general population. When it comes to distracted driving collisions, again, too many teens—over 1,200 in Ontario, according to the 2013 ORSAR stats—have been killed or injured in collisions.", "In a recent survey, half of all teens admitted to texting while they were driving. This is a growing problem, and not just among teens, of course. Research indicates that any driver who uses a cellphone is four times more likely to be in an accident. If current collision trends continue, fatalities from distracted driving will exceed those from drinking and driving in the very near future. In fact, law enforcement tells us that those numbers are shifting very aggressively.", "Equally alarming are the numbers we’re seeing for teen drivers and drug use. Of teen drivers who died in an accident, about one in four tested positive for drugs. The bottom line is that we need to do better. Even one teenaged driver fatality is simply one too many, which of course brings me to this year’s campaign focus on distracted and drug-impaired driving.", "From social media, like #gethomesafe, to the hundreds of community events, community ambassadors and downloadable toolkits, Parachute is helping to lead change, to raise awareness and to find solutions for the tragic consequences—to prevent the tragic consequences—of distracted and drug-impaired driving.", "We stand shoulder to shoulder with our valued road safety partner, and we’ve already started to take action. Last year, the Ontario government got tougher with drivers who still aren’t getting the message on distracted driving, by escalating penalties for novice drivers convicted of distracted driving, increasing the fine to $490 and up to $1,000, and applying three demerit points upon conviction.", "Just this past summer, we launched the ministry’s largest integrated social marketing and media campaign on distracted driving, known as “It happens fast. Put down the phone.” This campaign was launched on television, radio, online and at Cineplex Odeon theatres across the province. The campaign, as many here will know, encourages people to share their commitment on social media to #putdownthephone so that they can see the road. People are talking, sharing and getting involved by taking the pledge. We’re getting traction, and we are hopeful that we will see a reduction in injuries and fatalities on our roads.", "Earlier this month, we also announced tougher penalties for drivers who are impaired by drugs. These penalties include licence suspensions, fines, and mandatory treatment and education programs. Of course, we continue to work with our road safety partners to deliver important public education messages to help tackle drug-impaired driving.", "Ontario is recognized as a world-class leader in road safety because of our tough laws, because of our strong enforcement, because of our partnerships and because of our public education campaigns. And, without a doubt, thanks to the dedicated work of our valued road safety partners like Parachute, we are in a stronger position than would otherwise be the case.", "Speaker, I am proud to stand here today to mark this important initiative because we recognize that everyone, from those who are novice drivers to the most seasoned drivers on Ontario’s roads, should be safe and protected on our highways, on our roads and in our communities. The people of Ontario—again, both our teenage and young drivers and those of all ages—deserve no less." ],

Before I get started, I’d like to just acknowledge the children, youth, parents and advocates here in Ontario, and thank them for the time they’ve taken over the last few months to talk to me and to work with me to ensure that we can move the autism file along. I know that the work that they do every single day takes a lot of courage. I understand the realities that parents face every single day, and I just want to say thank you so much.", "I look forward to meeting more families and caregivers over the next few months, Mr. Speaker.", "I also want to take a moment to recognize the commitment to those who work every day in communities across the province to support children, youth and adults with autism. Thank you for your continued perseverance, and please keep up the great work. Our children depend on it.", "Mr. Speaker, it’s my goal as minister responsible for children and youth here in the province of Ontario to ensure that young people have the best opportunity to find success in Ontario. That commitment extends, of course, to children with autism. Our government is dedicated to providing children and families with autism with the best possible supports today and in the future. That’s why, Mr. Speaker, Ontario recently made the most substantial public investment into autism. We’ve announced an unprecedented investment of more than half a billion dollars over the next five years to enhance services and to better meet the needs of children and families here in Ontario.", "These are often complex needs. Autism is life-long. It is complex. The symptoms can vary significantly, and range in severity in each and every child. From a clinical standpoint we know it means that every child with ASD needs unique treatment and, more importantly, we know that this means that every child with ASD has unique potential. We’re committed to helping them achieve that potential.", "The new autism program here in Ontario will begin to be implemented in June 2017 and will foster development and provide more flexible, tailored and individualized services to all children and youth with autism. It will completely transform our current system to better match the needs of families. Mr. Speaker, what we’re going to do is create a single point of entry, making it easier for families to access service. We’re going to open up 16,000 new service spaces for families with autism. Wait times will be significantly reduced, and all children, regardless of age, will receive flexible services based on their needs. This will mark a major milestone in how autism services are delivered to children and youth here in our province. I am proud to be steering this change together with families, clinicians and advocates.", "Mr. Speaker, I understand that families have many questions as we move closer to that date in June of next year. I understand that transition periods can be very challenging, especially when we’re talking about families. That is why our government announced that we’ll start the implementation a year sooner, in June 2017. We’re making sure that families are well supported during the transition to the new program. Families of children who are transitioning from the IBI wait-list can access funds to help them get their services and supports they need for their children until the new Ontario Autism Program begins.", "We’re also helping families access an autism diagnosis earlier so children can get treatment as soon as possible. We’re doing this by increasing the diagnostic services through five regional hubs.", "As a parent, Mr. Speaker, I want nothing more than what’s best for my children. I know that parents all across the province feel the same. I am committed to continuing to meet with parents and caregivers to hear the issues and concerns. I want to know first-hand what’s working and what’s not working. By listening, we’ll have a clear understanding of the challenges that parents face on a day-to-day basis so we can better understand and respond to their needs.", "To parents, I’d like to say: Thank you very much for sharing your input and for partnering with us. We cannot implement substantial change without your guidance and without your families’ experience.", "I’d be remiss to not acknowledge our work with other government ministries as we begin to move closer to our new autism program here in the province. Enhancing our services requires a holistic approach, which is why we’re working closely with the Ministry of Education to strengthen our school supports to help children and youth transition into and continue in school on a full-time basis. Publicly funded school boards are receiving funds to support children transitioning into school during the new autism transition period. School boards will also be eligible for funding for after-school development programming.", "We’re also working closely with the Ministry of Community and Social Services to improve employment supports for young people with autism. All of these collective efforts are making a huge difference, and they will continue to make a huge difference.", "We know we can always do better. A big part of doing better is about understanding more about autism spectrum disorder itself. Because of its complexity, there is so much more we need to learn to better understand autism. Over the last few years, a great deal of research has been done here in the province of Ontario, and every year we are learning more.", "Statistics tell us that in Ontario, we have approximately 40,000 young people with autism, and we’re told that this number is going to increase year after year. Since 2004, our government has invested more than $21 million in more than 20 autism research initiatives. We’re also supporting research in neurodevelopment, including autism, through a $12.5-million investment over five years in the Ontario Brain Institute.", "As we move towards implementation of our new autism program, we’re also going to continue to seek advice from our clinical expert committee. We’ve also established an advisory committee of parents, stakeholders, service providers and other experts to provide advice on the design and implementation of this new program. I look forward to continuing to work with the Minister of Education, the Minister of Community and Social Services, families and stakeholders as we design and implement this new program.", "In closing, I just want to say to all the parents out there: Thank you so much for the work you’ve done. Thank you for your advocacy. I’d like to thank my critics for the work that they’ve done, and I want to say that together we can move forward to build an autism program that every Ontarian can be proud of." ],

Simply put, drugs and driving don’t mix. The fact that one out of four teen drivers who die in crashes test positive for cannabis bears that out. Meanwhile, research on distracted driving shows that texting behind the wheel is equivalent to driving with your eyes closed for almost five seconds. So every time your teen driver thinks of tapping out a text, ask them if they would want to put a blindfold on.", "While it’s true that drivers have a responsibility to ensure that they are distraction-free when behind the wheel, Parachute is also reminding us that passengers have a role to play to ensure that drivers’ eyes are focused where they should be: on the road.", "A recent survey of Canadian drivers found that 96% of drivers would stop driving distracted if a passenger asked them to. Simply asking can save your life and others. And so, as safety on our roads is a shared responsibility, I encourage all of those listening to join with our road safety partners in marking National Teen Driver Safety Week, and ensure that our young drivers and their passengers get home safe." ],

The minister’s words were positive, but let’s not forget that earlier this year, this government threatened the services that exist for children with autism. In March, this government announced changes to our province’s autism program, including removing children over the age of five from accessing intensive behavioural intervention therapy.", "Right after that announcement was made, my colleagues and I shared many stories from families across the province who were devastated by the government’s decision to cut off children from IBI. Day after day, my leader Patrick Brown and the PC caucus shared these concerns in question period and shared stories of children who had benefited from IBI therapy, regardless of their age.", "Even after the government’s own expert panel warned that removing children over five would have a detrimental impact on their lives, the government continued sticking to their talking points. This left hundreds of families in a state of fear and uncertainty as to whether their child would lose out on accessing this life-changing therapy.", "After months of opposition from parents, experts, municipalities, both opposition parties and organizations from across Ontario, the government finally reversed their decision, but there is still much work to do. While I’m happy that the government has reversed their decision, it should never have taken this long, and the fact of the matter is, their original decision should never have happened in the first place.", "We still need to concentrate on the transition between young people and when they go to school, and the transition when young people graduate, leave school and go into their communities.", "In support of raising awareness about autism spectrum disorder, I would encourage everyone to read Autism: The Gift That Needs to Be Opened by the Autism Society of Newfoundland and Labrador. This book is a collection of stories by families, experts and individuals with autism. Three individuals from my riding contributed to the book. I’d like to thank Krista Preuss-Goudreault and Michael and Doug McCreary for sharing their stories.", "It’s efforts like this book and the advocates volunteering in our community that help ASD and foster an understanding for families, for community partners, for educators and for governments." ],

In recent years, distracted and drug-impaired driving have created new challenges for all drivers on the road, as well as our police and other first responders who work to keep everyone on the road safe.", "Our young people are the most connected, technologically advanced generation to ever drive on our roads. Hand-held devices were well established when they started driving, and creating a separation between driving and communicating through text or social media is a new challenge. While Ontario teens need to understand the dangers of distracted driving, I would be remiss not to mention that this is a challenge for all drivers. I think our seasoned and experienced drivers have a duty to lead by example. My colleague the member for Niagara Falls, Fort Erie and Niagara-on-the-Lake once said that we need to address the issue of distracted driving every year. I could not agree more.", "As new technologies are developed each year that work to improve our lives, we must remember that hand-held devices threaten our concentration while driving.

Unfortunately, it was for all the wrong reasons.", "After being embarrassed last November by the size of wait-lists for both IBI and ABA, this government proceeded to try to manage those wait-lists by simply declaring that some of the children on those lists were no longer eligible. People with autism and their families—parents, siblings, grandparents, aunts, uncles—as well as friends rallied the government to let them know that they were wrong. In the thousands, they fought to make the government aware that what they were doing was not based in evidence and was fundamentally unfair to children over the age of five. In doing that, they raised awareness all across Ontario about what autism is and how this government had mistreated them. Thanks to those activists, the government backed down on its policy last June, after months of digging in their heels and insisting that they were right.", "New rules have been brought in. But, Speaker, there is still plenty of confusion in the community about what this program means for children with autism. There is a lack of consistency of information that parents are getting. Children are being shipped into ABA programs of a few hours here and there, which is completely inadequate to meet their needs. Children with autism are entering a school system that is severely under-resourced to deal with the influx.", "Speaker, awareness is more than knowing that autism exists and how prevalent it is. Awareness is about understanding the impact it has on people. It is about recognizing the long-term effects of not providing proper therapy when it is needed. That awareness has to start with the minister. I urge the minister to review the entire file and build a system that ensures that all people with ASD get the treatment they need when they need it." ],

  "text" : [ "Thank you, Mr. Speaker. As we proceed to third reading of the proposed Ontario Rebate for Electricity Consumers Act, I want to review what this bill would achieve and why our government has introduced it.", "When the Premier asked me to take on the Minister of Energy role four months ago, my mandate was clear: to ensure that electricity was as affordable as can be for all Ontarians. As members of this House will know, I’m formerly an executive director of the United Way in Greater Sudbury; and as an elected representative of Ontario’s north, this mandate strikes particularly close to home for me.", "I know the importance of electricity costs to peoples’ everyday lives. I know that despite consistent economic growth since the global recession, many families, both in the north and elsewhere, haven’t begun to feel Ontario’s economic resurgence in their everyday lives. The Ontario government recognizes these challenges, and we are committed to an affordable electricity supply. When I took on this portfolio, it was important to me that we act without delay to help Ontario families and businesses manage their bills.", "Passing the proposed Ontario Rebate for Electricity Consumers Act is an important step in that undertaking. Starting in just a couple of months, this bill would provide significant, immediate and permanent electricity rate relief to about five million eligible consumers across the province.", "Let me recap what is proposed in this legislation: If passed, this act would take effect this coming January 1. It would provide an 8% rebate for consumers eligible for the regulated price plan as set out by the Ontario Energy Board. These consumers are about five million residents, farms and small businesses. This 8% rebate, equivalent to Ontario’s share of the HST, would bring an average residential consumer a savings of about $130; that’s $130 annually.", "So, Mr. Speaker, as you recall from previous statements, the proposed legislation is just one part of a comprehensive package of reforms that would take effect on the same timeline. The timeline we have proposed is ambitious because we know that Ontarians are looking for this support. That’s why it’s so important that this bill be passed quickly. Our partners at local distribution companies in municipalities across the province need the time and clarity provided by the swift passage of this bill, in order to ensure that they can make the changes necessary to provide the rebate to their customers.", "We are also introducing measures to help rural customers, businesses, and commercial and industrial electricity users. For rural customers, our government will be updating the rural or remote rate protection program to increase the amount of available funding for approximately 330,000 eligible customers.", "This proposed funding increase to the RRRP and the 8% rebate will result in electricity relief of approximately $45 per month for eligible RRRP customers, or $540 every year. For businesses, we are proposing to lower the threshold for participating in the industrial conservation initiative, from three megawatts to one megawatt. This program, Mr. Speaker, incentivizes businesses shifting their consumption away from peak hours, which provides two benefits.", "First, it helps businesses reduce their own costs, increasing their flexibility and competitiveness; and second, it also reduces electricity system costs as a whole because shifting consumption helps defer the need for new-build peaking generation.", "In addition to these programs, our government has committed that under the Climate Change Mitigation and Low-carbon Economy Act, all proceeds from Ontario’s cap-and-trade program will be deposited into a new Greenhouse Gas Reduction Account. In turn, every dollar from this account will be transparent, invested back into projects that reduce greenhouse gas pollution and help businesses save energy.", "The Ministry of Energy is proposing to recycle proceeds to offset the impact of cap-and-trade on the largest industrial electricity consumers to keep rates affordable. This means that under the proposed electricity price mitigation strategy, proceeds from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Account will be recycled to industrial consumers, as our government committed in the 2016 budget.", "Now, Mr. Speaker, I want to review why we believe this legislation is the right approach. The Ontario government is committed to an electricity system and electricity supply that is clean, modern, reliable and affordable. But that’s not the system that we inherited when we came into office. Back then, our electricity system was faced with shortages, a dependence on coal, and aging infrastructure.", "But over the last decade, we have rebuilt our transmission and distribution grid and we have closed the last dirty coal-fired power plant. I’m especially proud that we have been replacing coal with clean sources of energy. Our province has been investing in a system that reduces greenhouse gas emissions and provides cleaner air for this and future generations of Ontarians.", "Today, Ontario has over 18,000 megawatts of wind, solar, bioenergy, and hydroelectric energy contracted or online. Our significant investments in renewable energy have helped us to fulfill our commitment to replace coal-fired generation with cleaner sources of energy. This not only benefits our environment but also the health of Ontarians.", "Each of our supply mix elements, including hydroelectric, nuclear, natural gas, wind, solar, bioenergy, conservation and clean imports plays a unique role in delivering a reliable and cost-effective source of energy to Ontarians. The diversity of the current supply mix also insulates Ontario against sudden changes in cost or availability of any one source, and is one of the greatest strengths of Ontario’s electricity system.", "What’s more, our investments in rebuilding aging transmission infrastructure and transitioning off of coal-fired generation mean we’re already well on our way with an electricity system for the future.", "As a result of these investments, we are not expecting to see the kind of energy cost increases that will face coal-dependent provinces and US states as they transition to cleaner forms of electricity generation. Instead, we can look forward to the future with confidence, backed by a power grid that is already clean, already modern, and reliable.", "However, we know that these significant investments have put cost pressures on some families. That’s why this government has used a variety of public policy levers to mitigate rate pressure for consumers. For example, we worked to reduce system costs, saving money for all ratepayers, and some of these actions include:", "—renegotiating the Green Energy Investment Agreement to reduce contract costs by about $3.7 billion;", "—deferring the construction of new nuclear, avoiding an estimated $15 billion in new construction costs, and approving the OPG plans to seek regulatory approval to extend the life of the Pickering generating station;", "—consistently reducing feed-in tariff—the FIT program—and microFIT prices through annual price reviews, saving ratepayers at least $1.9 billion; and", "—suspending the second round of the Large Renewable Procurement process and the Energy-from-Waste Standard Offer Program, for a savings of up to $3.8 billion in costs relative to Ontario’s 2013 long-term energy plan forecast.", "In addition, we have introduced targeted measures to Ontario’s many different customers—urban, rural, business, industrial, and north and south. We removed the debt retirement charge from residential electricity bills, saving the average homeowner around $65 per year.", "For low-income Ontarians, the Ontario Energy Board introduced the Ontario Electricity Support Program, or OESP, which offers monthly credits from $30 to $50. Customers with unique electricity needs—and I think it’s important to mention this—such as medical devices can be eligible for an even higher level of assistance, up to $75 a month. More than 145,000 people have already signed up for the OESP since it was launched in January of this year.", "The Ontario Energy and Property Tax Credit and the Northern Ontario Energy Credit also serve low-income Ontarians. These are on top of the Low-Income Energy Assistance Program, or LEAP, which was introduced in 2011. LEAP includes emergency financial assistance, special provisions and energy conservation programs to help customers in financial difficulty.", "As for the commercial sector, Ontario needs its businesses and industries to succeed, grow and create good jobs. That’s why we have been helping them manage electricity costs with the saveONenergy for Business electricity conservation program, the Five-Point Small Business Energy Savings Plan, the Industrial Accelerator Program, demand response auction, and the Northern Industrial Electricity Rate Program. And, of course, there is also the ICI program.", "The expansion of the ICI program that we’re proposing would empower eligible businesses to reduce their bills by one third. The current ICI program currently has 300 businesses in it. The new program, once this bill passes and if this bill passes, would allow over 1,000 businesses in our province to participate in this program. The important thing to mention about this is that it’s a win-win for us because if you look at the opportunity of the 300 businesses that are currently in the program, they actually saved 800 megawatts of peak generating power. That’s like not having to build two nuclear units. In turn, that saves the entire system from having to upgrade and build more generation, which actually would then help us keep the costs low.", "In conclusion, we’ve spent more than a decade building a clean, reliable and safe electricity system. As the government approaches a balanced budget next year, we believe the first beneficiaries should be Ontario families. The legislation we are proposing would help families, farms and small businesses across the province, and the other elements of our plan would provide rural ratepayers and Ontario businesses with additional relief. Taken together, this is a comprehensive package that would help ensure electricity is affordable for homes, farms and businesses across Ontario.", "I’m pleased to be debating this legislation for third reading and look forward to its speedy passage to ensure that Ontarians can begin to take advantage of the electricity savings provided for in this act." ],

  "text" : [ "I’m not sure whether the minister has been speaking to his House leader or not, but it will have quick passage because you’ve already determined that by invoking time allocation on the bill. Tomorrow, after question period, this bill will pass third reading because you people have the majority and the reality is that we’re going to support the bill. We have supported it since you brought it in—not because we support the energy policy of this government, but because we’re looking for any way that we, in the PC caucus and the PC Party, can find to support ratepayers in the province of Ontario who have been so badly damaged and injured by the policies of this government.", "Interestingly enough—I’ll just start in no particular order—the minister talked about the ICI program. A thousand businesses, he says now. Well, you know, the CFIB was in town here the other day. The Canadian Federation of Independent Business: 42,000 members representing half a million employees. It’s not going to help them very much. Most of their businesses simply can’t participate. But every one of those small businesses is suffering under the energy policies of this government and cannot afford to pay their hydro bills. Where is the help for those small businesses?", "We’ve talked and we’re going to continue to talk about the ratepayers, the consumers and the families that have been injured so badly and are hurting so badly because of the energy policies and the price of electricity in this province, but we can’t forget our small businesses as well—the backbone of our economy. Over 90% of the jobs created in this economy are from small businesses, and we can’t forget them.", "He talks about the industries, and that’s important. That’s an important component as well. Interestingly enough, I spoke to an industry in my riding. I met with them last week. In 2009, they were doing about $25 million in business. Their business was destroyed by fire. They relocated as quickly as possible. They’re doing about the same amount of business today, but their hydro bill is three times what it was in 2009. And not only that, but in that interim period, they’ve done everything possible to make their business more energy efficient. They’ve installed all kinds of brand-new high-efficiency equipment, high-efficiency lighting and all of those things and yet their hydro bill continues to skyrocket. They’ve taken all the measures to reduce their usage, but their hydro bill skyrockets. Why? Because of the policies of this government and the contracts that they continued to sign throughout that period. They took away the municipalities’ right to be self-determinant about whether or not there would be energy projects in their communities. They took away that right of municipalities, and now those projects are built and the price of hydro has gone through the roof.", "When we were at the hearings for Bill 13, interestingly enough—and they were limited as well. I know that very few members in our caucus had the ability to speak to this bill—not that they didn’t have the ability—the opportunity to speak to this bill. I know my friends in the third party did not have most of their members given the opportunity to speak to this bill as well. Then the hearings were truncated as well: one day of hearings here in the city of Toronto, not all across Ontario, where the people are hurting the most, in the rural communities here in the province of Ontario.", "I wanted to just take some excerpts from one person who called in—her testimony was compelling—a lady by the name of Norma Schmidt: I’ll just read directly from Hansard, if I may, Speaker.", "“Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Norma Schmidt. I live in rural Ontario, on the shores of Lake Huron. I am a 60-year-old retired nurse, and have had my life turned upside down by this irresponsible Liberal government. It would take too long to tell my story. Suffice it to say, it has been accomplished in a way that has caused havoc to my life.”", "I’ll read on further: “The Liberal government’s policies related to energy, and particularly the Green Energy Act, are devastating not only for the poor, but for the economy and the environment, and are noxious to the lives of those who live in rural Ontario.", "“The Auditor General this year reported that Ontarians paid $37 billion above market price for electricity. The so-called 8% rebate is a sham and, I believe, a seat-saver for the Liberal government.”", "She goes on to say, further down: “If this government was serious about reducing energy prices, they would stop signing contracts for green energy projects, cancel existing wind and solar contracts, and stop selling Ontario’s assets, such as Ontario Hydro”—what she means is Hydro One. “The Auditor General reported that the electricity component of energy bills rose by 70% from 2006 to 2014 and that it will cost consumers another $133 billion extra over the next 17 years.”", "She finishes by saying: “I’m outraged beyond belief at the disdain with which this government treats me and the people like me who are struggling to live on a pension in poor health.”", "Norma Schmidt speaks for an awful lot of Ontarians with her testimony before the committee—not that long ago; I guess the week before we had our Thanksgiving break. Then yesterday, we had clause-by-clause. Again, two hours were set aside for clause-by-clause to deal with this bill, and there were amendments proposed and the government supported none of the amendments.", "One of the amendments, interestingly, was one that we supported, an amendment put forward by the third party, the member for Toronto–Danforth. There is a concerning part of this legislation that allows the government to actually disqualify people from the rebate. They’ve gone all across the province, the Premier now telling her beautiful story—well, the minister—you’d think that Ontario lived in Shangri-La when it comes to energy policy, when you listen to him speaking over there. But the Premier and the minister went around the province talking about this 8% rebate that every ratepayer is eligible for; no ands, ifs or buts about it. But then they build into the legislation the ability for the minister to actually disqualify certain persons or parties who don’t meet a criteria. Is it all in or is it just the ones that the Liberals want to be in? So the amendment would have removed that section from the legislation, but the government voted against it.", "Now, I honestly thought that I may have had some support from the member from Kitchener Centre on an amendment that we proposed. It may have been a little bit tongue-in-cheek, but we were going to rename the act. Instead of—what do we call it here?—An Act in respect of the cost of electricity—whatever they call it; they’ve got their own name for it—we were going to name it after Raymond Cho, who won the by-election in Scarborough–Rouge River.", "Let me assure you, Speaker, and all of those people in Ontario, that if Raymond Cho had not won the election in Scarborough–Rouge River—if in fact the Liberal candidate had won the election in Scarborough–Rouge River—we wouldn’t be talking about an 8% rebate on the provincial portion of the HST on your hydro bill today. There would be no rebate, because they would have just kept on carrying on the way they have been, ignoring the needs and the desires of the people of Ontario. They would have gone on ignoring the plight that they have put the people of Ontario in. They would have gone on ignoring the pain that people are going through, people who have to make a decision: Do they heat or do they eat? People who are going to food banks because they have to make a choice: “Do we pay the hydro bill?” If they pay the hydro bill and they don’t get their electricity cut off, they then have to go to the food bank because they can’t afford the month’s groceries. They can’t get through the month.", "That is not me making that up. I have that from a lady who works at the food bank in Eganville who, earlier this year, told me how difficult it is in Eganville. In fact, they ran out of supplies at the food bank because they just didn’t have enough on the shelves. When she would ask people why so many people are coming to the food bank, she would be told, “Well, it’s because we had to pay the hydro bill. We can’t get the hydro cut off. We need the electricity for the children, to bathe the children, for hot water to wash, to do laundry—all of those kinds of things.”", "You’ve got to have it. You’ve got to be able to heat your homes. You’ve got to have the furnace running. But if they paid that hydro bill, they didn’t have the money for groceries.", "This is Ontario, Speaker." ],

The government wanted to reset the agenda, wanted to set a new path. Having spent some time in our ridings through the summer, the number one issue that I heard everywhere I went was the cost of hydro continuing to go up, and the sale of Hydro One. So I and most of my colleagues truly expected that the government would listen to the 83% of Ontarians who do not want them to continue with selling off Hydro One. We thought that the government would listen and bring forward some meaningful relief for people who have a really tough time paying their hydro bills.", "Well, we got a speech from the throne that confirmed that they were going full steam ahead with the selling of Hydro One.

They often use that they are taking the HST off. The HST was put on our electricity bill against the wishes of the NDP, and that represents 13%, Speaker, not 8%. What we are getting through this bill is an 8% discount on our hydro bill. How long this rebate, or discount, is going to be applied, we don’t know.

They start on April 1 and, between now and March 31, although they have a mandate to help people pay their hydro bill to avoid disconnection, they are out of funds. All the Red Cross could do was to ask the utility to hold off on disconnection, which they did not do. So he was disconnected yesterday anyway from the utility provider, which means the place that he’s been living at for the last five years is in jeopardy. But you also have to realize that yesterday the high in Sudbury was eight degrees.

He strongly believes that the government of Ontario should be held accountable for going ahead with the sale without the consent of the citizens of this province. Mr. Corbeil is fully aware that they did not campaign during the last election—the Liberals did not campaign to sell Hydro One, yet this is what they’re going ahead and doing. He wants them to be held accountable because this is not what he wanted to vote for.", "Another man from my riding, Mr. John Ross, and his partner actually came to see me in my office because they wanted an update on their Ontario Electricity Support Program, OESP.

Unfortunately, that won’t apply to our not-for-profit, charitable and municipal long-term-care homes.", "When I asked the Minister of Health to help them get this rebate on their bill, I gave the example that the government exempts not-for-profit, charitable homes from the payment of property taxes under the Assessment Act. They were putting forward that the same wording in the Assessment Act could be used in the legislation to implement the 8% rebate. Unfortunately, that was turned down, Speaker. I don’t know why, when we already know that our long-term-care homes are so, so stretched for dollars that the not-for-profit ones, the charitable ones and the municipal homes make no profit. Every penny that goes to them is invested into the care. Why do we exempt them from getting this 8% rebate? I can assure you that the 8% rebate would be reinvested directly into care rather than going to the new shareholders of Hydro One.", "I also have a letter from Mr. Herb Tooker.

As the former president of the Durham Region Non-Profit Housing Corp. and chairperson of the Durham advisory council on affordable housing, I know how hard the region has worked on this issue. Regions like Durham will create affordable housing plans to guide their efforts in reducing or ending homelessness and developing a housing system that best meets local needs. What’s clear is that the problems associated with affordable housing are wide and deep and any initiatives undertaken must be collaborative.", "A stable and secure housing system is a shared responsibility amongst all governments, and all parties have a collective obligation to ensure there is a broad range of housing options to support all Ontarians.", "While my caucus will be supporting the bill to head to committee, it’s clear that Bill 7 adds a number of new costs for municipalities, including requiring enumeration of homeless people, administering the inclusionary zoning program, and inspection and enforcement of the prescribed maintenance standards in rental units or a residential complex.", "My caucus wants to work with the government on Bill 7 to create a workable approach for the people of Ontario that actually works to fix the problems we’ve outlined in debate over the course of the last week and a half. With thousands of households continuing to struggle to make ends meet across Ontario, I and my colleagues in the caucus welcome the efforts from all levels of government to modernize housing assistance.", "The state of affordable housing in Ontario and, indeed, all of Canada requires immediate action, and this was made obvious in a submission from Ontario’s big city mayors. The population of the province is increasing and we read every day about record levels of household debt. We also have a relatively stagnant rental housing development sector, which is increasing housing costs. Speaker, at the end of the day, immediate action is required to address the problem. You know it, and other members of this Legislature know it. We just need to proceed.", "In March 2016, the Toronto Star cited a case of a woman who suffers from PTSD and back issues. Having stable housing accommodation is extremely important for her mental health, and she is indicative of thousands of people in this province. The article referenced the fact that there are tens of thousands of families waiting for subsidized housing in Ontario, and Toronto has the largest waiting list at 90,000—a staggering number, Speaker.", "Now, according to the Canadian housing association’s website, wait times in Ontario range from one to 12 years—Speaker, just stay with that for a moment: one to 12 years—depending upon the type of accommodation required. Clearly, wait times are far too long. As I’ve noted in the past, in my earlier comments on October 5, you can’t coordinate your way out of a supply problem.", "The proposed bill will help update and modernize housing delivery, but an increased supply of affordable rental units is still needed to meet the rising demand in the province. It’s well established. At the same time, it’s also important that we take care of the affordable housing that we already have. Currently, the capital repair backlog in non-profit and co-operative housing is extremely significant.", "I recently read an informative report entitled Affordable Housing in Ontario: Mobilizing Private Capital in an Era of Public Constraint. This was a joint report presented by the Institute on Municipal Finance and Governance, the University of Toronto and the Munk School of Global Affairs.", "According to the report, the chronic nature of the problem remains to this day. The report cites that there were 270,000 social housing units in Ontario, many of which were built decades ago and require major renovations. Estimates suggested that 70% of the units have capital reserve shortfalls, creating a liability of more than $1.2 billion. That’s $1.2 billion, Speaker.", "A Toronto Community Housing spokesperson said in February of this year that money for new affordable housing is needed, but “we have to preserve what we’ve got”—to my earlier point. The spokesperson went on to say that 350 subsidized housing units have been boarded up because the corporation doesn’t have the money to replace what needs fixing. Another 7,500 units are under threat to close by 2023 if they aren’t repaired, “and another 4,000 are in critical condition.”", "Toronto Community Housing is North America’s second-largest social housing provider and reports a $750-million capital repair backlog. Still, there remain over 150,000 households on social-housing waiting lists across Ontario.", "As buildings continue to age, units in disrepair will eventually become dangerous and unfit for habitation. Rising land and construction costs mean that it’s much more cost-effective to invest in the repair of existing affordable housing than to build new units.", "We recognize that there’s no such thing as free housing. The Ontario PC caucus wants the affordable housing problem to be addressed, but instead of solving it, this bill may actually make some housing more unaffordable.", "What’s clear is that Ontarians have accomplished a great deal when it comes to getting affordable housing on the policy agenda. Going forward, it’s up to all of us in this Legislative Assembly to make sure that it stays there and gets the attention it deserves.", "Thank you for the opportunity to conclude my remarks, Speaker." ],

We should all be thinking about affordable housing because we are in a crisis in Ontario when it comes to affordable housing. We’ve been telling the government—the Wynne government, the Liberal government—for years that they should be doing something about it.", "Our member Ms. DiNovo has brought in a private member’s bill five times on inclusionary zoning. Finally, inclusionary zoning will be part of this bill. That’s a good thing. But Speaker, if they would have brought it in when Ms. DiNovo first introduced it, we would have had something like 100,000 affordable housing units built just within the city of Toronto in the past 10 years—100,000. Think about that.", "The waiting list for affordable housing in Toronto is something like equivalent to the population of Prince Edward Island. That’s unheard of. We have to do more.", "This bill is a good step in the right direction. However, it’s so late in the process. We still need a federal housing policy. We still hope the Wynne Liberals, who have a federal cousin, a Liberal cousin in Ottawa, Mr. Trudeau—we hope that he’ll bring in a national housing strategy. The provincial housing strategy is absolutely necessary. This bill needs support.", "Thank you for your time this afternoon, Mr. Speaker." ],

We were uploading health and social services and launching a major provincial-municipal partnership with our provincial NDP government in Manitoba at the time, in spite of that.", "I always wonder why people end up running for the Conservatives when they were in municipal politics, because then we had the federal Conservatives. I was chair of the Big City Mayors’ Caucus nationally in the dying days of the last Liberal government, when we had SCPI and finally had, for about 10 years, some very robust housing policies, non-partisan—Allan Rock, Claudette Bradshaw, Jack Layton and the NDP. We were really making progress. Then, just as we were about to seize the day, as they say, we had Prime Minister Harper, where the entire national housing initiative was completely eviscerated. You could just watch the housing dollars go down. So I always find this interesting.", "We are doing a lot of good things here. We’re not yet back to where we need to go, and it takes a while. I think the commitments from—to be fair about this—both the federal Liberals and the federal NDP were robust commitments on housing. I think this is an area where both the NDP and the Liberals should be working together. I wish we were doing everything every day. I worked with the member from Parkdale–High Park when I first came here because inclusionary zoning was a big thing for me as well, having had some experience with it, and I think that’s collaborative.", "But I love the chutzpah from the member from Whitby–Oshawa, given that, at both the provincial and federal levels of government, you would be hard pressed to find a party that spent less on housing than they did at those two levels of government." ],

People in Perth–Wellington, at that time, I thought were doing quite a good job—at least the people who were administering those buildings were doing quite a good job—at keeping the upkeep of those buildings up to par. Certainly, we worked on a number of projects.", "I think that’s something that has to be addressed quickly: the upkeep of what we have, for sure, and also determining if the money to be spent on what we have right now is worthwhile. Some of these buildings might be in that much disrepair. I haven’t seen that around in my riding, but I understand that it has happened in some other ridings. Maybe the process should be to start over. So I think those things have to be determined. They should be determined sooner than later. If something is deteriorating, it doesn’t go the other way; it just deteriorates faster, and it speeds up. So I think that’s one of the important things that was certainly brought up by my friend from Whitby–Oshawa: that repairs or maintenance of these types of buildings should be looked at very seriously. If they can’t be, if it’s throwing good money after bad to look after these things, then that should be addressed as soon as possible." ],

Ça fait longtemps qu’on veut en parler. Je vous dirais que ma collègue Cheri DiNovo essaye de parler de logement abordable ici depuis au moins neuf ans. Elle essaye, précisément, de parler de zonage inclusif. Qu’est-ce que ça veut dire? Ça veut dire qu’à chaque fois qu’un nouvel appartement est construit, il y aura un nombre minimal d’appartements qui seront à prix abordable. C’est simple comme ça. Si on avait fait ça la première fois qu’elle avait présenté ce projet de loi-là, on aurait au-dessus de 100 000 logements à prix abordable déjà prêts et qui n’auraient pas couté un sou au gouvernement. C’est le genre de proposition, c’est le genre de loi qu’on a besoin de mettre de l’avant et qu’on avait besoin de mettre de l’avant depuis longtemps.", "En même temps, le député de Whitby–Oshawa nous parle du manque d’entretien de plusieurs des logements à prix abordable.", "Si un logement est à prix abordable, mais qu’il est tellement en mauvais état que l’évier ne fonctionne pas, la toilette ne fonctionne pas, les fenêtres ne ferment pas, bien, ce n’est pas un logement acceptable. On veut quand même une certaine dignité. Maslow nous dit que les priorités, ce sont la bouffe et le logement. C’est une priorité pour tous les êtres humains.

That’s where we have to be. That’s the mindset and that’s the space that I think will get us further along on this bill, Bill 7, as it deals with affordable housing in the province of Ontario.", "I’m going to go through a couple of notes here, Speaker: some information that’s been gathered by our wonderful researchers for the sake of those tuning in today. The bill is Bill 7. It is titled Promoting Affordable Housing Act, and it’s second reading.", "What is affordable housing? Affordable housing, under the provincial policy statement, states that:", "“‘Affordable’ means:", "“(a) in the case of ownership housing, the least expensive of:", "“(1) housing for which the purchase price results in annual accommodation costs which do not exceed 30% of gross annual household income for low- and moderate-income households; or", "“(2) housing for which the purchase price is at least 10% below the average purchase price of a resale unit in the regional market area;”", "“(b) in the case of rental housing, the least expensive of:", "“(1) a unit for which the rent does not exceed 30% of gross annual household income for low- and moderate-income households; or", "“(2) a unit for which the rent is at or below the average market rent of a unit in the regional market area.”", "That’s the technical definition of what affordable housing is. You’re welcome very much. Now try to go and find some, in urban areas mainly.", "Speaker, you and I come from the same area, as well as my colleagues from Windsor, where I think we’re fortunate in some sense that this isn’t as pervasive of an issue as it would be in some of the larger urban centres, like Toronto, of course, Mississauga, Hamilton, Ottawa and other areas around the province. We have, I would say, just recently experienced down in southwestern Ontario a resurgence of our real estate market, where prices are starting to go up. Home sales have risen. There’s a lot of interest in our region, so we’re starting to see some pressure on the real estate market and the housing stock. That’s indicative of the calls that we’re starting to get, as well, into our respective community offices. I know that we’re getting calls not only from residents but from municipal leaders who are looking for some assistance, sounding the alarm that the pressure that they’re feeling to provide these affordable housing units is becoming more and more difficult; therefore the need, obviously, for a bill of this sort to provide some remedy, to try to facilitate the increase of stock into affordable housing.", "The pillar of this bill rests on one of the provisions called inclusionary zoning—to be honest, Speaker, not a term that I was ever familiar with prior to being elected in this House. I’m just being honest. I never really knew what inclusionary zoning was. But once you start to understand what the theory is behind it and what the results are if it is implemented, you understand that this is something that is a really important and powerful tool when it comes to addressing affordable housing. What does it do? Well, it mandates that a certain percentage of new home construction and residential construction be allocated to that very definition that I gave you at the beginning—the affordable housing segment. It’s something that certainly those who are in the anti-poverty movement, those who are in the affordable housing movement, the co-operative housing movement—people who are in this universe—have advocated for for a very long time, and, frankly, its time has come.", "Speaker, I want to give credit to our member from Parkdale–High Park, Cheri DiNovo, who sets a couple of records in this place. I think she is the member who has had, as an opposition member, the most private member’s bills passed. She also has to be up there in terms of having tabled private member’s bills. She has a strong track record in terms of identifying issues, and that’s evident in the fact that she introduced a couple of different incarnations of inclusionary zoning bills, dating back to 2009. She’s got five bills dealing with inclusionary zoning and affordable housing under her belt, so to speak. We heard from our colleague the member from Windsor–Tecumseh that had those bills been enacted back when she first proposed them, it would have gone a long way, to date, to address the affordable housing issue. Toronto would now have 12,000 additional affordable housing units if it had been included back in the day.", "The member for Etobicoke–Lakeshore also had a bill, Bill 39, that included inclusionary zoning, back in 2014, something that could have gone a long way to addressing the issue two years ago.", "Nevertheless, here we are, Speaker, dealing with the issue again. Hopefully, this time it will have the political will and the support and be given the priority by the government to actually address the issue, because we know that municipalities are asking for it.", "Speaker, back in the day, in 1999, under the previous Progressive Conservative government, social housing was downloaded to municipalities, something that put an incredible burden onto their delivery and their ability to deliver, something that they continue to struggle with today. We don’t know whether that was the right move or the wrong move. Given the results that we face today with the backlog and the waiting lists and the degradation of the stock that currently exists, we probably should have had a different plan. Whether it should have been maintained as a provincial responsibility and given the appropriate resources—we most likely would have not been in this position, frankly.", "Unfortunately, like so many other bills, Bill 7 looks okay on the surface—and that’s what our concern is. Because many of the details are left to regulation, we won’t know whether Bill 7 turns into a really responsive bill or whether some of the regulations burden it down to the extent that it actually doesn’t give the municipalities the ability or the flexibility to address their concerns and their stock.", "New Democrats, of course, welcome the inclusionary zoning provisions of the bill, something that, as I stated, we’ve long fought for—I might add, against some government resistance. When it was our opportunity to amend bills like Bill 73, the Smart Growth for Our Communities Act, which dealt with growth and urban sprawl—there were no inclusionary zoning provisions in that bill. However, at committee, New Democrats again saw the opportunity to infuse that important aspect into the bill. It was voted down. Here is another incidence and an example where we could have addressed this issue a whole lot earlier than we are today, and it would have done a whole lot of good for the people who are out there waiting for affordable housing and searching for affordable housing.", "Speaker, there are some worrying aspects of the bill, in that it gives municipalities authority over the structure of their social housing agencies, including the power to potentially privatize or dissolve the agency. So our question is quite straightforward: What would the government’s intentions be within this provision? Why is it that you’re providing some guidance, you’re providing the priority, yet you’re giving municipalities the ability to potentially abandon or abdicate their responsibility to provide social housing and privatize it or completely dissolve it? That’s incredibly worrisome for us, as an opposition party, but also for those who are advocating on behalf of folks who are looking for affordable housing.", "The bill also allows municipalities to give cheques to people in need of housing instead of providing actual housing. This flexibility could be good for some tenants in some contexts, but there are certainly risks, given that these portable housing benefits might not be enough to provide actual housing for tenants. Will the money even benefit tenants, or will it simply flow into the pockets of landlords through rent increases?", "There’s another glaring omission in this bill, dealing with affordable housing: There are no provisions in the bill to deal with rent control. It’s another issue that I think is important, something that should be addressed. Not only is the cost of owning a home or renting a home increasing every day—juxtaposed with just the basic costs of living. We hear every day that the cost of hydro is making it absolutely impossible for people to make ends meet. They have to decide whether to turn on the lights or to eat, to pay for the basic necessities of life. So we would love the government to address that issue. It might not make its way into this bill. I would imagine that at some point during the committee process, New Democrats will attempt to address the issue either through amendment or otherwise, but it’s something that we had. It is something that addressed the affordability of housing in the past, but it’s long gone from the rolls of legislation in this province, and we would certainly like to see it addressed.", "The Liberal government promised to eliminate vacancy decontrol and restore rent control prior to 2003. But it’s been, of course, over 13 years, and this continues to be with Bill 7. An overall theme of this bill is the belief that the market alone can provide affordable housing, as if in clearing a few regulations and liberalizing some of the by-laws, the private sector might magically start to build lots of affordable homes. While New Democrats want the removal of regulatory barriers for affordable housing, the market alone cannot solve the affordable housing issue. The federal and provincial governments obviously must step up with more funding to get housing built in the province.", "Unfortunately, Ontarians are still suffering from the effects of federal Liberal cuts to housing in the 1990s and provincial downloads by the PCs. We’re left with a legacy that, of course, we continue to deal with today. That’s why it’s so important, I believe, to take the long approach and the long view to legislation. We’re still dealing with the effects, today, in 2016, of decisions that have been made and the ramifications of those decisions by governments in the mid-1990s.", "I just had my 39th birthday—" ],

How is it that we lose our bearings and good legislation gets off the rails, for what I can only imagine are political purposes? The time has come, obviously, for us to address this issue. This bill does have, we think, some positive effect but, again, we’re cautiously optimistic.", "Bill 7 allows municipalities to potentially drag their feet in creating second-unit policies under their official plans. We know municipalities’ official plans are their roadmap, with waypoints to communicate with their communities and developers as to where they’re going. A large extent of that is mandated by the provincial government. That’s why we believe that municipalities should address the issue and should remove the needless and unfair barriers and costs preventing the construction of new affordable housing. That’s what we hope this bill does—again, so much to be left to regulation.", "I always look forward to the committee process, where we bring in experts, where we hear from them as to what will work, what regulations will protect their ability to build, because we certainly don’t want to stymie any development. We want to make sure, if there’s housing that needs to be built, the pressures on builders allow them to build this in—literally; no pun intended.", "We also have to be straightforward with our intentions and our priorities here, and that’s going to take some political will. I don’t know who the champion of this bill is on the government side, but I think that might be something that they might consider—to get out there to broadly consult with the public. I’m not talking about hiring private consultants. We’ve seen that that doesn’t prove to be the best value for money. I’m saying to get out there on the road, on the street, in the communities with municipal leadership, with people on the ground, and have those discussions to signal quite clearly that this is something that you’re going to put a lot of effort into; you’re going to put the appropriate resources to develop affordable housing stock in the province and to maintain it. That’s a strong signal. That’s something that I think has been lacking.", "We’ve had bills come forward by opposition members. We’ve had bills come forward by members of the government. I hate saying “backbench members,” but they were backbench members. When a bill comes forward from cabinet, from the government, and it has a champion, that sends a true signal to those in that universe that something is going to happen and we should prepare for it and it will see the light of day. When we’re dealing with a billions-of-dollars industry, as housing is, I think it’s quite important that the government do that and work clearly with all parties involved. It is our hope that they certainly do that.", "I’ll reiterate again that the provision in this bill that will have the most impact is the inclusionary zoning mandate. It’s something that New Democrats have long fought for. It would be a recognition of this government and all of our acknowledgement as elected officials that it’s time that we do this and that it is our responsibility to make it happen. It would also be a recognition, and should be a recognition, that we know that times are tough out there and that people are struggling to make ends meet and that your government is there to help their lives a little bit, to help them out and to ensure that in Ontario—we know Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. Housing is way up there; a roof over your head is way up there. We can at least do that. We can at least—" ],

Bill 7 also adds new costs to municipalities, including requiring enumeration of homeless people, administering the inclusionary zoning program and enforcement.", "This government’s policies, from spiralling hydro rates to high taxes to increasing development charges on new homes and rentals, are also making life more unaffordable for all Ontarians, especially the people who require social housing and that type of housing.", "The previous version of this affordable housing strategy promised annual reports that would include performance indicators, yet these were never released.

He covered a lot of ground in the short period of time that he had to speak. Being from our region, from Windsor and Essex county, one of the things that we boast, aside from the beautiful area, especially our waterfront, is the affordable housing that we have. In fact, my home is in Windsor. It’s very similar to the size of my brother’s home here in Toronto, and I can tell you that my home was a small fraction of the cost of what it is here in Toronto. So we know a thing or two about affordable housing in Windsor and Essex county. But I think what any municipality really could use help with—and this bill does address some of it, although it doesn’t go far enough and there are some concerns—is that for those people who are in a lower income situation, have unstable finances and need to have affordable housing, we need to make sure that housing is protected and well taken care of. Often what we find in housing that’s rent-geared-to-income or in affordable housing is that those units are not kept up appropriately, and they need to be. They deserve proper living conditions like everyone else. We need to make sure that as people become financially stable, they then move out of that housing and make room for those who need that type of stability until they’re able to get on their feet, move along and clear out a unit for someone else. We need to make sure that we’re not having private organizations come in and snap up these units and start charging higher rates so people can’t afford to live there." ],

He raised concerns about proposed changes to the Housing Services Act that, if passed, would give service managers the authority to transfer social housing assets. Currently, municipalities are required to get approval from the minister if they want to merge, dissolve or sell their social housing agencies. The concept of getting ministerial consent for the transfer of social housing projects is inconsistent with the notion of local decision-making by the service managers to meet local housing needs. That’s very important, Mr. Speaker.", "The proposed changes to allow service managers the authority to transfer social housing assets would increase their ability to generate revenues for reinvestment in new social and affordable housing assets. Furthermore, should Bill 7 be passed, a ministerial directive would be issued to ensure that tenants are protected and consulted, and that all revenue derived from the sales would be reinvested for housing purposes. Lastly, service managers would still be required to meet their service level standards under the Housing Services Act, 2011, which requires that municipalities maintain a certain number of rent-geared-to-income social housing units in their service areas.", "This legislation, if passed, will help to deliver efficient, people-centred housing programs to reduce wait-lists and help Ontario’s most vulnerable gain access to stable housing." ],

The lack of such guidelines has become a problem in Ontario, as multi-decade agreements expire and affordable housing is inevitably put at risk.", "In that lies a real problem. If we are to deem and to have stock of affordable housing, and then that affordable housing is to expire and be up for grabs, as the member for Windsor West has identified, then we start to lose affordable housing stock, and it starts to degrade. That number gets smaller, inevitably. We would love the government to at least explain how this lack of permanency addresses what we know is a long-term problem and what we know they are not going to be able to catch up with today. So what’s their multi-year plan, going forward, if we are not to ensure that affordable housing be made permanent?", "It’s kind of a simple question. I know it’s not going to be a simple answer. But certainly, there has to be some balance found, and it comes down to priorities. Either we deal with this issue and really put our hearts into it, because it is the right thing to do in Ontario—something that I think we should be embarrassed about, given the numbers that exist out there—or we be truthful with the effects of this bill, because it certainly won’t go far enough." ],

You simply don’t have the wealth and the explosion.", "I agree that the member for Parkdale–High Park played a really pivotal role in getting inclusionary zoning, and it’s a really good thing. I have eight towers of about 30 or 40 stories or higher going up just two blocks from here. If three or four or five stories of each of those buildings were affordable housing, that would solve the housing shortfall.", "As an MPP, I have a housing plan and a neighbourhood plan for all 11 neighbourhoods, because my view is that while people may be homeless, they’re not neighbourhood-less. All the people I represent who don’t have a key to a safe place at the end of the day, Mr. Speaker, certainly live their lives in context in the neighbourhood, and we forget that. I work very strongly with the neighbourhood plan, but we need to elevate this to do more.", "What would some of those “mores” look like? Well, why don’t we have a settlement strategy and a population strategy in Canada? Cities like London and Windsor and some of the northern cities simply have a lot of capacity in schools and facilities. We need to start looking at the infrastructure that pushes population back into those mid-sized communities. Downtown Hamilton is about 50% surface parking right now. There are huge opportunities. While things like inclusionary zoning—my friend from—oh my God, he’s got a long name here—Ancaster–Dundas–Flamborough–Westdale, in bringing this bill forward originally, really understood that, but for me, why aren’t we driven by a population strategy? Windsor and Hamilton are in the centre of the great urban agglomeration in Canada, compared to the place that I was mayor of. I can tell you how hard it is to revitalize an urban centre, and how important housing is. But a larger population strategy, which you’ve seen in some parts of the US and some parts of Europe, is to redeploy population and to look at those kinds of incentives. That deals with zoning incentives. It deals with the location of government offices and infrastructure.", "The sad thing is that we’re living in a time when almost every major industrial country has one super-city. I was just in the UK. London has about 80% of the growth. Even formerly large cities like Leeds and Manchester are just now catching up. Russia is Moscow and St. Petersburg, the only two cities growing. Then Paris—we’re becoming almost single supercentres of urban development, and we need to do something about that.", "But you know, we almost lost 24,000 co-operative housing affordable units because the previous federal government cancelled the operating agreements. I’m not trying to pick a partisan fight here. I’ve already lost two. Two of my largest co-ops don’t have operating agreements anymore, and sadly, they expired before. But that’s 24,000 affordable housing units that are at risk.", "It just seems to me that in Toronto, living here and having been mayor of a poor place, amongst all this wealth and all this development—this extraordinary boom where one city block in my constituency, in a year, grows a bigger population than many small cities—we’ve got to come up with better solutions. We’ve got to do things like co-housing. We’ve got to take on these kinds of initiatives for community land banks and housing banks. I could give you about 20 things that we could do that would create a massive amount of housing, beyond inclusionary zoning. I just wish we got the forum to do that more often.", "I think this is a great law; I think it’s good. I hope, because it’s an innovative, new idea, relatively speaking, that it’s the first of many, because, Mr. Speaker, I still feel embarrassed when I go to bed every night and I know how many of my constituents don’t have a key to a safe place to live. To me, that’s inexcusable.", "I still think—well, I’m hopeful for this. I hope this is the beginning of new ideas, not the end, because we have a lot of ways to solve these problems." ],

One of the reasons why I ran to be a member of this Legislature was that I knew we had a Premier who is committed to municipal reform and to the provision of the ability for municipalities to have inclusionary zoning. So I’m very pleased to be able to rise and speak to this today.", "Mr. Speaker, I actually cut my teeth, as one of my first jobs after graduating from university, as the executive director of a non-profit housing corporation under a program that was done by the then NDP government. That was a great program; it built a lot of housing. It was also a little bit of the old style of program: a lot of government money, top-down, to build affordable housing.", "I think there’s still a role for that, but inclusionary zoning is a way to help all boats rise. In a community such as Toronto, where there is so much new wealth generation being created through real estate development, it means that as these towers pop up all around us, we know there will be a range of residents in the buildings: those who require affordable housing, those who are renting a unit there, those who are buying a unit there.", "Inclusionary zoning will provide the municipality with the flexibility to pass the right types of zoning bylaws within its jurisdiction—and it will be up to each municipality to decide whether they choose to opt for this. But once they put in place this mechanism, every developer, every property owner who seeks to redevelop, to build, will know what their obligations are to provide affordable housing within that development—not cash to municipalities which might disappear elsewhere, not just a vague promise to build something, but it will be designed so it’s formulaic. It will be that a percentage of that project has to be dedicated to affordable housing.", "This affordable housing will take a variety of forms. Some of it might be affordable rental housing, which we certainly need. Some of it might be affordable ownership housing, which is also something that we need, as a government, and municipalities as well, to ensure—that more opportunities for home ownership exist for people of more modest needs. We have organizations like Habitat for Humanity and Options for Homes who do this very successfully. Having a model such as the inclusionary zoning model means that these types of organizations and others will be able to participate in the development of affordable housing in partnership with those who are investing in building these great edifices all over our communities.", "I think this form of affordable housing is a crucial part of the solution to addressing the affordability of home ownership and rental accommodation for Ontarians because it will be tailored to each community. Each community will have the ability to set the types of goals that are appropriate to its market and its conditions. It will guarantee that as these communities grow and develop, all the residents of various means in the communities will have access to live in these new developments.", "Mr. Speaker, this is an extraordinarily important piece of legislation, one which, I agree, we’ve waited for far too long, but it’s here now. I hope that members of all parties will support it as it goes to committee and finally comes back to the Legislature for voting. The time to provide affordable housing to Ontarians is now, and this bill will help us achieve that." ],

We see in Toronto the housing market has just exploded. I think it was a few years ago there were more homes and buildings and cranes in operation in the GTA than all of North America combined. It was a fact that people were using just to illustrate how big this boom has been over the last few years. But I think that with the boom, there have been some consequences as well. We have a lot of people moving into the GTA and the cost of homes has risen drastically in the last few years.", "Our government has taken a response—and I would call it a holistic response—to combatting the challenges of affordability here in the province of Ontario, and we are talking about making sure that we can build affordable homes, but I think it’s part of a larger narrative.", "One of the reasons I, like the member from Etobicoke–Lakeshore, decided to run for the Liberal government was because of their legacy over the last decade-plus here in the province of Ontario when it comes to making life more affordable for people.", "Back in 2009, before I was elected, this was a government that decided to look for ways to expand on education. We put forward a plan to build full-day kindergarten across the province and, at the same time, we built more university and college spots. The reason I’m mentioning these two educational pieces is because we need to make sure that if we want to continue to be prosperous here in Ontario, to allow people to develop themselves and have the ability to go out there and earn an income, education is obviously a key piece to that. The more you learn, the more you earn.", "In addition to that, when we’re talking about affordability, I think we could just look back at our recent economic statement and the piece we put around child care: 100,000 new spots. Again, this is about building affordability for people here in Ontario.", "One of the pieces I’m most proud of as a Liberal member in this government is the work we’ve done recently around tuition. I know these items don’t directly relate to housing but they do directly relate to affordability here in the province. We’re talking about building affordable homes, and I think that by putting forward additional initiatives you allow people to have more flexibility when deciding on where they want to live.", "Our government put forward a proposal to its members to look for a way to better position students here in the province of Ontario. So if you earn under $50,000, as a family or as an individual, now your tuition will be free for college or post-secondary. The incredible thing about this piece is that we know if we have a more educated society, we will continue to develop a stronger economy.", "I’ll close by saying this, Mr. Speaker: With the child benefit—with over 500,000 families using it, a maximum of just over $1,300 per year—with our full-day kindergarten, more child care spaces being opened up, free tuition and with Healthy Smiles Ontario, I think we are creating a more affordable Ontario where people have the opportunity at the end of the day, if they work hard and they try, to build an Ontario, build a life here in the province where they can participate in the economy and really position their family and their children for success in the future." ],

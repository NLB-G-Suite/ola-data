  "text" : [ "I’ll be sharing my time with my parliamentary assistant, the member from Ottawa South.", "I’m pleased to rise today to speak to the second reading of the Health Information Protection Act, 2015, which includes amendments to existing legislation that protects the personal health information of Ontarians. This action, which follows up on a commitment that I made in June, aims to create stronger and more comprehensive protection of health information privacy; a renewed provincial eHealth privacy framework; greater accountability and transparency in the health care system about privacy breaches; as well as improved patient care and patient safety. It’s one more way that our government is putting patients first.", "Together, these legislative amendments would require and reinforce Ontario’s position as a leader in the protection of health information privacy. These legislative amendments are needed to ensure that the personal health information of patients receives the highest form of privacy protection.", "These amendments would also update our health information privacy rules into the 21st century, where health records are now electronic and not locked away so easily, in a filing cabinet, as they once were.", "Mr. Speaker, if passed, our bill would increase accountability and transparency by making it mandatory for health care providers to report certain privacy breaches to the Information and Privacy Commissioner, and to relevant regulatory colleges under certain circumstances.", "Patients across Ontario deserve to know that their personal health information is being protected. My expectation for all health providers who hold personal information about their patients is that they will go above and beyond to ensure that patients’ privacy is being respected. By mandating that certain privacy breaches be reported to the Information and Privacy Commissioner and to regulatory colleges, the individual health care provider, and indeed the whole system, will be able to benefit from the IPC’s review and recommendations for avoiding future breaches.", "As for the prosecution of PHIPA offences, we are removing a serious barrier to such prosecutions. Currently, there is a six-month limitation period from when a breach is alleged to have occurred to when a prosecution must commence. This has often left very little time to conduct a proper investigation. We are proposing an amendment that, if passed, will remove that six-month limitation period, which will give us more time to investigate the circumstances surrounding privacy breaches that could lead to successful prosecutions.", "In addition, we intend to align PHIPA with other provincial offence statutes to require the Attorney General’s consent to the commencement of a PHIPA prosecution rather than requiring the Attorney General to actually start the prosecution herself. To further reduce the occurrence of privacy offences in the first place, we propose to double the maximum fines for PHIPA convictions from $50,000 to $100,000 for individuals and from $250,000 to $500,000 for organizations.", "We’re also proposing to reintroduce privacy protection for electronic health records, as first proposed in 2013—changes that were and are supported by the Information and Privacy Commissioner.", "Finally, the proposed amendments, if passed, would enable appropriate sharing of patients’ drug prescriptions by the ministry with health care providers to protect patient safety and support more informed care decisions. Keeping this province at the forefront of patient privacy protection is understandably what Ontarians expect and deserve.", "The second important piece to our legislation is that we’re proposing to replace the Quality of Care Information Protection Act, 2004, with a new act of the same name.", "One side of this legislation is protecting the patients’ right to privacy, as I’ve just outlined. The flip side is ensuring transparency within the health care system itself, because information should be appropriately shared with the people who matter most: the patients. It’s important that health care providers are able to review information for quality improvement purposes following a critical incident, but this should be done in a manner that also respects the rights of patients and their families to know about critical incidents in hospitals and other health care settings.", "The existing Quality of Care Information Protection Act, or QCIPA, was enacted to provide health care workers an opportunity to share information candidly regarding a critical incident and to promote continuous quality improvement. The act ensures that opinions, speculation and information specifically prepared for discussions about quality improvement, which may include information from investigating critical incidents—that that information and those preparations are protected from disclosure in legal proceedings and from most other disclosures.", "Unfortunately, however, there was confusion as to what must be disclosed to the patient following a critical incident review, and when and how providers should apply to QCIPA in such circumstances. There was a lack of clarity among some health care organizations about how to use QCIPA effectively, as well as a greater need to share experiences and lessons learned about quality improvement opportunities across organizations across this province.", "To better understand the concerns about QCIPA, I convened a QCIPA Review Committee and committed to implement all of their recommendations. All recommendations were intended to help ensure consistent, high-quality, safe and patient-centred care.", "The new QCIPA, if passed, would maintain the existing quality improvement framework but would also provide greater clarity and help encourage better communication with and engagement of patients during the investigation of a critical incident.", "The default in our health care system with respect to critical incidents should be disclosure to the affected patient and their family of all the essential information about the incident, including the facts of what occurred; the causes, where known; and the specific remedial steps that will be taken. Our proposed amendments to QCIPA will help to make it clear that QCIPA can never be a barrier to such disclosures.", "So, if passed, the amended legislation would clarify the purpose of QCIPA and reaffirm the right of patients to access information about their health care. It would clarify that certain information about facts and critical incidents cannot be shielded from affected patients and their authorized representatives. It would allow the Minister of Health and Long-Term Care to make regulations that would require health care organizations to adopt a uniform approach when using QCIPA to review critical incidents. It would clarify that QCIPA does not interfere with health care facilities’ legal obligations to disclose information required by law or to interview patients involved in a critical incident as part of an investigation. And, finally, it would require that the Minister of Health and Long-Term Care would review the act every five years.", "Mr. Speaker, this very important piece of legislation, if passed, will support people and patients, providing more security and protection of their personal health information, as well as ensuring the transparency and access to information that they deserve to make the right decisions about their health care. So I call on all members to support our proposed legislative amendments." ],

Nous comprenons que les Ontariens exigent que leurs renseignements de santé personnels demeurent confidentiels. En même temps, nous comprenons que les Ontariens veulent que leur gouvernement soit transparent et s’engage à fournir des services de santé de haute qualité. Ce projet de loi améliorera nos efforts pour fournir le type de services que les Ontariens attendent.", "As Minister Hoskins has just outlined, the passage of this legislation under debate today would amend the existing legislation to protect the personal health information of patients while also increasing the transparency and maintaining the quality of Ontario’s health care system. When the minister talks about putting patients first, that is exactly what this legislation does. We understand that Ontarians expect their personal health information will remain confidential; at the same time, we understand that Ontarians also expect their government to be transparent and committed to providing quality health care services. This legislation will help strengthen our efforts to deliver the kind of services that Ontarians expect.", "Let me begin by speaking to the matter of protecting patient privacy. The Health Information Protection Act would amend the Personal Health Information Protection Act, 2004, and several other pieces of supporting legislation to strengthen the privacy rules that protect the personal health information of individuals. These amendments, if passed, would make it mandatory to report certain privacy breaches to the Information and Privacy Commissioner and to the breacher’s relevant regulatory colleges.", "This legislation would also strengthen the process to prosecute PHIPA offences by removing the requirement that prosecutions must be commenced within six months of when the alleged offence occurred. Speaker, Ontarians want to know that, should there be a breach of their personal and private health information, the province will take action. These proposed amendments effectively give the government the tools to better protect patient privacy.", "I would note that the Information and Privacy Commissioner was instrumental in the development of these amendments and fully supports this legislative change to strengthen privacy protection and improve Ontario’s ability to pursue prosecutions. In fact, the commissioner has stated that he is strongly in favour of the mandatory reporting of privacy breaches.", "I know that many hospitals and other health care providers already voluntarily and proactively contact the commissioner’s office when they discover that a privacy breach has taken place in their organization. I thank them for their dedication to protecting patient privacy. They recognize how serious this matter is, and that is a strong signal that we are on the right track with this legislation.", "Reporting is an important first step, but we need to take a step further to ensure that anyone considering misusing someone’s personal health information really thinks twice about it. That is why this legislation calls for the doubling of maximum fines for privacy convictions from $50,000 to $100,000 for an individual and from $250,000 to $500,000 for an organization. This would serve as a deterrent for anyone who is thinking of breaching, collecting, misusing or disclosing someone’s private health information for their own purposes.", "Another key aspect of this legislation is that it reintroduces and updates the electronic health record privacy framework that was introduced in the Electronic Personal Health Information Protection Act, 2013. Most Ontarians who receive health services have some form of electronic medical record, and there are many different types of medical records, whether it’s diagnostic imaging, immunization records or a document regarding hospital care.", "Cette loi va établir les fondations pour que les fournisseurs de soins de santé puissent partager des dossiers de santé d’une manière sûre et sécuritaire, et voilà ce que les patients veulent savoir : que leurs dossiers soient confidentiels.", "What this legislation does is build a strong foundation for enabling records to be shared among health care providers in a safe and secure fashion, and that’s what the patients want to know: that their records are safe. This legislation also includes a provision that will allow the ministry to monitor information about a patient’s narcotics and monitored drug prescriptions to their health care provider.", "Speaker, I have spoken at length about the steps this legislation takes to protect a patient’s private health information. That is just one aspect in this legislation. The Health Information Protection Act would also make great strides in improving transparency and patient safety in Ontario’s health care system. In September 2014, our government convened a committee of health care experts to advise the government on ways to improve the Quality of Care Information Protection Act, 2004—QCIPA—and health care legislation relating to critical incidents.", "The committee undertook extensive research and interviewed more than 60 health care professionals, patients and their family members who had experienced unintended or serious errors or accidents that caused them harm, as well as other service quality issues in hospitals. Their findings were presented in the QCIPA committee recommendations, and I’m pleased to say that the government is implementing all of the committee’s recommendations. One of the ways we are addressing these recommendations is through this legislation right now.", "Through the Health Information Protection Act, our government would replace QCIPA with a new act of the same name that will clarify the purpose and appropriate application of this legislation. It would reaffirm the rights of patients to access information about their own health care. It would spell out for everyone what information and facts about these critical incidents must be transparent and shared with affected patients and their authorized representatives.", "Our amendments, if passed, would clarify that QCIPA does not interfere with the right of patients and their authorized representatives to access information related to critical incidents that have occurred. This legislation would make it clear that QCIPA cannot be misused to shield from patients and their authorized representatives information about what happened, what it means for the patient and what steps the hospital is taking to prevent similar incidents from happening again. This is the kind of transparency that patients expect in their health care system.", "We also want to be clear to the health care sector what we expect of them. To make sure that this happens, the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care will be working along with the Ontario Hospital Association and Health Quality Ontario to develop training and guidance for health care facilities and professions on the issue of critical incident review and disclosure. This would help ensure that appropriate disclosure is applied more consistently in health care facilities across the province.", "This legislation, if passed, will ensure we are seeing the progress that Ontarians expect with regard to transparency and disclosure by requiring that the minister review the act every five years.", "We want to ensure that patients know that when a critical incident is under review, it is being done to the same high standards that they expect, regardless of where they live or which facility the incident may have occurred at.", "Our government has made a commitment to the people of Ontario through our renewed action plan for health care that we would put patients first.", "J’ai beaucoup parlé aujourd’hui de ce que les Ontariens attendent de leur système de soins de santé. Ils veulent savoir que leurs renseignements personnels de santé demeurent protégés et sécuritaires. Ils veulent savoir qu’ils peuvent obtenir les informations dont ils ont besoin au sujet de leur propre santé lorsqu’ils en ont besoin. Voilà pourquoi ce projet de loi est si important.", "I’ve spoken a great deal today about what Ontarians expect of their health care system. They want to know that their personal health information remains safe and secure, and they want to know that they can get the information they need about their own health care when they need it. That is why this proposed legislation is so important.", "If passed, these amendments would help keep Ontario at the forefront of protecting privacy of health records and would ensure that patients and their families will be kept informed and have their voices heard when an investigation is required as a result of a critical incident. That’s what patients want.", "J’encourage tous les membres à appuyer notre législation.", "Mr. Speaker, I encourage all members to support our legislation." ],

I know the minister was not in the Legislature during the eHealth scandal but I’m sure he’s well aware of the fact that the Auditor General found that the government had spent over $1 billion on the creation of this health record system. The Auditor General was highly critical and indicated that Liberal-friendly consultants received many contracts that were untendered; and, in fact, there was very little—there was some value in the work that was done, but not $1 billion worth of value, clearly, Mr. Speaker. I think the government will need to be reminded of that and be assured that the opposition won’t let them forget it.", "I also would express to the minister my personal appreciation for his interest in our Groves Memorial Community Hospital project, which we discussed earlier this week in a private conversation. Again, we very much appreciate the government’s commitment to proceed with a new hospital in Centre Wellington, the Groves Memorial Community Hospital. It’s an issue that I’ve been raising in the Legislature for many, many years on behalf of the community, working with community partners. I know that the government and Infrastructure Ontario recently issued a request for qualifications, an RFQ. We’re pleased that that further step has been taken. We know that the government is allowing us to disclose the time frame. We hope to have occupancy in the new hospital by the fall of 2019, with the construction phase being 2017 to 2019.", "I also want to point out that the Georgetown Hospital Foundation is having a donor appreciation night tonight, and I hope to make it. They have moved forward with a magnificent new addition and expansion of their hospital emergency department and CT scanner. We’re very proud of the work that’s done in the Georgetown hospital as well. I look forward to supporting them in any way I can too." ],

Although we’d like to think that the system has evolved in a way that allowed us to restrict access, it is more a wish than a reality. So it falls upon the people who have access to be held accountable, to make sure they only use that privilege when it is for the patient’s well-being. This is a difficult dance to follow each and every day of your career when you work in health care. I’m not sure we have it right the way it is put there, but we certainly have a good platform to work from, Speaker. I will make more remarks about this soon." ],

I couldn’t see as many patients for about six months because we were implementing electronic health records, and it was extremely stressful.", "I know the Minister of Health and Long-Term Care understands himself, sort of, the aspect of patients’ privacy in terms of the patients themselves. It used to be that you would be seeing one patient, and an assistant or staff person might come in with a chart and a question from another patient. You would discreetly try to look, so that the patient in the room wouldn’t see what was in that patient’s chart. Now we have big monitors in the room sometimes, and there’s a patient in the chair. When I worked as an optometrist, I was always moving the monitor.", "It’s as my colleague just said about an emergency room calling out a patient’s name: Even these things are fundamental breaches of privacy. We have to focus on the need for good-quality health care. That’s what we want to ensure. It is a balancing act, as she said. We want to make sure that the people in Ontario know that they are protected by their health care system. Of course, it has to be accountable, transparent and private, but we also have to ensure that we’re not focusing on the technological gadgets all the time and we’re not keeping up to date with new technologies. The fact is that a lot of these new technologies require computerization. As we’re developing electronic health care records, we have to keep in mind that the technology is moving so quickly that we have to almost anticipate: What’s the next level of hardware and software and medical treatments that we need to constantly communicate with?", "In our office, it wasn’t just a matter of putting in electronic health records; it was a matter of having software between diagnostic tests to talk to the actual equipment of the electronic health care record. That was complicated and expensive, to the point that we were paying for, and continue to pay in this clinic, upkeep—software support, it’s called—of three different companies because they are all interacting and talking to each other. You can see, for security issues, how complicated that is. I would say that it’s very similar to the banking system, where people now—who anticipated two years ago that you would be able to take a picture of a cheque with your smartphone and have it deposited in your bank account?", "With all these new technologies, yes, it simplifies life. As the member whose son works in medical records in a hospital just said, it’s actually saving space, and space is very valuable because hospitals pay for the space to store all those records and pay for staff to file those records and to retrieve those records and search around for those records. One of the best parts of electronic health care records is the fact that when you have a paper chart, only one person, only one health care professional, can be looking at that chart at that time. Now with electronic health care records, multiple people can be looking at the same chart at the same time in different aspects. A patient could be having an appointment in one part of a hospital for a test, but another clinician or staff person needs to access that record for another purpose.", "Right now, though, we have a fairly fragmented health care system. I think that—and I’ve said it before so I apologize if I’m repeating myself—we’ve all known, in the health care profession, that Alberta—Alberta Netcare they call it—has a fantastic e-health care system. All we had to do was go to Alberta, our friends, and say, “You have a very similar health care system for the province”—the delivery system is very similar, with a very similar mandate. I can’t imagine why we couldn’t have at least made the effort. I’ve never received an answer, not that I asked formally in writing, but I’ve never really received an answer from this government on why we didn’t just call up our colleagues in Alberta and say, “You have this real state-of-the-art system. You’ve worked out all the bugs.” The physicians are all integrated into the system; the hospitals are integrated; the diagnostic testing centres are integrated. Everybody is saying that it took a few years to really work those bugs out and get it working, but what would it cost us to implement it? Obviously, it wouldn’t have cost us as much as it cost Alberta to set up the whole e-health, and it certainly wouldn’t have cost us as much as we spent on our eHealth, which never achieved its goals.", "It’s a double shame because we can’t just say, “We tried,” when there was an e-health care system in Alberta that we could have borrowed, rented, purchased. We could have even paid the Alberta specialists to come and implement it and train our specialists. So I found it very heartbreaking on a personal level because of the colleagues I would see at conferences from Alberta and they would talk about the complications. Many of them said they had already purchased e-health care systems for their office that they had to basically throw in the garbage and start over again, and they weren’t complaining. Even though they had to spend that $50,000 or $100,000 to implement the electronic health care records, they were not complaining because the new system was working so well.", "In 2014, there were 439 cases reported to the Information and Privacy Commissioner’s office. What’s interesting is that, since reporting isn’t currently mandatory and this bill is going to address that, which is obviously very necessary, we don’t really know what that number is if it’s not mandatory. We all know that people don’t tend to report things unless they know they have to. That is human nature. It’s also human nature, even though it’s professionals in hospitals, to try to access a celebrity. Rob Ford was a politician, but he was also a celebrity, and three hospitals had breaches of his electronic health care records because people were snooping. You could see why people are snooping: sometimes just to gossip to their friends or for their own information, but they could also be selling information to the media.", "Just like I said about banking, we have to ensure—it’s not enough that physicians are perhaps having electronic health care records on a laptop which they take to a conference and might be stolen. Just a few years ago, we read in the newspaper of electronic health care records that disappeared—being stolen from cars or being lost—just from laptops that weren’t encrypted. It begs to mind the question that physicians, who obviously have to have a very high level of intelligence to be physicians, wouldn’t understand the dire consequences of carrying around all their patients’ records on their laptops and not even have a password to get into it, the most basic. But we all know that if somebody really wanted to get through a password on a laptop, they could do it. There are enough talented people. If people can break into banking systems and things like that, we know that there’s nothing foolproof, but we can do our best to ensure that patients’ records are protected as much as possible.", "I reached out to the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario, and they said that they are looking forward to better protection of patients’ privacies, but they mentioned a few concerns, mostly about clarifying the reporting obligations and the new provisions of how to report privacy breaches. They suggest that the language be made consistent with the mandatory provisions in the Health Professions Procedural Code. That’s what has to be looked at whenever we do new legislation: How does it interact with previous rules and regulations not just of the government but also of all the colleges that are affected, and hospital protocol? We understand how complicated that can be, Mr. Speaker.", "In last month’s Ontario Medical Review, which I’m sure the minister receives from the OMA, there was an article about Bill 119, basically summarizing for their membership, and they mentioned something that I haven’t heard mentioned yet today, which is that they expect the bill to have an opt-out system. That’s kind of like negative billing, which means that patients are automatically in the system unless they ask to opt out. Again, it sometimes comes down to individual rights and freedoms versus the collective and the needs of the community.", "We see that with vaccines, all the discussion of vaccines now. People feel that, ideally, their child shouldn’t have to be vaccinated but everybody else’s child should be, and then their child doesn’t really need to be vaccinated, and we can understand that. But if we want to use the information from health care records for studies to see if there are side effects from certain medications, we all understand that the incredible ability of computerization is that you can do searches and say, “Do a search of all the health care records of everybody on this medication who has this symptom,” and it’s very possible that things could come up.", "There is also the aspect that patients sometimes go to multiple doctors, and one doctor doesn’t know that the patient is seeing another doctor. They go to multiple pharmacies and they might have medications that they don’t want one doctor to know about, other medications. That creates problems for the doctors. Ultimately, the doctors are responsible for the health care of the patients, and it puts them in a tough bind sometimes, because if they don’t have all the information in front of them, how can they possibly make informed decisions about their patients?", "I’m just looking here, again, at the incredible system that Alberta has, and wondering why we’re not doing more than just protecting the privacy of patients. Why aren’t we finally addressing the fact that Ontario does not have a state-of-the-art electronic health care record system? EHealth spent over $1 billion. Actually, for years, we heard that, yes, the eHealth part of it wasn’t implemented but there was going to be a registry of diabetic patients in the province, and we were going to be able to do great research and information exchange. Even that didn’t get done.", "It’s not enough to say, as one of the ministers stated, that what’s in the past is in the past. That’s not good enough, Mr. Speaker. As the government, even in opposition, it’s our responsibility to ensure that the taxpayers’ money is used wisely and used for the purpose for which it was intended. It was intended that patients would have not just electronic health care records in their physician’s office, not just electronic health care records in a hospital, but that all of the different systems were going to be able to interact. They do not interact right now.", "Interestingly enough, I’ve gotten a few calls in the last couple of weeks from physicians who say that they have stopped receiving the government payments to cover the portion of their investment for electronic health care records. I haven’t had the opportunity, but maybe now it’s an opportunity for me to ask the health care minister what’s happening with compensation for physicians, for private clinics.", "One physician I spoke to just this past week said that two of the specialists, who work predominantly at SickKids, who come to his pediatric clinic in Richmond Hill only work one day a week—sometimes one day every two weeks. One is an allergist, and I think one might be a rheumatologist—a pediatric allergist and a pediatric rheumatologist. They say, “Well, if we’re not receiving that $300 or $400 a month to cover our share of your electronic health care records, we just want to go back to paper records.”", "What I said to this physician is—" ],

Yes, we can’t say that these offices are paperless, because referrals are coming in through the fax machines and things like that, but at least they don’t have to pay to store those charts and they don’t have to look for those charts all day long.", "It’s very frustrating. As somebody who spent many hours in my former profession looking for patients’ charts—there’s nothing worse. As somebody who worked with her husband—probably the most stressful part of working with my husband in a medical clinic was that he would accuse me of having the chart, and I would accuse him of having the chart, and invariably it was me who was at fault. I have to say that those charts pile up, and somewhere in there is the chart that I should have put for re-filing.", "I think there is a question among patients about accessing their records if they move out of the province. That’s always a very big question, and a problem for many patients. When they move out of the province, how do their records get accessed? Are they going to be able to get a printed copy or an electronic copy?", "Right now, a lot of diagnostic tests, even MRIs and ultrasounds, are put digitally on a DVD, and the patients have to go pick it up from the hospital after a radiologist has viewed it and actually transport it to another hospital where they have an appointment with another specialist. That is an incredible waste of people’s time. It’s an incredible waste of money, because they have to put it on a DVD and bring it to another hospital. When you have a great system like Alberta—and even Newfoundland, supposedly, has a better e-health system than we have in Ontario, which is quite shocking. That’s not what the digital age is all about.", "It’s a little bit like us here in the Legislature. We are not using electronic devices. It’s a historic place here. It’s about protocol. It’s a bit old-fashioned, I guess, for most people, but it’s not the most efficient place. I’m sure that the people at the Hansard desk would love it if, instead of sending around pieces of paper to them, we could just press “send” from our device, and we would send them our notes, and they could just upload it.", "That’s exactly how health care systems are supposed to work. It shouldn’t be patients picking up DVDs from one hospital to bring to another, as is happening in downtown Toronto right now. I know that even very recently, patients had to go from Mount Sinai to a nearby hospital and pick up a DVD. I’m just shocked when I hear that kind of thing. There’s duplication of services, because if patients are seen in an emergency room up at their cottage and have a test done, when they come to Toronto and they say to their doctor, “Well, I had a test done,” the doctor says, “It’s easier for me just to reorder the test and send you to redo the test than it is for me to access that information.” That’s a waste of health care dollars.", "I think that’s sort of what it’s all about. Yes, it’s very important to spend the money updating the privacy of electronic health records. At the same time, it’s more important to make sure we have a state-of-the-art electronic health care system. I don’t know why we are just focusing on one aspect of eHealth instead of revamping the whole thing.", "This is part of the problem: Health care dollars—too much is being spent on bureaucracy. Invariably, patients understand that rent has to be paid and staff have to be paid, but with a real state-of-the-art electronic health care record system, patients’ privacy could be protected and the efficiencies could be there. Yes, it’s an initial investment; we see how expensive it is. Maybe it is not too late to ask Alberta for some support or help.", "Most hospitals now have electronic health care systems in place. The problem is that different hospitals have different systems and, yes, the doctors’ offices that are part of the government-approved system to get support funding have to be on specific electronic health care record companies. I think there were five companies they were allowed to use. But there are still many physicians who are outside of that loop; they’re not getting any government support or funding, but they’re using electronic health care records systems that are not able to be integrated into any kind of health care system that we implement here. I think that one of our concerns is that, yes, we can oversee the privacy concerns of any health care record system that is integrated in the loop for the government, but what about all these private clinics where people basically just make a Word document, and they call that an electronic health care record, and they type it into the computer? Maybe it’s a bit old-school, but they feel that they’re retiring in a few years and don’t feel like investing $100,000 in electronic health care records.", "I think that I’ve pretty much covered what I wanted to say today.

Yes, as the member from Thornhill said, sometimes workers were a bit nosey, looking at patient records. But there have been situations in this province where nurses and other health care workers—but nurses in particular, because that’s who I represented—were terminated from their jobs, and we were unable to get their jobs back. Some of them were actually viewing patient records as a learning tool.", "I’ll give you one example: a nurse in one of the hospitals that I represented who worked in the emergency department part-time and worked in the step-down ICU part-time. On Sunday, he might be working in the emergency department and he might have seen 20 patients during his shift. On Monday, he’d come in and he was looking after a different group of patients; maybe some of them were admitted to that unit; maybe they weren’t. This nurse would go back and actually look at some of the patients that he saw in the emergency department and was treating on the Sunday. That was considered a violation of the legislation because those patients were no longer in his circle of care. He was going back to see, “Did that patient really have a myocardial infarction, or was it just indigestion and was he sent home? Was I correct?” He was terminated from his job. We were unable to get the job back.", "I think that there needs to be something in the legislation that takes into consideration that nursing is a caring profession, and sometimes they want to continue to make that connection with their patients." ],

The issue is very clear that we have a system that’s supposed to be publicly funded and publicly delivered.

They were cut off on the Thursday, that day. The very next day, the pharmacy was calling them to tell them they had no coverage.

Once you make one withdrawal, once you have lost this trust, the account is empty and will stay empty forever. I want us to get this right, but life shows us that we are a long way from that.", "Others have mentioned what happened to Mr. Rob Ford, whose personal health records were accessed over 100 times by people who had nothing to do with providing care to this man. This is wrong; this is wrong on every level that you look at. We had other cases where people were actually collecting data when a new child was born in this province and selling that information to a baby photographer so he knew who to contact so that he could sell baby photography to them. This is wrong. This is wrong on every level that you look at.", "This bill puts steps in place to make sure this never happens again. But there is a big “if” and there is a big “but” in there. It assumes that the electronic health system will be able to block things, will be able to shelter information from some people, some part of your chart. Unfortunately, the systems we have in place right now—whether you look at the system the health units are using, Panorama, or that the different hospitals are using, or community health centres or family health teams, they’re all using different systems but none of them has the electronic ability to do this in a way that is electronically secure.", "What does that mean? That means that responsibility then lies on the shoulders of the people who use that information. So the education of the people within the system will be huge in order for them to comply with a bill that is so tough to understand. Although I have been here for a long time, and I follow the health file very closely, I have a hard time understanding it. Can you see the disconnect there, Speaker?", "We are putting forward a bill that depends on electronic means that do not exist at the present time. I sure hope those will become available—the sooner the better—but right now, as we speak, they are not available; so then the responsibility shifts to health care providers and anybody else who works within the health care system, whether it be the custodian, the medical secretary, the receptionist or anybody else who happens to be around at the time.", "Then there’s the other big elephant in the room: that more and more of our programs and services that used to be delivered within the hospital system—a hospital has means. They have a reputation and they have many reasons to want to get it right. They will have their lawyers look at this; they will have a way to teach their staff and physicians to make sure they understand. But more and more the programs and services that used to be within our hospitals are now being transferred into private clinics, into the community. Our hospitals are being told that if it is not acute hospital care, then it is okay to send it off. Most of them are under really tight budgets. They look at where they can decrease their expenses, cut costs, and they say, “If we stop offering outpatient physio, then we don’t have to pay for those services anymore, and those services will be provided by for-profit physio clinics in the community. If we stop providing colonoscopies and let a private clinic in the community do them, those are savings that we can achieve.” And they’re doing this; they’re doing this full tilt. Did you know, Speaker, that—my time?" ],

Aujourd’hui, nous allons non seulement débattre de ce projet de loi, mais nous allons également voter pour ce projet de loi qui créera une nouvelle institution d’enseignement universitaire.", "Le projet de loi s’inspire de tout le travail qui a été fait par le RÉFO, par la FESFO et par l’AFO durant les dernières années et qui s’est conclu avec le sommet sur l’éducation postsecondaire.", "Nous avons dû travailler fort pour avoir des écoles primaires, puis des écoles secondaires, pour les francophones. Après plusieurs années, nous avons réussi à avoir nos conseils scolaires pour les écoles primaires et secondaires, et plusieurs de celles-ci offrent également des garderies pour nos tout-petits.", "Il y a un peu plus de 20 ans, nous avons eu les collèges francophones, comme le Collège boréal et La Cité collégiale, qui sont encore ici.", "Nous sommes présentement sur le chemin pour compléter le système d’éducation et mettre en place notre Université de l’Ontario français.", "Je dois dire un gros merci également au commissaire aux services en français. Lorsqu’en juin 2012 il a publié son rapport spécial d’enquête intitulé L’état de l’éducation postsecondaire en langue française dans le Centre-Sud-Ouest de l’Ontario : Pas d’avenir sans accès, il est devenu clair et il avait conclu que les possibilités limitées d’études postsecondaires en français, les longues distances et l’autonomie fragile de certains établissements affaissent les efforts de recrutement et de rétention, entrainant dès lors une perte pour la communauté franco-ontarienne. Je lui dis merci.", "Aujourd’hui, les néo-démocrates veulent une Université de l’Ontario français. C’est clair; c’est net; c’est précis.", "Comment on fait pour se rendre là?

J’ajouterais que c’est un silence gênant. Pour être complètement transparent, le ministère des Collèges et Universités ainsi que la ministre déléguée aux services en français ont émis un communiqué de presse conjoint suite au dépôt du rapport, mais le communiqué ne dit pas grand-chose. Donc, aujourd’hui, j’espère que pendant la période de débats on pourra en apprendre plus sur la position des différents partis politiques en Ontario face à l’Université de l’Ontario français.", "Si on n’en a pas entendu beaucoup du côté des libéraux à date, eux, les Franco-Ontariens et Franco-Ontariennes, en ont beaucoup à dire. Entre autres, plus de 2 200 personnes ont soumis une demande d’admission. Ça, c’est 2 200 personnes qui ont quelque chose à dire. L’université n’existe pas encore, mais on a 2 200 inscriptions déjà. Ce qu’ils sont en train de nous dire au travers de ce processus-là, c’est qu’ils veulent qu’on fasse le premier pas.", "Le premier pas, c’est clair. C’est de mettre en place un conseil de gouverneurs transitoire. Donc, ce sera déjà le conseil de transition qui sera là pour établir des liens avec l’université francophone existante, parce qu’il faut se souvenir qu’on a une université francophone à Hearst; mon collègue de Timmins–James Bay me le rappelle régulièrement. Ils auront également des liens avec les universités bilingues ou celles qui offrent des services en français. Il faut reconnaître que l’Université Laurentienne, l’Université d’Ottawa et le Collège Glendon à York, toutes ces universités, offrent des services en français. On a également nos collèges, le Collège Boréal et La Cité collégiale. Ces gens pourront établir des liens. Ils pourront faire des recommandations—et ça, c’est une recommandation que bien des gens attendent—sur les sites. On en entend beaucoup parler.", "Pour ceux qui ont participé aux états généraux, c’est clair que les gens qui ont participé à cet exercice voudraient voir un campus principal à Toronto avec des campus satellites dans le Nord, dans le Sud-Ouest et dans l’Est. Pour les gens qui viennent de se joindre à ce projet, qui sont excités par la possibilité d’avoir une Université de l’Ontario français, ces gens-là, disons qu’ils sont moins précis par rapport. Mais ce serait quand même au conseil de gouverneurs transitoire à décider. Il y a des étudiants potentiels dans toutes les régions de l’Ontario, donc on aimerait que tout le monde y ait accès comme le commissaire aux services en français nous l’avait dit.", "Obtenir une gouvernance universitaire pour et par les Franco-Ontariens, c’est d’avoir un établissement pour lequel on gère tous les leviers. Donc, la gestion inclurait les programmes, c’est certain, mais inclurait également l’administration, les finances, la vie étudiante, les activités académiques, la recherche, tout ça pour et par les francophones. Bien entendu, on parle du corps professoral, des étudiants, des services de l’admission, etc.", "Les étudiants et étudiantes parlent haut et fort. Ils veulent un milieu universitaire francophone, un milieu où on est garanti qu’il n’y aura pas d’assimilation. Plusieurs d’entre eux ont fait toute leur école primaire et secondaire en français et maintenant se retrouvent avec le choix déchirant de soit faire face à l’assimilation dans une université anglophone ou même bilingue, ou de devoir s’exiler pour venir à bout de faire des études universitaires en français. Les Franco-Ontariens et Franco-Ontariennes devraient pouvoir étudier en français dans leur province sans avoir à déménager.", "Donc, ça c’est ce qu’on veut. On veut voir la mise sur pied d’une université de langue française avec un mandat provincial, avec des campus régionaux coordonnés qui peuvent offrir une formation généraliste, mais également la formation spécialisée dans les régions appropriées selon la demande. Ils veulent une université faite sur mesure pour l’Ontario français, centrée sur la transmission et la création du savoir, qui forme des travailleurs, des penseurs, des créateurs et des citoyens pouvant contribuer au rayonnement de l’Ontario français et de la province dans son entier. Ils veulent un établissement qui offrira une formation de qualité, qui constituera un milieu de vie social en français, et ils expriment également qu’ils veulent être ouverts aux gens pour qui le français n’est pas la langue principale.", "La langue française joue en Ontario un rôle historique honorable depuis plus de quatre siècles. On vient de fêter nos 400 ans. La Constitution lui reconnaît le statut de langue officielle au Canada, et le français est reconnu en Ontario comme langue officielle en éducation. De plus, la Constitution reconnaît à la communauté franco-ontarienne le droit à la gestion scolaire. Nous gérons présentement un réseau de 450 écoles primaires et secondaires, 12 conseils scolaires et deux collèges communautaires en français. Les Ontariens et Ontariennes d’expression française n’ont cependant qu’un accès limité à des programmes postsecondaires en français.", "Je crois que mes collègues dans les trois partis reconnaissent l’apport du patrimoine culturel des francophones à l’Ontario et désirent le sauvegarder pour les générations à venir. Il est en effet dans l’intérêt social et économique de la province d’améliorer l’accès aux programmes postsecondaires en français dans toutes les régions de notre province. La création d’une université de langue française en Ontario est donc une étape logique et souhaitable qui permettrait à la communauté franco-ontarienne de disposer de tous les établissements scolaires nécessaires à son épanouissement, à sa pérennité et à son rayonnement.", "Les buts de l’université : offrir des programmes de premier cycle et de cycles supérieurs qui sont innovateurs; de favoriser un apprentissage, un enseignement, une recherche et un exercice professionnel de langue française qui soient de la plus haute qualité; de contribuer à l’avancement de la communauté franco-ontarienne; d’être une université qui est gérée et administrée en français et que tous les services soient disponibles dans cette langue; de promouvoir l’Ontario à l’échelle nationale et internationale en mettant l’accent en particulier sur les contributions économiques et culturelles de la communauté franco-ontarienne; de faciliter les échanges avec les éducateurs anglophones et allophones de l’Ontario afin de leur donner l’occasion de s’immerger dans un milieu scolaire universitaire de langue française; et de permettre aux étudiants francophones venant de régions éloignées ou de familles à faible revenu de faire des études universitaires en français.", "Nous avons cette opportunité, cet après-midi, de faire un pas. Est-ce que c’est le pas qui nous amène au fil d’arrivée? Bien sûr que non. Le chemin sera encore long, mais avec tous les jeunes que l’on a ici avec nous aujourd’hui et avec tous les gens qui sont prêts à nous aider sur ce chemin, je me sens confiante que l’Ontario est prêt à faire ce pas aujourd’hui : non seulement d’en discuter de façon positive, mais également de voter pour que ce projet de loi passe sa deuxième lecture.", "Je vous remercie, monsieur le Président, et je remercie tous ceux qui se sont déplacés aujourd’hui pour être avec nous pour ce débat important, un débat historique.

C’est l’organisme porte-parole des 25 000 jeunes francophones ici en Ontario. Ils ont une voix très, très forte, comme avait dit ma collègue de la circonscription d’Ottawa–Orléans. Alors, bienvenue ici à la législature de l’Ontario.", "Je vais parler un petit peu aussi en anglais.", "I have a study from the Conference Board of Canada that states that the province is losing enormously by not investing in a university system managed by and for francophones. According to the Conference Board of Canada, investment in Quebec and New Brunswick governments in the bilingual population increases access for these provinces to foreign markets and leads to additional economic benefits of up to several billion dollars. More specifically, and I’m quoting from the study, “In 2011, exports from Quebec and New Brunswick to French-speaking countries were two times more than would be expected considering their share of overall Canadian exports. The difference is even more marked with imports: Quebec and New Brunswick import from French-speaking countries two and a half times what they should given their share of Canadian imports overall. This indicates that the eight other provinces are doing much less trade with francophone countries in proportion to their share of Canadian global trade.”", "Obviously we need to have strong, educated francophone community members across Canada, not just here in Ontario, who can advocate and travel the world and develop those trade agreements and work for companies that do trade with other companies, and to develop and open up those markets. Certainly we see that happening in the provinces with the numbers of students who have more than just high-school and elementary-school French. In order to do that sort of international trade work, you have to have language skills from post-secondary and university-level programs.", "I’m going to just say that en français : l’étude du Conference Board du Canada souligne que la province perd énormément en n’investissant pas dans un système universitaire géré par et pour les francophones. Selon le Conference Board du Canada, l’investissement des gouvernements québécois et néo-brunswickois dans le bilinguisme de leur population augmente l’accès de ces provinces aux marchés étrangers et mène à des retombées économiques supplémentaires pouvant atteindre plusieurs milliards de dollars.", "Je veux parler un petit peu au sujet des francophones ici en Ontario.", "I want to say a few things about francophones here in Ontario; these are just a few facts for everybody to absorb. Among the 13.5 million people living in Ontario, 1.4 million speak French, which is over 10%; 611,500 of them identify as francophones; 42.2% of francophones live in eastern Ontario, 35.7% in southern Ontario and 22.1% in northern Ontario; by 2025, half of all francophones in Ontario will live in southern Ontario; 60% of francophones are born in Ontario; 14% are born outside of Canada, mainly Europe and Africa.", "Part of the support from this side of the House for a francophone university is that there’s a lot of talk about increasing francophone immigration. But one of the keys for immigrants—we see it between the United States and Canada—is that if somebody goes to university in another country, there’s a pretty darned good chance they are going to stay there. They meet somebody, they make friends, they get comfortable, they do some part-time work and they make connections in the community.", "It’s a fantastic way for us to boost francophone immigration in Ontario, which we all keep talking about and supporting, but it doesn’t quite seem to be happening. The target is to increase francophone immigration to 5% of new immigrants who would be from francophone countries and able to at least work to a reasonable degree and converse to a reasonable degree in French and contribute to all the francophone communities we have in Ontario.", "Up in York region, in the riding of Thornhill, we have l’AFRY, l’Association des francophones de la région de York. Mona Babin was the « directrice », and now her friend Valérie is taking over. Alain Beaudoin is the president. They have fantastic events and a fantastic summer program for students. We cannot keep that level growing without francophone university students. In fact, some people have even said to me, “There’s a lot of francophone universities in Quebec, and if our francophone students want to go to a francophone university, they could just go to Quebec.”", "That brings us right back to what I said about immigration. If our francophone students go to Quebec, they might decide to stay in Quebec. That’s not what the francophone communities here want to see. They don’t want to see their young people moving outside the province for university, not to return. I think we actually want to do the opposite, Mr. Speaker. We want to have francophone students from Quebec come to Ontario and maybe settle here, and this is definitely one way to do it. So it’s not just about a francophone university.", "Ce n’est pas seulement une discussion au sujet d’une université. On devrait parler un peu de la qualité des programmes dans cette université. Est-ce que c’est quelque chose pour étudier pour devenir médecin ou dentiste, ou est-ce que c’est seulement un programme des sciences sociales? J’espère qu’on peut en parler un peu. Peut-être qu’on peut avoir des programmes pour travailler au gouvernement, parce qu’on voit qu’on a besoin de personnes ici, des Ontariens et Ontariennes, qui peuvent non seulement parler en français mais écrire des choses dont on a besoin—des « press releases ».", "I’m going to repeat that, Mr. Speaker. There’s the question of what kind of programs and what kind of quality a francophone university would have. Obviously it would have to start small, but my suggestion would be to consider having programs that would help those of us here who are working in government—you know, as somebody who is not francophone—je suis francophile. But we’re always looking, in all levels of government in this province, for people who have the necessary skills, who can write articles, who can do press releases in French and not merely have a bit of French-language skills. Maybe it’s something we can work on to have an internship, un programme de stage. Somehow there could be some kind of co-operation between those of us who are elected officials and have students from a francophone university spend time interning in our offices. We could be part of that program and a part of that solution, because we see that in the medical professions. You don’t just go to university and get the degree. Some of the greatest programs have the best internships. Obviously, doctors have to practise in hospitals and clinics. As an optometrist, I had to work in a clinic for two years. We also see the co-op programs that are so successful.", "So my personal opinion is that I would really like to see some type of work/school program that would help us for purely selfish reasons. We all are often looking for staff not just in our offices but in the ministries and in so many areas in the government—if we want to continue to be a true shining light of francophone communities in Canada, not just, “Oh, yes, Ontario also has francophone communities.”", "I’m going to end by saying that on that level, my nephew, Eden, est étudiant à l’école secondaire le Collège français, ici à Toronto, au niveau 11. Il venait souvent pour m’aider à traduire, « translate », mes notes en français. He was born to a mother who grew up, like I did, in an English suburb in Montreal. She went to a French university in Quebec City and then she did, at the Sorbonne in Paris, a master of education, and she made a big effort to speak to her little baby son in French. He went on to go to a French-only school—not French immersion but French-only school. I have to say, now, when he speaks English, he sometimes has a French accent. Merci beaucoup à Eden Gladstone pour m’avoir aidé. Thank you very much. Merci beaucoup à tous les étudiants qui sont venus." ],

Part of that is the incomplete transmission of the French language by parents to their children in the home, but the other part of it is the fact that once you get past high school, the opportunities to actually go on to university or college are limited, if you want to study strictly in French.", "I just want to spend a couple of minutes talking about the erosion of French-language services under the act in my own riding. As a nurse in the Welland County General Hospital, before it became part of the Niagara Health System, where they brought eight hospitals together and closed three of those sites, we used to offer French services in our hospital. We offered French lessons to our nurses and to our health care workers. We translated documents—patient teaching documents and surveys—into the French language, but that has all gone by the wayside under the Niagara Health System.", "When I contacted the Niagara Health System, after I spoke to the French Language Services Commissioner about this issue, basically what they said was—I asked for the documents that actually supported their programs—that they were non-existent, and when we talked to them about it, they said they would do their best, and that purchased services are available in the public domain to provide French services. Well, that isn’t enough.", "It’s not acceptable to expect families to actually pay for French services when the government is mandated to do it. Closing the Welland site of the Niagara Health System, which is proposed by this government, is going to further erode those French-language services for a community that has a 15% French population.", "I have to actually sit down now because my time is up, but merci beaucoup." ],

It’s quite often I meet someone who’s from a francophone diaspora, who has come to Canada, or someone who’s been here for quite some time. I think it’s my last name that kind of activates the conversation, and they say, “Oh, Michel Coteau, how are you?” We have a bit of a conversation. It always surprises me how many francophones would live in a place like Don Valley East. Our francophone culture is very large across the province of Ontario.", "I know that, as Minister of Citizenship and Immigration in my previous portfolio, I had the opportunity to talk to a lot of people throughout the community when we were bringing through the immigration act that set a 5% target for francophone immigration here in the province of Ontario. I remember the conversations we had around small towns in Ontario that were established by francophones and some anglophones many years ago.", "All throughout Ontario, the francophone history in Ontario is a long history. If you go back to the early settlement of Europeans in this region, you’ll find that there’s always been a strong francophone presence in Ontario. People are often surprised when you say that Ontario has the second-largest francophone population in Canada. Sometimes people think it’s New Brunswick, but it is Ontario, again, with several hundred thousand francophones.", "I know that there’s a strong demand for French-based education in this province. If you look at Toronto, for example, while I was a school board trustee, we had a massive expansion of French immersion. I believe at the Toronto District School Board currently there’s roughly 20,000—I could be wrong with the number, but the last time I checked, it’s roughly 20,000 students who are in French immersion. In fact, my two daughters go to a French immersion school. It’s one of the three at the public board that is fully French immersion. They’re not introduced to English, I think, until grade 4. The demand at that school continues to grow and grow. It’s a real issue for that school because they’ve run out of space. There’s so much demand.", "I think that this type of a response to a demand is—looking at other academic institutions that would be able to support the growing demand here in Ontario would be quite good. I think that looking for ways to support any type of education attached to francophone and French learning in the province of Ontario is great. That’s why I’m so glad that Madeleine Meilleur has been looking at ways to bring people together to look at this initiative for expansion.", "I think I’ve gone over my time so I’m going to sit down now, but I have so much more to say on this topic.

He crumbles very quickly in the glare of grandma. That’s quite an impressive influence that one person has on a child’s life.", "It’s extremely sad that more than 75,000 grandparents in Ontario are denied access to visiting or seeing their grandchildren.

It states that when a grandparent makes an application to the courts to have the right to access their grandchildren, have the right to custody—or, in some rare cases, they could take full custody of their grandchildren. The problem is, when grandparents get to courts now, they make that case; they make that relationship. However, the court’s response to them is, “I’m sorry. You’ve made your case. I hear what you’re telling me, but unfortunately there’s nothing in the law for giving me that directive.” This bill would give direction to the courts—just direction—because it would add the word “grandparent” to the Children’s Law Reform Act where it does not currently exist.", "There is still a responsibility, when the grandparent makes an application, to prove that it is always in the best interests of the child.

That’s what this bill does.", "The relationship between my children and their grandparents is strong. My one son spends weeks at a time—it actually gives me and my wife a break when he’s away from the house—but you know that he is there, getting the values which my wife and I have instilled into our kids.

I want to start by thanking the member from Algoma–Manitoulin for bringing this bill forward today and having the courage to bring it forward again.", "Just shortly after I was elected in 2014, I had one couple visit my office and talk about the former attempts to bring this bill through the House. At that point, they asked me to sponsor this private member’s bill. I was unable to at that point, because I had already committed to and started work on my private member’s bill last year, which was the Lung Health Act. But I certainly appreciate the comments from the member opposite.", "Our government is firmly committed to supporting Ontario’s families and ensuring that a child’s best interests are looked after, and this is an important part of that commitment. I know that the member opposite was saying he hasn’t had the privilege of being a grandparent yet, and I want to let him know that I’m looking forward to that in May. I went to Copenhagen for a couple of days to see my stepson and his fiancée get married. They’re expecting our first grandchild in May, and I couldn’t be happier. I’m looking forward to that very happy event. Hopefully they’ll be living closer to North America than Europe at that particular time.", "Again, it brings this home for me, as I’m looking forward to the birth of our first grandchild and really reflecting and pausing to look at my experiences with my own grandparents and my children’s grandparents. As we know, the role that grandparents play in the lives of children can be enriching to the children, the grandparents and indeed the extended family.", "I just wanted to add a couple of comments about the private member’s bill. Under the current law, our courts must consider the “love, affection and emotional ties” between a child and any person who is applying for custody or access. In fact, currently, in an application for custody or access under section 24 of the Children’s Law Reform Act, “The merits of an application ... shall be determined on the basis of the best interests of the child,” considering a broad range of factors that include among others, “the love, affection and emotional ties between the child” and the persons involved in the child’s care and upbringing.", "This would likely include grandparents in any instance where the child’s grandparents are an active part of the child’s life. I want to stress that point, Mr. Speaker: At present, under Ontario law, a grandparent already has the ability to obtain an order for access to their grandchild if such access is found to be in the child’s best interests. So when the member from Algoma–Manitoulin’s bill states a requirement that a child’s relationship with his or her grandparents be considered among the factors in determining the child’s best interest, I don’t think we should see that as an entirely new concept. It does already exist.", "Rather, what the member’s bill does is make the grandparents an explicit factor in the determination of access and custody. I know that determining access and custody in today’s scenario is really a difficult, complex and highly nuanced decision that a judge needs to make. It says that a change to make grandparents an explicit factor to consider, regarding the best interests of the child, could have symbolic value and may satisfy the concerns of grandparents who believe they should be treated differently from non-grandparents under the language of the Children’s Law Reform Act. The proposed amendments are technically unnecessary, however, and would not change how custody or access determinations are made.", "In regard to the other reform contained in the member for Algoma–Manitoulin’s bill, I think we all need to look very closely at how “unreasonable barriers” are defined in the relationship between children and their grandparents. As well, I would ask the member opposite whether that requires parents to facilitate a positive relationship between the child and the grandparents. I think it’s fair to say that some grandparents may have unreasonable expectations about how much access they should have with their grandchildren and where and when that access should take place.", "Also, we seem to be working on the presumption that having access with a grandparent is always in a child’s best interests, but in reality, that may not always be the case, and I know the member from Algoma–Manitoulin has talked about that. There can be so many determining factors of that: It may be a very strained relationship between a parent or both parents and either set of grandparents. It may be that it’s not in the child’s best interests because the strain of that access point, of where and when and how long, can be difficult for the child. It’s very difficult, sometimes, for the custodial parent or guardian of that child to really know what’s being said or done or talked about in the presence of the child, in a strained family relationship. So I just want to be cautionary about that particular situation.", "As I said before, family dynamics, particularly during family strains and breakups, are very, very complex. I’m cautious about the bill being overly prescriptive. The decisions that judges have to make in light of strained family dynamics and all the complexities that can fall upon families—make the decisions very difficult for judges. I think there are a lot of complexities that are different. All families and sizes of families have differences. There are differences in family relationships and dynamics there. I know that judges strive to keep the interests of the child at the centre of these decisions.", "As we know, just as there are unfit parents who represent a risk to their child’s well-being, the same can be true for grandparents, and I think we in this House would recognize that. There have been several court cases, even in the last few years, that have looked at the abuse that some children have had to suffer at the hands of their grandparents. There have been several convictions of grandparents who have mistreated their grandchildren. I know that those are few and far between, but we do need to recognize that.", "I’ve said before in this House that I was a pediatric nurse at the Hospital for Sick Children for the first 10 years of my nursing career. I was working with children under age four and a lot of children who were coming in with a diagnosis of neglect or potential child abuse or something like that—failure to thrive was another. Those children I remember in my nursing career weren’t always parented by parents. They were sometimes coming in with guardians who were aunts, uncles, grandparents. Some of these children that I saw—babies and toddlers, in particular—had horrific signs of abuse.", "I remember, actually, the first child I ever admitted to the Hospital for Sick Children was a 13-month-old little girl. She had a rope burn around her neck. The story that I had from the parent and the grandparent at the time of admitting that child was very different from the story that they came in with the next day. The bottom line was that it was the grandparent who was later convicted of abusing this person.", "Those are the kinds of things that come to my mind, Mr. Speaker, when I’m looking at the protection of children.", "In closing, I think that it’s a very difficult decision to prevent someone’s access to children in their family, but our concern continues to be paramount—for the well-being of Ontario’s children. We want to make sure that we’re not overly prescriptive and that judges continue to be allowed to make the nuanced and difficult decisions that they need to, to protect the children who are there in front of them.", "I wanted to reiterate again that, under today’s law, grandparents are able to ask for access from Ontario’s courts, to be able to continue to see their grandchildren.", "In saying that, Mr. Speaker, I just want to recognize again the member from Algoma–Manitoulin’s bill today. Those are just really a few of my thoughts. Indeed I do support getting this bill into committee and having that dialogue and a greater debate, to be able to hear from all points of view. Again, I want to thank him for his caring attitude by putting a bill out today that really tries to address some of the issues that we’ve heard about in our constituencies about parents and families, and grandparents in particular.", "Thank you very much.

I think that being a grandparent—apparently; I’m not there yet—is a heck of a lot more fun than being a parent. You can certainly see why, because when you’re a grandparent, you’re there for all the good times. You can say bye-bye when it’s not so great.", "I grew up with my grandparents living across the street from me.

How would the grandparents know unless they’re being told? People can sneak off and get divorced and the grandparents wouldn’t have any input.", "I think this bill isn’t insisting that grandparents remain in their grandchildren’s lives. What this bill is saying is that they must be aware. That’s how I’m taking it, that the grandparents must be told there is a divorce going on. The kid has to be—if they’re old enough to discuss and to assess what the emotional ties are with the grandparents and to see if the court wants to mandate that the grandparents should have access if they want to have access—that they are able to somehow communicate that to the court system, to the judge.", "We see too often in custody disputes that there are a lot of sour grapes and chips on people’s shoulders and they’ll do anything to punish the opposite party, even so much as hurt their own child by denying their child access to their in-laws or maybe even their own parents, who maybe they feel slighted them.", "I think that the member from Algoma–Manitoulin is addressing something that does affect a lot of people. I don’t think that this is a small number of grandparents. Certainly there are the vocal grandparents. We’ve heard of them in the newspapers, who have protested not having access to the grandchildren, but I think that there are probably tens of thousands of grandparents who are denied access to their grandchildren. Perhaps the grandchildren moved away. If they offer to have the grandchildren fly out to visit them, they’re not even able to communicate that because they might not even know where their grandchildren are if the court doesn’t mandate that they are allowed to have some kind of access.", "He’s not here today, but the member from Etobicoke Centre told a beautiful story about how his grandfather insisted he learn Ukrainian and learn about the Ukrainian culture, that it was one of the closest relationships in his life and that he really credits his grandfather for a lot of his success.", "I bet that if we speak to a lot of people in here and we talk about our families and who was influential in our lives, a lot of us here had a support system that went beyond just our parents and our siblings; it went to aunts and uncles and grandparents. It definitely does take a village to raise a child, and I would hate, for the child’s sake, to see that they’re denied a relationship with their grandparents if they want to have that relationship and if the grandparents want to have that relationship.", "I am also looking forward to hearing from members of the community. I think that it’s going to be interesting in committee to see which community groups come to speak on this and what they have to say. I think that the fact that we’re living in a multicultural country really says a lot about different cultures and different attitudes to raising children. I think that a lot of the new Canadians—we certainly see it when we go knocking on doors, Mr. Speaker. The door is opened and you start talking to somebody, and it turns out that they’re the grandparent, not the parent. The grandparents are there, sometimes living with two or three generations, sometimes four generations, in one house. It’s a very vibrant, lively household, and those children are extremely lucky to have that type of atmosphere and that type of upbringing.", "I think the main thing we all have to remember is that the child should come first. If a child is only a toddler and the parents get divorced, that child might have different needs as a toddler than they have growing up and being older, perhaps in their teens. I think it would be very sad if we couldn’t ensure that grandparents could somehow have a connection to their grandchildren, if the grandchildren want that connection and the grandparents want that connection." ],

  "text" : [ "It’s a pleasure to rise again on this bill. As was mentioned by the member from Algoma–Manitoulin, this has been before the House several times. It begs the question: Why are we still debating it? Why has this not happened? I would certainly send that concern over to the government side.", "I also wanted to say to the member from Cambridge, because she was very articulate in her concerns that the reason that Kim Craitor brought this forward was because of the actual experiences in court cases, that I will read what one judge said when grandparents actually did go before that judge and asked for the ability to see their grandchildren. Again, the best interests of the child were that these grandparents would have access to their grandchildren, and the judge said, in response, “There’s nothing in the current legislation that directs that I should do that, so I’m not going to give you that opportunity.” That’s why we’re here. In the courts, when grandparents go forward to try to get access to their grandchildren and it is in the best interests of the child, judges are still saying things like that. That’s why we’re here. That’s why we need this legislation.", "My children didn’t have any grandparents, and I only had one, so I can tell you that we miss that opportunity.", "I want to share a story—it’s very quick—with the member. Obviously not going to be named—a grandmother who raised her grandchildren. The reason she raised her grandchildren in my riding was because her daughter had addiction and mental health issues, was in and out of institutions, was clearly incapable of looking after them herself. It’s a sad story. She raised these children from birth until they were in their teens, and all of a sudden the mother came and asked for custody. That mother—this is her own child, so this is not even a custody dispute in a divorce case—came and asked for custody back, and she had to, by law, give it. Then the daughter refused the grandparent any access to those grandchildren. Remember that this grandparent was, de facto, their parent—the only parent they’d ever known. The daughter went on to relapse. The grandmother lost contact with her grandchildren. Imagine the horror of that. Imagine the sadness, the tragedy of that.", "That is exactly the tragedy that the member from Algoma–Manitoulin’s bill hopes to prevent, because, really, it is about the best interests of the child. We understand the concerns. Some of the concerns are that the grandparents, for an abusive parent, will intercede and will simply be stand-ins to be able to give that abusive parent access to these children again. That’s why we go back to this: the best interests of the child.", "That’s why it’s so important, though, to give everyone who’s involved in that child’s life an opportunity to make their case equally before an adjudicator. That’s why it’s so important. This is not taken lightly. There were busloads of grandparents who came into this Legislature when this bill was first and second and third introduced. Grandparents across Ontario want this bill to be passed. Parents want this bill to be passed. More importantly, the advocates of our children’s best welfare want this bill to be passed. So in the interests of our children, in the interest of the best interests of our children, please let’s get this done, finally." ],

  "text" : [ "I am pleased to rise to speak to Bill 142, An Act to amend the Children’s Law Reform Act. I’ve been contacted by a number of people in my riding over the years about the inability of grandparents to visit their grandchildren. It is an issue: Very caring people who just want the opportunity to visit and be part of their grandchildren’s lives. Sometimes it’s blocked just because of issues in the family that really are not fair to these people. Many friends of mine are grandparents, and they are such a big part of the children’s lives. I think if you look at that—what a loss it would be, for the sake of a sometimes petty battle between parents, that they be blocked or something, because they can add so much—the outings, the guidance, the help.", "Children’s lives can be so complicated today. The opportunity to get out with grandparents in a situation sometimes that’s not quite—it’s away from some of the issues that they see in school and their homes. It’s so much of a benefit that they can provide.", "I know that this bill has been previously put forward five times, and supported, I believe, by all, each time moving onto the next step, but never getting through. We’re really hoping that this gives an opportunity for the bill to go through. I know that early in the new year, I’ll become a grandparent, and I’d like the opportunity to be part of that. Who knows what the future brings?", "The system will be there to protect the children. There are cases when the court is—it’s the right decision. But in most cases, I believe, when grandparents are having trouble getting to see their grandchildren, there really is nothing there other than some external issues that really are penalizing the children.", "We see this also in the case of foster care. Grandparents are looked upon by the experts as being the first choice. I think that speaks a lot about the credibility and maturity that grandparents can provide. Sometimes it’s very worthwhile to the relationships and to the well-being of the child and the grandchildren.", "I’m hoping that we can see this bill pass, but not only just pass second reading. I think it’s time—it’s been through enough— that we see the Legislature here actually take it through and put it into law. There seems to be a general agreement that it’s important and that it’s the right thing to do. Hopefully we’ll see, in the not-too-distant future, that this actually becomes law so it doesn’t have come back a seventh time." ],

Most people would be really challenged to work out these numbers, but many activist grandparents across this province will be able to work it out; and I bet my bottom dollar that if the former member for Niagara Falls, Kim Craitor, is watching, he will know exactly what those numbers mean. Because they are the numbers of the bills brought forward to address this very issue over many years. It was also co-sponsored, as we heard previously, in the last two attempts at the bill by the former member for Whitby–Oshawa and by my caucus member and colleague the member for Parkdale–High Park. Today, we can add 142 to that list. I want to thank the member for Algoma–Manitoulin for bringing this very important bill forward again.", "Like other members, I often hear from distraught constituents, grandparents who love and cherish their grandchildren, but who never get to see them; who aren’t able to be a part of their lives. They are heartbroken, but as the law stands just now, there is little that they can do about it. For some, it’s a matter of no more than an expression of their love for their offspring’s offspring. For others, they recognize that their grandchildren desperately need a shoulder to cry on, need support and encouragement, or sometimes they need a place to call home.", "Grandparents have so much to offer, as they have done for so many people since time began. Memories are laced with fond recollections of time spent with our grandparents. Scolding was done by parents, but grandparents not so often. In their later years, grandparents often have more time to relax and a bit more time to enjoy what is around them. They can share the volume of wisdom that they’ve accumulated over the years and, often, life’s experiences that have taught them to appreciate the good things in life.", "I’m not a grandparent myself—thank goodness—but yes, Speaker, I’m hoping that one day I will be a grandparent. But I do recognize the joy I see in grandparents when they have their grandchildren around. I remember quite fondly my own grandparents, my nana and my gramps; and the times we spent with them are some of my fondest memories of mine as a child. They were treasured moments that I will never forget.", "Unfortunately, that is not the case for thousands. There are somewhere in the region of 75,000 grandparents being denied access to their grandchildren, sometimes for no valid reason. Make no mistake: There are valid reasons to deny access to some grandparents, and we consider this in the bill. It’s vitally important that we remember that the best interests of a child should always come first. That is a principle that we must never lose sight of. And I’m glad to see that this bill addresses the issues in a couple of ways, and I’ll quote them.", "“A person entitled to custody of a child shall not create or maintain unreasonable barriers to the formation and continuation of a personal relationship between the child and the child’s grandparents.” “Unreasonable barriers” should address one of the concerns of the member opposite. It also says that the contact should be facilitated “if such contact would be appropriate in the circumstances.” These are very important points to be made as we consider this bill.", "Speaker, it’s five times that this bill has been read in this Legislature and five times that it has passed second reading. This time I’m hoping that it does the same, but I’d like to see something different this time: I’d like to see this brought to committee. Let’s get the work done, let’s make sure we get it right and let’s get these grandparents the grandchildren that they so well deserve." ],

We have an opportunity to do something that has been so needed for such a long time.", "I listened to all the comments that were put around the House, and it is absolutely necessary to put the reference to grandparents inside this piece of legislation, because the answer, when a grandparent goes to the courts and makes their case—the response that they always get is, “Thank you for making your case. You’re justified in your cause. You’ve established the relationship and the need that you have with your grandchildren. However, I do not have the tool to provide you with that opportunity.” This is the tool. If we do this—and I’m going to reiterate it again—it will be done, and it must be done in the best interests of the child.", "I’ll just read this: “the willingness of each person applying”—it’s not automatic. You still have to apply. You have to make a case for your want, your willingness, that relationship with your grandchild. You have to make an application for custody of the child, to facilitate contact between the child and the child’s grandparents, if such contact would be appropriate in the circumstances.", "Again, it’s providing the tool to our courts to act in the best interests of the child, respecting the wants of grandparents.

Usually you want to do things, but sometimes you have to do things that need to be done.", "I just want to read from an article written by Ashley Csanady, from the National Post, a couple of days ago. I think she sums up what this bill is all about:", "“About 37,000 soon-to-be parents lose their baby along the way each year in Ontario—and as many as one in three women will lose a pregnancy in her lifetime. Many of them struggle with a system that often lacks support and training, as well as families, friends and even health care providers who don’t know what to say. Then their grief is compounded by a lack of answers and insufficient research to provide them.”", "This is something that most of us—most people in this province—probably do not want to talk about. It is something that happens to thousands of Ontario families and mothers every year. They lose children through miscarriages, stillbirths or immediately after birth. When that happens, what they run across is almost like a two-tier health care system, in this province and across Canada.", "If you’re fortunate enough to have the birth of a wonderful baby, you get the full and the best health care and support there is. If you happen to be unfortunate, with the loss of a baby, all of a sudden you are treated totally differently. There isn’t the help, the support or the medical experience to give you the counselling you need for yourself and the family. It isn’t there. It’s very haphazard.", "If you happen to be lucky and to be in some of our excellent hospitals—Mount Sinai, or Sunnybrook—there are great teams of expert doctors there, and nurses and nurse practitioners who will help you through this traumatic time. But in most cases—we had a young mother, a very brave young mother, who came to speak at the press conference the other day, Jamie McCleary, and she said it was one of the worst experiences of her life to see her unborn child treated like medical waste. Nobody knew what to do with this dead child of hers. You can imagine the trauma of this mother who carried this baby for all these months and this baby is basically treated, as I said, like medical waste.", "The problem is that it’s sort of a cultural taboo. We don’t like to talk about it. We can’t talk about it. It’s so difficult for mothers and families and fathers. So, therefore, it’s never brought to the public realm. The public knows very little about this trauma that mothers and families go through. Mothers told me that they go to the hospital and the doctors or a nurse or friends will say, “Well, you lost that one, but go ahead, try again. Have another one.” There’s no counselling, no sympathy, and it’s something you can’t talk about because it’s something, supposedly, that you’re not supposed to talk about. Subsequently, the counselling support afterward is not there.", "The way babies are treated if they’re not successful in their birth is really a hit-and-miss thing that is really disgraceful. I know I’ve talked about some of these things and the various experts, and they all agree: We need to start breaking the silence. There’s a Berlin Wall of silence around infant loss and pregnancy. Whether you’re in the medical community or whether you’re in the general population or in the Ministry of Health, it’s a subject rarely dealt with. Subsequently, it doesn’t get the attention and the resources that it desperately needs.", "Thankfully, most of the doctors that I have talked to in recent days are world experts; we’re very fortunate. They all say we need this attention. We need to talk about it. We need to invest. We need to expand existing programs and we need to acknowledge that this is a health issue that can no longer be ignored.", "I talked with Dr. John Kingdom here, the head of obstetrics and maternal health at Mount Sinai. He totally agrees. We have to pay attention to this so that we can get mothers and families the medical support that they need when they go through childbirth and pregnancy. These are things that can be done. We have the ability but because of this, as I said, wall of silence, it’s not given the attention, the resources it requires.", "There is a network called PAIL, Pregnancy and Infant Loss Network, where a lot of volunteers go forward and talk to grieving mothers and families, and give them some support. But this is a very small, fledgling organization of volunteers that’s standing alone in trying to give help to these mothers and families. We need to invest in these types of organizations and have programs right across the province of Ontario. Right now, as I said, it’s very hit-and-miss.", "These organizations, by the way, quietly helping mothers and families, are all over Ontario—they’re in Brampton, Hamilton, London, Peterborough, Toronto, Markham, Durham, Barrie, Woodstock, Sarnia, Renfrew county, and Ottawa—but they’re working with limited resources, and they need to be resourced, along with the co-ordination of expert medical support, which is possible, because we do have the experts here in Toronto, and we have experts in other parts of the province, but we need to co-ordinate them.", "There is an urgent need to do this, because the experts even say, like Dr. Kingdom says, despite all the advances of medical science, the rate of infant loss and death has not decreased in this province. It’s still on the rise every year—thousands of mothers—and the research can’t really tell us why this happens. Does this occur more in Ontario than it does in New York state or in Europe? We don’t know. This comprehensive type of research of the causes and the incidence is not really done. We need to fund this kind of research and co-ordinate this research across the province. We can do it with the expert doctors and nurses that we have here.", "We have a wonderful nurse practitioner who came to the press conference the other day. She came to the press conference. She is the coordinator of this outreach program out of Sunnybrook—Wendy Moulsdale. She does this every day, and she says, “I believe this bill is an important step to begin collaborating with the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care. Together we can share our knowledge....” We have to do better.", "Dr. Mathew Sermer from Mount Sinai says, again, we need this kind of legislation. Dr. Seaward from Mount Sinai—I got a letter from a doctor from Sunnybrook from this morning, saying we need this kind of co-ordination.", "We have capable nurses; we have capable midwives; we’ve got an excellent health care system. But there’s a big gap in our health care system when it comes to mothers who lose their children through miscarriage and stillbirth, or early infant death. They just suffer in silence. They can’t talk to their relatives, because it’s something you don’t talk about. Sometimes their family doctors don’t know anything about the grief they’re going through. Some of them suffer serious mental challenges because of this tragedy they go through. It can affect your mental health and your physical health—not to mention the agony of losing a child that they’ve carried for months.", "What this bill would do is basically help bring—what we’re here for today, I think, with your support—we can bring attention to this subject that nobody wants to talk about. We need to start getting people to ask questions, to discuss solutions and to share best practices. The essence of this bill is to try and bring this out of the darkness into the front of our health care system.", "At the same time, I’m also asking, with this bill, in order to help with this awareness—as you know, we’ve done this with many bills in this House; we’ve had awareness days—for October 15, which is this day in many other jurisdictions, to be called Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness Day. That would help too.", "It’s not going to solve all of these problems overnight, because some of these, as many of you have known, have been talked about quietly for years, but very little has been done about it except, again, in isolated circumstances where you’ve got wonderful doctors and midwives who do something about it. There are programs, as I said, at Mount Sinai and Sunnybrook, but we need to have this available to all mothers and families across Ontario, to see what practices, what protocols exist in Cornwall or Kenora, North Bay and in Burlington. We’ve got to know what’s there for mothers there.", "Right now it is not a comprehensive health care system. As I said before, it’s a two-tier health care approach that exists in this province. It’s not to blame anybody, the doctors or the people in the Ministry of Health; it’s something that needs to change culturally. We need a change in our culture here towards pregnancy and infant loss, and this bill hopefully will move this along to where it should be." ],

He makes a lot of outstanding points and tells some heart-wrenching stories.", "I’ve got to think that the worst thing ever in life is if you have to bury a child. I can’t imagine that. You’d never wish that on your worst enemy. Sadly, this Saturday I’m going to a funeral for a friend of the family. He has been a good supporter, a businessman and a leader. His mom will be burying him. He lived to his fifties: Tom Fleming. Poor Val lost both Tom and her husband, Art, within a year.", "It’s a celebration of life too, a celebration of what Tom accomplished. Whether you lose a child as an adult, teen, or youngster, we have ways of coping with that. It never makes up for the loss, but we have ways of families coming together to give support. But as the member for Eglinton–Lawrence points out, it doesn’t exist for children who are stillborn or for miscarriages. I don’t quite understand why. He says it has been taboo, which is true. I always found it interesting. When Deb and I went through her pregnancies, and friends—you just don’t tell anybody. What’s the unwritten rule? Three months or something like that: You don’t tell anybody. It’s just the way it is. It’s kind of puzzling, because you probably should. It would help us cope with that kind of loss.", "As a result of that, without these coping mechanisms, a way of people giving the support of family, friends, health care professionals, you feel abandoned and awfully empty. I guess for stillborn, too, my God, you go through the same gut-wrenching, extraordinary physical stress. As a mom, the child is born and you’ve got that as the end product: a healthy baby. But for a stillborn, there’s that crushing emptiness that would result from that. As the member said, people will often say, “Well, you can go back at it; you’re young.” It’s really no way to deal with this. This member has a number of initiatives to deal with this in terms of looking at best practices, comparing scientific data, investing in counselling. I think those are all very worthy and timely initiatives.", "I think the other aspect, too—I know I’m sharing my time with my colleague from Thornhill—you beat yourself up, too, right? Without some answers and some help and support, you start beating yourself up when this tragedy hits a family.", "We’re lucky, Speaker; we have two beautiful little girls, Miller and Maitland, six years apart. Miller just turned eight at the beginning of October; Maitland will be almost two for Christmastime—she’ll be two in March. We had some good luck at the back ends and some tough luck in the middle, but we’ve got two.", "In these situations I know the mind will whirl: What could I have done better? Should I have made some different approach on my own health? Did I exert myself too much? Dads will think this, but for the moms it’s going to be deeply wired in. And if you don’t have some better answers, some better practices, some counselling, that’s going to haunt you forever. You start blaming yourself. I suspect that’s some of the psychology behind all of this.", "But if when a stillborn birth occurs, or a miscarriage, there’s a better understanding of the science, there’s some emotional support from family, from friends, from others who have gone through it, if there’s an understanding of the psychological counselling that can help make—I can’t say adjustment, but help to cope—I think we’re going to be all a lot better off for it.", "I commend the member. It’s forward-looking. I just had never questioned before why there’s that three-month taboo. There really isn’t a reason for it. And for all of those who go through that gut-wrenching loss and emptiness, it’s going to help.", "So good for the member for the initiative. I fully support it." ],

It was a horrendous time. The nursery was ready. The shower had happened. Everyone was excited and waiting for this wonderful gift that would be joining their family. But that excitement came crashing down as things went horribly wrong very quickly, leaving extreme emotional destruction in its path. This is just one experience that I’m very familiar with.", "The Pregnancy and Infant Loss Network reports that one in five pregnancies in Canada end in miscarriage, and that in Canada, six of every 1,000 births are stillborn. Thirty-seven thousand families across Ontario experience pregnancy and infant loss each year. Those parents deserve and require support and understanding during their time of grief. That is what this bill aims to do. By amending the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care Act, this bill would add new duties and functions to the minister.", "In addition to those duties and functions already in place, passage of this bill would require the minister to establish research initiatives and programs, undertake analysis to look at and understand what contributes to pregnancy loss and infant death, develop programs to reduce the risk, provide counselling and support to families affected by these tragedies, and undertake research into the best practices of other jurisdictions. It’s hard to argue against the Minister of Health being required to put all of these items in place, and I wouldn’t want to do that. They are all needed.", "There are many things that the minister should be required to do when it comes to the delivery of health care in Ontario. The lack of services for people with mental health problems has been spoken about often in this chamber.", "Earlier this year, I was taken on a tour of a few homes operated by the Good Shepherd in Hamilton: a transitional house where youth between 16 and 20, some of them dealing with mental health issues, learn life experience and skills and learn how to cope; a residential home for youth and supporting families who need support and tools to deal with their mental health problems, trauma and conflict resolution; a shelter for homeless and street-involved youth which provides 20 beds as well as on-site access to mental health professionals, a physician, a nurse practitioner, as well as youth support workers.", "Thanks to the dedicated staff—those workers—and their own fundraising efforts, they manage all of this with government funding of $44 per day. They’re terribly underfunded and, in fact, they have just 1.6 mental health clinicians to service all of Hamilton.

Pregnancy loss and infant death is an exceptionally traumatic experience that does not get the attention it deserves. D. Ferguson is quoted on the Pregnancy and Infant Loss Network’s website as saying, “How very softly you tiptoed into my world, almost silently, only a moment you stayed, but what an imprint your footprints have left on my heart.” It’s very easy to underestimate the impact these events can have on mothers, fathers and the entire family, but I think this quote really brings it home.", "This bill also serves as a reminder of where the government is failing to provide services right across the entire mental health sector.", "The bill will also establish October 15 each year as Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness Day in Ontario. This date is already recognized in the US, parts of Canada, Australia and the UK, and it was previously brought forward to this chamber by my colleague the member for Hamilton East–Stoney Creek. I think it’s fitting we make this declaration now in Ontario.", "Again, I thank the member from Eglinton–Lawrence for bringing this bill forward, and I hope that we can pass it through committee and make sure we get this work done." ],

  "text" : [ "I’m very pleased to rise and debate this very important bill brought forward by the member from Eglinton–Lawrence, named the Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness, Research and Care Act, 2015.", "I noticed that there has been quite a bit of attention given to this bill since being introduced recently. Other than the coverage in media, I actually received e-mails from my constituency. Constituents felt passionately about this bill, and they urged me to support this bill. I would like to quote one of the e-mails: “Losing a baby is very traumatic for a family. It goes against the natural order of things. It can leave families feeling isolated and alone. These families are grieving, and need access to support and resources—support and resources which are sorely lacking today.”", "Which brings me to my fond memory of first having my two kids. Seven years ago, when my daughter was first born at Mount Sinai, which is a wonderful facility situated in my riding, there were entire wraparound services around my wife, the mother, and the newborn. I remember it was specifically on postpartum depression. The mother was cared for in that. I felt like, “Wow, I’ve never experienced this before.” It was a similar experience when my son, Matthew, was born two years after.", "So I’m a little surprised by the lack of services or supports in place for those who lose infant babies or who had a miscarriage. To me, I think they probably go through an even greater chance of emotional distress.", "So I fully support this bill. I think it speaks to some of the gaps in service. If passed, it would establish and expand comprehensive research initiatives and programs to assist mothers and families who experience pregnancy loss and infant death, undertaking a comprehensive, comparative analysis to understand the factors that contribute to an increased risk of pregnancy loss or infant death. This is very important. In this day and age, we all have BlackBerrys and cellphones. Everyone is working on their laptops. You would think that collection of data is so easy, yet we are still dealing with an area where limited data is available for any analysis, for the ministry to even look at it and make some policy around it. I think this bill does just that: It actually shines a light and calls out the need for more data collection, more attention paid in this area.", "The member from Eglinton–Lawrence gave us some good numbers, good stats, on infant loss in the past. I think it is time for the province and for this government to take a look at what we can do to provide that much-needed support.", "It also speaks to developing and expanding programs to help reduce the risk of pregnancy loss and infant death: Develop and expand existing programs across Ontario to provide counselling and support to mothers and families who have experienced a pregnancy loss or infant death. I said I can only imagine a parent going through losing a child. Any time you lose a family member, you need time to grieve. You remember the good times you had with this family member. In this case, it would be very difficult. I can only imagine the parent going back home and seeing the room prepared for the newborn and starting to wonder what it would be like. They can only imagine what it could be like, as opposed to remembering those fond moments.", "I think the support has to be there for these mothers, and fathers as well, to go through a very, very tough period of time.", "It also suggests to undertake a comprehensive analysis and survey of the best practices in other jurisdictions in regard to prevention of pregnancy loss or infant death. We have to look around the world and see how other places are dealing with this issue. I think that if we put our minds and resources to this, we could be a leader in this area.", "I just recently had a visit to China. They’re envious of our biomedical science and the way that we manage our medical system here. I think that if we start paying attention to this area, we could be the leader in this area and provide further assistance, not just to Ontarians but outside of Ontario and even to the world.", "I’m fully supporting this bill, I want to thank the member for bringing it forward, and I look forward to further discussion on this bill." ],

It wasn’t that long ago that nobody would want to admit they were raped. Certainly, parents didn’t want people to know their daughter had been raped. They felt that nobody would want to associate with her or possibly marry her. There was also a huge taboo. We went from that to much more openness—not enough, but much more openness; certainly in the medical field, where doctors will even sometimes ask women now, when they’re doing a case history or seeing a woman for the first time, “Have you ever experienced any traumas of a sexual nature?” They’ll ask it in leading terms. But I don’t think doctors will necessarily ask a woman if she has ever miscarried a child or things like that, unless she’s trying to get pregnant. Then they want to know the case history and want to know if it’s an at-risk pregnancy.", "There are special rooms in emergency rooms set aside in all of our hospitals for women who have been raped, with special information. You would hope that the hospitals would be much more understanding, but I have a feeling they’re not, because they’re under incredible budgetary strain to separate a woman who has given birth to a stillborn child from other women who have given birth to healthy children. You can just imagine: The mother still needs the same health care as a woman has delivered a healthy child. She has still delivered a baby, there could still be complications and she still needs to be taken care of. We would hope, Mr. Speaker, that the resources can be put in place and that we could do something to ensure that the resources are in place, if they’re not in place everywhere.", "I’m going to just say a little bit about my culture. In the Jewish culture—not everybody follows it, of course—basically you’re not pregnant until you’re past your first term, because it was the understanding that so many women miscarried in the first trimester that you wouldn’t tell people you were even pregnant, and if people asked you, you would say, “Well, it’s not three months yet, so we’re not even going to talk about it.”", "Certainly, observant families and even many secular Jewish families won’t hold baby showers and won’t decorate the nursery. They’ll order it, like a registry when you’re getting married and you order dishes and things like that. They’ll order everything and have everything ready to be delivered, and they’ll have a relative or friend at the house to have everything delivered when the woman is in the hospital and they get the phone call that everything is okay, because it’s a tragedy, obviously, if a baby does not survive the birth or has some kind of medical complication and doesn’t live long. But that tragedy is exacerbated by a mother and father having to come home to see all the clothes and the nursery and everything set up.", "Of course, it’s not always practical. My father always talks about how my mother wouldn’t want to have anything in the house. She had four children, and he would be left scrambling, because he’d have to go and get everything, especially for the first child. She didn’t have anything. He said, “I’m bringing a woman home with a baby.” Of course, in those days, they kept you in the hospital for a week, so that left all your relatives time to prepare things for you at home.", "My mother had a little brother, when she was about four years old, who had a hole in his heart. Today, that would be easily repairable. But my grandparents were told, “There’s nothing we can do. He’s going to die in two weeks, and you shouldn’t bring him home. Just tell people that he died and we’ll take care of it from here on.” Well, my grandmother wouldn’t hear of that. She took the baby home, and he lived for two weeks. Because he hadn’t been circumcised yet, he couldn’t have a proper burial. So, my grandfather had to take a shovel and bury him. It’s really heartbreaking. I never talk about it. Sorry, between my hoarse voice and being choked up—it’s not a good combination.", "We all know of somebody who has lost a baby from SIDS, sudden infant death syndrome. The celebrity Marla Shapiro in Toronto became a spokesperson because she was interviewed; she lost one of her children to sudden infant death syndrome. She went on to have a career, basically, in the public forum, speaking out, not just about that but about women’s health advocacy, and became a TV spokesperson on City TV. She’s a regular. She ended up with her own talk show on health issues. I think that was a very brave thing for her to do, because when she did it, very few people were able to go on TV and in the public forum—I’m not even able to talk about somebody I never even met—and she helped so many people by doing that. So, kudos to her and for all the great work she has done.", "I think that our health care professionals are programmed and trained to deal with healthy babies, and they’re uncomfortable and just want to see it end, because it’s painful for them, as well. You can certainly imagine the health care staff spending hours getting to know the parents, only to have the child not survive the delivery. Of course, we all want to do what we can to raise awareness. Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker." ],

  "text" : [ "I also want to thank the member for Eglinton–Lawrence for bringing forward this bill, the Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness, Research and Care Act. This is certainly an initiative that the NDP fully supports. In fact, my colleague the MPP for Hamilton East–Stoney Creek had introduced a similar bill in 2010.", "As women’s issues critic for the NDP caucus, I want to frame my comments from the perspective of reproductive justice. Reproductive justice acknowledges that not all women have the same ability to make reproductive choices. Their reproductive autonomy may be limited by lack of access to abortion services or by lack of social and financial resources that are necessary to have children and raise them in safe and supportive environments. So this bill recognizes that pregnancy loss must equally be included in the full spectrum of pregnancy and parenting options that reproductive justice includes. That covers abortion, IVF, childbirth, adoption and, now, pregnancy loss.", "I want to speak for a moment about language. Certainly language evolves; and I congratulate the member for the language of this bill, because what we see here is a long, overdue step forward from the term “miscarriage,” which is how we often refer to natural pregnancy loss. But what the term “miscarriage” conveys is that there is some fault or blame involved in the loss of the pregnancy, when actually physicians will tell us that pregnancy loss is most often the physiology of a healthy body recognizing that a pregnancy is incompatible with life.", "Unfortunately, Speaker, too many people do not understand the causes of miscarriage. There was a study by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine that found three quarters of both men and women believed that stress can cause miscarriage, two thirds believed that lifting a heavy object could trigger the loss of a pregnancy, and one quarter believed that miscarriage could be caused solely by the woman not wanting the pregnancy. The reality is that most miscarriages are not associated with any action or inaction on the part of the woman. Most are caused by spontaneous chromosomal anomalies that make human development impossible. They also occur, as the member said, much more frequently than many people realize. Women who know they are pregnant experience a rate of miscarriage of about one in five, or 20%, but the rate is much, much higher if it includes the loss of fertilized eggs before the woman knows she is pregnant.", "But because of misinformation about the causes of pregnancy loss, many women feel shame and stigma if they admit experiencing a loss of pregnancy. We have a society that values the worth of women according to their ability, their desire and their willingness to carry a pregnancy to term and to raise children. So it’s no wonder that women often blame themselves. So by talking openly and honestly about pregnancy loss, which is what this bill does by talking about the incidence of pregnancy loss and what can happen afterwards, we can reduce the stigma and the guilt that often accompanies pregnancy loss.", "Speaker, we need to ensure that there are appropriate supports in place to help those who experience pregnancy loss—not only the woman but also the woman’s partner and others who cared about the pregnancy. There may be feelings of profound grief at the loss of hopes and plans for a relationship with a child; and the loss of future identity as a mother, as a father or as a grandparent.", "At the same time, reproductive justice requires that we recognize and respect that there may be differences in responses to pregnancy loss. We have to avoid assuming that all individuals will experience the loss in the same way and will need the same kinds of support. We have to remember that the social norms of masculinity and femininity that condition women’s response to pregnancy loss have an equal impact on men, who are expected to be stoic and strong in their handling of grief and may actually face disapproval if they display emotion", "For pregnant women who have been abused by their intimate partner—and we know that the risks of violence to women increase significantly during pregnancy. We know that the World Health Organization found that spousal abuse increases the risk of miscarriage by 50%. Women who experience pregnancy loss as a result of sexual violence require very specialized counselling and supports to deal with the complex emotions that are associated with the loss of the pregnancy.", "Before I close, Speaker, I just wanted to go back to what I had said in the beginning about the full spectrum of pregnancy and birth options for women. There is a link between pregnancy loss and abortion. When the fetus dies, a D&C is often required to fully end the pregnancy, and this means that comprehensive access to abortion services is vital across this province, not only to protect women’s reproductive autonomy but also to support women through the loss of the pregnancy.", "So, Speaker, again I want to congratulate the member for bringing forward this bill. On behalf of my colleagues in the NDP caucus, we believe that this is an initiative that is important and that should go forward as part of our health care system and the kinds of supports that we provide to women and men and families in this province." ],

I always love private members’ hour. It gives us a chance to talk about issues of mutual interest and concern, but today is particularly important.", "I want to thank, in that regard, my colleague from Eglinton–Lawrence for tabling this conversation today by bringing forward this bill, Bill 141, the Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness, Research and Care Act. I want to thank him because this is an important conversation for us to have, not in a finger-pointing kind of way but in a “Let’s embrace the survivors of loss and let’s do that in a compassionate and empathetic way.”", "This bill, this conversation, addresses an issue that is often underreported and one which we, in Ontario and across the country, often have a hard time talking about, and yet it is an issue which touches so many lives—one that has touched, I’m sure, Mr. Speaker, virtually all of the members in this House. Sadly, it has touched me and my family personally.", "The expected birth of a child is supposed to be one of the happiest moments in one’s life, a time full of excitement and wonder and, ultimately, hope for the future. Far too often, these magical moments are cut short by unexpected events. There is no reason for this subject to remain a taboo, and that is exactly why today’s debate is so important.", "Especially here in Ontario, we are proud of our ability to speak openly about the issues that impact our lives. That is why I’m pleased to say that, if passed, this bill will proclaim October 15 as Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness Day in Ontario. Sometimes, one of the most powerful and important things you can do to effect change is to simply raise awareness about an issue, and this bill will certainly do just that.", "Of course, awareness itself is not enough. We need to deal with the complexities that lie at the heart of issues relating to pregnancy loss and infant death. Individuals who go through these extremely trying experiences need a range of supports to help them cope and to assist them in their recovery. Because each individual and family’s experience is unique, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to providing support when it’s needed most.", "That’s why, importantly, this bill calls for the development and expansion of existing programs across Ontario to provide counselling and support to mothers and their families who have experienced pregnancy loss or infant death. In addition to calling for more research into the prevention and understanding of these issues, an evidence-based approach is needed to help us to help mothers, fathers and their families and all of their loved ones, indeed, when they need it most, to heal their wounds, both seen and unseen.", "According to a study conducted by the University of Rochester and published in the British Journal of Psychiatry, the depression and anxiety experienced by many women after a miscarriage can continue for years, even after the birth of another child. Sadly, we hear stories of survivors whose lived experience of loss simply isn’t being validated or supported. For example, mothers are told that they will be fine once they have a healthy baby, when the research demonstrates that this is simply not true. Of the women who’ve had one miscarriage or stillbirth before giving birth to a healthy child, almost 13% still had symptoms of depression 33 months after their new baby was born. Of those with two previous losses, almost 19% had symptoms of depression—again, almost three years after the birth of a healthy child. That’s close to three years, as I mentioned, of struggling to bear a burden that is, to all of us, inconceivable. As the member from Niagara West–Glanbrook said in his remarks—indeed, Speaker, in his extraordinarily personal remarks—no one should have to bury a child. This is completely outside the natural order.", "Prenatal loss is not routinely considered a risk factor for antenatal or postpartum depression in the same way as, for example, personal or family history of depression or exposure to other of life’s stresses. We need to change the way that we think about this type of loss, and that is what this bill hopes to accomplish. It would recommend necessary targeted support, because, as we know, maternal depression does not just affect mothers, but entire families. It is our duty as public servants to support Ontarians who suffer such tremendous losses.", "Mr. Speaker, it is often said that it takes a village to raise a child, but when a child is lost, that village suffers profoundly. I commend my colleague the member for Eglinton–Lawrence for introducing a bill which would have long-standing positive impacts not just for the women who have lost a child, but for their families and their circles of care too.", "I urge all members of this House to support this bill, because no one should feel like they are going through these incredibly difficult times alone, without the necessary support.

  "text" : [ "I’m pleased to continue the debate on Bill 9 because there are a couple of things I’d like to wrap up in saying.", "As we all know in this House, Bill 9 is very light legislation. It reflects the trend we have from this government in terms of feel-good environmentalism photo ops, as well as legislation feel-good moments.", "We all know that closing coal plants is a finite issue here in Ontario.", "It’s interesting. I want to quote a member from this House in a recent debate that we had on Bill 9. After quoting it, you’ll perhaps understand why I’m disappointed that they didn’t support our one amendment that we had for Bill 9. That quote is from the Minister without Portfolio. In a previous debate on this particular bill, he said, “My good friend, and the former member for Kitchener–Waterloo, Elizabeth Witmer, was a person who believed in it, and indeed she started the conversion of Lakeview out of the use of coal. I commend her for that, and I have been a long-time champion of her doing that on that occasion.”", "That’s why I can’t help but take this time this afternoon to share my disappointment in the government that they did not do right by supporting our amendment and renaming the bill with regard to recognizing Elizabeth Witmer’s initiative to start the conversion of that first coal plant.", "Carrying on from that, it’s safe to say that we’ve had a number of disappointments with this government. That doesn’t take away from the fact that closing coal-fired generation stations is indeed the right thing to do. It’s the right thing to do if it’s done with a smart plan, and that’s where the rub is.", "You look great in the chair, Madam Speaker, I must say.", "Coming back to doing something with the right plan, a smart plan—makes us hesitant, because with this government’s history of eHealth, gas plants, the Green Energy Act, we can’t help but be a little anxious with regard to exactly where we’ll end up.", "That takes me to the fact that, specifically, the Green Energy and Green Economy Act, 2009, was intended to support new investment and economic growth in Ontario through the creation of a strong and viable renewable energy sector. Madam Speaker, I am sad and frustrated to say that the government has absolutely failed Ontario in this regard. It worries me and the rest of my caucus and, I’m sure, the third party in terms of what else is coming down the pipeline.", "We have to talk about cap and trade for a moment or two because that’s another worry. I hope that the government’s decision to push forward with cap and trade—that it’s not modelled on the European system. We don’t have all the details yet, so it still leads one to worry about where we might eventually land with regard to this particular program.", "Obviously, if anything can be taken away from where the Europeans went with their cap and trade, it’s that it was a complete failure as well, much like the Green Energy Act. But we can learn from their failure because we have to be positioned well. We saw the cost of poor planning and pandering to the needs of special interest groups in Europe. What has that resulted in? Unfortunately, that failed vision has seen the re-creation of a dependency that Europe was moving away from. Unfortunately, that dependency is coming back onto coal because of the ill-conceived and total failure of the industrial wind turbine scenario that was fostered in Europe.", "We just heard yesterday or the day before that the UK, probably maybe as early as the weekend, is actually looking at coal plants now. We know that as carbon prices have plummeted in Europe, cheap coal production is continuing to come back onto the plate in conversation. In Germany alone, 12 coal-fired stations are due to open by 2020. That is seriously concerning because we’re pushing to alleviate our province of coal-fired generation and bring down greenhouse gas emissions, but all the while technology is leading and the dire need to bring energy prices back into a realm of affordability—those two main things are driving other jurisdictions to revisit coal.", "For goodness’ sake, I ask this government to make sure that we don’t waste any more time on feel-good legislation because we know that we’ve already committed to closing all the coal plants. But let’s make sure, for goodness’ sake, that we learn from Europe, we learn from other jurisdictions and we take sure steps going forward so that energy in Ontario is affordable and reliable and that when we consider poverty in this province, we eliminate energy poverty, because I’m afraid we are going to be facing a lot of issues associated with that very concern through this winter alone.", "Again, I look to the government to stand up, to lead by example, admit their mistakes, like Europe has and the UK has, possibly stand up and take a leading position and put an end to the unaffordable, unreliable green energy that we have generating through our industrial wind turbines. Do right by Ontario. This is feel-good legislation for this government of Ontario: Bill 9, An Act to amend the Environmental Protection Act to require the cessation of coal use.", "But for goodness’ sake, let’s do the right thing and bring down the cost of energy in Ontario as well. We can get it right by following the lead of Europe and of the UK. Terminate the use of industrial wind turbines, which has done nothing but increase energy costs. We’re very blessed in Ontario. We have nuclear generation. We’ve got hydro generation. We’ve got a natural gas sector that’s busting to fill in some gaps. So let’s remember, as we go forward and we talk about energy in Ontario, that it’s affordable and reliable, and we don’t force people here in this amazing province between eating and heating." ],

  "text" : [ "I appreciate the opportunity to talk on this final third reading of Bill 9. As you’re well aware, Speaker, this bill is pretty simple. When I first saw it—I was talking to the Sergeant-at-Arms about it. There’s no doubt about it: You could hold it up to the light and you could see right through the bill. We’re not talking about a telephone book here; we’re talking about a very simple, straightforward piece of legislation.", "It effectively bans the use of coal at four facilities in Ontario and exempts the use of coal where it’s not used to make electricity for the grid or primarily for the grid. If you’re burning coal today in your auto plant, if you’re burning coal in your steel plant, and you’re not making electricity, this bill does not apply to you. You can carry on tomorrow as you did the day before.", "I support this bill, Speaker. I have to say I’m sympathetic to some of the comments of the critic from the official opposition, because I think we need to go much further than this bill. I wouldn’t say I’m sympathetic with everything she has said, but I think we do need to go much further than simply the shutdown of coal.", "There’s no question that shutting down coal, something supported by all the parties in this Legislature, is an important part—or was an important part—of addressing climate change. But frankly, Speaker, we haven’t seen action afterward that is on the same scale, and if we are actually going to come to grips with climate change, we have to proceed on the scale of shutting down coal on an ongoing basis over the next few decades.", "As has been noted, the plants in question are already closed, and this bill will make it more difficult for a future government to burn coal. No government will be able to start burning coal in those power plants at the simple whim of cabinet. They won’t be able to make a decision late at night in a boardroom somewhere here at Queen’s Park or simply at the end of an excellently catered meal around the cabinet table. They’ll have to come into this chamber and they’ll have to fight for it if they want to resume burning coal to make electricity. They’ll have to fight for the authority to start choking people again, to start sending children with asthma to the emergency rooms again and to make our whole landscape hazy again. Those memories of smog—we need to put them behind us.", "This bill is a firebreak against the return of coal. It is not a steel wall. It doesn’t change our electricity system. Frankly, Speaker, I think that’s where we’re going to have to go. If you want to make sure we don’t have future governments going back to coal, you have to do a lot more than shut down the coal plants that existed before 2003.", "We need to think about the larger picture. All three parties in this Legislature supported the shutdown of coal, in large part because, as our nuclear power plants were taken out of service for refurbishment in the late 1990s, the government of the day ramped up the burning of coal to deal with the shortfall of power. That had substantial, visible, real impacts on the health of the people of this province; had substantial, real impacts on health care costs in this province; and generated a political backlash against the burning of coal.", "That pollution on its own was enough to drive the impetus to shut down coal, and I’m glad that it did. But a larger issue, a longer-term issue and in many ways an issue that will be more profound for the health of the people in this province is the question of climate change.", "A few months ago, we were debating the climate change resolution brought forward by the member from Glengarry–Prescott–Russell, and I read a quote from Lord Stern, a former head economist at the World Bank, who was directed by the British government to write a report on the financial impacts of climate change. In 2006, Lord Stern reported back and talked about the necessity for action. He said this: “The investment that takes place in the next 10-20 years will have a profound” impact “on the climate in the second half of this century and in the next. Our actions now and over the coming decades could create risks of major disruption to economic and social activity, on a scale similar to those associated with the great wars and the economic depression of the first half of the 20th century.”", "Now, Speaker, climate science has moved on sharply since 2006. Many in the scientific community are far more worried about what is coming than Lord Stern was in 2006. The scale of the challenge before us, the scale of the risk to our society, the scale of the risk to the lives of people alive today and the next generations coming after us is quite substantial. We’re talking about disruption of human society on an extraordinary scale. Those among us who may have lived through those events, or talked to their parents or grandparents about those events, know that, in human terms, we are engaged in a very high-stakes adventure, a very risky adventure.", "A few weeks ago I had the opportunity to go to London for a workshop that was put on by the United Nations Environment Programmme and by the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. There were parliamentarians from Bangladesh, Ghana, Botswana, Samoa, Australia, the Cook Islands, the Maldives, the Seychelles. There were people literally from around the world who were talking about their problems—their daily problems—with climate change, and they were casting about for action on a global scale to deal with it.", "I have to say, when I talked to my colleagues from Bangladesh, they said that even with the two-degree centigrade maximum that the international community is trying to keep temperatures below, one third of Bangladesh will be under water and 60 million people will be displaced. They said to me that there are no climate change deniers in Bangladesh. What people are trying to figure out is how they deal with this dramatic, profound change to the life of that nation.", "The representative from the Cook Islands said that three quarters of their population had already moved out, that some of the lower-lying islands were being abandoned, that the rise of the seas was causing salt contamination of freshwater wells, that people were seeing the future and it was not a good one for them.", "The parliamentarian from Samoa talked about the fact that, for three years running, they had droughts that devastated their crops and, at the end of each growing season, cyclones came in and wiped out the crops that had survived. They are not talking about a distant problem. They’re talking about a problem they’re facing on a day-to-day basis now with a drop in their standard of living.", "I had an opportunity to talk to a representative from the Philippines. She talked about the massive loss of life with the typhoon—I believe it was Haiyan—that went through a few years ago, and how the Philippines, first of all, has changed their whole approach to these massive tropical storms, recognizing the potential for large loss of life and putting in place preventative measures and emergency measures that in the last cyclone dramatically reduced loss of life.", "But she said, “What we have to do, what we are doing now, is trying to move people off the shores, off the coastal areas, to further inland.” And they’re extraordinarily resistant because, for many of these people, their life is the sea. They go out and they fish; their whole economy is dependent on that. They want to be able to get up in the morning, walk down to the shore, take their boat out and fish. Moving inland may make it safer for them in a storm, but in terms of their day-to-day life, it is made much more difficult.", "From a parliamentarian from the Seychelles, the same issue: They have some very high ground on their islands and they’re starting to move people inland. The Maldives are in a much tougher spot because it’s much flatter.", "I had an opportunity to talk to the parliamentarian from Ghana. The major part of Ghana’s electricity production is one large hydroelectric dam in the country. Two thirds of that dam is idle because the water levels have dropped so low. For them, it’s a day-to-day struggle to deal with the challenges to their society and their infrastructure from the impacts of climate change.", "Speaker, we here in Toronto, we here in Ontario, have been touched by climate change, and I’ll address that as I go further in my speech. But so far, we’ve had the wealth, the insurance industry, the high ground to ensure that our loss of life has been minimal. That’s not the case with many other parts of the world that are far more exposed than we are.", "This problem, which many in this community see as distant, in other places is today, now, this moment. In many ways, I felt when talking to them that I could see what the future would be like for us, with people constantly trying to deal with the difficulties imposed by more extreme weather events, changing coastline, and parliamentarians who are trying to come to grips with the social conflicts and the physical constraints imposed on them by the changing climate.", "It’s one thing to talk about people far away, on the other side of the world, but I want to talk a bit about how we’ve seen this manifested right here in Ontario. This March, I was going to door to door in my riding, talking to people on Gerrard Street. As you’re well aware, because the climate has changed, the course of the jet stream has changed and we’ve been subjected to large volumes of arctic air coming into Ontario, coming into the northeastern United States. I talked to a pensioner on Gerrard Street whose hydro bill in March for the previous two months was $1,500—more than her pension. For her, it was really an extraordinarily difficult burden placed on her back.", "While we were going through temperatures of minus 20, in Anchorage, Alaska, way up there by the Arctic Circle, they were seeing plus five degrees, plus 10 degrees. That same distortion of the jet stream that brought arctic air streaming into Ontario diverted it away from Alaska for an extraordinarily mild winter. It isn’t just that the world gets hotter, but that the climate and weather patterns change substantially. The weather becomes more erratic. It is more difficult to grow crops because it is very difficult to know what the weather will be from year to year.", "In fact, there was an article in the New Yorker, I guess it was eight or 10 years ago—a very good science writer talking about her conversations with climatologists who looked at the change in climate at the end of the last ice age. One of things that they noticed as they went through the ice core record, as they went through the record of sediments at the bottom of lakes and of oceans, was that the climate would change quite suddenly. You would see multi-degree rises within a decade, not slow changes over many decades; and you would see something that they called “flicker,” where the climate would go back and forth from very cold to very hot from year to year. When we see this very strong variation from year to year here in Ontario, it makes me think that we may be seeing many of the same processes that were seen at the end of the last ice age. As the world got hotter then, the world climate regime became more erratic, more unpredictable and fast-changing.", "It isn’t just Toronto, obviously. You get very disruptive, very chaotic events that people notice when hurricanes go through places like Goderich. A friend of mine was in Goderich the day after the hurricane a few years ago—extreme devastation, a total shock to the people of that town. A gorgeous town, if anyone’s been there—a beautiful central square; a really nice place—just mowed down. Goderich, Superstorm Sandy going through New York City or Hurricane Katrina going through New Orleans—more and more disruptive events that have a huge impact in human terms and a huge impact financially.", "Superstorm Sandy, as it’s been called, caused about $5 billion worth of damage on the American eastern seaboard. Since that time, insurance companies on a global basis have been getting themselves ready for a $10-billion event on the American eastern seaboard. The scale of impact is expected to continue to grow.", "In the summer of 2013, Toronto was hit with some of the worst flooding ever. I want to read a bit of what the Toronto Star reported: “The storm and flash flooding that hit the GTA on July 8 has set a record for the province’s most expensive natural disaster, according to the Insurance Bureau of Canada.” We’re all going to be stuck with those bills, either through higher insurance premiums or by incidental costs that aren’t covered by insurance.", "I’ve already had constituents in my riding say that insurance companies have declined to renew insurance for people’s homes because they felt the homes were vulnerable to flooding; that the sewer lines in their neighbourhood weren’t adequate to protect them. So parts of their coverage would be cancelled. Now, East York is far above sea level. They don’t have to worry about the sea coming in. But they do have to worry about heavy rainstorms and hurricanes dumping volumes of water that our sewer systems, built for the weather of a century ago, are not able to handle.", "In that same Star article, the Insurance Bureau of Canada’s Ontario vice-president, Ralph Palumbo, made a statement about the storm, saying, “While these preliminary estimates are staggering, we do expect them to go even higher.” He’s right; we do see very high costs.", "I have to tell you, there’s more to global warming than just the cost. There’s also a smell. That smell is sewage in your basement. In Ontario, our sewer systems, our waste water systems, are built for a climate that no longer exists. Rainfall patterns are not the ones we had last century. They’re not the ones that engineers based the sewer and water systems on. They’re becoming more and more different. Storms that used to happen once a century now happen twice a decade. That speaks to significant property damage and significant insurance costs. People are going to spend more time shovelling sewage out of their basements and they’re going to be spending more money. Global warming is hard on the nose and it’s hard on the pocketbook.", "Speaker, as much as I believe it was a good idea to phase out coal, and as much as I think that this bill is useful in making sure that it’s very difficult to bring it back, I need to remind everyone in this chamber and I need to remind the government that stopping the coal shutdown is not adequate. I am very worried about our ability to meet our 2020 targets. I haven’t seen the action that would say to me that, in the next five years, we’ve got everything in place to actually meet that target. I’m very worried that the targets that are set for 2030 are ones where governments can say, “Yep, that’s 15 years from now. My career will be over. Someone else will have that headache.”", "If we actually want to meet the 2020 targets, if we want to meet the 2030 targets, for reductions of greenhouse gas emissions, everything that is going to be done has to have its starting positions put in place now. If we’re concerned about climate change, global warming and the impact on our society, on our lives and the lives of our families and the lives of other people’s families, we can’t simply rest with this bill and say, “Everything is taken care of.”", "We can understand those particular risks of extreme weather causing physical difficulty and extreme weather causing expense—expense for energy and expense for repairs—but there’s another level of concern that we need to start thinking about in this chamber and in this province, and that relates to financial stability.", "I want to go back and talk to you about another event of financial instability that we have to recognize and incorporate into our thinking. I’ll just explain a bit of background, Speaker, and then I’ll bring it back to the question of greenhouse gas emissions—oil, gas and coal. That’s the 2008 financial collapse related to subprime mortgages. If you ever have the chance, Speaker, there’s a fabulous book you should read, The Big Short, by a writer called Michael Lewis—a great storyteller, very colourful prose, very solid on the facts. He followed the growth in understanding amongst people dealing with the international financial system who came to understand that at the heart of the financial system, there was this huge chunk of rotten, dangerous assets that people had invested hundreds of billions, possibly trillions, in: subprime mortgages.", "A number of analysts, in those years leading up to 2008, actually went and looked at those assets. They looked at those subprime mortgages in Phoenix, Orange county, San Diego and all over the United States: mortgages that had been given by mortgage companies that took a cut and passed them on to investors. They didn’t care about the quality. It was really irrelevant to them. All they cared about was getting their cut and passing on this toxic brew of subprime assets. Pensions, banks, people who felt they were investing in grade A, creditworthy assets, were totally—what I can say?—oblivious to the risk they were taking. In 2008, all of that came apart. There were staggering losses globally. As you’re well aware, Speaker, governments around the world had to prop up the financial system—around the world. We were lucky; we didn’t get a Great Depression. We did suffer and are still suffering the aftermath of what’s called the great recession, but I’m not sure that we learned our lesson from the 2008 subprime mortgage debacle.", "I want to give you some background, because we’re facing similar investment risks with oil, gas and coal. For those who have not followed the literature on this, I’ll note a report that was provided by the Environmental Commissioner of Ontario a number of months ago. He talked about the need for a planetary carbon diet—call it a carbon budget, if you will. In 2009, the global community, through the United Nations, adopted a ceiling that we would not go past in terms of global warming: two degrees centigrade. I referred to that earlier in my remarks. When you go past that, you start getting very dangerous, very unpredictable climatic events, most likely irreparable.", "There’s an awful lot of concern globally in government circles and in scientific circles that action needs to be taken to stay within that two-degree boundary. Now, as the Environmental Commissioner wrote, we’re already about halfway to that threshold. We’re already seeing the impact of an almost one-degree increase. We’re seeing extreme storms and we’re seeing substantially more erratic weather patterns.", "for future use.", "release, this global budget will be exhausted in about 28 years. We’d have to stop entirely in order to stay within that budget. That is a very short time frame in the life of a society, very short. I’ll give you an example: The Wright brothers flew their first heavier-than-air aircraft in about 1903. Maybe I’m a year off one way or the other, but around then. Thirty years later, 1933, you had airline companies that were providing service across oceans. Twenty-eight years, 30 years is not a long time. There’s a huge disparity between that budget that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change worked out and the amount of greenhouse gas-emitting fossil fuels that are on the books of global oil, coal and gas companies.", "if they were all burned. If the threshold is 1,000 and what people have on their books—what companies have on their books—is 2,900, then about two thirds of the fossil fuel reserves that global companies are depending on to show that they’re financially stable are going to have to stay in the ground. That raises huge questions because as you may well imagine, if an oil company says, “The value of all my reserves has to be cut by two thirds,” then their stock value plummets.", "A few years ago, I think BP revalued their oil reserves and showed they were 10% to 15% lower than they’d previously estimated, and the value of the stock plummeted. That’s because the value of these companies is dependent on the reserves that they have on hand. The reality now is that they may not be able to burn all the reserves that they have, effectively devaluing those companies.", "Within Canada, the Toronto Stock Exchange composite index is one of the most carbon-intensive stock indices in the world. In 2013, the TSX had over 400 companies listed in the oil and gas sector, representing a market capitalization of their total value or worth—here I’m quoting the Environmental Commissioner—of around $400 billion to $500 billion. The Environmental Commissioner stressed in his report that investors, pension plans—and many of us have great interest in pension plans—and insurance companies had to start looking at these areas of investment through a climate lens because they were putting their funds at risk by investing in these companies. Pension plans were putting their funds at risk—future pensions—by putting money in these companies.", "Several authoritative international organizations, including the International Energy Agency, Carbon Tracker, the United Nations, and the HSBC—Hongkong and Shanghai Banking company, a bank you may be familiar with, one that operates in this country and in this town—are warning investors to focus this lens quickly and act accordingly, to avoid another kind of catastrophe: an economic one.", "We saw, in 2008, that investors had sunk hundreds of billions into assets that weren’t worth what the vendors said they were. We’re in a situation now where oil, gas and coal companies are making a bet that the world will never act on climate change. That’s their bet. The companies are based on that bet, financed on that bet, sell bonds on that bet. Their whole value is based on a bet that nothing will be done.", "If they’re right on that bet, it’s disastrous for us. If they’re wrong on that bet, it’s disastrous for their bottom lines, for their financial statements, and for everyone whose investment portfolio, including big pension funds headquartered here in this province—it’s a threat to those companies that have built their foundation on those industries.", "So this is not a minor or tangential issue. This is a huge risk area for us. The Bank of England is now seriously turning to the question of what they call stranded assets—this coal, oil and gas that can’t be burned—and unburnable carbon, given the major role that the London financial markets have in financing fossil fuel investment around the world.", "In October 2014, the British paper the Guardian reported: “The governor of the Bank of England has reiterated his warning that fossil fuel companies cannot burn all of their reserves if the world is to avoid catastrophic climate ... impacts of their decisions.", "“According to reports,” Mark Carney, head of the Bank of England, “told a World Bank seminar on integrated reporting on Friday”—Friday of that October—“that the ‘vast majority of reserves are unburnable’ if global temperature rises are to be limited” to two degrees centigrade.", "The governor of the Bank of England understands the kinds of risks that oil, gas and coal companies pose to the international financial system, just as subprime mortgages posed that risk, that threat, less than a decade ago. A decade ago, a number of people very smartly understood the risk, and they got out of that market. They saved themselves. Some of them made a lot of money by betting against the companies that didn’t understand what was going on. There were a whole bunch of banks and investors—people remember the names Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers—that got hit profoundly, and many countries took a profound hit from those unstable and risky assets.", "We have to understand and protect ourselves against the risk in terms of our physical experience of the world. We have to act to protect ourselves from the climate change that will destabilize our society. But we also have to understand it in terms of controlling our cost of living and cost of energy, and we have to understand it in terms of financial risk.", "At this point, I don’t believe that this government understands those risks, and I’m confident that they’re not preparing for those risks. I look forward to being shown something different.", "This bill, the one before us, as I said at the beginning, is a small firewall against a bad practice. But if we’re actually going to take on the challenges before us, we need continuous, substantial steps towards changing our energy system. We have to move beyond oil, gas and coal.", "The good thing is that the cost of conservation is already far less than the cost of electricity, for example. You can effectively reduce your need for electricity services at a cost of three to six cents a kilowatt hour.", "I did a quick calculation on my electricity bill before the most recent rate increases came into effect. When I factored in the distribution and the regulatory charges and all that, I was paying about 21 cents a kilowatt hour. That’s a lot of money, Speaker—a lot of money.", "At the same time, the market for energy is changing in a profound way. In the United States, renewable energy prices are dropping dramatically. In the United States, the cost of solar power is competitive with or lower than electrical power from the grid in Hawaii, and on track to be competitive in Arizona and California within the next few years.", "In fact, within five years, solar power is projected to be cheaper than grid power in about 20 American states, and banks are noticing. Banks are noticing the potential for disruption—technological disruption, economic disruption—of the existing energy systems.", "Speaker, my bet is that at one point in your life you rented a video from Blockbuster Video. I think it’s probably a pretty good bet that at one point you put down your five bucks. Maybe I’m wrong, but I think there’s a very good chance that many people in this room, in the past, rented a film from Blockbuster Video. My bet is that you can’t find one of them anywhere now because they’re gone. They met Netflix and the game was over.", "Disruptive technologies eliminate whole areas of the economy. We’ve seen them before. In the 1970s and early 1980s, when there was talk about bringing mobile phones to Ontario, I remember reading stories in the Globe and Mail about investors speculating whether or not this mobile phone thing would actually take off—“Is it worth putting the money in or not?” Some eventually got into mobile phones. Some still have very old-style phones in their hands. I remember meeting in the early 1980s with a fellow who was doing construction in a co-op that I was working at. He brought in his mobile phone, and he was sort of tilted over because the battery was about the size of a car battery. It looked kind of like one of those older rotary phones. There was a lot of skepticism at the time that this would catch on, but things moved on. Things moved on, and big telephone and communications companies that didn’t actually adapt to, prepare for or deal with mobile technology took huge losses.", "We have to understand that that is happening in the energy area with regard to renewable energy, with new technologies and micro-grids that are going to change the way people use energy and make energy in North America.", "Earlier in 2014, Barclays bank downgraded the whole electricity sector in the United States. They looked at that sector and said, “Hmm, Blockbuster Video, we’ve seen this movie before. We’re not going to put as much money into this sector as we have before.”", "John Spears, the fabulous energy reporter for the Toronto Star, who I believe is not writing there anymore, wrote a very good article in the Star’s business section. He quoted Barclays, saying, “‘In the 100-plus-year history of the electric utility industry, there has never before been a truly cost-competitive substitute available for grid power.", "“‘We believe that solar plus storage could reconfigure the organization and regulation of the electric power business over the coming decade.’", "“A combination of solar and storage is already competitive with grid power in Hawaii, Barclays said, and the trend will only grow.", "“‘California could follow in 2017, New York and Arizona in 2018, and many other states soon after.’", "“Barclays sees near-term credit risk for utilities where solar power is gaining traction. And it sees long-term risks ‘from a comprehensive reimagining of the role utilities play in providing electric power.’”", "Barclays bank, last year, understood the potential scale of disruption of the electricity industry, understands the potential for solar power and other renewable technologies to make nuclear, coal, oil and gas electricity production uncompetitive.", "Already in Germany, a country where there’s not an awful lot of sunshine, solar power is producing power for houses at a cost of between nine euro cents and 12 euro cents per kilowatt hour. Speaker, that’s a lot cheaper than peak power in Ontario.", "In Abu Dhabi, which is looking at vast investment in solar power to provide electricity and to provide power for desalinization, they’re signing contracts for electricity provided by solar panels at less than six cents a kilowatt hour.", "When Al Gore was speaking here at the Climate Summit of the Americas in July, he talked about a mining company in Arizona that had signed a contract for solar power for electricity at under five cents a kilowatt hour.", "Speaker, the reality of electricity production, the reality of demand for fossil fuels is changing dramatically and has the potential to change even more dramatically. We in Ontario need to take advantage of those shifts.", "It’s a good thing to stop burning coal; it’s a good thing to have a law prohibiting that. I’m happy to vote for this bill. My caucus colleagues are happy to vote for this bill. But I have to say that, just as Franklin Delano Roosevelt had to take far more substantial steps than simply passing one or two small laws to bring the United States back to some sort of economic viability, after four years of the Great Depression, this government or a future government is going to have to be far more active and change things far more profoundly if we’re actually going to keep climate change within—what can I say—survivable bounds, if we’re actually going to protect the air that people breathe in this province in the years to come.", "I appreciate the measures that have been taken. I’m looking for measures far more substantial to continue getting rid of emissions on the same scale as they were reduced with the elimination of coal." ],

  "text" : [ "I’m pleased to have an opportunity for just a couple of minutes to speak to Bill 9, An Act to amend the Environmental Protection Act to require the cessation of coal use. I must admit that I wonder why the government really needs this bill. It’s a one-page bill to make sure, I guess, that they don’t generate electricity with coal. But we’ve seen so many promises to do with coal over the years.", "I’m sure the member from St. Catharines would probably remember the original promise to shut down coal-fired generation. I had to go back and check, because I thought, “I’ve heard this so many times before.” But it was actually 2003—the 2003 election. The promise that was made did seem a little silly at the time, because they promised in the 2003 election that they would shut down coal by 2007 and replace it using clean sources. Now, they would have had to have been pretty darned efficient to actually accomplish that promise. As it turned out, that promise was made many, many more times over time, and some eight years later, after the 2007 election, it was actually achieved.", "I’m not sure this bill is something that’s really required. Governments get elected, and particularly a majority government can basically do what they wish. For example, when the current government got elected, there was the Taxpayer Protection Act that the Mike Harris government had brought in to make sure that future governments balanced budgets. Well, when the current government was elected and didn’t feel like balancing the budget, they just repealed the Taxpayer Protection Act and, as we know, have run up some pretty significant deficits, doubling the debt of the province in the past number of years. So I do question, really, whether this bill is actually necessary.", "When I was looking back in 2003, there were a few other promises too: We’ll not sell off the electricity grid; we’ll not sell any publicly owned generating stations. Things seem to have changed in the recent years.", "Of course, we have the cap-and-trade system that’s being proposed right now. I must admit that I met with an interested citizens group wanting to educate me on different measures to try to reduce carbon use, and they were basically proposing some sort of carbon fee that was fully refundable to the citizens, more or less along the lines of what BC has done in the last number of years. BC has a carbon tax of, I believe, $30 a tonne, but it’s revenue-neutral. It’s given back to people and corporations in the form of tax reductions so it doesn’t harm the economy. I think that’s really critical, and it’s really simple and straightforward. That seems to make a lot more sense to me than the complicated cap-and-trade system that is open to gaming and didn’t work in Europe, which is being proposed by the government.", "I was asking this group that was educating me, “Why do you think they want cap and trade?” I think the suspicion is that the extra revenue that’s going to be generated is just going into the general fund somewhere, and who knows what’s going to happen? Or maybe it’s going to be used to balance the budget. When that happens, it will hurt the economy, because it will be a new tax, it won’t be revenue-neutral and maybe it won’t accomplish anything. So I’m a little concerned about the government implementing that. Especially, they’re again setting a very ambitious target of a timeline. I’ve heard that people are really concerned and industries are really concerned. I’m the mining critic; mining is really concerned that they’re not going to get it right if they try to rush it and don’t take the time to do it properly. So I do have a lot of concerns with that.", "But we are talking about Bill 9 today, the one-page bill. Frankly, I’m not sure that it’s really necessary, so I think I’ll end debate there." ],

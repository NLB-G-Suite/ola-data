I wanted to acknowledge that I did make an error.", "Actually, there is a parallel with this four-page programming motion, because there are some endangered species here at Queen’s Park. One of them is a travelling committee, a committee that actually has province-wide hearings. In the old days, you would have a bill that would travel extensively around the province. You would go to all corners of the province to actually ask citizens what they thought of a particular piece of legislation. But I have to tell you, Speaker, since this Parliament began, that is all but an endangered species in this area.", "What is also an endangered species is the words that this government said in its throne speech, the fact that they would put partnership above partisanship. Over and over and over we’ve seen motions similar to this; we’ve had a plentiful crop of closure motions—time allocation motions.", "So there are endangered species in this Legislature: the rights of individual MPPs to represent their ridings, to be able to have meaningful input at the committee process and to be able to have meaningful input to provide amendments to bills that actually reflect what our constituents and the province of Ontario want in legislation. It’s all but extinct, to use a phrase from the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change when he talks about the planet and extinction. Our rights as members are increasingly being diminished by this government. Again, this four-page substantive motion that programs bills is the icing on the cake of this government saying one thing and doing something completely different.", "As opposition House leaders, we sit at meetings every Thursday at lunchtime—myself and the third party opposition House leader—and we talk about trying to co-operate. We talk about bills that the government would like to move forward. There are some bills in this substantive motion that we’ve agreed could have a few days of hearings and move forward. But there are some bills that we require, because of the constituents we represent, that they have a far more substantive opportunity to go around the province and get input from people in all corners of Ontario.", "Yesterday, I talked about the leader of my party, Patrick Brown, and the fact that, right after he was elected leader, he decided that the north was a priority and decided to go up with the member from Nipissing to look at the Ring of Fire.

There are miles and miles of speeches that the member has made about his concern about time allocation. But there are many other members—many distinguished members of the Wynne government—who have said the same thing. The Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing, Mr. McMeekin, said on December 9, 2002: “We use closure so often around this place, one would almost be led to the belief that everyone has sort of sanitized views on everything”—“sanitized views on everything.” That’s what this government has now adopted after that member expressed those concerns back in 2002." ],

I stood up and made a point of privilege; I hope that the Speaker will rule on it soon.", "There are other members of this government that I want to get on the record. The Minister of Northern Development and Mines, Mr. Gravelle, said on November 19, 2001: “It’s just stunning that the way they choose to deal with it at the end of the day is to put time allocation on debate. It’s wrong, I think everybody knows it’s wrong and I think even the government members themselves know that it’s the wrong way to approach it.

But again, what happens is that after the negotiations are done, after the meeting is over, the government walks over to the table and they file their motions; they file their time allocation motion.", "In this motion, they deal with this bill and put it forward.

So it’s a time allocation motion that’s leading to a time allocation motion that’s going to pass a time allocation motion. I believe you don’t see that very often. They’ve put it under the guise of a programming motion, and I just want to speak to that, first of all.", "A programming motion is when the parties agree. The three parties get together and they agree on whatever a program is, as far as being able to pass legislation through the House. We have done that here before—not a lot, but it has happened at times. It’s an agreement amongst the three parties that you sign off on. Normally, it’s done by unanimous consent, so you don’t have to have a substantive motion. It is a substantive motion that is passed with unanimous consent, so that you don’t have to have a full debate on the substantive motion.", "In this particular case, the government is calling it a substantive motion, but this is not a substantive motion, because I, as the New Democratic House leader for our team and for our leader, Andrea Horwath, have not agreed to this. I know that Mr. Clark, the House leader for the Conservative Party, has not agreed to this either. So you can’t call this a substantive motion, because in fact, the two opposition parties have not agreed.", "So this, by any other name, is a time allocation motion. It’s an omnibus time allocation motion, to be specific. Let’s put that out there, right at the beginning.", "What’s interesting is that what’s contained in this substantive motion are bills that you don’t even have to time-allocate. This is really, really silly. For example, last night, here in the House, we had a bill before us which had had two or three hours of debate in regard to third reading for the immigration act.

The parties supported that, and there was some minimal debate. I think there were about six or seven hours of debate at second reading, and there were probably about six or seven hours at third reading. But that’s because a number of members happen to represent rural constituencies and—surprise—guess what? People wanted to be on the record, having to do with an issue that is related to their riding. That’s what this place is all about.", "The government seems to think that we’re somehow being dilatory. People watching back home, if you wonder what “dilatory” means, it’s that we’re being silly buggers trying to muck things up by debating bills that we want to be on the record on—not the case.", "It is normal for a bill at second reading to get anywhere from two hours to eight hours of debate. If you go back and look at all of the Hansards dating back to when I got here in 1990, there are some bills that have had far more debate than that. But on average, I would say between two and eight hours. On second reading, normally that’s what gets done.", "If the government is wise—and this government at times has chosen to do this and I give them some credit for that—you allow bills to go through the House in their natural progression. That allows for members of the assembly on all sides to put on the record the issues they’re interested in, representing their constituency and putting their thoughts, thinking about what it is that has to happen once the bill gets to committee, and just let the bill go through its natural process by which it’s going to get into committee. That’s normally what happens.", "In this particular case, we have a substantive omnibus motion that’s going to time-allocate four bills.", "Bill 9 is the act in regard to the cessation of the use of coal. That’s a bill we all agreed to, which passed second reading. I believe it went naturally; I don’t think it was time-allocated. Maybe the Clerks can clarify that for me. We ended up going through committee and now we’re here. The bill is at six hours and 32 minutes of debate time.", "Guess what’s going to happen, guys? You don’t need to time-allocate this thing. Actually, we’re at second on this one. It’s six hours and 32 minutes. Let me rephrase that: We’re at Bill 9, cessation of coal; we’re at second reading, we’re at six hours and 32 minutes.", "The three parties agree and I would imagine we’re probably almost done debate on that particular bill. If the government was to call that bill on one of those long midnight sittings, my guess is you’d probably get it.", "Let’s look at the other one: Bill 37, invasive species. I’ve given my lead. We’re at second reading; we’re at six hours and 50 minutes. I don’t think there’s a lot more debate to be done on that one. I think we’re going to be pretty well done. I’m not sure how many more members of the House want to speak to it but I can’t imagine there are all that many.", "Then Bill 52, which is the anti-SLAPP legislation. We’re again at second reading; we have six hours and 50 minutes. Again, I don’t think there’s all that much more debate left in this one. The government is putting this in an omnibus bill in order to move it out of second reading and into committee.", "And Bill 66, which is the Great Lakes Protection Act, which is at almost four hours of debate.", "My point is, when you look at these four bills, they’re on the cusp of going into committee without even having the time allocated. Here’s the other thing: If the government decided to time-allocate all four bills, you would probably get those four bills faster just by calling the time allocation motion because the time allocation motion is two hours. Four bills times two hours is eight, so it’s eight hours of debate.", "Guess what’s going to happen with this substantive motion? I’ll tell you now, we will talk this out because there are a number of amendments we want to be able to make. We believe that the way this thing was written was in such a way that leaves a little bit to be desired when it comes to hearings. You’ll be hearing from us a little bit later on that. You’re going to have six and a half hours of debate minimum on this substantive motion, plus a two-hour debate at time allocation for eight and a half hours. So you’re actually slower using a substantive motion to move these bills through the House than you would be—thank you Monsieur Clerk—if you just did it naturally.", "I don’t even think that most of these bills would be time-allocated.

We’ve gotten agreements to pass bills without even having to do time allocation to put bills into committee.", "There are 25 bills that have gone through processes of second and third reading—at least second reading, and some at third. From the count, about half of those 25 bills have been time-allocated. In other words, the other half have gone the natural process.", "I’m just saying to the government across the way that I’m a little bit perplexed as to why you’ve brought this particular motion forward. What you end up doing is doing an omnibus bill to time-allocate a bunch of bills that normally would be accepted by the assembly by the natural process of debate and the natural process through the committee.", "For example, on the issue of cessation of coal: Please, is anybody opposed to the cessation of coal? Stand up; I’d like to know who you are. Each political party has had in their platform that we would phase out coal for over 15 years now. I know that we as New Democrats did. The Conservatives did for sure, and I know the Liberals did. We all agree that the use of coal is something that had to stop. We didn’t stop it in the timelines we all wanted to, as far as what the government finally ended up doing, but we’ve actually reached the goal we had all set ourselves in our electoral platforms. So why is the government time-allocating a bill that, quite frankly, everybody in this House agrees on, that already has six hours and 32 minutes and probably is going to pass not too much further beyond at 6:32?", "If you look at the Invasive Species Act, again, it’s the same story. We’re at six hours and 50 minutes on invasive species. I spoke to this bill. I thought I was clear. Maybe the government didn’t understand what I was saying during my lead, and maybe they didn’t understand what our members were saying, but we support the bill. We never said we’re going to hold up the bill. We never said that we’re not going to allow the bill to go forward. We agree that something needs to be done in regard to invasive species. It’s a problem in this province, and we need to be able to deal with it. Nobody has indicated from the Conservative caucus, like New Democrats, that they want to hold this up. We’re fine.", "But you know what members are doing? Members are putting their views and their constituents’ views on the record. That’s what this Legislature is about. I think part of the problem we get into is because we now have this tool called “time allocation” in our standing orders, the government, more and more, moves away from what the intent of the Legislature is supposing to be all about; that is, to be able to voice our concerns or to voice our support on particular bills and to suggest what we think is lacking in the bill so that when it gets to committee, those items can be looked at but, more importantly, to give the public the ability to have their say when it comes to what the bill looks like and what it should be doing by way of amendment for it to go back to third reading.", "So it’s penalizing members in the public to do what it is that we’re supposed to do within our rights as members and the rights of the public to be able to come and present to committee. Why are you penalizing the public? What has the public ever done to you that you need to time-allocate a bill that naturally is going to pass anyway, and all that the public wants is their ability to have their say?", "For example, the government is moving on the privatization of Hydro through the budget bill. What have you got against the public that you don’t want to allow them to have their say on Hydro privatization? Are you afraid they may say something that you’re going to take offence to? If somebody does, well, welcome to politics, and welcome to government. The minute you get elected, 50% of the people are going to be opposed—maybe not opposed, but may not be onside with whatever you’re trying to do. That’s just the nature of things.", "What governments try to do and what members try to do individually is to do the best we can to represent the needs of our constituents and the needs of the province. But this government is saying, “No, no. Let’s not do public hearings on the road over the privatization of Hydro. We know best as a government because Kathleen Wynne, the Premier of Ontario, is real smart, and she knows what’s best for everybody. We don’t need to listen the public. Oh, God, no, because the public may have something to say, and we don’t need to take that into consequence.”", "We’re not giving the public their due, and the due of the public in all of these bills that are contained within this particular omnibus bill, the substantive motion—the public should have an ability to have its say.", "When I first got here in 1990, we didn’t have time allocation. Here’s what used to happen: Let’s say there were 20 bills on the order paper. The parties would get together—because an opposition party or an individual member could hold up a bill as long as they wanted. I hearken back to the days of Peter Kormos." ],

I can tell you that Bob Rae wasn’t, because I heard the story. Bob was trying to shut him down, which is a whole other story. But Mr. Kormos had the right to try to slow that bill down to make the point that he was trying to make. That’s what a Legislature is all about. But do you know what? Even though the government of the day did not have time allocation—and the member from St. Catharines was here at the time—there was a process entirely within our caucus by which our leader, the future Premier of Ontario, Mr. Rae, dealt with Mr. Kormos and got some kind of an agreement in regard to hearings that travelled, that went on the road, where Mr. Kormos was able to get constituents to come and speak to the bill.", "Who got the short end of that deal? Certainly not the public; the public actually got their say. And that’s what this Legislature should be all about. It shouldn’t be about a private club called the Liberal club of Ontario or the Conservative club of Ontario or the NDP club of Ontario when it comes to whoever sits on the other side of the House and they only do what it is that they want. This is about the people. This is the people’s chamber. This is where legislators gather in order to be able to debate issues, try to represent our constituencies and, more importantly, give the public the opportunity to come to committee to be able to speak to bills.", "When I got here in the 1990s, when there was no time allocation, there were some bills that travelled for two and three weeks in the intersessions, either winter or summer. Do you know what? It allowed members to go out across Ontario to get to know this province a little bit better, to get to know each other a little bit better as members and to get to know the issue a lot more. We got members who got to be quite expert on particular subject matters as a result of the work they were doing on committee.", "Here is the beautiful part about it: The public got a chance to have its say. So you would go to Kenora; you would go to Sioux Lookout; you’d go to Cornwall and Ottawa and London and other places around Ontario, and the public would gather at these hearings. They would come because they knew that the Legislature was listening. And guess what we did when we listened, Mr. Speaker? We used to amend the legislation, because we used to say, “You know what? The public came forward. We’ve had four or five presentations where they pointed out that this particular clause in the bill doesn’t make a lot of sense for the following reasons,” and we would amend.", "I’ll give you a good example. Michael Harris—do you remember him? He was Premier of Ontario for some time here. I was an opponent of Mr. Harris. I thought most of what he did—I was completely on the opposite side of it. But we had a bill in order to allow snowmobile clubs to charge a licence to ride on trails, and it became mandatory. It was a bill that most members of the House accepted; I certainly supported it, and I know that the Liberals at the time—Mr. Bartolucci was on committee with me; he accepted it. But we went out and we travelled the bill.", "I remember that we ended up in some community somewhere in northern Ontario; I forget where it was. Somebody came forward and pointed out something in the bill that didn’t work. There was a section of the bill, the way it was written, that would completely stymie the ability for snowmobile clubs to get agreements to do their trails on crown land—when they had to go across a hydro right-of-way or whatever they were trying to go through. And this person came before the committee and said, “I’ve been reading this—and I’m not an expert; I’m just a lawyer and I love my snowmobile. When I read this, as a member of the snowmobile club of” whatever town, “this section does completely the opposite of what it is that you’re trying to do.”", "I remember that the government person who was taking lead on the bill—I forget who it was—said, “No, no, no. You’re wrong. We’ve done this,” and he challenged the person in the presentation. But then, even the Conservative members started going, “Hang on. We’ve got a problem here.”", "Guess what we did? We amended the bill. The service that that individual brought to this Legislature by coming before the committee to point out that there was an error with the bill, which we then amended and fixed—he did us a service, not a disservice, because we now have legislation that works. That’s what this place should be all about.", "What the government does when they do omnibus time-allocation motions or individual time-allocation motions and don’t allow bills to go through the natural process—you’re shutting the public out, let alone my right as a member to speak; you’re shutting the public out. People have views. People want to know that when they have a view, they can express it, and if it’s on a bill, that they can come to committee and say what they have to say.", "Like I said, when I got here in 1990 and there was no time allocation, if there were 20 or 25 bills on the order paper, there were probably only about four to five bills that got a lot of hearings—a week or two or three weeks of travel in the province. Most other bills went through the House fairly quickly, but the rule was always that you would allow the bill to go to committee, in order to give the public an opportunity to have its say. Why? Because the bills that were like the ending coal bill and the invasive species bill and others were bills that everybody agreed on. They tended to go through a lot more quickly.", "On other bills that were more controversial and more substantive, yes, there would probably be 10, 12 or 14 hours of debate, because they were more substantive and they demanded more time. But that was an agreement that was done with the House leaders. You would say, “Okay, we’re fine on invasive species. We’re only going to put up two speakers”—one party would say. The other party would say, “I’ll put up two or three, and that’s all we’ll do, but we’re going to put up more people on this other bill.” That’s the way this place worked.", "The government, by doing this omnibus bill—by which they’re bringing forward four bills in one in this omnibus time-allocation motion—I believe are not helping themselves, because it’s going to take them longer to pass it this way than it would to do it naturally.", "If these were controversial bills, like the budget, like privatizing hydro—serious bills that the opposition has opposition to, like the Tories, for that fact, on the Ontario pension plan bill—then I would understand why they’re trying to time-allocate. I still wouldn’t agree, but I’d understand: because there would be substantive resistance in the House to having that bill go through. But these four bills are hardly bills that the opposition has a problem with. Bill 66, Great Lakes Protection Act, is at second reading with almost four hours of debate. Bill 83, the anti-SLAPP bill; Bill 37, the Invasive Species Act; Bill 9, ending the use of coal: They’re all bills that the opposition in both parties support. So why are we time-allocating stuff when, quite frankly, there’s an agreement in the House?", "It tells me there are a couple of things going on. One is that the government doesn’t want to listen to the public in a meaningful way. Yes, there are going to be some hearings in this time allocation motion. I see we’re going to allow witnesses to come forward for a day here or two days there, depending on what the bill is, but we’re not going to travel any of these bills. For example, on the use of coal—it would be kind of interesting to go up to Thunder Bay–Atikokan. We shut down a coal plant there; maybe the people of Thunder Bay–Atikokan would like to have their say. Guess what? The people of Sarnia–Lambton want to have a say as well about what this has meant to their communities. So why are we not at least travelling the bills to the communities that are affected? “No, we’re only going to do it here in Toronto.”", "With regard to the Invasive Species Act, there’s hardly a community in Ontario that is not affected. Now, I’m not arguing we should have to travel the Invasive Species Act for weeks and weeks to a hundred communities, but there are a number of people across Ontario who want to speak to it, and what I’m saying is that this motion is going to limit the ability for the public to have their say. The only place they’re going to be able to come to do that is the mother ship called Toronto.", "I just want to point out to members of the assembly that I love Toronto. I think Toronto is a great city. It has been voted the number one city in the world, and I’m quite proud of that as an Ontarian. But you know what? There’s Timmins, there’s Welland, there’s Ottawa. There are all kinds of communities around Ontario that are just as important—" ],

You’re actually not respecting the public. You’re actually not respecting the various regions of this province, to have their say. I think that is disrespect, and I think, eventually, that’s the type of thing that’s going to come up to bite the government. They say it’s not opposition parties that defeat governments; it’s governments that defeat themselves. I think the government, by doing what they’re doing, is actually writing their own demise, because at some point the public says, “You know what? They’re not listening to me. If somebody is prepared to listen to me, maybe I’ll vote for them.”", "It’s a little bit like what happened with the NDP in Alberta, with Rachel Notley and Mr. Prentice. What happened in Alberta wasn’t just a question of how the NDP ran a great campaign—which they did; it was a question of how Mr. Prentice defeated himself. Mr. Prentice made a number of errors going into that election, where the public said, “You know what? We’ve had these guys for 44 years, and these guys just don’t get it. So whoever out there who is prepared to speak to how I feel and counter what Mr. Prentice and the Tories are doing, I’m prepared to vote for it.” And Rachel Notley ran a very strong campaign. She’s an amazing leader in the sense that she’s very charismatic, very dynamic, and in the end she basically won a majority government in Alberta, a place that you would never have thought the NDP would actually form the government, let alone get a dozen seats.", "What I’m saying is that the government here, by doing what you’re doing with these time allocation motions, is doing the same kinds of stuff that quite frankly defeats governments. I will argue that there’s probably a darned good chance that Mr. Harper is going to lose the next election federally, and I think there’s a good chance he’s going to lose it to Thomas Mulcair. Why? Because that government is forgetting what they’re there for. At the end of the day, it’s about the public. The problem with governments, after they’re there for a long time—of all stripes; I’m not going to sit here holier than thou and say that doesn’t happen to the NDP as well—is that they tend to forget what they’re there for. They become an institution unto themselves, and they say, “Oh my God, I’ve got to get my legislative agenda through.” It doesn’t matter who stands in the way. The public—who are they? And they do time allocation in the way that they’re doing now. So I just say to my colleagues across the way that it is not the way to do things.", "On the Great Lakes Protection Act, Bill 66, I know there are people who want to speak to that in and around places like southern Ontario, along Lake Ontario, the various Great Lakes, Niagara Falls—" ],

It’s actually going to take you longer to time-allocate this stuff than if you just let it go naturally. Even if you wanted to time-allocate the bills individually, it still would be faster just to time-allocate individually. I don’t understand the House management strategy in the government House leader’s office, because if I was the government House leader, first of all, I think and I hope I wouldn’t use time allocation. I hope, but who knows? Anything is possible in this place. That’s the one thing that I’ve learned. But I would hope I wouldn’t. But if I did have to use time allocation, I’d be looking at these bills and I’d be saying, “Listen, I can probably make a deal on all four of these bills somehow to allow them to go forward in exchange for something with the opposition,” like more hearings on some of these bills or other bills; or, in the case of New Democrats, severing out the Hydro portion of the budget bill and allowing the Hydro portion to travel out in committee. If the government wants to do that, I’ll pass all of these bills today. I’ll put it on the record here today: If the government is prepared to travel out the Hydro portion of this bill, we’ll agree to the terms of these time allocation motions for travel without any difficulty.", "But again, will the government do that? No, because I believe the government is locked into this process where they think they know better than the public, and I think, Mr. Speaker, that’s just not the way to do things.", "I’m watching the clock.

If he’s watching today, I just wanted to say, Preet, thank you very much for all your insight into this very important topic.", "Financial literacy is defined as the ability to use knowledge and skills to manage financial resources effectively for a lifetime of financial well-being. Personal financial literacy is more than balancing a chequebook, comparing prices or getting a job. It includes skills like long-term vision, planning for the future, and the discipline to use these skills daily.", "Mathematics is an integral part of every curriculum. How to use mathematics for planning a budget or managing money, however, is not often part of the curriculum.", "Financial literacy is critical to the prosperity and well-being of all Canadians. It is more than a nice skill to have. It is a necessity in today’s world—and, moving forward, should be treated as such by policy-makers, educators, employers and other stakeholders.", "The need for this has arisen because young people are now bombarded with information through the Internet. There are no checks and balances or criteria on posting information. People, especially youth, take this information at face value which, in some instances, turns out to be incorrect.", "Research has shown that stress affects a large number of Canadians and in most cases it is a direct or an indirect result of financial matters", "Australia, Singapore, Britain and the United States have already instituted programs that allow people the opportunity to learn about financial literacy. The curriculum should focus on the following main modules or areas:", "Module number 1: Making sense of your money. This module would impart a basic understanding of the financial world as it relates to you. It aims to enable you to set smart financial goals and work out how much you need for your goals. You will also be able to develop a budget by tracking your spending, how to cut down on expenses and how to save on a regular basis by using the spending plan. You will also understand how the effects of compounding interest can impact your savings.", "Mr. Speaker, most of us have a credit card, and this credit card usually has an interest rate anywhere from 15% to 20%. But in actuality, when we take into consideration the compounding effect, that turns out close to 50%, something that most people do not know.", "Module number 2: Fraud, unfortunately, is on the increase, where almost every Canadian has been approached to buy or participate in programs that provide vast financial benefit. Last year, Canadians lost $74 million to fraudsters, and in 2013 this figure was approximately $60 million. Governments at all levels have their hands full investigating fraudulent sources. Our goal should be to educate individuals so they can separate the wheat from the chaff. An additional in educating our youth about fraud prevention is that youth can help inform our seniors, in some simple terms, or maybe in their own language, about fraud prevention, especially through the Internet.", "Module number 3: Credit education. This module aims to enable you to find out if you’re borrowing too much, types of loans and associated costs. You will be able to understand the consequences of over-leveraging and the implications of bankruptcy, learn how to avoid borrowing too much, and how to resolve debt issues.", "A few decades ago, credit was only used to buy a home or car. Nowadays, credit is on the fingertips of people, and those who are unable to manage it end up with financial and psychological problems. Mr. Speaker, I feel this is probably one of the most important aspects of this motion, or one of the most important things that a person should be concerned about when considering their finances.", "I had a story in my constituency office where one of my constituents co-signed a loan on behalf of somebody. This somebody made late payments or didn’t make some payments, which ended up costing this constituent dearly in terms of getting financing on a home. After having received financing, he realized he wouldn’t be able to get a competitive rate.", "This is also more important for newcomers to Ontario, because oftentimes these folks have no idea what a credit score is, mainly because in the place where they come from there’s no such thing. So it’s really important. Oftentimes, unknowingly, some of our newcomers fall into some very serious situations as to not knowing that their credit score is being affected by some of their activities.", "Module number 4: Financial planning, and it begins now. This module aims to help you understand the process of financial planning. You will learn how to assess your financial situation and discover your financial fitness through the use of financial statements and ratios. You will have an overview of the financial plans; namely, saving, insurance and investment, and how they can help you achieve your financial goals.", "Mr. Speaker, insurance literacy, I believe, is lacking in most people, with insurance plans from all aspects, from disability insurance to life insurance. They can be very, very complicated to understand. We can always remember the saying, “Always read the fine print,” but unfortunately, the fine print doesn’t make sense to most people. So it’s important to deal with an adviser who can put this fine print into some understandable terms so you know exactly what you’re getting.", "I had my house broken into and lost some valuables, and I didn’t know that I had to get extra insurance to cover some of the items I had lost. The coverage was limited. Again, I did not check into the fine print. It makes it increasingly more of a topic that we should teach our youth.", "Module number 5: Money management for youth. Youth need to be educated as early as in high school about the need and impact of loans—student loans, mortgages, credit card debt—timing the buying of a house and evaluating a job prospect. Again, job prospects may not be such a big thing for people to analyze, but when you get a job, there’s a salary involved, there are benefits involved and there’s travel relocation. It can all be very tough, and it’s very important to have the tools to assess the different types of options that are available to you, because at the end of the day the amount of money you could lose or gain could be substantial.", "Module number 6 and other modules: Building a nest egg—very important. We should have the tools available to us to calculate whether an RSP, a TFSA, paying down the mortgage or a combination of those is the right step to take in terms of realizing your goals.", "Introduction to personal financing: understanding risks, financial markets, stocks, bonds, debentures, options and warrants.", "Insurance: Again, it’s very important to learn about the policy you’re getting and the potential benefits you will receive or will not receive.", "The government of Canada convened a task force to study how to impart financial literacy. The task force recommended a special focus on how to impart financial literacy. Their main recommendations are summarized as follows:", "—appointment of a financial literacy leader;", "—integrate financial literacy into the formal education system, including high school, post-secondary and formalized adult learning activities;", "—financial literacy to be included as an essential link in its Essential Skills framework;", "—integrate a financial literacy component into the Canada Student Loans Program for students receiving funding;", "—financial literacy training programs for young Canadians eligible for funding through the Youth Employment Strategy;", "—provide financial information and education services for recent newcomers to Canada through its orientation services. There’s no mention of anything about financial literacy in the packages that newcomers receive once they arrive in Canada.", "—work with employers to incorporate financial literacy training into their current workplace training programs and communications. Often employers have different ways of giving their employees benefits, and a person should have an understanding of how to maximize the profit they get from what they’re receiving.", "—promote financial literacy through programs that reach Canadians directly, with a special focus on young Canadians;", "—help Canadians maximize the financial benefit of government funding. For example, as a person with young children, I was fortunate enough that one of the first things I did when my kids were born was to buy an RESP. Even with a small amount of interest and the idea of forced saving, I cannot tell you how useful it has been for me to know that I’m put putting away a little bit every month that will help me greatly when and if my kids do decide to go to a post-secondary education institution.", "Today’s financial challenges are a testimony to a growing need for specific education, as more and more families and individuals become victims of their financial illiteracy. Such challenges are among the major causes of bankruptcies, foreclosures, divorces, homelessness and even murder-suicide.", "While monetary issues seem to be the main source of such hardships, the root cause can be tracked back to lack of character development in individuals. In response to this need, Mind Treasures has developed a unique curriculum, ABCs of Wealth, which combines character development with financial literacy in order to raise an entrephilanthropic generation that is mentored to become financially stable and independent, so it can use various forms of wealth, knowledge and expertise to build and establish stronger families, neighbourhoods and a new world.", "Mr. Speaker, thank you for the time you have given me to present my motion on this important topic." ],

Every day, we can look to the pages here in this House and be reminded that we do have a duty to ensure the success of the next generation and those who will lead it. Therefore, we do our best to make sure Ontario’s curriculum equips these young people with the skills and knowledge that they will need to succeed when they get older. The success of our children will ultimately drive the success of our province and our country. Aligning our education system in a way that provides students with the skills most in demand in the 21st century helps them succeed in our competitive global market, but also ensures the strength and competitiveness of our economy.", "We focus on math, although our scores aren’t that great these days, and sciences, and they’re not that great either. We can improve those, but they are focused on so that we can hopefully have skilled trades programs in our high schools and post-secondary schools. Well, we can do better at that also. While focusing on those subjects, it’s important—it sometimes overshadows the need for a comprehensive financial literacy curriculum.", "When a student enters the public education system, there’s no telling what they will become. A varied course load allows them to find out what they’re passionate about, hopefully, and continue that pursuit as an adult. You can go to a student who might want to be a computer science programmer and another one who wants to work with their hands and maybe become an electrician, or decides that they want to take on the agriculture sector—in the field of agri-business—or become a farmer, we hope.", "We can be sure that in any of these professions that these students go into, in their different career paths they all have to manage day-to-day finances. Basic things such as not spending more money in a week than you make or saving money for a rainy day are learned concepts. As we know from looking at the past Liberal budgets for 12 years, if you don’t learn these concepts at an early age, bad habits of spending outside your means can carry over into adulthood.", "Statistics Canada has put out a basic financial literacy test. It is actually a survey to determine the level of financial literacy and money management skills of Canadians. Guess what? The results have not been pretty. Canadian adults, on average, score 67% on this test. It should therefore surprise no one that roughly 20% of Canadians face serious difficulties in four out of five dimensions of financial capability.", "When I talk about financial capability, I’m talking about the framework that StatsCan used to assess people’s ability to manage their finances. The five dimensions of the framework are making ends meet, keeping track of finances, planning ahead, choosing financial products, and staying informed. I emphasize again that these concepts are learned concepts; nobody is born with the above knowledge. It should be clear by now that, for a skill that everyone needs, financial literacy and money management capability among Canadians is inadequate.", "I certainly want to commend the member from Brampton West for bringing this issue to the forefront. We all understand the value and importance of financial literacy for every citizen. Therefore, I believe, Ontario should have a comprehensive financial literacy curriculum. I know that Primerica was in this week, and they left pamphlets for parents to help guide their children on how money works.", "The most reliable way to help our children is through acquiring knowledge through the school system. So, for that reason, I’m happy to support this motion today." ],

This is a topic that I could probably take much longer than 12 minutes on.", "I’m going to start my time speaking about a wonderful thing that happened today. I’m about to embarrass my daughter, probably. I got a text message during question period—don’t worry, my phone wasn’t on. She was very excited to announce that she just got her first job, and she starts next week. During that conversation, I said to Morgan—or, after question period, I called my daughter, Morgan, and congratulated her. I said, “Tomorrow night, when I’m home, we’ll go out for a special dinner,” and that I had put money on her bank card so she could go buy some clothes for her new job. Then I followed that by, “In two weeks, when you have your first cheque, you can take us out for dinner,” and her reply was, “No, Mom. I need to save my money.” So she kind of gets it—she doesn’t really understand that I might need to save my money too—but she does kind of get it.", "I think this is a very important motion. I think the topic is very important. Kids today often don’t understand what it means to get a job, how difficult that can be, and then once you get it, how to plan for your future. They have to understand that sometimes expenses pop up that they’re not thinking about, so they need to set money aside for that. They need to understand that, although they think they’re never going to get old, someday down the road, that will happen. It happens to the best of us. They need to put money aside for that as well. And they need to understand that they need to put money aside for the things that they need, for bills and for being able to go out and buy the clothes they want to wear. There is a lot involved when it comes to financial literacy.", "It’s a very complex subject that many adults struggle with. In fact, there are many in communities across the province, mine especially, who struggle to make ends meet to begin with, so it’s even more important that they know how to stretch every penny, how to make it go as far as it possibly can.", "I’m looking at the member’s motion and noting that the government has a majority; the minister could have easily brought this forward as a government bill. I acknowledge the effort from the member from Brampton West for bringing this to light now.", "There was a report that came out in 2010; the Ministry of Education received it. It was from the Working Group on Financial Literacy. It was entitled A Sound Investment: Financial Literacy Education in Ontario Schools. I won’t have time to speak to all the points, but there were some very key points that are definitely worth mentioning. They mention the importance of financial literacy education and supporting success for all students. I think I spoke to that when I mentioned that down the road, they have to know how to allot their money for the things they want now, the things they’re going to want later, the things they need now and the things they’re going to need later. They need to understand how to prioritize. Is it a want or is it a need?", "They note the potential for financial literacy education to address social inequities. That’s another very important topic, especially in my riding. It’s a very diverse riding: I have some very affluent neighbourhoods, we have a lot of middle class, and then we have an area where it’s all low-income and people struggling to make ends meet. So I think it’s important that students understand that the financial situation for their family may not be the same for every family. They need to understand that there are differences.", "A very important one is the need to support teachers in the classroom. We need to make sure that the teachers have what they need in order to provide good programming to the students to help the students be able to make good decisions in the future.", "The importance of engaging and consulting with teachers, students, parents, families and other key stakeholders: I can’t say enough how important I think that everybody involved—the students in the classroom, the teachers in the classroom, the parents and the families of these students—they all need to be engaged in these conversations. The saying is, “It takes a village.” That couldn’t be more true, especially when it comes to financial literacy.", "They note the need to optimize technology in support of financial literacy education. Often we find in our education system that there are the haves and the have-nots. There are schools that have laptops, enough laptops for every student. There are schools that have iPads for every student. Then you’ll find schools in other areas that don’t have a single computer for the kids. They don’t have laptop carts; they don’t have iPads for their students. There’s a real inequity there. We need to make sure that every student in every school in every classroom has the same resources and that the teachers have access to those.", "Another point was “Introduce and integrate financial literacy education into the Ontario curriculum as early as possible, in a relevant and age-appropriate way.” That’s important as well. We need to know what students we are going to reach in the best way and at what age. We need to know what to teach and when. It needs to be supported right through their career in our public education system.", "“Continue to embed in the curriculum the core content and competencies required for financial literacy.” I would say that goes back to literacy and numeracy. We need to make sure that the students are getting the supports in the classroom on the core subjects in order for them to fully understand what we’re talking about when we’re trying to teach them financial literacy. If they can’t read, and they don’t understand basic math, it’s going to be very difficult for them to understand when we’re talking about financial planning.", "“Encourage teachers and educators to foster responsible, engaged, and compassionate citizenship as part of student learning in financial literacy education.” I think it’s safe to say that every day, our teachers do the very best they can to make sure that students receive the best education they can, that they have individualized learning, and that they reach every student and teach them to be responsible and respectful citizens.", "I know that the member from Parkdale–High Park is going to want to speak to this too, so I’m going to wrap it up for now.

I for one worked from the day I was 15, but the credit card still was like this golden opportunity to go spend money that I didn’t have. That’s why financial literacy is so important: From a young age, you set the stage; you’re setting an attitude, a type of life, where people will be more responsible with their money.", "A recent opinion research survey found that only one third of Canadian youth ages 10 to 17 years say that their parents regularly talk to them about money and finances." ],

  "text" : [ "That’s right.", "The research, conducted by Ipsos Reid on behalf of ABC Life Literacy Canada and sponsored by TD Bank Group, found that money is one of the least-discussed issues between parents and kids.", "It’s concerning that parents appear reluctant to talk to their children about money and finances. Perhaps it’s because they believe their kids aren’t interested in money or they’re only interested in getting their parents’ money, not how they spend it.", "This is a subject that is hard to understand. Since learning about essential life skills usually starts at home, parents should be open to having these conversations, and schools should offer to open that conversation up for the parents to make it easier for them to start those conversations and build on that skill of responsibility.", "It is a certain responsibility, if you start giving your kids an allowance at a young age and tell them how to manage that allowance and what it will do if they’re able to save it. How much further will you go if you start a retirement fund at 19, as opposed to 40?", "The first step in improving financial literacy is to take the fear out of finance. Parents need to speak with their children about money management to help teach and guide them, and to help increase every family member’s financial literacy levels.", "More than 30% of youth surveyed wish their parents would talk to them more about their family’s finances.", "That’s an important point, because a lot of kids will not understand—like the member said previously, you have families with different financial needs and financial restrictions and not everybody can have everything, so it causes quite an unfair balance. If we show our kids how to be responsible with their money, it makes it a more balanced playing field for everybody—because people don’t feel privileged, whereas other people may not be as privileged, so the kids will better understand an environment that they’re growing up in.", "Financial literacy can provide a step-by-step process to complete financial wellness. The first thing that we have to do is to commit to change by talking about finances, by letting children know how important it is to talk about our finances, what credit ratings are and how credit ratings work and why it’s important to have a good credit rating, so that they can build a secure future for themselves, so they can make wise investments and continue to grow those investments. Without a credit rating, they won’t be able to do any of that. When kids don’t understand what a credit rating is, why they’re saving their money, why they have to build their credit rating, it’s a recipe for disaster, so it’s very important that we start teaching them at a young age.", "The other main objective is to be able to assess your financial situation and to know what kind of financial situation you’re in so that you can better manage that financial situation—so that children will learn to live within their means and not above their means. You don’t want them to be in constant debt and living to pay off that debt.", "The third point would be to make your money count; make the most of every dollar. When I was 15 years old, when I started working and I wanted that $100 pair of jeans, I know my parents always said, “You can have them, but you’re going to put up half the money.” It always made me not want them quite so much. That’s a way of teaching them how much their money means and what the value of money is.", "Another good way to manage your money is to document where you spend it. I checked myself how much money I spend at Tim Hortons in a month. I’d be surprised to see what I could save over the course of a year by not going to Tim Hortons at all. Documenting is a great way to teach kids—that way, they see their money coming in and they see their money going out—and to protect yourself by performing regular checks, always checking on your finances, checking on your investments and checking to see where your money is going, whether it’s growing or whether it’s not growing.", "So once again, Mr. Speaker, I would just like to say that I think this is a great motion. I think it’s a great thing to implement for our kids so that we can teach them about the importance of responsibility, the value of a dollar and how to work hard for your money, and to also teach them how important it is for us to respect people in different families from backgrounds that may have financial restrictions." ],

In today’s economy, it’s vital that individuals must have a high level of financial literacy.", "I want to share some stats with everyone in the House at this moment. According to Life Literacy Canada, seven out of 10 Canadians are not fully confident that their math and money management skills will help them plan for a secure financial future. Further to that, the Credit Counselling Society conducted a financial literacy survey just in 2014 and found that 64% of Canadians frequently carry credit card balances, which usually means they’re paying higher interest rates than other types of loans, yet these people claim to be financially literate.", "Among those surveyed with household income of more than $100,000, 82% claim to be highly financially literate, but about half of that number said they don’t follow a budget or a spending plan. The CCS survey also says that 76% of respondents aged 25 to 34 report that they follow a budget, but that more than two thirds are stressed by having moderate to significant amounts of non-mortgage debt. The conclusions of this study found that many Canadians believe that they are financial stable and aware, yet their bankbook and financial decisions say differently.", "I want to share with you that my colleague from York–Simcoe has done a lot of work on this issue over a number of years. I congratulate the member from Brampton West for bringing forward this motion, because it reinforces what the member from York–Simcoe found and shared during her paper. That paper was called Preparing Students for Challenges of the Twenty-First Century. I want to remind everybody of the good work that the member from York–Simcoe has already done.", "In her paper, she explained that we should take the solid financial literacy work already done by groups like the Investment Funds Institute of Canada, the Jr. Economic Club of Canada, the Financial Planning Standards Council and Junior Achievement Canada, and introduce it in a structured way into our schools, beginning at the earliest level, so that all of our children will develop financial literacy.", "Our member from York–Simcoe went on to explain in that paper that having a solid understanding of money helps build the foundation for the entrepreneurship that Ontario needs to go forward successfully in an economic perspective. Needless to say, this motion falls perfectly in line with this PC view, and that’s why I’m happy to say that we are supporting it.", "I know that many times in classrooms, students are taught very valuable science, English and math skills. However, we often miss the critical life skills that can help our youth grow as they face financial challenges in their lives, such as doing your taxes, investing your money and obtaining a mortgage. I feel that proper education would prove to be very valuable and students will then be able to apply those learnings to real life situations.", "Just last week, actually, when I was in a class for the entire day, a teacher shared with me, “Some courses are getting too soft. We have to get back to the basics.” That’s essentially what our leader, Patrick Brown, says as well. The member from York–Simcoe actually has much more information to share and I am fortunate to be able to share this time with her today." ],

But it’s amazing that some of those things stick with you, even though we derided them at the time. I have to say that I was talking about home ec classes as I was preparing dinner on Sunday night and remembered some of those items.", "We did not have financial literacy classes, and of course we need them; there’s no question about it.", "I want to say, though, that this is a world fraught with dangers that we, in our generation—most of us here—didn’t even begin to approach back then. This is a world where we’ve got usurious interest rates—I’m just going to say it. Payday lenders are on almost every corner. They’re charging over 800% interest. My own daughter got stung by the fast cash of walking in with a paycheque and then getting out and realizing what you pay for it. The absolutely usurious interest rates charged by credit card companies as well—I know that’s federal, but it’s something we really need to look at as a community. So yes, the responsibility is to train our children, and we should do a much better job. So we support the member’s motion.", "But we, as a government, also have to look as our responsibility, too, at the world out there and what kind of world our children are growing up into. Years ago, I brought forward a payday lending bill that was synonymous with the law in Quebec, which would limit interest rates to 35%. Think about that: Federally, 35% used to be considered usurious; it was illegal to charge over that. Now it’s commonplace to charge over that. It’s happening on every street corner in downtown Toronto. Of course, the government did respond, to be fair. We brought those interest rates down. Now they’re only about 800%. They were about 1,000%, if we remember. This is outrageous. Nobody, no matter how much money you make, can afford to pay that kind of interest rate. So there’s some legislative work to be done here.", "Now, the Quebec law means that there are no payday lenders on the streets of Quebec. However, the industry has of course become more sophisticated. It has moved online. So now there’s essentially online payday lending at high interest rates. Again, the technology exists to deal with that—other jurisdictions in the States are—so you can prevent rollover loans etc.", "Again, not saying anything, yes—absolutely: Beyond balancing our chequebooks, we need to know about interest rates. We need to learn where to look for the pratfalls in life: how to borrow, how to save—all of that. So many people—Canadians now are in more debt than we’ve ever been in our history. That’s a very dangerous situation, and that comes from financial illiteracy. But we also have to protect Canadians from those who, quite frankly, would rip them off and rip off Ontarians.", "This is happening every day. I have people in my constituency talking all the time about how they borrowed something from a payday lender, and guess what? Years later they’re still paying back that original loan.", "This is our responsibility. We cannot let particularly the most vulnerable among us get stung. When I talk about that, I’m also talking about our children. I know that when I went to university, the first thing I didn’t see when I walked onto campus was somebody trying to give me a credit card. That’s one of the first things our children see when they walk onto campus: somebody to give them a credit card. And no one is telling them that if you don’t pay off that amount in full every month, you’re always going to be paying that amount off. That’s financial literacy too; that’s financial literacy 101. And that’s government financial literacy as well, because federally we regulate that, and provincially we regulate payday lenders now; it was downloaded to us, so we also have a responsibility.", "I would say—and I think I heard somebody in Her Majesty’s loyal opposition say something to this effect—that financial literacy begins at home; it begins right here. So yes, we need it in our schools. Absolutely, we’re going to pass the member’s motion. We also need it in this House, and we need to protect people from those who would exploit them. Sadly, that’s still going on.", "Again, let’s not forget about payday lending. It’s still a scourge in our community. Federally—because there is an election coming up—let’s not forget about the rates that credit cards charge. That’s also our responsibility. Let’s pass the member’s bill, absolutely, so that kids can be prepared for the extremely dangerous world of finances into which they will walk." ],

How do we learn to drive a car safely and to obey the rules of the road? The answer is, we have to be taught.", "In the absence of teaching, we couldn’t organize a society that contains safe and productive cities. In the absence of being taught, people couldn’t learn the skills they need to do the job they do or to work in the career that generates the income that people need to buy what they need to live on and what they choose to buy to express who and what they are.", "Who teaches people how to manage their money—large amounts and small amounts—that their job, their profession or their career generates? That’s a good question. There are lots of merchants who will use some serious advertising and promotion money to teach you how to spend all the money that you have, all the money that you can borrow and more money on top of that. Who will teach you how to live within your means? Who will teach you that using a credit card is exactly the same thing as spending the money?", "You can learn those lessons in bankruptcy proceedings. Trustees in bankruptcy will teach you by hard experience. So will credit counsellors after your spending has gotten out of control. For example, do people really grasp how payday loan advertising pitches about $20 in fees getting you $200 really amount to an annual interest rate of around 540%, depending on the terms—540%? Do people really grasp that what you’re paying is the same as borrowing $100 and paying back $600? It means that if people were truly financially literate, there would be no payday lending industry.", "People would insist that their children open a savings account when they start school, as the member’s children have.

If you learn what credit is, how borrowing works, what compound interest is and how interest on debt works, then you’re likely to make intelligent choices about how you save money, how you spend money and how you borrow money.", "Learning to invest money is a bit more complex if only because, after you’ve learned the basics, your options then become very much larger, but that’s not what the member is proposing. The member is proposing: How do we get Ontarians to learn the basics? The member’s bill is not close to teaching anything like what’s in the Canadian securities course, for example. It’s about enabling Ontarians to control their lifelong money management, to stay out of bankruptcy, to understand how a household budget works, to systematically put away money on a lifelong basis for a secure retirement, and to use credit and borrowing intelligently.", "To that end, just a few statistics: In 1980, Canadians spent about 82% of their disposable income. By 2005, Canadians were spending 96% of their disposable income. As spending has increased relative to income, personal savings have fallen from around 20% 30 years ago to a mere 1.2% today.", "Markets, financial institutions, merchants, insurance companies and organizations that offer credit spend literally billions of dollars to shape consumer behaviour. The member’s proposal very reasonably asks whether the prime motivator in how people save, spend and manage money is going to be how much advertising they’re exposed to. In this, I agree with him.", "What I like about his resolution is that it is not prescriptive. It doesn’t say that schools have to have a set course on this. For example, as we revise our curriculum, why could we not say that in doing your mathematics problems throughout the time that you’re in school, some of the questions in the exercises could lead you to discover how to manage your money, could lead you to practise good spending habits? As you’re teaching various subjects, is there a way to spin financial literacy into some of those subjects? That’s one possible outfall of this.", "It does bring to mind, experientially, some of the things that I remember. I can remember being on a sports team back in the 1980s. At one point, we had to get some more equipment for the team. We delegated that to two of the guys. They called me one Saturday morning and they said, “We need your help.” I said, “Why? What’s the problem?” It had to do with the fact that they didn’t have the cash. I thought, “This is odd. Just put it on a credit card and the team will reimburse you.” I was kind of curious, and I drove over to one of the guy’s places where they were sitting. It turns out that this one gentleman—born in Canada of Canadian parents, raised and educated in this country—what he would do is he would keep a whole drawerful of his paycheques, and when he needed money he would go and cash a paycheque. When I saw that, I pretty much went ballistic on them. We postponed getting the equipment the team needed and I got him to gather up all of those cheques. We went into the closest bank and we opened a bank account for him. He was in his early twenties at the time. That was the first time he’d ever had a bank account.", "I thought to myself, “How pervasive is this?” Well, it turns out that it is very pervasive. It turns out that this is not a problem that’s confined to any one geographic area or social strata or whether you’re born here or whether you’ve come here. It’s something that’s passed down. If you haven’t learned good financial habits at home, you’re unlikely to practise them as an adult.", "I think the member has raised a good discussion point.

It was published in 2011. It provides all kinds of demonstrations of the kinds of things that people have wished for in the debate that we have heard. For instance, things like making change obviously have a mathematical component to it, as well as understanding the value of money. I won’t go through the ministry guideline but I just want to make sure everybody knows it’s there.", "The responsibility of the ministry extends beyond the elementary panel. It goes back further even than I as a classroom teacher. It is still available to high school-level students as an economics course.", "I’m going to digress very quickly to the demonstration of how things come around again. My class was learning the difference between a monopoly and a free market. At that time the Liberals were engaged in a navel-gazing exercise on the role of Brewers’ Retail, as it was known at that point. Of course, it was an absolutely wonderful opportunity to engage my 17- and 18-year-old students to go out and study the Brewers’ Retail, which they did with great enthusiasm. The Liberal Party of Ontario at the time had provided a great deal of resources and study and economics and so on and so forth on the benefits of breaking up that monopoly—or maintaining it. Nothing changes.", "What does change is the manner in which the private sector has undertaken on the important role of financial literacy. To suggest that there is a vested interest, I think, is a little disingenuous here. You have groups like the Investor Education Fund providing documents, exercises, activities and online learning and things like that. The Toronto Star has worked for many years with the private sector on things like the Toronto Star Classroom Connection program, which engages kids. Money: It’s Up to You free instructional kits: Thousands were distributed to Ontario teachers. So the private sector has recognized—and I’ll tell one more anecdote—how important this is.", "I had a constituent come to me a few years ago.

This is my first private member’s bill as the MPP for Windsor West, and it’s truly my pleasure to speak on their behalf to this very important legislation.", "As a rookie member of provincial Parliament last fall, I couldn’t believe what was happening when my office was inundated with phone calls from home care recipients and their loved ones in my riding and across southwestern Ontario. The Erie St. Clair Community Care Access Centre had just announced a 33% reduction of daily nursing visits and was reassessing many home care recipients across the province and deeming them to be in the category of low-to-mild needs, resulting in a decrease in their service.", "To make up for the service reductions, the CCAC suggested family caregivers take all the responsibility for providing care, in one case even suggesting that a patient’s wife change his intravenous medications, which includes actions like flushing out the vein. In another instance, an elderly woman who suffered from a significant abscess was told that wound care was something that her husband should be doing. To her dismay, the service agency tried to force her husband to clean, repack and re-dress her wound. The agency also referred home care recipients to other community agencies, many of which could not handle an increase in capacity on such short notice—all this in order to make up a deficit of over $5 million at the agency. Patients were given little or no notice about the reassessment.", "In Ontario, you are allowed to appeal a reduction or termination of your home care service, first internally to the service agency and then to the Health Services Appeal and Review Board. It can take up to 60 days for a ruling on the internal appeal, and neither tier guarantees that your services are sustained throughout the process. Anyone with a loved one who received home care knows that 60 days for a ruling is too long. While some agencies restore services once an appeal is filed, this is not guaranteed, and the appeal system is inconsistent across the province. All too often, recipients in one area of Ontario continue to receive home care services while people with similar needs in other areas of the province lose their care.", "In the fall, like the hundreds of home care recipients across Ontario who were also having their home care slashed, my constituents had nowhere to turn.", "Speaker, I will forever be thankful for the support of my community, as well as my colleagues from Essex and Windsor–Tecumseh, as we spoke out against these cuts together. Many home care recipients and their family caregivers did not want to become spokespeople for this cause but felt they had no choice. They distributed petitions that were signed by hundreds if not thousands of their friends and neighbours in Windsor and Essex county and across southwestern Ontario.", "Every day, support poured in on the phone and in emails. Eventually, after months of uproar across Ontario, 80% of the Erie St. Clair CCAC deficit was wiped clean and the urgency to reduce services was calmed. It was a major victory for my constituents and all those who had ever had their home care reduced or terminated and felt they deserved better.", "The issue of sudden reductions or terminations in home care is not limited to the Windsor area. For instance, from September to December 2014, over 1,200 home care patients in the Champlain CCAC catchment area were reassessed, and more than 500 were discharged as a result.", "Speaker, my strife is no longer just about these cuts. It’s about the way home care recipients are treated across this province and the fight to create a better system for appeals to service reductions. I want to be certain that home care recipients and their families will never be so undervalued in our health care system again. At the very least, they must have access to a robust appeal process that guarantees their service while they are going through a lengthy appeal. Bill 92, the Empowering Home Care Patients Act, 2015, seeks to do just that. If passed, the act will:", "—shorten the time period, from 60 days to 30 days, during which an agency is required to respond to complaints respecting decisions about the particular community services a person is entitled to receive;", "—require the agency’s response to include information about the process for appealing the decision to the Health Services Appeal and Review Board; and", "—stay the decision of the agency if it would result in the termination or reduction of the community services provided to a person, if an appeal of the decision is made to the Health Services Appeal and Review Board.", "These changes need to be passed today. If anyone in this chamber has a loved one who relies on home care, they will understand that a reduction or termination of these services is life-altering. It’s unfortunate that the appeal process in our home care system does not reflect this.", "Home care recipients need to be informed that there are options when their home care service is cut. They need to have time to adjust to their new service level and/or access to a consistent, cohesive outlet to appeal any reductions to their home care.", "Our home care system is broken, and structural changes must take place. Bill 92 focuses on just one aspect of a complex system, but we cannot undervalue the importance of empowering home care recipients with access to a robust, consistent appeal process.", "If Bill 92 were to become law today, the benefits would be clear to recipients and their family caregivers by tomorrow.", "This bill is not limited to the community care access centres, but applies to all approved service agencies under the Home Care and Community Services Act, 1994. The bill is a concise, effective way to ensure home care recipients get the home care they deserve that is based on medical fact and patient input.", "The bill has received widespread support from across Ontario. The Ontario Health Coalition states: “It is important that home care patients not be cut off of vital home care services while they make appeals. Bill 92 will make the home care appeals system fairer and more just for patients.”", "The Advocacy Centre for the Elderly indicates that the eligibility criteria for home care services have become fraught with seniors having services cut back. Due to unclear eligibility criteria, seniors must turn to complaint and appeal provisions under the act to enforce their rights. The Advocacy Centre for the Elderly supports Bill 92, on behalf of seniors.", "The Ontario Society of Senior Citizens’ Organizations wrote a letter of support for this bill and encouraged its members to review this legislation.", "Speaker, joining me in the gallery today is a representative from the Alzheimer Society of Ontario. This organization recognizes the value of the bill and states: “Patients and caregivers have enough to worry about when appealing a decision to reduce their home care services. It is important to recognize that the current process of appeal adds undue stress to an already stressful situation by removing services during an appeal. The only option is to hire privately to make up for lost services. And that’s really only an option for the few who have enough income to do this.”", "Also joining me in the gallery are representatives from Care Watch, which also supports this bill on behalf of seniors in Ontario. The organization states that “seniors in Ontario need to have access to a high-quality and comprehensive home and community care system. Having a fair and understandable appeals process that does not interrupt the delivery of care is an important component of that system.”", "It’s clear that stakeholders in home and community care want this bill to pass. They know that Bill 92 is a simple and concise way that we can help home care recipients and their family caregivers right now. I know that my constituents are not alone in being impacted by these service reductions. Home care recipients across southwestern Ontario had their services reassessed just like so many others across the province.", "I’m sure that all members of this chamber receive calls from their constituents with similar home care horror stories. I’m asking that all members of this Legislature support home care recipients and their families today. I’m asking that we recognize that our current system is not working. It’s failing home care recipients. Families know that our home care system is not meeting patients’ needs.", "In March, the Donner report was released, and although there is a lot that I don’t agree with, it did acknowledge the shortfalls in our home care system and actually called for a timely and transparent appeals process to be included in a home and community care charter.", "I’m calling on this government to now recognize the value of a transparent appeal process and vote in favour of the bill that is right in front of them. Speaker, we need the Empowering Home Care Patients Act to pass today—right here, right now. I ask that all members of this chamber join me in supporting this important legislation.", "Speaker, I notice that I still have a little bit of time left on the clock, and I just want to mention another story, that wasn’t in my notes, of an elderly lady in her mid-90s. She had suffered a very severe stroke. She was unable to walk and unable to talk; she couldn’t feed herself, she couldn’t bathe herself, and she was incontinent. Through the reassessment process, they decided that she was suddenly, now, low to mild needs and did not require service anymore. I’m not certain how someone who cannot do anything for themselves can be considered low to mild needs.", "In fact, her daughter and her son-in-law, who are seniors themselves, were then put into the role of her primary caregivers. So we’re talking about seniors who are lifting someone in her 90s, who is frail, out of a wheelchair to put her into bed at night or to bathe her, administer medication to her and feed her. During this process, not only were they in charge of having to care for her on a regular basis; they had no respite. Somebody had to be in the house with the mother 24/7. They couldn’t even go out to get groceries, because this woman required both of them to be in the home in order to move her from wheelchair to bed and so on.", "When something like this happens, I’m not sure how families are expected to be able to go out and buy the groceries they need, go to work and earn the money they need in order to get private services to take care of someone. It’s quite shameful that somebody who is 92 and unable to take care of herself, in one of the most extreme cases, would be considered low to mild needs and arbitrarily cut off from services.", "I’m happy to report that after standing in this chamber and asking the minister directly why these cuts are happening—and being able to name people. It wasn’t until I stood up and actually started giving names and cases of those impacted that everybody who had come forward and allowed me to share their names, whether it was in the media or in here, had their services restored. But those services could still be cut tomorrow. They’re not guaranteed. We need to make sure that these people understand that they do have an appeal process. They can go to the service agency—not just the CCAC; any service agency that provides home care—file an appeal, and be told that there is an additional appeal process—because right now that’s not required—and that if they decide to go to the Health Services Appeal and Review Board, those services will be reinstated during that time.", "These are critical services that these people need, and they need to know that they have an opportunity to appeal these cuts and these decisions." ],

It’s also an issue that is quite familiar to me, given my previous role as a social worker working as a discharge planner in the Ottawa Hospital and also as the co-owner of a retirement residence, Portobello Manor, in my riding of Ottawa–Orléans. So it is with great pleasure that I will support the member’s bill.", "I just want to first highlight the important steps that our government—and I’m very proud of those steps—is taking on the issue of home care. Our government received expert recommendations through Gail Donner, in a report titled Bringing Care Home. This report has been instrumental in guiding the creation of our plan, the Patients First road map. The road map, which we will implement over the next three years, has 10 points. These 10 points will make sure we enhance home and community care in order that patients receive the best services possible and have little need to complain.", "Through this plan, we will be providing funding for an additional 80,000 hours of nursing care, at-home and community care. That represents a $750-million investment over the next three years, Mr. Speaker. These hours will be realized through an increased number of visits and hours that health care providers can spend with patients who have complex care needs. From 15 years in the health care sector, this is huge. I’m excited about this plan because I’m pleased to say that this government will be giving greater choice to individuals in choosing their home care provider. This is very, very important.", "Our government will also pilot different approaches to give eligible Ontarians more choices over who provides their services in-home and where these services are delivered.", "We know that patients—and I have to say that I certainly know too—want to be at home instead of in hospital. By continuing to increase the quality of care at home, we are addressing the concerns of the member opposite.", "I also understand that we need to address the capacity for home care in the future. The Patients First road map will plan for the future. Just as we are building Ontario up and planning for the future of our infrastructure, we are creating a long-term plan for our aging population.", "I am pleased that we are moving to create a patient ombudsman who will comprehensively address issues. Anyone in Ontario who has an unresolved complaint about their care at a hospital, long-term-care home or community care access centre will have a transparent health care investigator in the ombudsman. The patient ombudsman will focus on health care issues and enhance the complaints process by adding a patient-centred lens to this process.", "Mr. Speaker, it is unquestionably necessary that we seriously consider each and every one’s complaints and properly address them. That being said, I support the member opposite’s bill and understand her concerns. We, as a government, want to continue to ensure that patients receive the best home care and, if they are not, that the government is responding to their complaints in a speedy manner.", "I think the government is showing leadership in how we’re going to address those concerns that have been experienced by our patients and our seniors all across the province.", "I’m happy, like I said, to support the member, but I’m even more excited to see the next step on our plan." ],

It’s a complicated system, and it shouldn’t be so complicated. I know the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care are trying to make some changes that hopefully will make it better.", "It is difficult fielding phone calls from CCACs if something happens in their time schedule—so you can only imagine if an elderly person either is on their own or their spouse is elderly, probably in their 80s. I have lots of stories about how they’ve been discharged from hospital, and they’ve given the instructions to the spouse, yet the spouse is, like, 87 years old. They can’t be expected to fill in those care gaps. I know that this does happen, especially in the eastern part of Haliburton county. I’ve had to pick up the phone and ask, “Did you think this through? The person is 87” or high up in age. “How can they actually physically help as much as you think they can help?” So access to the services—and what the services are required needs to be done.", "When the CCACs—in my area, anyway—were on strike earlier, the nurses there told me stories that they actually added layers of bureaucracy so that the nurses themselves, who were very highly trained, weren’t able to make those decisions. They’d go to a level of bureaucracy that had nowhere near the experiences the nurses had. They’d sometimes wait eight hours before a decision was made to provide the home care. Meanwhile, that patient had been discharged from the hospital and was waiting for home care at home.", "It’s pretty nerve-wracking if you don’t have anybody in your family who has had experience in health care. I can tell you, I still get calls from all my family members on health care—because you’re never not a nurse, as I say.", "There’s too much bureaucracy.", "I heard the member mention the great care providers in her area.

They actually put the community care in—they just took the people and rolled them over into the hospital—and coordinated these services, because, just like the story I shared with you about the east part of Haliburton county, that’s what they look after. They knew that they were not able to deliver the home care services out to these regions. It was too hard; it was uncoordinated.", "The hospital itself had a smaller program but could only go—I think it was five kilometres outside the village that they actually provided home support services to. It didn’t actually have to be health care. It was like home support: Get the meal; help them have the bath. They were doing that.", "That’s a model that works. It’s very efficient.

It needs to be a system that looks after the vulnerable, the infirm, seniors and those in need of short-term and long-term health care.", "There is no place in our health care system for the existing privatization, let alone more privatization, as set out in the latest announcement from the Ministry of Health, where they’re going to invest another $750 million, and you can pick your own providers—what is that about? That opens the doors for hundreds more private operators in the system, and will put shareholders and their pockets before health care, which will put profit before quality care, before continuity of care and before seamless care.", "The acuity levels of patients in this province who are leaving hospitals and needing home care is growing. The population of people who require home care is aging. Seniors are living longer. The problem with that is they have multiple, complex health needs, so three hours a day, one hour a day, 20 hours a month does not cut it, unfortunately.", "Patients are being discharged from hospital much sooner. Some of them are being discharged after hip replacement within 24 to 36 hours; with that, they need more care in their homes.", "We have got the RNAO calling for the disbandment of the CCAC.

Some 500 agencies are operating—some for-profit, some not-for-profit—without any oversight, without anybody to assist in coordinating those services, and now we’ve got the RNAO calling to disband a similar organization across the province.", "In Niagara, we’ve had a strike going on for eight weeks. CarePartners is a for-profit agency where the CEO, Linda Knight, made almost $700,000 last year with her wages and perks, while 1,600 patients in the Niagara region are on wait-lists and not getting the care that they actually need. Dedicated professionals—RNs, RPNs—are on the picket line instead of giving patients the care they need, because their CEO is making hundreds of thousands and they’re getting $18 a visit in a for-profit system, like they were working piecework at the canning factory.", "Just yesterday, I heard from the CCAC, through the Globe and Mail, that the LHIN in my area is actually moving $4 million or $5 million from the CCAC to the community partners to do home care. Were MPPs notified about this? No. I had to hear about it from the Globe and Mail. It is unbelievable what is happening out there.", "In addition, they told me that the CCAC in Niagara is ending their wait-lists. I heard about that in the Globe and Mail as well. There was no notification to any of our offices that seniors who may have had care providers for years are suddenly going to have a new care provider. Nobody has notified anybody of that change—not the LHIN, not the CCAC and not the Ministry of Health. It is atrocious that something like this could happen with no notification, and it’s very dangerous for our senior population to not be on a wait-list, particularly those people who don’t have families.", "I’ve just got about a minute left, because I know the member from Nickel Belt wants to weigh in here, but I want to give you two recent examples in my community. The mother of a good friend of mine was 86 years old. She went into the hospital. Her name was Barbara Dmytrow. She had a heart attack. She came home from the CCAC. She lived on the second floor of the house, but her daughter was still working and the rest of her family lived in Ottawa and all over the place.", "She had a CCAC assessment. She was on oxygen.

Well, her daughter found her a week later on the floor, where she died alone at 10 o’clock in the morning, because she was getting no care in our community.", "Just yesterday, I heard from a woman—her name is Christine—who has an 11-year-old disabled son; he’s been disabled since about three months old. He had major surgery at SickKids hospital. She took him home on May 11. She could have sent him over to a rehab hospital for a couple of weeks after the surgery, but she took him home, saving the health system thousands and thousands of dollars. It’s now May 28. She is still waiting for services and equipment for that child, which he could have had had he stayed in the hospital and cost the system probably $100,000.", "These are the kinds of things that are happening in our community; they need to stop.

I think the movement we are seeing—across the world, but certainly here in Ontario—to home care is a very positive move, because most people, given the choice and with adequate and good health care available to them in the home setting, would choose that. Whenever we’re striving to improve the circumstances related to those receiving home care, that is good. That’s why a discussion this afternoon on this subject is valuable.", "I am pleased that our government is investing $4.3 billion in the community care sector across the province of Ontario. We increased funding by $270 million this year, and we have provided the LHINs with $2.4 billion in funding for CCACs, representing close to a 100% increase since 1999. But those are all statistics, and they are important statistics because sometimes you’d get the impression that there’s never been an increase in the amount of money going into home care, when in fact there have been huge amounts of money dedicated to home care—at, I must say, the suggestion of those in the health care field, who have said it would be better to have care delivered in the home in many cases, rather than having people convalescing in a hospital setting, though they do have to do that sometimes.", "Some of the real heroes we know out there are caregivers from the family. Some of the members have discussed what they go through very often. Often the caregivers are quite elderly or may have health issues themselves. They have been real troopers in terms of providing that kind of support in many extenuating circumstances, but you really do need professional help through personal support workers, nurses and others who can be of assistance to people in this field.", "One of the things I’ve noted when I meet with people is something that’s not popular to say. Unfortunately, in the 1990s, the battle over taxes was lost. The right wing said that taxes were bad in the United States, Canada and around the world; therefore, if you mentioned increasing taxes, you’d never be elected. And yet, everyone who comes forward with new programs and suggestions for improvement in health care or other fields knows in their heart of hearts that to deliver the kind of service we would like to deliver, you really have to increase taxes.", "So when I meet with people, I ask them that question. I asked them the question at the time: “Are you prepared to increase taxes? Because what you’re proposing is very good.” Invariably, they’ll either say “No,” or they’ll say, “Yes. Tax somebody else, but don’t tax me.”", "I think as a society, we have to start understanding that if we want improved public services, it’ll take more dollars to do so. I wish that message would get out there, but to pretend it wouldn’t—I don’t think anybody this afternoon has said that, but I encounter many people, because we all meet with people in our constituency offices, and invariably they want government to invest more if they’re from the field of public services. I am sympathetic to that, but I ask every time: “Are you prepared to go out and campaign for higher taxes?” “Oh, no. Take it from education. Take it from here. Take it from there. Governments waste money.” They have a myriad of excuses for it. I think someday we have to confront that fact, because we have to continue to make improvements.", "The member has brought forward some interesting suggestions in her initiative this afternoon to improve. If we’re going to make those improvements, if we see the tsunami coming for health care—for seniors particularly, with the number of people suffering from dementia, and that number is going to increase in the future—it’s going to require financial resources to meet those obligations. Unless we as a society—and, I guess, we as politicians—are prepared to put that message out there to people, then we’re not honest with them if we don’t tell them that that kind of investment is necessary.", "I commend the member for bringing forward her initiative this afternoon for consideration of the House.

My riding of Thornhill, of course, is in York region. It was quite heartbreaking to see two gentlemen who came with him. One is a caregiver for his mother, and the other is a caregiver for his wife. Thank goodness that there are programs in York region in our community where patients with Alzheimer’s can go during the day, and thank goodness that we do have health care workers who are providing home care.", "But I think that we’re all told to look carefully at charities before we give them our valuable after-tax dollars, and many people feel that 80% of the money should go directly to services for most charities. If they see it go further askew from 80% and 20%, they say that charity is not getting my money. Some people even say it should be 90% and 10%, or 100% of the money. Well, maybe we have to have that discussion and say that CCACs should be a significant amount of the money—perhaps 80% has to go to front-line health care—and insist on that. If the administrators can’t do it, then maybe those administrators have to provide the front-line health care that they’re tasked to do.", "So we were just hearing today from the member from the third party that the Welland hospital will be closing. How are we here talking about prioritizing tax dollars when we’re talking about shutting down health care in a community? Families drive their parents and their children and themselves to appointments. If they have to go farther, that’s more time off work and more time away from their family and their tasks. If people have to drive farther for health care, we all know what happens. Oftentimes they don’t make it to the hospital in enough time to receive the care that they need in a timely fashion.", "We can definitely do better, and in my opinion it’s about prioritizing the money that we’re already collecting. I don’t think that it’s fair to constantly go with our hands out to the public when the public is struggling. We could definitely do better.", "I appreciate the suggestions in this bill that we have to respond to complaints within 30 days instead of 60 days. In my riding of Vaughan, four complaints, I’m told, were made against a home daycare; this government didn’t act upon them, and a little girl unfortunately died under terrible circumstances. It’s not enough, unfortunately, to just say, “We’ll investigate.” We heard the member from Ottawa–Orléans say that it’s a priority for her and her government to investigate any complaints.

That’s what we’re seeing, certainly, right now, Mr. Speaker.", "So what’s the negative? We’re talking about all the positive multicultural things going on in Ontario. What are the negatives? Well, I’m going to read from this letter that I sent to the honourable Sergeant-at-Arms, about the Al-Quds rally, which unfortunately takes place in many parts of the world. It really ties in with the pro-Khomeini—I guess we can almost call it—terror recruitment that can be going on in our own province, right under our very noses. The letter reads:", "“With great urgency I write to call public attention to the repeated demand of a group of public citizens to stage a demonstration of a deeply offensive, racist and deplorable nature on the grounds of Queen’s Park.", "“The Al-Quds Day tradition was initiated in 1979 by Ayatollah Khomeini to endorse and promote a fundamentalist strain of Islam as well as the hatred and destruction of both the Israeli state and the Jewish people.”", "Rallies take place, Mr. Speaker, all across North America, with slogans chanted and obscene sentiments suggested, with placards and, yes, even flags of known terrorist organizations which are now outlawed.", "We have to focus and we have to bring the stage and the focus to the positive aspects of multiculturalism and ensure that hate is not brought to our wonderful country and our wonderful province and all the wonderful communities.", "We all enjoy the diversity, I think, and we enjoy meeting people from other cultures and learning about other cultures; we enjoy, certainly, as I’ve said, the food from other cultures. It’s boring if we’re all cut from the same cloth and eating the same food week after week and day after day.", "But we also have to recognize that too often people see multiculturalism as an opportunity to propagate hate. So let’s focus on the positive. I’m really happy that the member from Trinity–Spadina brought forward this proclamation. On behalf of the PC Party, I’m certainly happy to say that we support and we look forward to celebrating all these wonderful events. I only touched on a tiny bit that takes place over maybe a two-week period. We look forward to celebrating with all of the members of the House. We enjoy seeing each other outside of the Legislature at these kinds of events; we all know that we do. We look forward to meeting many of our constituents and each other’s constituents at the events as well. Thank you." ],

  "text" : [ "I am pleased to rise on behalf of the constituents that I represent in London West to speak to the motion today that was put forward by the member for Trinity–Spadina. This motion calls on the province of Ontario to officially recognize Canadian Multiculturalism Day every year on June 7. I understand that the purpose of the motion is to demonstrate Ontario’s commitment to the official policy of multiculturalism that has been set by the government of Canada. This was adopted, as the member indicated, back in 1971. It’s been in place for decades in this country. June 27 has been recognized as Multiculturalism Day since 2003.", "I want to say at the outset that New Democrats are certainly proud to stand in support of the motion, and I congratulate the member for Trinity–Spadina for bringing this forward.", "This motion, this recognition of June 27 as Canadian Multiculturalism Day, really goes a long way to recognize the vital contributions that people of different ethnic and racial and cultural backgrounds bring to our societies here in Ontario. It celebrates our shared diversity. It acknowledges our collective commitment to democracy, equality and human rights, all those principles that we value dearly as Ontarians.", "It also sends an important message to newcomers that becoming Canadian does not mean giving up their cultural identity, that in Canada citizenship is not synonymous with culture. So there are opportunities for people to share their cultural identity and to celebrate their cultural identity.", "I looked at some of the literature around the concept of multiculturalism. Multiculturalism really has three main goals. The first goal is to recognize and celebrate diversity, which is what we’re talking about. We know that both the federal and provincial governments are very active in supporting and encouraging ethnocultural groups to have festivals and community events, to showcase their food, their traditional dress and their cultural traditions.", "The second goal is to foster the integration of newcomers into Canadian society. This means ensuring that immigrants are able to find jobs, that they are able to make connections, that they are able to join community groups and that they are able to find their place within society.", "The third goal is to create and maintain equality between citizens. This involves enabling newcomers to become full and equal members of our society who have a say, just like the rest of us, and whose views and contributions matter, just like those of us who were born here. We want to ensure that the skills, the experiences, the insights and the ideas that newcomers bring to Canada are valued, because we know that they enrich our society and benefit us all.", "Speaker, we do pretty well on the first goal. Certainly I’ve found that one of the best parts of being an MPP is being able to participate in those many cultural events and celebrations that take place in my community of London and across the province. I have really enjoyed and been enriched from learning about the different ethnocultural communities I represent in London.", "But unfortunately, we don’t do nearly as well on the second and third goals, those goals of integration and equality. For example, I’ve spoken before in this Legislature about the labour market needs of the African Canadian community in London, and the challenges they face integrating into the labour market. There was a needs assessment done earlier this year that found unemployment among African Canadians in London is about 35%, which is five times higher than the overall unemployment rate. Of course, this represents an incredible loss of talent, skills and credentials that these newcomers could bring into our community.", "Just this week, there was an article in the London Free Press about a heart surgeon who had arrived in London from Iraq 15 months ago but has been unable to find work that allows him to practise his skills as a physician. This is not just a London issue. This is across the province, and across the country, really.", "In Ontario, the Fairness Commissioner issued a report in January of this year that talked about the barriers that internationally educated professionals face in entering the labour market in Ontario. She recommended that some changes be made to the Canadian experience requirements that are put in place by many regulatory bodies, because this requirement for Canadian experience creates a huge barrier for immigrants to be able to enter the workforce. This barrier has also been recognized by the Ontario Human Rights Commissioner. Both bodies have called for these Canadian experience requirements to be removed.", "The Fairness Commissioner’s report also highlighted the need for better access to bridge training programs for professionals, as well as sustainable funding for these programs, because research shows that they start up, they close down—there’s no continuity for immigrants in knowing when they will be offered and where they will be offered. They’re also very, very expensive, costing up to $12,000 for tuition. This creates huge barriers for immigrants to enter these programs, but these programs are necessary for them to enter into the labour market. So bridge training is something that would really help with the integration of newcomers.", "Finally, I think we all know that people come to Canada because they want a better life for themselves and their children. They want new opportunities. They want to practise their skills in the occupations they were trained to do. They want to send their kids to post-secondary education so their kids can do better than themselves, which is what all of us hope for future generations, and can have brighter futures.", "If we are not able to do this for the newcomers who come to our society, if we fail to live up to the promise we present, what we risk doing is creating alienation and despair, and we risk losing out on all of those incredible contributions that newcomers can make.", "In closing, I would say that we absolutely welcome observing June 27 as multicultural day in Ontario, but we will also continue to push for much, much more." ],

It’s a real honour and a privilege to see so many familiar faces, and I want to welcome you all to Queen’s Park.", "We’re fortunate to live in a province as diverse as Ontario. We are the most multicultural province in Canada, where half of all new immigrants to the country make their home. We’re a land of opportunity, with a strong, prosperous and democratic society that has been shaped by the hard work of generations of immigrants.", "Ontario has over 12 million people. Our population consists of people from 200 countries, speaking as many as 130 languages. Think about it: Close to 200,000 immigrants a year from all across the world continue to choose Canada as the destination for a new home. That’s what my parents did decades ago.", "Of the more than 1.5 million people who immigrated to Canada and became permanent residents during the last six years, over a third of them immigrated to Ontario. Ontario is the clear, number one destination for immigrants coming to Canada. People are drawn here by an exceptional high quality of life, and by our global reputation as an open, peaceful and caring society that welcomes newcomers and cherishes diversity.", "Recognizing June 27 as Canadian Multiculturalism Day in Ontario will give us the opportunity to celebrate our diversity and acknowledge our commitment to democracy, equality, justice and mutual respect. It will give Ontarians a chance to better understand and appreciate the contributions of the various multicultural communities throughout our province and country.", "Our multiculturalism is important. It’s important because it helps to combat ignorance. It’s important because it encourages an open dialogue between different cultures. And it’s important because it helps to bridge the gap between different ideas, different values and different beliefs.", "Ontario consists of various cultural, racial and ethnic groups. Our multiculturalism helps to foster the idea that every person can make significant contributions to our society because of, rather than in spite of, their differences. We can learn from one another, but first we must have a level of understanding about each other to facilitate collaboration and co-operation. Celebrating our differences and promoting learning about other cultures helps us all to understand other perspectives within the world in which we live. It makes our province and our country a better place, a more interesting place to live in, because when we have people from diverse cultures contributing language skills, new ways of thinking, new knowledge and different experiences, we are all made stronger.", "That is why, Mr. Speaker, I’m proud to speak in support of this proposed motion officially recognizing June 27 as Canadian Multiculturalism Day.

I want to sincerely thank the member—the fabulous, great member—from Trinity–Spadina for putting forward this important initiative.", "Multiculturalism is a fundamental characteristic of Canadian heritage and of our society here in Ontario. People of all backgrounds have made and continue to make valuable contributions to Ontario. I think it is absolutely appropriate and necessary to dedicate a day to celebrate and recognize the social and economic contributions that immigrants have made and continue to make to our province on a daily basis. It’s important that we have a day in which we can celebrate and recognize our diversity. What better day than June 27, as being proposed by the member from Trinity–Spadina?", "As an immigrant myself, I understand personally the importance of Ontario’s diversity. Speaker, looking around this House here today, I see many members who, like myself, are children of immigrants or immigrants themselves. I’d like to take a moment to acknowledge the deep and enduring contributions newcomers have made to the quality of life we enjoy today.", "My family arrived in Toronto from Portugal in 1970 and settled in the riding of Davenport. I quickly started kindergarten and began the process of adaptation. Most newcomers will tell you that it’s easier for children to adapt. My father attended English-as-a-second-language classes at George Brown College, and thank goodness they were available—and, 45 years later, we’re still providing ESL classes to newcomers in this province. But I’m grateful to my parents for giving me the opportunity to grow up in Canada and to be here today in this House. I’m so proud to represent Davenport, the community that embraced and welcomed my family when we first came to Canada and one of the most diverse ridings in the entire country.", "So many fantastic communities call Davenport home and truly make it one of the most vibrant areas in the city of Toronto. Little Portugal comes to mind, and I share that with the member from Trinity–Spadina, as does Corso Italia on St. Clair. As well, the Vietnamese community is very active in Davenport around College Street, and they are represented by the fantastic Vietnamese Association of Toronto, which I’ve had the pleasure of working with. Of course, there’s the Hispanic-Canadian community quite prominent across Davenport, specifically along St. Clair. As many of you know, I had the honour of passing my first bill, Bill 28, An Act to proclaim the month of October as Hispanic Heritage Month.", "Thanks to the support from all parties in the Legislature, our province will now recognize the important social, political, economic and multicultural contributions that Hispanic Canadians have made to Ontario. I encourage all members of this House to reach out to the Spanish-speaking communities in each of your ridings for the month of October.", "The importance of Hispanic Heritage Month clearly demonstrates the importance of passing this motion and celebrating Canada’s multiculturalism. I’d like to thank the member once again for putting forward this motion, and I encourage all members to support this important private member’s bill that is being put forward today to celebrate the first Multiculturalism Day in Ontario." ],

Having said that, his heart, or at least his electoral sense, is in the right place. I would encourage him and his colleagues and followers to perhaps think of individuals from the diverse cultures that we have in between the election cycles and not merely at the election cycles.", "I can tell you, for example—and I stay this with some form, I guess, of regret—that what is being practised at the federal level is akin to what’s called “dog whistle politics,” which, of course, have been perfected and made into a fine dark art in the United States of America. There are coded signals given, which perhaps try to foster, inculcate and invigorate the darker side of our natures. For example, we don’t have to go too far out of the province of Ontario; we can go to the province of Quebec. Thankfully, the government that was voted out—booted out, I should say—with their, as I believe it was called, Quebec charter of rights or whatever the actual terminology was.", "They were at the stage where they specified, in kind of cartoon, diagrammatic form, the types of dress—and therefore implying the types of people who are not welcome in the country of Canada and in the public institutions of Quebec. That’s called dog whistle politics. Actually, “dog whistle politics” is a little subtle; that was probably overt. I’m very happy to report that we live in a country where, essentially, that was not only rejected out of hand, but that government was booted out.", "We need, whether it’s simple humanity, simply realizing that it’s the year 2015, or whether it’s on the economic arguments that my colleagues have said, or whether it’s a historical commemoration of the act of multiculturalism which was brought in by Trudeau I, once upon a time, in 1971, as I understand it—all of these reasons, because we are a pluralist, global society.", "I would commend, for example, the pluralist achievements and aspirations of His Highness the Aga Khan, whose centre we, along with the Premier and many of my colleagues, just inaugurated a part of; or, for example, Ratna Omidvar of Ryerson and the Global Diversity Exchange and the extraordinary work she’s doing to help bring these types of issues, as I say, as a celebration of humankind, and not merely as an electoral wedge strategy.", "Merci beaucoup pour votre attention, monsieur le Président." ],

It’s an important concept, because nature created differences; humans added value to that. It’s very important that we say that every unique element that we all exhibit is beautiful and wonderful. All of our diversity makes our society more rich, and it is something that we need to celebrate. In fact, celebrating our uniqueness when it comes to our culture, our language and our spiritual beliefs gives individuals more self-worth and self-confidence. It’s something that we need to celebrate; it’s very important.", "As a society, though, I ask us to start thinking about the way we view multiculturalism. We often think about Canada as a place that is welcoming of other cultures, but instead of thinking of Canada as a place that welcomes other cultures, let’s turn that definition somewhat and think of Canada, by definition, as a place that is diverse. It is a place that should be inclusive and accepting of diversity—not that it welcomes other cultures but that it is, in fact, a place that is made up of different cultures. That is its inherent fabric.", "In that light, we would move from an initial position where we were talking about the idea of tolerance and tolerating different religions and different cultures and values. “Tolerance” was a term that was used at one point when speaking of different cultures and ethnicities, but we need to move beyond that and into the language of acceptance and inclusivity. That’s where we need to move, as a society, and I hope that we will use this as a platform to build on that concept of inclusion.", "It’s so important that we recognize the importance of inclusion and accepting our diversity and celebrating that diversity, because we all know far too well that racism is alive and well in Canada and, in fact, in Ontario and across the world. To counter some of the negativity that we see that actually seeks to divide us, based on our unique differences and our diversity, we need to send a clear message that we do not accept that approach.", "In fact, the fact that we have practices like carding and racial profiling, where people are meant to feel—or made to feel—unwelcome, unwanted, in their own communities and this society—we need to counter that message by putting forward a message of inclusion and acceptance, and I hope that this bill will do exactly that. By celebrating our multiculturalism, we will send a message that as much as we hear and see these signs of divisiveness and these messages that seek to make people feel excluded, unwelcome and not wanted, we actually denounce that and instead want to accept people for their uniqueness.", "I want to also acknowledge the fact that all of us in Canada are immigrants. Everyone in Canada, except for those who call this land their traditional land—and I have to acknowledge that we are on the traditional lands of the Mississaugas of New Credit. Besides the aboriginals, the First Nations, everyone came to Canada. It’s just a matter of when we came." ],

I had the opportunity to speak to this bill at second reading and my understanding is the bill hasn’t changed much since then. Despite several excellent amendments put forward by New Democrats that would have helped strengthen this bill, the bill hasn’t changed. Sadly, the Liberals voted against every single amendment put forward by the NDP at committee—every single one.", "One of our main concerns is that this bill empowers the government to outsource motor vehicle inspection centres to an unspecified third party that would be exempt from the oversight of the Auditor General and the Ombudsman. A number of my colleagues compared this to the creation of Drive Clean on steroids. It appears to be a fairly accurate depiction. This delegated authority is unaccountable and could have the capacity to dictate to drivers how often they must bring their vehicles in for inspection and what they need to do to pass inspection. I don’t think it’s unreasonable to ask that this government clarify the vague provisions that allow for this outsourcing.", "That is precisely why New Democrats tabled amendments at committee that would improve transparency around this issue. We asked for some accountability mechanisms, be it the Auditor General or the Ombudsman. The Liberals voted this down, although, given the Liberal track record on accountability, I can’t say that this was surprising.", "We believe that the Director of Vehicle Inspection Standards must be an officer of the ministry, a public servant. For instance, we suggested an amendment that would ensure this. Once again, the Liberals voted this down. Currently, under this legislation, the director could be anyone, including someone chosen by special interests such as insurance companies. In fact, it could even be another Liberal patronage appointment, which so many Ontarians are growing tired of.", "An additional amendment that the New Democrats tabled would require motorists to stop at an unsignalled crosswalk if there was a pedestrian waiting to cross. Many in Ontario would be shocked to learn that this isn’t already a law. As I understand it, once you step off the sidewalk and onto a crosswalk, motorists have to stop for you and allow you to cross. This is obvious, but not always the practice, unfortunately. What we would like is for this level of protection to be extended to pedestrians waiting at crosswalks.", "You will soon see a theme has formed in my speech today, Speaker. The NDP proposed an amendment that would match the law with people’s expectations or perceptions of the law. How could you possibly know when it is appropriate to step off the sidewalk and onto a crosswalk if there is nothing prompting you? Are children able to measure traffic effectively and know when it’s safe to enter a crosswalk? Wouldn’t a requirement that all motorists stop at a crosswalk where a pedestrian is waiting greatly improve public safety?", "New Democrats also sought to increase the maximum fine for hitting a pedestrian when they are in a crosswalk.

The Liberals voted against this.", "As I’m speaking on a bill entitled the Making Ontario’s Roads Safer Act, I’m reminded that my colleague the member from Essex put forward a motion calling for the widening of Highway 3. He tabled this motion to call on the government to honour a commitment it made in 2006 to widen this highway, running from Windsor to Leamington. Right now, this highway is about two thirds complete. The rest of Highway 3, many people in our area know, is the Bruce Crozier Way. It’s a single lane in each direction. If we are talking about safety today, how is this safe? The widening of this highway was something residents of the area have pushed for since 1993, much of the advocacy being done by Bruce Crozier himself. Along with the safety implications, moving forward with this project has many economic benefits. The Leamington-Kingsville area is known for its agriculture, and widening this highway is essential to allow these businesses to grow and access the American market. However, the Liberals failed to support the important motion tabled by my colleague from Essex.", "Speaker, I’d like to turn to some of the bicycle safety provisions of this bill. I think it’s timely to have a discussion on bicycle safety as so many of us have already started cycling this year. In fact, this month, Windsor residents took part in yet another Tweed Ride. For those of you who are not familiar with this event, it’s one part a cycling event and one part a fashion statement, as cyclists ride wearing—you guessed it—their finest tweed fashions. It’s something to see. If you’ve never done something like this before, I invite you to join us next year. This year’s event had almost 350 participants, setting a new record. I spoke about the Tweed Ride when this bill was being debated at second reading, and I think it’s very fitting that I had a chance to mention it today, after the event took place.", "I talked at length, at second reading, about crosswalks. I think it’s very important that we look at the safety of crosswalks. We’re encouraging young children to participate in physical activity, and they use crosswalks to get over to the school, to play in the playground, or to one of our parks. They often don’t know how to gauge how fast a car is going, how far away it is and how safe it’s going to be, how much time they have to make it across the road. I believe that including the amendment that we wanted, which was to make it so that drivers have to stop at a crosswalk, regardless of whether there’s a light flashing—if there’s someone standing on the sidewalk waiting to cross, the drivers should have to stop and let the person cross. We’re putting children at risk, especially young children. They don’t have the ability—sometimes, I’ll admit, especially in this big city, I have a hard time gauging how much time I still have left to get across the street." ],

So we need to make sure that children have a mechanism where they know, when they’re at a crosswalk, that any car coming is going to stop and wait and let them cross.", "I also spoke to the outsourcing. As you know, New Democrats are never in favour of P3s. We’re never in favour of removing accountability. We believe that there should be mechanisms in place to make sure that those who are providing services are not only providing the services that we have asked them to provide but that they’re doing it in a safe manner; that there are checks and balances in place to make sure that they’re doing it in a safe manner; that our safety is not at risk; that they’re doing the job well; that they’re not just doing the job.", "I don’t have a lot of time left, so I’m going to go back to talking about the Tweed Ride. As the member from Windsor–Tecumseh can attest to, the majority of it takes place in his riding, and they move into my riding, because our ridings are so closely joined. It’s quite the spectacle to see how seriously people take cycling in our city. We have a beautiful waterfront with lots of trails. In the member from Windsor–Tecumseh’s riding, they have the Ganatchio Trail, which is a beautiful trail. You can bike, you can rollerblade, you can walk the trail and the waterfront, which extends right from the Windsor–Tecumseh riding right into Windsor West. They’re beautiful biking trails, and we need to make sure that people using these trails or cycling on our roadways are safe.", "At second reading, I had spoken at length about penalties for cyclists and had spoken about the increase in penalties for cyclists that they were looking at implementing, that they are often harsher than what someone driving a car would be exposed to. We need to make sure that those who choose to ride bikes—I mean, we would rather people on bikes than in cars. So if we’re going to encourage people to ride bikes, we need to make sure that there are safe places for them to ride and that the fines aren’t prohibitive, that the rules aren’t too prohibitive.", "We’d love to have something in Windsor like you have here in Toronto, where there’s designated bike lanes with a curb, but we don’t have them. We don’t have the infrastructure—the roads—to allow that, so we need to make sure that the people who have to ride bikes on the road are safe when they do so, and that every tool is in place to make sure that nobody gets hurt." ],

I look forward to this particular issue actually being resolved by way of regulation, because this particular issue is big—not only in northern Ontario but in different parts of the province.", "The other thing I want to just say very quickly is the whole issue around the Connecting Links program. The government has announced that there is $15 million in order to assist with Connecting Links. I would say that is really a drop in the bucket to what we need. The two worst roads in Ontario have been voted in the city of Timmins alone and are both the same road. One is Algonquin Boulevard, which is a part of Highway 101 that runs through Timmins itself, and the other part is Riverside Drive, which is the other part of Highway 101, which runs in what we used to call Mountjoy, which is also part of Timmins but the old Mountjoy township. So we now have the two worst roads in Ontario, a four-lane highway that’s probably in about as good a situation as a road to Kakatush. And if you’ve not been on the road to Kakatush, it’s a gravel road that is from somewhere else; it’s from Plan 9 from Outer Space.", "I’m just saying to the minister across the way, we need to do something better when it comes to Connecting Links, because municipalities can’t afford to pay the kind of money that they’ve got to pay when it comes to maintaining what is essentially a provincial highway." ],

I really support the sanctions throughout this bill that are dealing with that.", "I know the municipalities are looking forward to the passing of this bill to make sure that outstanding fines have to be paid so the municipalities have more money in their system to be able to add to the infrastructure that they need in their communities.", "I’m hoping the rest of this afternoon is devoted to ensuring speedy passage of this bill.

They’re not seeing people taking the bus more because of the bus lanes. In fact, people are very frustrated: They see the traffic getting worse, and they feel that the government is too focused on making things more difficult for commuters to get around in York region. People are very concerned that the Spadina subway expansion to York region has been delayed again, and the price tag keeps climbing.

I think that people in the GTA and Hamilton regions are very concerned about the traffic and the transit issues that are going to result during the Pan Am Games. Just this morning around Queen’s Park, near the University of Toronto, there was quite a bit of congestion. I’m just thinking to myself, looking over at the University of Toronto, where part of the games will be taking place, and wondering how we’re going to manage in terms of transit, traffic and even the cyclists. Are we going to have adequate places for all the bicycles to be locked up? I haven’t seen that, but I really hope that’s the case." ],

So we need to make sure we discuss this properly and give it the time it deserves.", "Over the next hour, I’m going to touch on various things changed by this bill, various amendments proposed to this bill and various comments made to this bill.", "As we are now in third reading, this bill has passed through numerous debates in this House and committee. So, today, we’re going to have some of those final comments on this piece of legislation before it becomes law.", "Throughout the course of my entire speech, I’m going to focus on one thing, and that’s road safety. When I say “road safety,” I mean more than just a nice title that was given to Bill 31. I’m going to talk about policies and changes that actually make our roads safer, and policies that currently don’t exist. I’m going to talk about what’s in this bill that actually promotes road safety and what’s seriously needed to be considered to make our roads safer. I’m also going to touch on numerous policies in this bill that have very little to do with road safety and a lot to do with trying to ram through laws.", "Mr. Speaker, as everyone in this House saw a few weeks ago, the Auditor General proved that the safety Ontarians had come to expect on their highways during the winter months has not been there the past five years. When we hear things like that coming from such respected sources, we need to stop and take a look at what’s going on in this province, and not just in the winter months.", "We need to work together. I’ll repeat that again, because I know everybody on the other side is very interested in this: We need to work together and to legislate where we must to keep people safe. Let me say this one more time, and I’m sure I’ll end up saying it again: Safety must be a priority. That’s our responsibility as elected members of this Legislature. If there’s one thing under our control that is unsafe, we have an obligation to fix it. I hope we can keep the Auditor General’s report in mind when we’re discussing Bill 31, because it proves that these words have real consequences.", "When I look at this bill, as I mentioned when I spoke on it before, there’s quite a lot in here that we can get behind and support, and we’re happy to help move it forward. When it comes to laws that will actually protect the people of this province when they’re driving to work or driving home, New Democrats will be supportive.", "It’s no surprise that this is a bill that combines a number of laws and amends a number of laws. It’s going to get passed in one bill instead of several bills. I think this is important to hear: We’re talking about changes to buses, trucks, bicycles, ATVs and the 407, among other things, all in one bill. So naturally, there are some things in here we’re quite supportive of. Some things we disagree with, but overall, some language desperately needed changes—language that wasn’t changed at all during the committee process.", "Let me start with something I believe most people in this House agree on, which is our mission to eliminate distracted driving on our roads. I know a lot of us in here use our BlackBerrys quite often, but cellphone use while driving is something that has come up quite a bit lately and tends to affect the younger generation. Frankly, 25 years ago, we had no idea this would be a concern. Had you come up to most of us in 1995 and said that people using their phones while driving is going to be one of the biggest safety concerns in the province, we would have looked at you like you had two heads. Today it’s a concern, and it’s a concern in a big way.", "I know that in every round of debates on this bill, we’ve gone over the stats time and time again. I know you’re all familiar with them. We all know that the OPP has said a number of times that distracted driving is the number one—think about this. I know you’re all interested in this, but think about this. I think this is key. The OPP has said that distracted driving is the number one killer on our roads, but I think if you asked the people in the province of Ontario what it was, they would probably say drinking and driving, if I’m guessing.", "These are the kind of stats that people of this province also need to be familiar with. It’s terrifying to hear. It’s hard to think that if you just quickly check a message while driving, you’re one of the people creating a distracted driving situation, but that sort of casual use is where the danger comes from. When we hear things that state 30% to 50% of accidents on our roads come from distracted driving, we have to take note, especially when you think about who is most likely to be using the cellphone while they’re driving: the young people of this province.", "For some people, just telling them these stats unfortunately isn’t enough. The urge to check a phone call or to check a text when you’re on a straightaway is sometimes too great. When we have thousands of young people doing this, we know they’re in danger. I can definitely support moving to eliminate this from our roads. In fact, as I understand it, Ontario is one of only three provinces in the country—one of three in the country—which doesn’t have demerit points for distracted driving. It’s clear that other districts have been more proactive when it comes to eliminating distracted driving. I don’t believe Ontario should fall behind.", "Mr. Speaker, I’ve said this before, as well: This needs to work in partnership with an education program. We can’t just jack up fines and assume people will stop doing it. There are kids out there driving on back roads or in areas where police just can’t patrol. Maybe they’re not getting the fines, but they’re still texting. If they know how dangerous it is, how much they’re putting their own lives at risk, then maybe we can start to truly eliminate this from our roads.", "I like these movements to eliminate distracted driving, but I hope this isn’t where the buck ends. As quickly as cellphone technology began to be part of everybody’s lives, we need to move twice as quick to keep people safe in this province. So let’s do this, but keep in mind that the technology is still changing, still evolving, and that we need to keep pace with it.", "I always like to bring up the case of seat belts. Mr. Speaker, you remember seat belts, right? I’m sure some of the people would remember. I know Mr. Bradley would, for sure. When they were first introduced, no one ever wore them, probably including myself. It didn’t feel like a responsibility. Now, if you watch any younger person getting into a car, the first thing they do is buckle up, including my three children. It’s second nature. Of course, this has come with technology that allows your car to sense if you’re not wearing your seat belt, where you get the little light that says, “Buckle up your seat belt.” But I believe that is a product of great education campaigns that came with the seat belts. It was simple: “Seatbelts save lives.” Three words, and we were able to educate a generation and actually save lives.", "The same sort of thing needs to occur when it comes to our cellphones. Right now, people know they shouldn’t text while they drive, but they do it anyways. Our goal here should be to create an Ontario where people get into their cars and feel the same obligation to turn off their phone as they do to put on their seat belts. There are some people who say this may never happen, but really, this happened quite quickly with seat belts. It saved lives and, in my opinion, absolutely needs to be part of our campaign to end distracted driving.", "Of course, I’m not opposed to these increased penalties. We need to make sure distracted driving is taken seriously. I’m just saying that we can’t impose these fines and assume the problem will take care of itself or that we’re done with it. As the technology continues to evolve, the laws of this province need to evolve with it to make sure they properly address the threat.", "In this House, we’ve always encouraged each party to work together, to do what they can to make this province one of the safest places to live in the world. This is a government that has said it wants to work with the people of this province. When this bill was in committee, it was still being handled by my friend the member from Algoma–Manitoulin who I know is passionate about road safety, as well as the PC critic for transportation. Yet as they sat through the days of the clause-by-clause, they saw time and time again their amendments continually getting voted down. In fact, if you read the record, you can see that this government voted down amendments of substance that came from the members opposite. And they weren’t political amendments, Mr. Speaker; most of the time, they were there to clear up language or to help actually improve road safety.", "What’s even worse is that this government used its majority to rule a number of amendments out of order. Again, I’d like to commend the PC critic, who even pointed this out during committee. Just because your government may not agree with amendments doesn’t mean they’re not at least worth talking about.", "This legislation will affect people’s lives. It will govern how safe our roads are. When it comes to something so important, there shouldn’t be anything that is deemed not worthy to even talk about. I hope that in the future, this government takes this advice and lets these amendments at least be debated on the record so that the people of this province can know exactly where their elected representatives stand.", "I’d like to just highlight a few of the amendments that were rejected by the government while this bill was in committee. Reading through them, you will see that they are common-sense amendments—common sense.", "For example, in this province if a pedestrian is standing next to a crosswalk but hasn’t entered the street yet, then the cars don’t technically need to stop. So just to clarify: If a pedestrian walks into the road, then the car is legally obligated to stop; yet if a pedestrian is waiting patiently on the side of the crosswalk, then the vehicle technically does not need to stop. How can you not at least take a look at that? If you were to go around the province and ask people if they feel they need to stop for a pedestrian waiting to cross, they would all say yes. Well, unfortunately, that’s not actually the case when it comes to the law.", "So we offered an amendment to just clear up the law, just to make sure that people were abiding by the law and to make sure that it was clearly written. Well, of course, that amendment was voted down, and I’m still not entirely sure why.", "Is there opposition to stopping at a crosswalks? I can’t figure it out, but that amendment, like the rest, was voted down. Like I mentioned earlier, it was just common sense and what we were trying to do, quite frankly, was to make the bill stronger. I believe that’s our role. I don’t think anyone in this would have tried to slow the bill down because it includes a line that protects people waiting to cross the street.", "This bill talks about road safety, which is just as important for people using motor vehicles as it is for people on bicycles. We wanted to tighten up the language around the one-metre passing rule for cyclists. Let me say that I’m happy that was included, but we wished that it was stronger so it could be even more effective. When we saw that included, we got together and figured out what the best language—now, think about this—would be to fully protect our cyclists on our roads. We have lots of cyclists right across the province of Ontario, but particularly in Toronto and particularly around Queen’s Park. This isn’t something that should come as a surprise to anyone.", "All across the province, people are turning to bicycles. It’s incredible. They’re better for the environment, they’re healthy and they’re more cost-effective. Come down to my riding in the summer; I’m inviting all my fellow Liberals and PCs who are here. You can see people travelling up and down the Niagara Parkway. What happens is that folks use public transit because they can bring their bikes on the GO train, and they come down to the parkway.", "You’ll like this, Mr. Speaker. I know it’s late in the day. It’s been an interesting day, but you’re going to like this. The parkway is a beautiful drive. On one end you have Fort George in Niagara-on-the-Lake and on the other you have historic Fort Erie in the town of Fort Erie. Both are open to the public and are incredible heritage sites that showcase the history of the region.", "Think about this: In between that bike ride, there are dozens of attractions. You can park your bike and explore the gorge. It’s absolutely incredible.", "How many have been to the Floral Clock before? Anybody here?", "Interjection." ],

He’s really the unofficial mayor of Chippawa, and I promise you that he’s great company.", "The parkway itself has been perfectly preserved. It’s absolutely beautiful, and you can do the entire thing on your bike from one end to the other. It’s a great option for recreational biking and a great way to stay healthy. We should be encouraging people like that, people who want to make healthy choices, environmentally conscious choices.", "How do we encourage them? Well, we make 100% sure it’s as safe as it can possibly be. That’s what New Democrats wanted to do. We wanted to make sure that the one-metre rule had strict language. Again, I’m going to talk about language. Right now it just says that vehicles must use a one-metre passing rule—I’ll quote what it says, and I know my good friend from St. Catharines will understand this—“as may be practicable.” Those are soft words when it comes to contractual language. In bargaining, we call them weasel words. I don’t know if I can say that here, but I’m going to say it anyway. They’re soft words. What we’re saying is, we should be putting in words that are going to make sure we protect the lives of those who choose to ride their bikes. I don’t believe that should be an issue of convenience. So we tried to just tighten up the language and make sure cyclists were safe. I don’t think anybody in here wouldn’t want that. But we couldn’t get the amendment done. That amendment was voted down by this government as well. Perhaps one day they will explain to cyclists why they felt that tougher language wasn’t necessary.", "Mr. Speaker, let me talk about yet another amendment. The Ontario coroner said time and time again that mandatory side guards for trucks would save the lives of cyclists and pedestrians and ensure their safety. These reports were in 2010, 2012 and 2013, calling for side guards. This is an office that can offer some expertise to help strengthen the bill, to really make sure it does everything it can to make Ontario roads safer. The government can say, “Hey, look, we consulted with the office. They added this rule in there because they can prove it increases safety.” This isn’t something revolutionary here in Ontario. These mandatory truck side guards are already in place in Europe, where they do a lot of cycling, and in Japan. Along the lines of the reports and the examples set elsewhere in the world, we introduced what I thought was fair and reasonable, that would be easy for all parties to agree to: an amendment for mandatory guards. What happened? Once again, it was defeated by the government. It didn’t make a lot of sense.", "Mr. Speaker, we also proposed some common sense amendments when it came to motorists who hit pedestrians at crosswalks. Listen to this. This is interesting. I actually met with some people on this. I was absolutely surprised at this one. Right now, when a pedestrian is hit at a crosswalk, the motorist faces a general fine of $500. That’s the fine for failing to yield to a pedestrian at a crosswalk. If you don’t stop for somebody, and they get seriously injured or die—this is the part I never knew—that’s a $500 fine. Think about that. I was absolutely shocked. It was actually a group of motorcyclists, in the hundreds, who told me about this. I couldn’t believe it. We tried to put language in this bill that would address this issue with a stiffer punishment. I think that’s reasonable to expect. Why would anybody not do that? Again, the theme of this is, we were trying to work with the government and say, “Listen, let’s make the bill stronger. Let’s make sure it’s safer for everybody. It doesn’t matter if you’re a cyclist or you’re in a car or a pedestrian. It doesn’t matter.” Guess what happened on that amendment? Does anybody know? Go ahead." ],

When you’re on your phone and driving, you’re basically impaired. There’s no way you can fully take in what is happening around you. I think we all agree with that.", "When you look at how someone might get hit at a crosswalk, and you do the math, you can see that distracted driving may be a big part of it. We want to make sure that the fines for distracted driving are appropriate, but also the fines for the outcome. In my mind, this amendment goes hand in hand with what this government was trying to do. Instead of considering it, the amendment was, of course, voted down. So it seems they’re serious about taking on distracted driving but unwilling to follow up.", "Mr. Speaker, I hope I’m making a point here. The point that I’d like to make is, these amendments that were proposed weren’t designed—by the way, you should listen to this, Minister—to destroy the bill or reverse the hard work that was done by the ministry staff to put it together. We saw some areas where this bill was lacking or perhaps just wasn’t strong enough. Instead of showing any interest in working with us, this government voted down every amendment that they themselves didn’t propose. So if people fall victim to some of the missing regulations, that will be on this government. They showed no willingness—and I’m surprised at that, quite frankly—to work with the other members in this House and amend the bill.", "Obviously, we support making our roads safer. A number of things in the bill make sense, and we can agree with them. But there’s a ton of stuff in here. Some of that content is good, some of that content is not so good, and some of the content is missing entirely.", "As I continue to talk about this bill and explain some of the major shortcomings, I hope the members in this House will keep this in mind.", "Mr. Speaker, take a look at the issue around roundabouts. Again, I believe the transportation critic has done quite a job proving that there is a lack of clear legislation when it comes to roundabouts in this province. This has left cities and regions putting up their own rules for roundabouts which contradict one another.", "When I spoke about this issue before, I mentioned that I have a number of roundabouts in my riding, Niagara Falls, including one of the first in the province of Ontario: in Queenston, right along the parkway I just talked about where you can go to cycle. When it comes to making sure we have clear and uniform rules about roundabouts, it really does affect people in my riding.", "The Premier talks about being non-partisan, working with everyone in Ontario. Mr. Speaker, I don’t believe that making clear regulations about roundabouts in this province is a political issue. I do believe that making sure the people of this province have a clear understanding of what is and is not allowed at a roundabout is a clear safety issue.", "Yet this government seems to put politics ahead of safety. In this bill, they had a chance to make sure the roundabouts in this province were safe and properly regulated, yet once again, this bill will pass without any of that. As this House discusses other ways to make sure roundabouts are safe, these laws will quickly come into effect.", "Once again, I don’t believe this change was going to be anything big or stop this bill. Really, it was quite simple. All it was going to do was make a few tweaks to the Highway Traffic Act and it was solved. Once again, this bill does nothing for that.", "I haven’t even touched on the regulations that were completely left out of the bill. Just take a look at the associations that were calling for pre-warning yellow lights on school buses. For those of you who don’t know, when a bus is slowing down, right now it has to turn on red flashing lights. Cars near buses are not legally required to stop until the bus itself has come to a complete stop. The bus drivers have to use these lights to signal to other drivers that they’re about to stop. So what ends up happening here is that the bus turns on those red flashing lights but keeps driving. I think most people would think it would stop, but no, it keeps driving. Cars see these red lights and they stop, only to look at the bus driver in confusion as the bus continues right by them.", "It may seem like a small change, but we’re the only district, other than Saskatchewan, that does not make regulations which require pre-stop warning lights, which flash yellow, then red lights to go on, to be used when a bus comes to a complete stop. A small change but a safety change, one that’s important.", "When you really think about this, you can see how important this is. What cargo—I’d like people to listen to this—in this province is more important than what our school buses are carrying? Our kids, our grandkids, our future. They should all be safe on the roadways in this province as they travel to and from school. So if we have confusion over when to stop when a bus is near, you should know who’s in most danger. That’s right. It’s our kids and our grandkids.", "It’s not like I’m pulling this topic out of thin air. This is an issue that associations have been raising for a long time. I know my colleague has spoken about this in the House. It’s a simple fix. No one can keep our children that much safer. Honestly, it’s hard to know why it wasn’t included in this bill but, in the end, it’s not there.", "This bill does change some of the language around utility task vehicles or UTVs, as they’re called, but not quite as much as we’d like. I know that a number of the members who have constituents in their ridings who frequently use UTVs have been calling for the same rights of passage as ATVs in Ontario. What more input could this government be looking for? UTV and ATV groups have been calling for this, and constituents. The changes are a good admission that there need to be some updates.", "The consultation says more needs to be done, and it isn’t being done. This wouldn’t cost this government a penny. Think about this: not a penny, and yet it would make sure that people who go to change the oil in their UTVs aren’t committing a crime. It’s a simple fix that could be included in this bill, and I have no idea why it wasn’t.", "This bill does touch on medical suspensions when it comes to licence renewal—this is an important issue—but I’m not sure if it does exactly what is necessary in this province. I’m happy to see that this has been cleared up a little bit, but let me tell you, this needs to be a lot clearer.", "The bill clears up what is and what is not mandatory for a doctor to send to the MTO when it comes to medical review. It also allows the patients to keep their old licence to be used as ID if their licence is suspended. Let me just say that I do applaud the government on that. With all the changes made to ServiceOntario—what does and doesn’t qualify for ID these days—seniors in my riding are having a tough time keeping up. We need to make sure that we’re not stripping people of ID and leaving them with no reasonable way to prove who they are so they can get health care.", "The problem is there’s no recognition here with some of the major problems around medical review. I’ve heard it in my constituency office. A driver has his licence suspended for medical reasons. Okay, that’s fair. He has a heart attack, he’s fainting, he has all those types of things that may happen. They go to their doctor and the doctor now says that they’re medically cleared to go back to work or to drive. So he’s driving a cab, he’s driving a transport truck or he has to drive to get to work. For most people, this is good news when their doctor who treats them in their daily lives says that they’re healthy and they can expect to go back to work. In this case, they’ve done their work: They had to prove that they were medically able to drive again. They didn’t ask the government to prove it. They went out of their way and they did the work themselves. The problem is that you need to send that to the MTO for the MTO to approve it. The labour minister should listen to this. I know he’s here and I appreciate that he’s here. So I’m going to read this again and hopefully he can hear it: The problem is that you need to go to the MTO for the MTO to approve it.", "So now I’m ready to go back to work, I’ve been cleared to go back to work, and I’ve got to get the authorization from the MTO. Of course, this makes a little sense, but it’s the time they have to wait that is a major problem, because now I’m cleared to go back to work—if you’re on benefits and you’re cleared to go back to work, you can no longer collect benefits. If you’re in a union shop and you have a union rep, then maybe he can go to the company and talk to them; if you’re in a non-union shop, they may end up getting rid of you.", "So in Niagara Falls one of my constituent assistants was dealing with these cases over and over again, Minister. The problem was that these people were professional truck drivers, or needed their cars to go to work, and their bosses were doing everything they could—", "Interjections." ],

If they need a product shipped, they need someone to fill the job. It isn’t fair for a person to lose their job if they’ve done everything right. If people have to wait—to the labour minister, because I think they think it’s funny over there, but it’s not—up to three months from start to finish, that’s a severe impact on their ability to hold onto their job and their employment. This province should never get in the way of someone who wants to work, yet that’s exactly what is happening. We were doing everything we could, but there is simply no way to speed up the process.", "We could end up with people who are medically fit to drive, employers who want to give them shifts, and yet they’re still waiting to go back to work. This is a problem that needs to be addressed. These wait times are putting people’s employment at risk. So in this bill there were some changes to that process, but they weren’t good enough. They need to address the concerns at the ministry level, either through regulations or addressing it in this bill. Until it’s addressed, we’re going to keep having people being put in stressful situations and losing their jobs.", "I’m certainly not trying to pick on the labour minister, but if he’d like to talk to me after this, I’d like to talk to him. We’re having lots and lots of issues with this in Niagara with the MTO, and I can relate. I’ve been off work a few times and have wanted to go back. It’s an issue, and I’d appreciate talking to him.", "We want to talk about making our roads safer. What would be better than removing cars from the highway? By offering proper public transit, people stop taking their cars places. Look at Niagara. If we had a GO train that we’ve been calling for, that the community has been calling for, that we’re providing a business case for, more people would take the train. They would get out of the gridlock, take public transit and be able to use their phones on the trains all they want. It’s a lot safer than driving. It can happen tomorrow. The people have been calling for it. That’s one way to make roads safer: Take some of the cars off the roads. It makes a little bit of sense.", "I’d like to touch on one aspect of this bill which really highlights the concern we have with all of our amendments being voted down by the Liberal government, and that is the privatization of the vehicle inspection centres. It’s another issue. I don’t understand why this government believes this would make Ontario roads safer. Look no further than the Auditor General’s report which showed that privatizing the winter highway maintenance put people’s lives at risk. With that report coming out, we can draw quite a few things between that and this plan.", "When the government started to privatize the winter road maintenance, they were telling the people of this province that it would be cheaper, that they’d be able to clear our roads quicker, and it would keep it safe. The Auditor General proved that under their privatized plan, our roads became more dangerous. There was a major problem with oversight and accountability. In the Auditor General’s report, we found out that these companies that were given these contracts through RFPs were supposed to report on their own work—now think about this—essentially, telling the government whether they thought they were doing a good job. I wish I could have done that when I worked at General Motors, but I wasn’t allowed to do that. You’ll never guess what happened, Mr. Speaker.", "Interjections." ],

So instead of the problem being fixed right away, the people of this province had to wait five years to get proof of what they had been saying all along: that the privatization failed, that our roads were unsafe and people were at risk.", "We as New Democrats take a look at Bill 31 and notice provisions which outsource the vehicle inspection centres. We know what happens when these things get outsourced with absolutely no oversight. There are a number of problems with this plan outlined in the legislation. In fact, I think one of my colleagues put it well when he basically called it “Drive Clean on steroids.”", "For those of you who may not know, the vehicle inspection centres are currently overseen by the province, and should stay that way, by the way. They certify regular passenger vehicles and commercial vehicles. That means the buses and the trucks that fill our highways and our roads all need to be certified by a vehicle inspection centre. We’ve all seen them along the highway; we’ve seen the trucks going in.", "Consider how many of our constituents either use a passenger vehicle or drive near a truck. This should be extremely important. If you want to ensure our roads are safe for the province of Ontario, then we need to ensure that the certifications are done properly and with accountability. We need to make sure that the procedures and regulations are being followed and that there are stiff fines when centres do not properly inspect the vehicles.", "Frankly, this is people’s lives we’re talking about here. This shouldn’t be a debate. When it comes to people’s lives, their safety needs to be number one, job one. In order to ensure that safety is number one, this government needs to be able to see how those centres are operating and what’s going on inside. You shouldn’t be giving them to a third party.", "It’s so easy for outsourced companies to skip a regulation here and there, or ignore something they don’t feel is necessary. When the public doesn’t know about it, then even more regulations start getting skipped. It’s something we’ve seen happen time and time again.", "Mr. Speaker, I know an hour is a long time to listen to me, and I can appreciate that, but I’m going to continue going.", "I’m sure you agree with this and I’m sure that the members opposite agree with this, so what is the concern? We’re reading in this bill that the administrator of the new vehicle inspection centre system is not an agent of the crown. What are the implications of that? Essentially, that means that the oversight that government agencies are subject to, like the Ombudsman or the Auditor General, will have no power over these service providers, again.", "Let’s look at the state of transportation in the province here. Just a few weeks ago, the Auditor General did some digging and was able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the highways of this province were not as safe as we had been used to and that snow was not being removed from them properly. We know that. The report showed that.", "So the Auditor General writes this report and proves that the current system isn’t working. Once it brought it to light, we hoped changes will come. Considering how badly monitoring was from these contractors, we would sincerely hope that change is coming.", "The Minister of Transportation has said that after 60 days he would like the Auditor General to come back and re-evaluate, so we will be watching closely that process. The problem I have with the 60-day time limit: I don’t think there’s going to be any snow on our roads. I may be wrong; we’ve had some weird weather, but I don’t think we’re going to have any snow in July and August. I might be wrong. My point is, these are concerns we would never had known about had it not been for the Auditor General’s oversight.

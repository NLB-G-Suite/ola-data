This legislation comes out of listening to Ontarians over the past few years. We listened to their concerns but we also listened to their hopes for a better life within today’s workforce. We listened when we initiated the most comprehensive review of Ontario’s labour laws, and we did that through the Changing Workplaces Review. Many of the proposals that are contained in the legislation respond to what we heard during that process. Many of our proposals respond to what we see all around us: a world where the very nature of work is changing.", "Everybody in the House, Speaker, and in homes across the province, knows that more of our fellow Ontarians are working in part-time jobs. They’re in casual jobs, contract jobs, and they’re working in minimum wage jobs and just trying to get by. This is despite the fact that Ontario has a very strong and a very growing economy. In fact, over the past three years, Ontario’s economy has outperformed all G7 countries in terms of real GDP growth. That’s something we should be proud of, Speaker. What we see is that our exports have increased and business investments in the province have increased. Ontario’s unemployment rate has been below the national average, each and every month, for the past 24 months. But that’s why we can’t forget, Speaker, those who have every right and reasonable expectation to join us in this prosperity: those workers and their families.", "We did very, very extensive consultation on this bill before we brought it forward. We really listened to Ontarians. We listened to employers, we listened to employees, we listened to people who were advocating for those who find themselves often living in poverty, we listened to small business and we listened to the chamber of commerce. We’ve listened, as well, after the introduction and during the committee hearings and the meetings that have taken place on this bill. Those conversations are reflected in the amendments we have added to our bill and, in my opinion, have made the bill even stronger and more reflective of the wishes of Ontarians.", "The plan for fair workplaces and better jobs, Speaker, addresses a very wide range of issues. I just want to review some of the key elements of that plan for the House. First, raising the minimum wage: I think all members of the House would agree", "Interjections." ],

Right now, 10% of workers in our province earn the minimum wage of $11.60. This is something that surprised me. I didn’t know this.

It surprised me and I thought I knew the province well, but about a third of workers in the province of Ontario make less than $15 an hour.", "When we think about the minimum wage in the past, it was often referred to as a student wage, a trainee wage or somebody that was new to the workforce. But what we’re finding is that half of those people that are making less than $15 an hour are between the ages of 25 and 64. I don’t have to tell anybody in this House that those are the years you’re trying to raise a family. That’s the years that, if you’re going to have kids, would be the years when you would be having those children and all the expenses that are associated with that. The majority of people who earn less than $15 an hour are women. So that’s 30% of Ontarians earning less than $15 an hour, and that is millions of people in this province. Many of them support a family on a wage that just doesn’t go far enough. They’re raising children. They’re trying to save for their education. They’re wondering if they will be able to pay the bills each and every month, let alone ever being able to get ahead or perhaps even dream of owning a home.", "So the movement that I’m asking the House to make today in the minimum wage is going to make a world of difference for millions of people in this province. The increases we’ve proposed in our legislation respond to the human need that we see around us on our streets each and every day. The plan is to raise the minimum wage to $14 an hour on January 1, and $15 an hour on January 1, 2019.", "In another key element of our plan, what we’d like to do also is to make sure that those people that are working part-time are treated equitably, are treated fairly, and with dignity and respect, and they’re paid the same amount of money as somebody that is doing substantially the same job on a full-time basis. The reality is—and I don’t have to tell anybody in this House; they see it in their own communities on a daily basis—more and more companies are choosing to hire part-time or temporary employees. What that’s done in many cases—not all cases, but in many cases—is create a very unfair workplace in which some are paid less than others simply for doing the same job. I think most people in the province would agree that paying people the same rate of pay for substantially the same work is just plain common courtesy and fairness. That’s why we’ve also proposed that casual, part-time and seasonal employees who do substantially the same work as full-timers—the work need not be identical—are paid the same rate of pay.", "We’re also proposing to increase minimum vacation entitlements. What we’re saying is that after five years with a company, an employee should be entitled to at least three weeks of paid vacation each year. Ontario is behind other provinces in guaranteeing better vacation rights to their employees. So it’s time to do what’s right.", "It’s going to establish fairer rules for scheduling, rules that give greater certainty to workers while maintaining that flexibility we know is so important for employers. Workers deserve a degree of certainty, Speaker, especially when you need these shifts in order to make it through the month.", "Our bill is going to ensure that more workers, not just those at large companies, have the right to take up to 10 days of personal emergency leave each year and, for the very first time in the province of Ontario, have two of those days paid. We all need to be able to respond to the realities of life—it could be an illness in the family; it could be the death of a loved one—but what we shouldn’t be thinking about at that time is the prospect of perhaps losing our job just for taking that time off.", "I think we’re responding with the necessary compassion to those who experience or are threatened with domestic or sexual violence by providing up to 10 individual days of leave, up to 15 weeks of leave without fear of job loss, and the first five days of those leaves in each calendar year should be paid.", "Our plan for fair workplaces and better jobs rewards good employers. The vast majority of employers in the province of Ontario are excellent organizations that provide the best for their employees. It helps ensure that responsible, law-abiding employers don’t face unfair competition from businesses that skirt the law and take advantage of workers. Above all, it focuses squarely on making certain that workers are treated fairly.", "Speaker, our economy is a good place to be right now. We’re confident in Ontario’s ability to do even better in the future." ],

Yet we’re given 10 minutes to debate this in third reading.", "The minister’s own words—and this is what just galls us. First of all, the Liberals are masters of two things: They are masters of shutting down democracy, which is what they are doing in this House, and they are the masters of politics and political spin. The Premier said the other day in question period that they didn’t go ahead with the changes to the minimum wage until June 1, in this piece of legislation, because the economy wasn’t strong enough. Well, now we hear the minister this morning saying that for the past three years we’ve had a great economy in Ontario, that for the past 24 months unemployment has been below the national average and that Ontario has been leading the G7 in economic growth for the past three years. He’s been crowing like that for the past three years, yet in February of this year, he defended the current practice of tying the minimum wage to the rate of inflation; as did the Premier. I don’t have an hour—I have got 10 minutes—but I could give you an hour of quotes from this minister and that Premier defending the current practice of tying the minimum wage to the rate of inflation.", "So what changed? What changed? Well, you see, it’s about the high-priced pollsters that the Liberals use. They went out and asked them, “What do we need? We have got the least popular Premier in the history, perhaps, of politics in general, let alone Ontario politics.” But certainly in Ontario politics, no Premier has ever been lower in the polls. They said, “How can we pull a rabbit out of the hat? What can we do—something that is right off the wall, that we’ve never talked about before, that in fact we’ve spoken against in the Liberal Party. What can we do to salvage 2018?”", "And those deep-thinking, highly paid pollsters came back to her and said, “You know what? There are no guarantees in life, but we have to do something really categorically different, something that nobody is going to expect. The NDP have been talking about this for a long time and we’ve always told them, ‘Sit down. Be quiet. We’re not going to do it.’” So they said, “What are we going to do? There is nothing we can do to make the Premier more popular. What can we do to get those people to somehow come around to us one more time?” They came back and they said, “You know, it’s a long shot—it’s a long shot—but we do believe that if we raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, that could be something positive for us. It’s not a good thing for the province of Ontario. It’s not a good thing for the economy. It’s not a good thing for employers. It’s not a good thing for small business. But we think it will be popular—we think it will be popular—and let’s do it really quick so we get it over with.”", "They’re hoping, Speaker, that the change that takes place on January 1 is immediately, essentially, a $2.60 raise from what it was January 1, 2017—$2.60, just like that. You see, before all of the negative effects can be fully absorbed, the people will be going to the polls, and they’re hoping that none of the problems that are going to arise as a result of this will manifest themselves just yet. These are the Liberals now: “We will be able to fool the people. We’ll be able to hornswoggle the voter one more time.” One more time—that is what their hope is in Bill 148.", "For two years, they’ve been doing what they call the Changing Workplaces Review—for two years—but not only was it not part of the Changing Workplaces Review; it was actually verboten—it was verboten.", "Interjections." ],

Well, I can tell you, Speaker, that this bill, other than increasing the minimum wage, which really just brings you back to living in the late 1970s in terms of costs and what your dollar will buy, doesn’t do a heck of a lot for people who are in precarious jobs.

The Liberal government voted down 36 amendments that the NDP brought forward to committee—amendments that would have gone a long way to fixing precarious work for workers in this province, things like card-check certification. The government introduced it for a couple of more sectors, so now there are four sectors of workers in the province that have card-check, but they’re discriminating against all the other sectors so that it makes it more difficult for workers to join a union.

We’ve seen long strikes over the last two years in the province of Ontario. We’ve seen people on the picket line—CarePartners, for example, for 10 months—and the government continues to allow replacement workers to be brought in, causing a lengthy strike, where in many cases in the past when we didn’t have replacement workers, strikes would be over in just a day or two.", "I think the government could have gone a lot farther. I don’t know why they didn’t, and I don’t know why they are rushing through this bill here today in 30 minutes.", "I think it’s important to remember that there are close to three or four million people in this province who are working for minimum wage with no benefits and no pensions. If we really wanted to improve the lives of these people, then we should have had a better look at all of the amendments that the NDP introduced over the second reading and the third reading, and we should have been listening more intently to those people who made presentations to us. There were over 1,500 presentations made to the committee, to the public hearings. I think the Liberal government should have listened more intently.", "I know that, as New Democrats, we would have introduced far better legislation, seeing that we had these pieces of these acts opened—and not for the last 20 years." ],

  "text" : [ "Speaker, thank you very much. I appreciate the introduction, and I appreciate the opportunity to speak to this motion this morning.", "I find it extraordinary that we’re dealing with a time allocation motion on this bill. Speaker, I know you won’t be surprised. Frankly, there’s a lot in this bill that still needs to be debated, and my hope is that in a thoroughgoing debate, there will be an opportunity for all in this Legislature to think about the amendments that have to be made to the bill to deal with its underlying faults and problems. So I don’t understand why on earth the government is moving a time allocation motion on this. As I understand it, the debate has been productive. It hasn’t been something that people have been drawing out; people are getting at the heart of a very substantial matter.", "Just to go into some of the things that I believe still remain to be addressed, should be addressed in debate and, frankly, will not be properly addressed if there is time allocation: Off the top, this bill just seems to have an awful lot of holes in it, an awful lot of areas that have not been properly addressed. There are real questions about what the rules will be governing where stores will be set up. That’s not addressed in this bill. How many stores will big cities like Toronto, Mississauga, Hamilton and Ottawa get? That’s not addressed in this bill, and no understanding of how that formula will be determined. We don’t know how big these stores will be, how cannabis will be priced or how cannabis will be taxed. These are very substantial questions.", "In my community, I would say that people overwhelmingly support the legalization, but the question of where the retail outlets will be is a very big issue. The lack of detail, the lack of discussion, is a real question here.", "We in the NDP support the legalization of recreational cannabis and we support the LCBO role: the former, the legalization, because too many people had their lives damaged through charges on an issue that really belongs more to the realm of social policy than to the realm of criminal law. As to the support for the LCBO model of retailing, we know that the LCBO is a well-regarded and responsible retailer. We know that having a set-up that allows retailing without the profit motive driving policy is really important. Cannabis is a substantial substance; it can have serious effects. With all of that, it is a popular substance, and if you’re going to retail it, then you need it to be retailed by an organization, a corporation, that understands all of the social factors that are involved.", "We’ve seen a list of communities that are going to be the hosts to Ontario Cannabis Retail Corp. stores. There are about 40 stores that are planned for a province of 14 million people. It doesn’t seem to make a lot of sense. If we’re going to deal with the whole question of the black market, of criminal involvement in the sale of cannabis, then you have to ask who is actually thinking this strategy through, because this doesn’t look like a comprehensive strategy to move Ontario away from this black market.", "On top of all that, although this government has been talking about where it’s going to put retail outlets, as far as we can tell, there’s been no consultation with the affected municipalities and, frankly, there should have been. As I’ll hopefully be able to get to further on in this speech, the local municipalities will be involved in carrying the cost of enforcement. If they’re going to be carrying substantial costs, they need to be part of the discussion as to exactly what is going to be in their communities.", "This bill has many, many loose ends and it seems clear that it’s going to be up to a new government to sort those out. I think it would be to the government’s advantage—to Ontario’s advantage, more importantly—to not stop debate on this bill, to not time-allocate it, but to actually let the debate run its course and let there be a proper consultation and a proper debate on exactly what should be in the bill.", "We’ve seen this with other bills. Right now, I’m the Chair of the social policy committee. We’re dealing with time allocation on Bill 166. Frankly, the public has wanted to get in to speak on this, but the notice period has been extraordinarily short. There’s a lot of frustration.", "I want to touch on a few things that are missing in this bill. I’m happy to say our critic, the member for Essex, has done a very thorough job in his leadoff speech going through all of this. But I want to reiterate some of the things that should be addressed and that probably won’t in the course of this curtailed schedule of debate on the bill.", "First of all, this framework is still a work in progress. Now, some of this is understandable. We’re still waiting to see exactly what the federal government will put forward. We have Bill C-45. It’s not yet law; it’s still being amended. Some of the things that are unaddressed: for example, the original version of C-45 did not legalize edible cannabis products, and so Bill 174 doesn’t seem to accommodate them either. But now the federal government says that they will amend C-45 to allow for edibles within a year of C-45 coming into force.", "This is a problematic area. There are a lot of people who are going to have difficulty with second-hand smoke from cannabis users. This will become an issue in multi-unit buildings. In a previous life, I was a property manager in a housing co-op, and the conflict between people in smoking and non-smoking units that were adjacent to each other was profound. It’s bad enough that people are dealing with cigarette smoke. If they are also having to deal with the psychoactive impact of cannabis coming through their walls, there’s going to be an awful lot more conflict. I don’t know why the federal government didn’t address edibles early on, because that’s going to be one of the ways that you deal with the second-hand smoke problem. Clearly, we aren’t dealing with it in this bill.", "The bill, strangely, keeps one foot firmly in the prohibition era in its approach to what will soon be a legal product. There’s going to be confusion amongst consumers between this legalization of cannabis, on the one hand, and on the other, unprecedented new powers for police that are more severe than what exists for alcohol or cigarettes. Speaker, we’re facing a situation where people understand these products to be legalized, but at the same time facing what could be heavy-handed enforcement and some unintended consequences.", "The enforcement and the penalties in this bill are focused on unauthorized dispensaries. The maximum penalties facing dispensaries are vastly higher than those for illegal alcohol sales under the Liquor Licence Act. The landlord liability provisions seem unprecedented. I think we do need regulations; I don’t think there’s any question. But this actually raises the issue: Why is this so much more severe than for liquor and tobacco? I think that’s an item that needs to be debated at greater length, and this time allocation motion will choke off that debate.", "The maximum penalties for selling non-medical cannabis to minors are actually lower than the maximum penalties for selling alcohol or cigarettes to minors. That seems to be inconsistent with a much tougher approach to retailers and dispensaries. In fact, Bill 174 seems much more focused on enforcing the government’s retail monopoly than it is with protecting minors. That’s a substantial issue. That’s an issue that deserves greater debate in this chamber, not a stifling of debate, which is what the government has proposed and what we’re debating this morning.", "There are broadly written provisions that could potentially capture innocuous activities and subject them to steep fines. For example, if an adult is found driving with a half-used package of cannabis for later use in their pocket, even if it’s medical cannabis, they could face a fine of up to $100,000 as an illegal transporter, and everyone in the car can be searched by the police without a warrant. I can see obvious problems with this.", "Again, it makes sense to allow debate to continue on this; hopefully, in the course of that debate, solutions being put forward and problems with the bill being addressed. Thinking that time allocation stifling debate is actually going to improve the quality of decision-making here is not a defensible position, has been shown historically to be wrong, but that’s where the Liberal government is going.", "The use of non-medical cannabis is pretty much limited to private residences, which exposes cannabis users who lack access to private residences to disproportionate policing and prosecution. Interestingly, I was approached by a person in my riding who works in a medical cannabis dispensary. This was one of the areas that they were most concerned about, because there are many people who don’t have access to a private space where they could consume cannabis.", "If we set the law up so there’s no way to function within it without breaking it, we’re going to have people who are charged, people who are entrapped, to no useful social purpose—no useful social purpose. Now, the government says it will explore the feasibility and implications of introducing designated establishments where recreational cannabis could be consumed, but there’s no provision for that in this bill.", "Speaker, the bill is half-baked. Ending the debate now means the oven is turned off. It’s a mistake." ],

I was very, very concerned about that, because now it’s going to be pointed out—because as I read it in the act as it is right now, it’s going to be decided with regulations. But the point is, what are those regulations going to say? When are they going to introduce it? How are they going to get that information out? How are drivers in Ontario going to know? So I have some real, serious concerns about that.", "The Attorney General introduced Bill 174 to legalize cannabis.

I want to take a moment to talk a bit about what we’ve heard on time allocation from members of the opposition. But before I do, I think it’s important that we point out that there is a mandated timeline that is attached to this bill, and that timeline is not of our choosing. The federal government, as you know, has taken steps to legalize cannabis by July 2018. As we know, that date is just around the corner. That said, Speaker, even though the federal legislation was only introduced a few months ago, our government, knowing it was coming, has been working on these priorities for over a year.", "The legislation that we are proposing and the approach it supports were developed through months of research and policy development across a dozen ministries, led by a dedicated legalization of cannabis secretariat. For many months, our government has been working closely with our partners at the federal and provincial level to manage this complex transition. We have been engaged with states such as Colorado in the US and other jurisdictions that have already legalized recreational cannabis at the state level, so we could benefit from the lessons that they have learned and the best practices when they went through this legislation.", "Over the summer, we held consultations with stakeholders from across industries and launched an online survey for people across the province.", "There is a lot of uncertainty about what’s moving forward with the federal government. For instance, I agree with the member from Toronto–Danforth on the whole issue around edibles, but, let’s be clear: The federal government isn’t going to address that issue until after the July 1 implementation. Therefore, it ill behooves us to delay our legislation until they get that right; it’s happening down the road.", "We’ve also heard a lot from members about a lack of debate on the sections. But the sections, like in schedule 3 that cover the vaping issue; these were all debated almost two years ago and we’re simply taking that debate and putting it in the context of a uniform approach under the Smoke-Free Ontario Act.", "We also had prior extensive debate on the transportation sections in a previous bill—", "Interjection." ],

We have been saying since the beginning that to meet the deadline which is imposed by the federal government this legislation must pass before the House rises this session. There are less than four weeks left for us to do this, and we have other legislation which is also extraordinarily important to the people of Ontario.", "This legislation does include critical safety measures to protect Ontario communities by strengthening enforcement measures, giving stronger tools for police to shut down dispensaries, tougher penalties to tackle impaired driving to keep our roads safe, and strict rules on where cannabis can be used to keep our communities and our youth healthy.", "Moreover, we are committed to opening 40 dedicated cannabis retailers by July 2018, but until this legislation is passed we cannot start the necessary preparations to open these stores. Also bear in mind that once these stores open there will still be opportunities for people to legally purchase through the mail system online and have it mailed as it currently is, particularly with medical marijuana, and no doubt with recreational marijuana as well.", "Delaying this legislation, as the opposition seems to desire, will put the people of Ontario at risk. It will make the timelines to actually do the regulations, the consultations and the postings and get these stores open—it puts that process at risk. It’s essential that we do everything that we can to meet the timelines that were imposed on us by the federal government so we can protect the health and safety of all the people of Ontario. Our government has worked diligently over this past year to propose and introduce a plan that will keep Ontarians safe and meet the federal timelines.", "I implore the Legislature and the opposition to do the right thing: Support the passage of this legislation so that the necessary protections for the people of Ontario can be put in place as quickly as possible." ],

He talked about a big change of the government of the day—obviously, it’s his job to promote his government’s policies: Because they shut down the coal-fired generating plant—I believe it was called the Lakeview coal generating plant—he can now see the lake. That made a big difference in his community, and I can appreciate that. I learned something. That’s a government policy. It was before my time here, but I believe that all the parties were in favour of cancelling coal. Certainly ours was, and obviously the Liberals were.", "He commented that not only did it make a big change in his local neighbourhood, but the cancellation of coal also made a big change in the air we breathe in Ontario. Later on, I’m going to come back on that: that since Hydro One is now buying coal-fired power generation stations in other countries, they obviously don’t really care about the air in other countries. We’re going to come back to that in a few minutes. But for the Lakeview Generating Station, that’s now a beautiful recreational area—more power to him.", "I’m going to follow his example. I’m going to talk about, since I have been here, a Liberal policy that’s made a huge difference in my riding of Timiskaming–Cochrane and in many other ridings across the province, but certainly in mine. That was the day that the Liberal government decided to privatize the Ontario Northland Transportation Commission, and their first step was that they cancelled our passenger train, the Northlander. That was the first thing they decided to do.", "What I found interesting in the minister’s speech, and I have it written down here somewhere—it will take me a while to find it; I’ve got two pages of notes. In his speech, he said that the Liberals were very committed to building infrastructure—we’ll get back to that later, to the numbers—but he was wondering about the Tories. He said something like, “What won’t they build and what will they cut?” That’s a legitimate question. But there’s a second part to that question: We already know what the Liberals cut. They didn’t have any trouble deciding to cut infrastructure in northern Ontario. They had no trouble at all—none.", "At that point, they said—and I remember it so distinctly—that we were going to have enhanced bus service in the north.

Because they made an election promise four years ago to balance their budget. Again, anyone in business knows that you’re better off to keep your profit-, income-generating assets, and certainly ones you need to control to ensure that you actually have access to these assets. You’re better off keeping those assets and actually recognizing that you’re going to have a deficit than you are selling things that you need to keep just to artificially balance your books.

We also believe that that part of the bill should be pulled out and should be debated separately. During the technical briefing, we spent quite a bit of time on pension benefits. Before I go much further, I would like to thank the staff at the various ministries, because they stayed there as long as we wanted and they tried to answer our questions. But in the pension benefits part they couldn’t, because the information on how the pension benefits regime in Ontario is going to change with this bill isn’t included in the bill. It’s in the press statement from the Minister of Finance. So they couldn’t really be definite on how the bill was actually going to change the pension benefits.", "For the future of people in Ontario—and think about all the pension problems we’ve had with Sears. There are all kinds of pension issues. You know what? We should take some time and do this right, right? After this, if it was pulled out, we might very well disagree with what the government is doing, but right now, nobody really knows what the government is doing—really. Again, that’s something that shouldn’t be just rolled in.", "I certainly don’t claim to be a pension expert, but they’re talking about taking the solvency rate from 100% down to 85%, right? That’s not good.", "And then they’re talking about making the bill so that they can create buffers to fix that. But they don’t really know what the buffers are because that’s in the minister’s press release. Come on. Really?", "Again, do your due diligence and make legislation work. The way they’re doing it, it’s just not, at this point, the budget measures—there are a few things in here that they are trying to clean up. I don’t disagree with everything in here, but a lot of this stuff should be broken up and should be done in much more detail. They leave a lot—specifically the pension stuff—up to a lot of regulation.", "I’m not going to quote but I’ll paraphrase my colleague from Timmins–James Bay. He has waxed eloquently about how it used to be that government, that the Legislature, worked on—a lot more of the meat of legislation was left up the to the legislators, and now it’s all delegated to the ministers and the ministries." ],

And the Conservatives wanted to do the same thing. They were pretty aggressive at us. What I couldn’t believe—and, regardless, we’re very opposed to back-to-work legislation. But I’m more concerned about the Conservatives. Haven’t they learned anything in 14 years? They were willing to pass it, sight unseen. The Conservatives are big on back-to-work legislation, obviously, but we hadn’t seen the bill when the unanimous consent motion was put forward to pass this thing in 10 minutes, sight unseen. Several of the Conservative members flipped out on us that we weren’t doing this. They were willing to pass Liberal legislation. Those two words together should be a big red flag. I could not believe it. Would you do that for any other bill? No, especially when you’ve got a government who has a majority. Oh, we had to sit during the weekend? Tough. Really, it didn’t make any difference at the end of the day. Where the difference was for the college students was that the Premier could have stepped in much earlier, not with back-to-work legislation. She has the power to direct the parties back to the table. She could have stepped in much sooner.", "What this whole issue is really about is how willing the government was to play politics with this issue—at the very end, at the last minute—to try and blame it on the NDP. Now, we expect that from this government. We expect that. But if you really think about it, how gullible were the Conservatives to jump on the train? They seemed to be so intent on back-to-work legislation, they didn’t care what the details said." ],

  "text" : [ "I’m pleased to be able to rise for the next hour and have a discussion about Bill 177.", "Speaker, this fall economic statement is nothing more than a pre-election house of cards. As we dug deeper into the numbers, it was clear that the Auditor General and the Financial Accountability Officer were absolutely correct not to believe any of the numbers in this book.", "By the government’s own admission, the economy will underperform many private sector forecasts for 2017, which had growth at 3% or higher. Despite the government’s narrative, it doesn’t line up with the fact that growth is slowing as we speak. Yet they’re still somehow predicting a $10-billion revenue increase this year alone so they can balance the budget. None of this adds up.", "We wonder: Why do the Liberals continue to thumb their nose at the Legislature’s independent experts, who say the budget is not balanced? The experts have been clear that the government has been using one-time revenue to fluff up their budget: money from the Hydro One sale—well, that’s over now; money from the land transfer tax—the housing market is cooling; from federal transfers—well, that fluctuates year to year. Those are, all together, in the billions of dollars. In fact, each of them alone is in the billions.", "Without these massive one-time revenues, the government still says annual revenue growth will be 4% over the next four years, but the Financial Accountability Office says that it will average just 3%. It doesn’t sound like much. However, the difference between 3% and 4% in a budget of this size is billions of dollars. We’re billions of dollars apart from where the Financial Accountability Office says we should be.", "Again, Speaker, none of this adds up. If the independent legislative experts don’t believe the government’s numbers, why should Ontario’s families? Why should we ever believe any of the numbers we get from the Liberals?", "By almost every metric, this government has underperformed since the 2017 budget. Actually, revenues are only up $115 million—nowhere close to their forecast. Yet expenses are up $215 million since the budget. Personal income tax and health premium revenue is down. It’s down almost $2 billion since the budget came out last spring. Yet, they still say revenue is going to increase somehow by $10 billion. It’s a made-up number to artificially balance the budget.", "We have these rosy, glowing projections from the government, but in reality, the numbers just aren’t there. The truth doesn’t fit with the government’s narrative. You have to continue to ask: Why does it always take the Auditor General, the Financial Accountability Officer or the OPP to get to the truth in the province of Ontario?", "Speaker, reading this book, the fall economic statement, is like reading a fairy tale. I have to say that to you, Speaker, because everything inside it is made-up stories. It’s just wonderful little made-up fairy-tale stories. If you look in the financial section, they don’t use the Financial Accountability Officer’s numbers as a starting point. They don’t use the Auditor General’s numbers as a starting point. They use their own made-up numbers to start and then fluff up the books to show a balance and a surplus at the end. It’s a fairy tale. It makes for wonderful reading for Liberals, I’m sure. But somehow, we have got to be able to start dealing with facts in Ontario.", "I’m going to talk about four words that are very, very serious words from the FAO, the Financial Accountability Officer, and the Auditor General, the AG. Speaker, they are “unlikely assumptions,” and “significantly misstated.” Those are quotes from the AG and the FAO. When you look last month, there were two reports. One was called “blistering” and the other was called “scathing.” That’s by just about every media in Ontario. So when you look at the Financial Accountability Officer’s commentary, the title of the commentary, Ontario’s Debt Reduction Commitment Based on Unlikely Assumptions—that’s the title—that says it all. That should just tell you everything you need to know. Unlikely assumptions: The numbers that they have put in here are not going to happen. They’re unlikely. They have made assumptions here that are just not going to happen.", "The Financial Accountability Officer predicts our net debt will increase by $76 billion over the next five years. That brings us up to $392 billion in debt, Speaker. Remember: When this government took over, it was in the $139-billion range. Well, today, it’s $392 billion. It will be over $250 billion—almost three times what it was when they took office. That’s very significant. It took 137 years to get it to $139 billion, and they have tripled it in 15 years. Well, it will be more years by the time it’s tripled.", "They’re also going to raise the net debt rate to GDP—it’s a complicated expression—but it’s going to be raised to 40.3%. It talks about how much debt that you have, your net debt to GDP, to your growth in your province. What you really just need to know is that it used to be 27%. When this government took office, it was a healthy 27%. Why I tell you that was healthy is because even this government continues to tell you that their goal is to get it back to the pre-Liberal number of 27%. But right now, it’s on its way to 40.3%. That’s alarming.", "The targets that this government is using and announcing are based on achieving a balanced budget every year for the next 12 years. That’s why the Financial Accountability Officer said that’s an unlikely assumption; that’s not going to happen. It has never happened before and it’s not going to happen again, so why would you tell people that that’s what we’re basing this on?", "Here’s a quote from the FAO. He says, “If any of these relatively optimistic assumptions fall short ... the government’s 27% debt-to-GDP target would not be achieved.” They go on to say that achievement of that 27% target is based on “unlikely assumptions.” Again, the FAO said, “Over the past 30 years, Ontario has rarely achieved successive ... balanced budgets,” let alone 12 consecutive balanced budgets, especially from these guys. So his final words are “unlikely assumptions.”", "Now let’s jump to the Auditor General for a moment. The title of the Auditor General’s report is equally blistering as the FAO’s report. Her report was called “Ontario Government Understates Annual Deficit and Net Debt.” That’s the title of her book: “Ontario Government Understates Annual Deficit and Net Debt.” That paints quite a picture. Just the title alone paints quite a picture.", "She, for the second year in a row—which is unprecedented in Ontario’s storied history—issued what’s called a qualified opinion, a qualified audit opinion. What is a qualified opinion? You can only issue a qualified opinion if, “based on the audit evidence obtained, the statements are significantly misstated.” That is very, very serious in accounting terms. You’re misstating numbers. You know what that means. It would be unparliamentary for me to take it even a step further than that.", "This is what she has done. The Auditor General has told us those other two words. Remember the Financial Accountability Officer’s “unlikely assumptions”? The Auditor General: “significantly misstated.” Boy, I’ll tell you, given those four words together, any of those two phrases together, if you were a private company, you would have the regulators in here looking at your books from top to bottom. And we have our regulator; we have one. It’s called the Auditor General. But they disparage the Auditor General at every turn.", "When you imagine she has told us—again, this fall economic statement has numbers in it, and this is a quote: “The statements significantly understated the 2016-17 deficit, as well as the province’s net debt.” Speaker, she’s telling you the numbers in here aren’t right. The Financial Accountability Officer told us the numbers here aren’t right. Why would anybody ever believe for a moment anything that’s said in this book?", "The auditor went on to describe a little bit—this is so serious—" ],

  "text" : [ "Speaker, that “significantly misstated” has been presented on the floor of this Legislature. It has been tabled by the Auditor General of the province of Ontario. That’s in her book. Anybody can open the Auditor General’s book, tabled right here; it’s in the books that are tabled here.", "Here’s what she’s saying: “I have issued a qualified”—remember, “qualified” means that it’s significantly misstated. “I have issued a qualified audit opinion because the statements were not prepared following Canadian public sector accounting standards.” The Auditor General has warned all of us, “The Legislature and all Ontarians must be able to rely on the province’s consolidated financial statements to fairly report the fiscal results for the year. This year they cannot do so.”", "Can you imagine what would happen to a company’s stock if their auditors came out and said, “You cannot rely on any of the numbers that are in that report”? That’s what the auditor has told us again.", "She went on to say: “The deficit”—now she’s getting specific, Speaker—“is understated by $1.444 billion”—that’s just this year’s deficit—“and the net debt is understated by $12.429 billion,” $12.5 billion for both 2016 and 2017.", "That is unbelievable. Again, if you were a company, your stock would be gone. You would have a run on the stock. The regulators would be in there and they’d be looking at the seriousness of what you’ve done.", "So really, what’s at issue are two things. We’ve got the earlier track, which is all about the pension fund surpluses. This government thinks that they can raid the pension funds and use the pension surpluses as their money to fluff up their books. If you can imagine, you’ve got a set of numbers and now you’ve got two tracks of numbers. The Financial Accountability Officer felt it important to report one set of numbers that they believe are correct, and another set of numbers. Can you imagine, Speaker, that they’ve actually printed this little chart out to show that they’ve had to branch off into two sets of numbers, because they’re so far apart between what the Financial Accountability Officer says is correct and the Liberal Party? Now it jumps to get even more complicated, because each of those two branches now have two branches of their own. Now we’ve got this tentacle, this web.", "Accounting should be a straight line, up and down. There’s no ifs, ands or buts. Two plus two equals four, end of story. But in this government, you’ve got a two-branch, and each of those now has two. And what those two branches are all about is the treatment of the so-called fair hydro plan.", "Here’s what the Auditor General said as to why we have to take two more branches now. The government “inappropriately” recorded “the market account assets ... of the Independent Electricity System Operator.” Oops. It was done inappropriately, but it was also done by design, Speaker. It was not an accident. I’m going to get to another report in a moment that talks about just how nefarious this was. It was done by design. Again, she is saying that the books are significantly misstated.", "We can break that down a little bit more, Speaker, and get into the Auditor General’s next report—this is a month later now. What the Auditor General revealed is that the government created a complicated financing structure, designed to keep the true cost of the so-called fair hydro plan off the province’s books. It was going to cost a lot of money, and they didn’t want anybody to know (a) how much money it was going to cost, and (b) how they were paying for it. All they wanted to do was make sure it didn’t show up on their books so that they could have this fake balanced budget, this fluffed-up number.", "Their plan was to keep the numbers off the books so as not to show a deficit and not to show increased debt. And they didn’t want to show that this decision would cost Ontario families $4 billion more in interest costs, as this off-book structure that they built doesn’t have the same borrowing power as the province.", "So you can imagine, Speaker, they wanted to hide the fact that this thing was going to cost about $40 billion to do. They wanted to take that money and shuffle it right across the street over to OPG, Ontario Power Generation, which the people also own and they have their thumb on, and they forced them—they forced them, they co-opted them—into doing this. I’m quite sure the people at OPG had no intention of ever saying, “I’ve got a great idea. Let’s take all this debt on and not tell anybody.” This is a typical Liberal move. Not only have they gone across the street and co-opted OPG into doing this; we then learn that because OPG can’t borrow money at the same low rate that the province does, it’s going to cost $4 billion more just in interest, to hide that from our books.", "But now we say to you: The Auditor General has outed you. Your secret is out there. We now know what you were going to do. You don’t have to do this anymore. She’s going to make you record those loans on the province’s books. You’re going to do that anyway. So why go through with your charade of trying to hide it and pay $4 billion more? It’s just being stubborn to go through with that charade and put families $4 billion more into debt. How is that strong and fair for Ontario? How is it fair to make families pay $4 billion more now, absolutely unnecessarily? Your secret is out. It has been blown. Everybody has figured this one out. You got caught again. And now you have a chance to save 4 billion bucks. Are you going to do it? No, you’re not going to do it.", "In the auditor’s summary of concerns, she said, “It is clear ... that the government’s intention in creating the accounting/financing design to handle the costs of the electricity rate reduction was to avoid affecting its fiscal plan ... the intention was to avoid showing a deficit in the province’s budgets and consolidated financial statements ... and to likewise show no increase in the provincial net debt.”", "That’s just plain sneaky. You want a pat on the back for doing something—this so-called fair hydro plan, when there’s nothing fair about it at all to the next generation and the one after that and likely the one after that, who will now have the bill for all of this, and a highly inflated bill. The Financial Accountability Office told us that that bill may be—because we’re in deficit and we don’t have that money in the bank to pay this, we’ve got to borrow. It could add another $93 billion. That’s the number from the FAO. Think about it.", "Earlier, I mentioned that our new debt number in Ontario was going to be $392 billion. Let’s call it $400 billion, to round it off. This $93 billion over the next several years—let’s call that $100 billion, to round it off. Add the two together. That’s half a trillion dollars, $500 billion. A billion is a thousand million. So think about a trillion. These are numbers that boggle the mind of everybody here. Just think of the length of paper we’re going to need to write $1 trillion out with those zeros. Each of those zeros represents yet another generation that will be in debt. That’s the legacy of Kathleen Wynne. That’s the legacy of the Liberal government.", "Can you imagine: When they took office, $139 billion—and today, when they leave, it will be headed towards—because of what they have done, it could be almost half a trillion dollars. That is the legacy of the Liberals.", "How they’re doing this is very, very sneaky. The Auditor General has told us, “The government is making up its own accounting rules.” I’ll explain exactly what she is referring to here.", "The government is saying that the accounting cannot affect the fiscal plan. That’s what they want, and they’ve got everybody co-opted. As she says, this was a mandate to senior officials and private sector external advisers.", "In fact, they paid external advisers $2 million since last March to concoct this scheme. If this thing was so clean, why didn’t they just come out and ask the Auditor General how to do it? She would have told them how—or the fact that they can’t do it. No. They spent half a million dollars in a legal retainer and $2 million in consultant fees. The accounting treatment—she said that she did not want it to “affect the fiscal plan,” and that “it should not show any deficit incurred from this required borrowing, nor should it add to the amount the government would report” on their debt. They’re trying to hide everything.", "In the end—this is another quote from the Auditor General—“the government decided on a very complex form”—to achieve the mandate—“to avoid recording a ... deficit and an ... increase in ... debt.” That’s what these guys did. That’s what they did. They wanted to make sure that when it came time to put this book out, they could fluff up the numbers and not have any inconvenient truths happen—the fact that they have $12.5 billion more in debt to be added, and $1.5 billion more in deficit.", "To end on this chapter: Through legislation now—this is another thing they did—government created their own accounting assets. This is the first time in Canadian history. They simply legislated the loss at IESO. So you’ve got a loss—it’s like your mortgage on your house. They legislated a loss as a regulatory asset. That is somehow like having a mortgage on your house, which you owe—that’s your debt—but calling it an asset. That’s what they did. They simply legislated that loss as a regulatory asset.", "In essence, if the government or any government is allowed to call a loss an asset, we will never, ever, ever see a deficit in Canada again. Why would you have a deficit? It’s an asset. Snap your fingers like these guys did and call the debt an asset and record it on your books. But they got caught by the Auditor General, so it’s time for them to come clean.", "In the speech that the finance minister gave, he talked about this 4.5% to 3.5% reduction in the small business tax rate. However, all that was in his speech and in the media scrum and what was in the media was this 4.5% to 3.5% reduction. But as you look through the bill, the big binder that the member from Timiskaming–Cochrane talked about having a two-hour technical briefing yesterday on—we had ours a little earlier as well—there’s no mention of it in the bill. In this entire bill, Bill 177, there’s no mention of this 4.5% to 3.5% reduction. In fact, almost everything that the minister talked about in the speech and in the media scrum was fairy-tale and fluffy and unicorns and rainbows, but none of that is really in the bill, which was disturbing and alarming in itself.", "But if you look at the book that they supplied—it’s 166 pages long. But if you go right to the end here, Speaker, at page 159—you only have a couple of pages left—that’s when they added this small business tax reduction from 4.5% to 3.5%. It’s pretty obvious this thing came as a last-minute addition. They realized that they’re in a lot of trouble with this book because it’s all fairy-tale numbers and they’d better put something in here they can talk about, so you’ve got page 159 talking about this small business corporate income tax rate. It goes on to page 162, which has a chart, and that’s really it.", "It’s a couple of pages long, so you can tell they added this as a last-minute thought: “Look, we’re in trouble over Bill 148 and the minimum wage. We’ve realized now that we’re going to lose 50,000 jobs, if the FAO is right; 90,000 jobs, if TD Bank’s estimates are right; 185,000 jobs more or less over two years—a little different time length—if the chamber’s right. We better do something.” So they concocted this 4.5% to 3.5% tax rate.", "Let me tell you why that is so useless to most small businesses. I’ve been a small business owner—medium-size business, maybe—all my life. It started off, certainly, as a small business when I was in my teens. I’ve been a lifelong entrepreneur, Speaker, and I can tell you that taking this tax rate of 4.5% and dropping it to 3.5% may sound like some kind of a Hail Mary pass from the Liberals.", "But think about this: I have a restaurant in my riding that has a lot of employees. It’s open 24/7. The owners, the husband and wife—it’s a mom-and-pop shop—came in. They sat down, opened their books up, put their books in front of me and said, “Look at what this is going to do.” We’re talking about the minimum wage increase now. “It will add $152,000 a year in costs.” It’s the most expensive part of his costs now. He said, “First of all, I have to fire four people. I just have no alternative. We can’t raise our prices much more than they are. I’m going to fire four people.”", "But let’s just talk about this for a second. It’s still going to cost him money. His profit is not that great. I looked at his books; I know his numbers. So dropping from 4.5% to 3.5% when his profit is now—he’ll be lucky to even see a profit anymore—3.5% of zero is considerably less than 4.5% of some kind of profitable number. Zero is zero, Speaker. He isn’t going to make any money anymore.", "He and his wife don’t really know what to do. They feel bad; they’ve got these great employees. And so this is a Hail Mary pass to try to sound like they’re doing something, but none of that is in the bill.", "In the first half hour I’ve talked about why there’s nothing in this book that can be trusted. None of the numbers mean anything. They’re useless. They’re not based on fact. The FAO and the Auditor General will not sign off on these, so we know these are useless. There’s no sense even talking about the numbers that are in here any longer.", "In the second half hour that I have then, Speaker, let’s talk about the bill—Bill 177—and what’s in it. Sadly, and as you heard from others, there are 46 schedules in this bill—46 schedules. This is an omnibus bill. It’s comprised of 46 schedules, and it contains a number of bill consolidations.", "We’re going to start right at schedule 1. I’m going to go through them all, Speaker. I’ll try to go through some of them quickly and some a little slower.", "I’m just going to ask the page—if you will come forward for a moment. I don’t know if anybody has given you the courtesy yet of seeing a news release that I’m issuing, that we can talk about in a moment, but I wanted you to see that so there are no surprises. I understand your party is aware of it, but I wasn’t sure if you were.", "Schedule 1 is the Broader Public Sector Executive Compensation Act, 2014. I’m not really sure where that fits into the fall economic statement, but I can tell you what I call this bill. The member from Welland will get a chuckle out of this. I call this part of it the “St. Joseph’s Health Centre act,” because you will remember back when we spoke about the fact that the CEO of St. Joseph’s Health Centre was earning a salary of $720,000 and serves on several boards—for one of which he earned $357,000 a year and received $1.5 million in stock.", "If you look at that, it’s magical now that schedule 1 allows a minister—it doesn’t necessarily say “Minister of Health,” so this is going to be for all of them—“to make a particular specified decision” related to executive compensation “that, in the opinion of the minister, is appropriate” for broader public sector executive compensation “on a case-by-case basis.” That’s the long way around saying that the Minister of Health will now be able to step in and control the salaries of the CEOs of hospitals. That’s what this is all about. This was because they were so shocked somebody was earning $720,000 on one hand from the government, and $357,000—and 31 days of their time, by the way—on the other hand for sitting on one board. There were many other boards where we didn’t count the days. I’ll lovingly call this the St. Joseph’s Health Centre act.", "That’s in schedule 1. Schedule 2 and several other schedules—it’s called the Building Code Act. Really, it is the Elliot Lake act. And that’s what it is. I don’t say that in a bad way. This is quite seriously to implement the recommendations of the Algoma mall catastrophe and disaster and the lives that were lost. This is a building code. Here it is in the fall economic statement. Please tell me, somehow, what that has to do with the fall economic statement. Yes, this should be in. Yes, it needs to be passed. Of course you’d support that. These are the recommendations to stop further disasters from happening.", "Schedule 3 is the Child Care and Early Years Act, which allows that a childcare provider’s own children who are under 6 years old are not required to be counted in certain situations. Well, of course we’re going to be in favour of that. It was our idea. We’re thrilled that it’s in there, Speaker.", "Schedule 4, when you look at this one, that is the Child, Youth and Family Services Act. What it’s doing in a fall economic statement, we’re not sure. It’s simply to correct a reference error. That’s all it is.", "Schedule 5 is the City of Ottawa Act that recognizes Ottawa’s bilingual character. I’m not sure what it’s doing in the fall economic statement, Speaker, but it’s there. And you’ll see more about that coming up in a moment.", "Schedule 6 is the City of Toronto Act. Well, this gives the minister more authority and this makes other numbers retroactive.", "Schedule 7 is the Commodity Futures Act. Okay, that sounds a little bit more finance-y. I can tell you that I called it the whistleblower act. It gives a procedure for an employee to complain to an arbitrator or to the court if the employee has been subject to a reprisal prohibited by that section. I can almost understand that one.", "Schedule 8 is the Community Small Business Investment Funds Act. That’s more finance-y. It’s technical amendments; that’s what it is.", "Schedule 9 is the Co-operative Corporations Act—technical changes.", "Schedule 10 is the Corporations Act. This has to do with mutual insurance corporations and it changes from two alternate chairs down to one, but it is a finance-related issue.", "Schedule 12 is the Education Act. This is all about taking the existing provincial and demonstration schools, known as Centre Jules-Léger, and giving them a new not-for-profit called Centre Jules-Léger Consortium. So that’s an education act in the middle of your fall economic statement with all these numbers that are made up.", "Schedule 13 is your Election Finances Act. I have to tell you, Speaker, this one’s my favourite. In this entire document, this one takes the cake. So you remember the campaign finance scandal, Speaker, when Kathleen Wynne and the Liberals got caught in a cash-for-access scandal and campaign finance scandal and all this quid pro quo. You can pay $100,000 and have six ministers, and then they get caught, and it was you can pay $100,000 and have six chiefs of staff come to a meeting. I mean, it was—" ],

I fully understand why the minister said that, because who the heck would ever think that their campaign scandal would be tied into their fall economic statement.", "I’ll tell you why that’s so bizarre, Speaker. Not only did they rush the campaign finance scandal bill to change all these rules and regulations, and now, as the member from Welland said, we can’t even go to a spaghetti dinner anymore—well, not only did they do that; in their zeal to get this run through so fast, they made a boatload of mistakes. So here we are, only a few weeks ago debating a very historic bill to create two brand new ridings in northern Ontario, and what was attached to that? Campaign finance reform. It was, “Oops.” They had bungled that original bill so badly that they had to jam, into a beautiful bill to create two northern ridings, they had to throw in a rider on that one to try to fix up some campaign—and I’ll be honest, I call that one the “Caroline Mulroney clause,” because our party is attracting the highest-calibre candidates across Ontario. They’re lining up to run for the PC Party. They want to join the Patrick Brown team, and this party did not want Caroline Mulroney to be out there, raising money, so they brought out the changes. They brought out the changes to campaign finance last time and changed the rule only to benefit themselves.", "So here we are again, in the fall economic statement, and we have yet another schedule, schedule 13, the Elections Finances Act, which puts limits and makes it retroactive. The re-enactment of the section is deemed to have come into force last July 1, 2017. I haven’t quite figured out the changes in this, who it’s going to affect, but the fact that they’ve gone back and made it retroactive to July 1—as my dear old dad would say, we’re not sure who’s going to get nailed with this one, but it will manifest itself in the fullest of time. We’ll learn who this is going to harm. We’ll learn that soon.", "Yes, Minister, like you, I would wonder how I could be talking about a campaign finance scandal in the middle of this. Well, it’s you guys who put it in there. That’s why.", "Schedule 14: The member from Timiskaming–Cochrane spoke very passionately about that. This is the English and Wabigoon Rivers Remediation Funding Act, 2017. This is the Grassy Narrows issue, of course. This one defies all credibility that the Liberals and the Premier did not know about this. This is what they stand up and say every day. They’ve been in power for 14 years. For 10 years people have been talking about this: “Oh, we didn’t know about that.” So it’s important that this get dealt with. Don’t get us wrong, Speaker; we fully support schedule 14. But we’re not going to support the fall economic statement or any of the numbers in it because they’re made up.", "With that in mind, I’m going to break for a moment, Speaker, and just read a letter that I issued today. The letter says:", "“The Ontario PC caucus is extremely disappointed with this government’s decision to introduce yet another omnibus bill—Bill 177—in a bid to ram through unrelated legislation without proper debate and consideration in the Legislature in order to score cheap political points against their components.”", "“This is the same cynical approach the government has taken with Bill 174,” just this week and last week, “dealing with cannabis sales, where unrelated legislation affecting e-cigarettes and school bus cameras”—school bus cameras—“was inexplicably attached to the cannabis-specific schedules of the bill.", "“Let me be clear—many of the schedules contained in Bill 177 have the full support of our caucus. For example, we are completely in favour schedule 43, which would establish a French-language university in Ontario, something our leader, Patrick Brown, led the charge on. We also support the recommendation in schedules 2, 30 and 34 that stemmed from the inquiry into the Elliot Lake mall collapse that will improve safety in Ontario. As a matter of fact, schedule 3, which deals with exceptions for child care providers, is based on an amendment the Ontario PC caucus proposed at committee.", "“Bill 177 is a 168-page, 46-schedule omnibus bill introduced by the finance minister, which ironically enough has very little to do with the fall economic statement.", "“The Premier would do well to follow the lead of her federal counterparts, who changed parliamentary standing orders to prevent the use of omnibus bills that include a wide range of unrelated matters. In fact, earlier this month, the Liberal Speaker of the House of Commons ruled that four aspects of the federal budget bill, Bill C-63, were not part of the budget and needed to be introduced as separate bills.” They would be wise to follow the lead set by their federal cousins.", "“The Ontario PC caucus is requesting that the aforementioned schedules of Bill 177, as well as other non-fall economic statement schedules, be removed and introduced in the Legislature as separate pieces of legislation. They deserve to be considered on their own merit. We will further push for amendments, where necessary, to the finance-specific schedules of the bill to try to improve this legislation.", "“We cannot support the financial direction of a government who has allowed debt to spiral out of control beyond $300 billion.”", "Speaker, on that point, I would seek unanimous consent to put forward a motion without notice to split Bill 177. I have tabled this motion." ],

I’m allowed to do that, and I expect to.", "Just yesterday—actually, yesterday it was brought out, but it’s in today’s media. The headline is, “Ontarians Subsidizing Michigan, New York Hydro....” That is something we’ve talked about here—I was elected in 2011, and the then-Auditor General, in November 2011, held a news conference with a special report on the state of hydro. It’s so shocking a report, but so revealing. Everything—everything—that the Auditor General told us, first of all, is now proven to have been true, but all the forecasting that he did—for the next six years he had numbers, and I’m talking numbers in the billions. He was bang-on on every one of his numbers. When the Green Energy Act was first put out, he came out only two years later and said, “Hang on a second. This is going to cost Ontario families billions, and here’s why.” He told us that there was no business plan done; they just rushed into it. It was, “Ready, fire, aim.” They jumped into something they knew nothing about—the law of unintended consequences. It didn’t occur to them because, for the most part, there were no business people involved in crafting this thing to tell them whether it was a good business deal or not, whether the numbers would work or not, whether it would hurt families, force energy poverty in Ontario and make families choose whether to heat or eat.", "He was right back in 2011. I was there in the room. I was there in the media studio the day he discussed this. I was energy critic at the time. He told us how much money we were going to lose every year exporting surplus wind and solar power; he told us that. This is now in the news today. Ontario lost between $732 million and $1.25 billion over the past two years selling surplus clean electricity outside the province. That’s the sad reality of what this government has created.", "Here in their fall economic statement, they open the door to talk about the Green Energy Act, and I know many of us in our speeches over the course of discussing Bill 177 will want to highlight the Green Energy Act, because they’ve opened the door. They have opened the door to the pain and suffering they have caused Ontario families through their misguided direction on green energy, when Ontario had the cleanest, greenest, most reliable and most affordable energy in water power created more than 100 years ago by Sir Adam Beck. We had it made. When this government took office, we were amongst the lowest energy rates in North America. Today we’re amongst the highest. That’s what they have done.", "Think of all the companies that continue to leave Ontario—and the stories are numerous—all the companies that expand in the States buying cheap power. I talked just yesterday about the greenhouse chap we had met when I was energy critic. He was telling me that he wanted to double the size of his greenhouse operation. I had no idea of the magnitude of that. I toured it; it was monstrous. I’m thinking, “This is a lot of millions and millions and multi-tens of millions here.” I’m trying to do the math in my head. It’s a pretty big number, and he’s talking about doubling the size down in around the Chatham–Kent–Essex riding. This was back in 2011 and 2012, but he could not get a fair energy price.", "I ran into him here at the vegetable growers’ lobby day and I said to him, “Peter, did you ever build your greenhouse expansion that you talked about?” He said, “Vic, I want you to know we spent $100 million building a twin of our operation, except we did it in Ohio.” You can imagine: We’re paying Ohio every night to take our surplus power, and they eat our lunch, take our businesses away, put them in Ohio. That’s where they invested $100 million to build a new greenhouse. He said, “Do you remember my friend Terry?” I think that was his name. I said, “Yes, I remember him.” We also visited his greenhouse. He said, “Well, he built an $85-million greenhouse facility, but he did his in Pennsylvania.” He built his in Pennsylvania, where energy was cheap. Again, we pay Pennsylvania to take our surplus power.", "Interjections." ],

Her job is not to be partisan. What she does, she does because she is hired to do that job.

That’s workers who have partial benefits and who are actually going to see those benefits reduced or gone unless the government does something about it. I don’t know why, when they opened this and they put this into the omnibus bill, they didn’t address that issue for those workers who are already living in poverty, and when they actually lose those benefits on January 1 when the minimum wage goes up—" ],

He’s a good young guy, a bright young guy, and he should know a lot better than to call the Auditor General’s comments “malarkey.” Of course, it’s just part of the overall disparaging of the Auditor General that started with the former Minister of Energy and has carried on through to the former chief of the Treasury Board as well. I have been in that media conference room over and over, sitting only a few feet away, when these cabinet ministers disparage the Auditor General. It’s a grand plan of theirs so that when they do come out at election time and hold up their budget and say, “See? We told you it was balanced,” they will have disparaged the Auditor General so many times. They’re trying to diminish the respect that we all have for her.", "It’s not working. You got caught.

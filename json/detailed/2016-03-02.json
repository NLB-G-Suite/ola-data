  "text" : [ "Speaker, I’m pleased today to lend my voice to Bill 172, the Climate Change Mitigation and Low-carbon Economy Act. We need to focus today on a credible plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Climate change, as we all know, is a serious challenge that we all want to address. That’s why Ontarians across the province are already taking individual action to reduce their carbon footprint. Speaker, many have made their homes more energy efficient already, some have purchased hybrid cars, and others have invested in new, clean technologies that will transition Ontario into a low-carbon economy.", "Clearly, the people of Ontario are willing to do their part, but unfortunately the Liberals are using this goodwill to introduce cap-and-trade. Again, Speaker, I want to emphasize that I do not think it’s acceptable that Liberals are using Ontarians’ goodwill, and use the environment as an excuse, to introduce their cash grab cap-and-trade. It has proven to be an ineffective tool to reduce emissions, and we’ve seen that in Europe already. The fact of the matter is that it greatly increases costs for families and businesses. When we already have driven out many manufacturers to our neighbouring states, this is a huge concern that must be addressed.", "Specifically, we know that cap-and-trade will increase the cost of gas, groceries and home heating for families. It will put good, well-paying jobs at risk in our manufacturing sector, and it will shut out investment in new industries and facilities in our province.", "We have met with many stakeholders, and they have told us they have been waiting for a cue from Ontario one way or the other, which will be the tipping point for whether they choose to invest in Ontario or run away from Ontario. I’m afraid the latter is probably what’s going to be happening.", "As I said before, Speaker, the Liberals’ cap-and-trade scheme is a cash grab in the name of the environment, plain and simple. It puts a new tax on gasoline and home heating to raise revenue for the government, not to protect the environment. Again, the tax on gas and the increase in home heating is solely to raise revenue for the government to use at its will. It has absolutely nothing to do with protecting the environment.", "Speaker, you don’t have to take my word for it. I can back my words up with those of someone else. Just listen to what former finance minister Greg Sorbara had to say recently on The Agenda with Steve Paikin last week. Sorbara said that once the government sells its “imaginary product called carbon credits,” it will raise prices for “virtually every product” that Ontarians buy. I’m going to repeat that: Greg Sorbara said that once the government sells its “imaginary product called carbon credits,” prices for “virtually every product” in Ontario will increase.", "He wasn’t afraid to tell it the way it is. Sorbara said, “Although the minister said there are no tax increases, the fact is that there’s a $1.9-billion increase—I call it a flow-through tax—that will ultimately affect consumers.... It’s interesting to raise money and say, at the same time, you’re not raising taxes.” Speaker, it’s high time this government is honest and tells the truth to Ontarians.", "I always find it interesting when a Liberal is willing to point out the spin of his former colleagues." ],

  "text" : [ "Just yesterday, my colleague from York–Simcoe, when debating Bill 151, the Waste-Free Ontario Act, said that a good way to start cutting down on waste is limiting the amount of bureaucracy this government has grown.", "Coming back to this particular situation in Bill 172, the facts are that the Liberals’ cap-and-trade scheme puts a new tax on gasoline and home heating, which will ultimately create excessive new bureaucracy. In fact, Mr. Sorbara highlighted this very concern last week when he said, “Cap-and-trade requires a very significant bureaucracy. And this government has a very large bureaucracy. The last thing it needs is to add hundreds of people to the offices around Queen’s Park to deal with cap-and-trade.” Speaker, you won’t be surprised when I say that I couldn’t agree more with that statement. You and I both know that we need to limit the size of government, not increase it.", "Worst of all, cap-and-trade has proven to be an ineffective tool to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Again, Sorbara called his own party out for moving forward with cap-and-trade, saying, “There’s no evidence, anywhere in the world, that the cap-and-trade system actually does work ... to significantly reduce carbon emissions.” Again, Mr. Sorbara said, “There’s no evidence, anywhere in the world, that the cap-and-trade system actually does work ... to ... reduce carbon emissions. Until I see that evidence, I have to be a little bit skeptical about the whole scheme.” That’s right: Mr. Sorbara called the Liberal cap-and-trade initiative a scheme. He also went on to say that it’s going to bring more money to the government to use as it will.", "It’s absolutely stunning that senior members of the Liberal Party don’t even agree with the direction this government is taking. This policy direction is truly a major disappointment, and it is going to be a very sad legacy for Premier Wynne and her cabinet. Four years away from Ontario’s 2020 emissions target, this government had a chance. They had a chance to introduce a credible plan to tackle climate change. But the Liberals have chosen to do the opposite, protecting their own pockets and cash flow.", "Unlike British Columbia, the government’s cap-and-trade scheme lacks accountability and creates a new slush fund that can be used to finance Liberal pet projects. Just think: If they had reined in their mismanagement, reined in their scandals and reined in their waste, we wouldn’t have to be in this position. We could have had a well-thought-out, credible approach to addressing climate change.", "The manner in which this government is acting is flat-out wrong. To raise money in the name of the environment is unacceptable. What is even more unacceptable is to use the money raised in the name of the environment for covering their butts to pay for years of Liberal scandal, waste and mismanagement, as I’ve mentioned before. With this government’s track record, we know we cannot trust the Liberals to prioritize the environment over their spending addiction.", "Ontarians expect and deserve a government that will take climate change seriously, and they deserve a government that will take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while protecting taxpayers and our economy. I will cover the problems with the Liberal scheme in greater detail in my speech, but let’s talk about consumers right now.

  "text" : [ "I would like to go over the costs this plan will create for consumers and businesses. In reading the government’s budget document, it’s clear that the Liberals have not provided a fair picture of the long-term costs of their cap-and-trade scheme. Last week, I was telling people: You have to focus on the long term. When the Premier spoke about minimal charges, the reality is that that was for the first year or two. It’s unacceptable to mislead Ontarians in that manner.", "Since 2003, the cost of electricity has gone up 375%, and now we have 570,000 households living in energy poverty in this province. Apparently, that is still not enough, because cap-and-trade will raise the cost of the natural gas component of our power supply, and that will be reflected in our hydro bills. If you heat your home with natural gas, those bills will also increase. By 2025, some analysts project gasoline costs will increase by $400 a year and natural gas costs will increase by $475 annually. Think about those families. Think about the families who want to send their kids to camp or register them for hockey or for dance. That money means a lot. I dare say, I worry a lot about our seniors on fixed incomes. How are they going to manage this increase? The total bill amount of household energy bills, including electricity, gasoline and natural gas, could increase by as much as $1,500 a year, in addition to the existing scheduled increase for electricity.", "The impact on businesses is even more alarming. For a medium-sized business, analysts are projecting increases in natural gas and electricity costs ranging from $120,000 to $1 million. With those excessive new costs, businesses will be forced to lay off workers; and with every lost job, there’s a family who has lost their livelihood. That’s what this is boiling down to. How many more Ontario households will be driven into energy poverty by these increases? Many businesses will not be able to absorb that level of increase for energy. To survive, they will have to pass those costs on to consumers, resulting in an escalating decline in our standard of living. It is clear that the Liberals have not thought about this scheme’s long-term impact on energy costs. They haven’t even thought about the impact on our industry. They haven’t thought about its effect on our border economy and our competitiveness within the North American marketplace.", "The only thing the Liberals care about is the revenue the scheme will generate. And it will generate a lot. The Liberals plan to rake in $1.9 billion a year in new money. Yes, you heard that correctly. They plan to raise $1.9 billion, which they then can spend on whatever they choose. We know the Liberals’ motive behind cap-and-trade is all about the money, no matter what they say.", "But there is also a secondary Liberal motive, and that’s public relations. Now, let’s talk about the Liberal PR stunt for a moment. The government rushed to table Bill 172 and panicked to release its cap-and-trade regulation, all so that Kathleen Wynne and Glen Murray could pat themselves on the back at the photo op this week in Vancouver. The Liberals disregarded the concerns and economic advice of industry just so they could have their cap-and-trade scheme released in time for the First Ministers’ meeting.", "Ontario PCs focus on environmental results, and in focusing on environmental results, we will keep life affordable for families and businesses. Unfortunately, the Liberals’ focus is taking more money from Ontarians and setting up PR stunts to garner media attention. We all have seen recently how media stunts can go awry. Do these sound like priorities of a government that is serious about addressing climate change and protecting our economy?", "I think that members participating in this debate know my opinion. If the Liberals were serious about climate change, they would be focused on measures that can produce results, not setting up a stock market for carbon.", "Let’s talk about what really matters here. In the spirit of protecting the environment, we must look at innovation. To effectively reduce emissions, the PC Party of Ontario understands that we must advance innovation, increase energy efficiency and improve energy conservation. That means investing in transit, modernizing buildings and working with industry to develop realistic improvements to production processes. Unlike cap-and-trade, these are all proven ways to substantially reduce emissions. There are jurisdictions around the world that are doing amazing things in terms of developing environmentally friendly urban plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but I’ll get to that in a moment.", "With the PC Party of Ontario, technological advancement has always been our party’s approach. For one, I would like to remind members opposite that it was the former PC government that started the phase-out of coal in Ontario. I’ve spoken about it many times. Elizabeth Witmer, a Huron county native, started that ball rolling.", "Interjections." ],

I know that members opposite don’t like to acknowledge these facts—just listen to them right now—because they begin to expose the very thin veneer of celebrated Liberal myths. But let’s be clear for the record: The Liberals continued the coal phase-out that the former PC government started because of the $600-million investment from the Harper government. When I reflect on this history, I think of the famous quote by John Adams: “Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passion, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence.”", "The important point is that the Ontario PCs have always understood that it is the government’s responsibility to have a credible plan to reduce emissions while protecting taxpayers. And, unlike the Liberals, our focus is on advancing innovation, increasing efficiency and conserving energy, not raising energy costs and taxes for hard-working Ontarians.", "I mentioned the opportunity to attend the climate summit in Paris. When I walked around the pavilions where jurisdictions from around the world were showcasing their approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, something was evident. It popped out, and I couldn’t let go of it: Ontario—this Premier—likes to pretend that they’re leading the way, and unfortunately we are so far behind. The event showcased tech innovations that are on the markets today or should be invested in that make a greater contribution to cutting emissions than cap-and-trade will.", "The failure of government to take questions at the press conference when the MOU was signed with Manitoba was actually a sad day—for me, anyway. It’s interesting that the three provinces—Ontario, Manitoba and Quebec—hosted a media event where they were going to celebrate the signing of the MOU. As quickly as they came on the stage, they were escorted off without any questions. I would dare say that one of the reasons is that when I was visiting with colleagues and visiting with other jurisdictions—other countries—they were asking, “Why is Ontario following through and going with a cap-and-trade scheme? Don’t you know how it has resulted in Europe?”", "Speaker, in case you don’t know, the European cap-and-trade system was absolutely polluted with fraud. The targets were mis-set and it was an absolute failure. It raised a flag, and many people that I spoke to were shaking their heads as to why Ontario would follow through and not learn from their mistakes. So the discussions, as I said, were quite interesting in Paris.", "I think we need to focus in on what really matters. Again, that comes back to being fair to Ontario taxpayers and Ontario businesses, all the while focusing on the innovation and the technology we need, and a sincere commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.", "Let’s talk about the trading scheme again. I think it’s worthwhile to talk about some of the problems that actually exist within cap-and-trade markets, as I alluded to just moments ago.", "Many of you will remember the Chicago Climate Exchange, which traded greenhouse gas emission allowances from 2003 to 2010. By 2008, the Chicago Climate Exchange was trading 10 million tonnes of carbon allowances monthly, and the price of offsets rose to $7.40. However, a year later, due to a lack of activity in US carbon markets, the price of a metric tonne of carbon fell from over $7 down to 10 cents. The exchange was closed in 2010.", "The other cap-and-trade system that has experienced a litany of problems, as I alluded to, is Europe’s emissions trading system. Shortly after the ETS started up in 2005, problems with permits led to a collapse in prices, which resulted in a drop in value to close to zero. Disturbingly, some of these industries and manufacturers, which had received free allowances from the government, raised the price of their products as though they had actually incurred costs. The government ended up distributing so many free permits that the price of carbon dropped again, making it cheaper for companies to purchase offsets than to make emission reductions.", "A significant source of instability in the ETS has been fraud. A recent audit of that system revealed that attempts to prevent fraudulent activity in the market are still inadequate. Critics suggest that the ETS has been a costly exercise which has done little to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The price of permits has dropped from €30 to less than €5 due to permits that were given for activities that did not really reduce emissions, security breaches and phony credits. Interpol has even charged a major financial institution with involvement in carbon permit fraud, and investigators estimate that billions of euros have been lost due to this activity.", "Speaker, given the Liberals’ history of waste and mismanagement, how can we trust them to operate such a complex initiative? I’ll let you ponder that for a second, as I wet my whistle here.", "We’ve seen time and again that they take from Peter to give to Paul. They introduce a tax in the name of health, and where did that money go? Directly into coffers. We have proof and so many reasons why we can’t trust this government.", "Let’s talk about Liberal targets as well. Speaker, it might be helpful to review the position of Canada and Ontario with regard to greenhouse gas emissions.", "Approximately 80% of greenhouse gas emissions from human sources comes from the burning of fossil fuels and various industrial processes, like driving vehicles, electricity production, heating and cooling of buildings, and transportation of goods. While global emissions have been growing, the bulk of that growth has been in emerging markets and developing nations. Canada produces 1.6% of global emissions. Due to increasing emissions levels from these developing countries, Canada’s percentage share of global emissions is expected to decline.", "Again, to the members opposite: I ask you to really listen here. Canada produces 1.6% of global emissions, and because of what has already happened and because other countries have greater targets to achieve, Canada’s percentage of shared global emissions is expected to decline.", "Realistically, we live in a large country, often with long driving distances between cities and without a great deal of public transport outside of major urban areas.", "I can’t help but reflect back on last Thursday and some of the media coverage that the budget received. Specifically, Global News did a good job of challenging the finance minister on his thoughts. It’s quite interesting when a finance minister, a senior cabinet minister, so clearly has a disconnect with the rest of Ontario, when he would submit to the reporter, Alan Carter, that life is going to be easier because of cap-and-trade, because we’re going to encourage people to use public transit.

Driving, heating and cooling are the necessities of life.", "Ontario produces 23.5% of Canada’s total emissions. Now, let’s not forget that Canada’s total share of global emissions is only 1.6%, and Ontario produces 23.5% of that small percentage. So what does that mean? It means that Ontario’s global share of greenhouse gas emissions is about 0.38%. That’s right, Speaker—less than half a percentage point, and look at what it’s going to cost Ontarians and Ontario businesses. This government is just rubbing its hands, waiting eagerly to rake in the $1.9 billion, because we have 0.38% of greenhouse gas emissions at the global level. Considering that Ontario’s economy has always had a strong manufacturing and industrial sector and that we live in a climate which requires energy-intensive heating and cooling, I feel that it’s important to keep that 0.38% figure in mind.", "Going through the Liberal government’s climate change strategy, which outlined the government’s vision and objectives with regard to mitigating climate change, I gave a great deal of thought to the emission reduction targets of 37% below 1990 levels by 2030, and 80% below 1990 levels by 2050.

Are they realistic, or are they just stretch goals, as my colleague from Peel-Dufferin suggested?", "Mr. Speaker, there is a great danger in setting arbitrary goals when dealing with energy and economic matters, because energy is the lifeblood of an economy. A reliable, affordable and sufficient supply of energy is inextricably linked with economic sustainability. Industry, manufacturers and businesses provide employment which in turn supports our hospitals, schools, health care system and social agencies. We must be clear here: It would take a technological transformation of our society to reach the Liberal goals. That means our focus must be on innovation and not the cash grab that they have introduced through their cap-and-trade scheme. Without realistic and affordable developments to change how we heat and cool our homes and power our vehicles, given current technology, achieving these targets would literally bring our economy to a standstill, or require a massive wealth transfer to purchase carbon allowances from outside of our province, or perhaps a combination of both of those two scenarios.", "Ontarians are rightly questioning whether the proposed cap-and-trade scheme is the most effective method of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and if it is a responsible use of scarce taxpayer dollars. Yes, I’m sure you would agree, Speaker, that tax dollars are very scarce here in Ontario, and we do need to use them responsibly and wisely. I’m going to talk in a moment about how cap-and-trade is not a wise use of those dollars.", "Cap-and-trade around the world has been proven to be ineffective. Between 2005 and 2013, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick achieved the largest emissions reductions of all Canadian provinces, without the use of carbon pricing. Experts have been clear that the price for carbon needed to meet future emission targets and change consumption patterns would have to be much higher than what is being proposed.", "For example, Mr. Paul Boothe, a member of the Ecofiscal Commission, recently stated that in order for Canada to meet the greenhouse gas reduction targets that it agreed to at the Paris summit, a carbon tax of $150 to $200 would be needed. So it appears that these initial costs that we heard about last week, the cost increases on gasoline and natural gas, are just the tip of the iceberg.", "At this point, Speaker, I would also like to recognize Ms. Aldyen Donnelly, the president of WDA Consulting, for the excellent article she has published on this topic. Ms. Donnelly has advised both industry and governments on emission reduction strategies. Ms. Donnelly’s observation on cap-and-trade programs is that they are “inefficient and regressive” and allow governments to “pick corporate winners and losers.” Where have we seen that before? Just think of their dismal green energy failure. It’s a very concerning situation when it’s almost like déjà vu or Groundhog Day. Here we go again, with the Liberal government setting themselves up to pick corporate winners and losers.", "I’d like to paraphrase a statement from Ms. Donnelly that is especially pertinent to the proposed Liberal cap-and-trade program, stating that “carbon/energy taxes translate into green goods-producing job growth is ... a myth.” That sounds very similar to Mr. Greg Sorbara’s comments earlier. She went on to say that 100% of the job growth in carbon/high-energy-dominated jurisdictions has been in the public sector, as goods-producing jobs flee. Again, 100% of job growth in carbon/high-energy-dominated jurisdictions has been in the public sector, as goods-producing jobs flee.", "We’ve talked about the leakage. We’ve talked about how we’re nervous that this Liberal cap-and-trade scheme will drive business to our neighbouring states. Unfortunately, if they stay the route, that’s exactly what’s going to happen here in Ontario. In looking at existing cap-and-trade markets, other analysts have noted that cap-and-trade has not so far proven to be an efficient means to reduce emissions. Reductions have been achieved through economic downturns, technological advances, product standards, changes to alternate fuels and energy-intensive industry moving to other jurisdictions—and there’s that leakage that I spoke about.", "At the end of the day, the Liberal government’s cap-and-trade approach appears to be more about raising government revenues and economic control than making meaningful progress towards lowering greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating climate change. The purpose of Bill 172 is to establish a price on carbon by means of a cap-and-trade program that will change the behaviour of everyone across the province and allow Ontario to link to Quebec and California in the Western Climate Initiative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The government of Ontario “envisions, by 2050, a thriving society generating fewer or zero greenhouse gas emissions. Businesses and innovators will be creating world-leading low-carbon technologies and products that drive new economic growth, productivity and job creation.”", "Mr. Speaker, before we begin to even talk about zero emissions, perhaps we should examine some mundane realities. It’s no secret that this Liberal government has increased Ontario’s debt to over $300 billion. I believe this past Thursday we heard it was going to be $308 billion—unacceptable. The province’s fiscal situation is dire. We no longer have the luxury of stretch goals. They have to be let go of. We don’t have the luxury of stretch goals, wasteful spending or implementing costly initiatives without clear, empirical evidence that the program is fact-based, will fulfill its mandate and that benchmarks will be met in an efficient, cost-effective manner.", "Ontarians have a right to expect that—", "Interjections." ],

  "text" : [ "If the Liberal government is going to introduce a cap-and-trade scheme to reduce emissions, they had better be clear about the long-term costs. We want to know exactly the cost of this program, exactly what tangible emission reductions will be realized, or if Ontario will meet its targets mainly through purchasing carbon allowances from its partners in the Western Climate Initiative.", "Let’s talk about buying emission reductions. Ontario’s emission target for 2020 is 150 megatonnes, yet the province’s emissions are expected to reach 168 megatonnes. To achieve Ontario’s targets, emissions will have to fall to 110 megatonnes by 2030 and 35 megatonnes by 2050.", "Dave Sawyer of EnviroEconomics projects a gap of 18 megatonnes in Ontario’s 2020 target of 15% below 1990. In order to close that gap, Mr. Sawyer’s analysis projects that Ontario emitters would have to purchase 11.5 megatonnes of allowances from Western Climate Initiative partners. Some of what we’re hearing is that many of those credits will have to be purchased from California in US dollars. Does that make any sense?", "Ontario could reduce the other 6.5 megatonnes at the WCI allowance price in 2020 of C$17.16 per tonne. The cost for the Ontario 6.5-megatonne abatement would be approximately $55 million, and the cost for Ontario emitters to purchase the 11.5 megatonnes of carbon allowances from the WCI initiative partners would be worth $205 million.", "The EnviroEconomics analysis assumed a coverage of 85% of Ontario’s emissions in 2020 while the Liberal announcement puts the figure at 82%. The government expects revenues of $1.9 billion in the first year: 60% of this $1.9 billion would come from transportation and 27% from buildings. EnviroEconomics estimates auction revenue to be approximately eight times greater than the actual cost of emission reductions. So the total cost for Ontario to close the 18-megatonne gap to achieve its 2020 target would be $261 million.", "Let’s look at these carbon allowances. Large emitters in Ontario are paying $205 million to help Ontario achieve its 2020 target. According to Ms. Donnelly, there have been concerns raised about California’s carbon market with regard to the high number of free allowances distributed, accounting practices and the actual reduction value of the carbon allowance. Due to these concerns, none of the other US states that participated in the Western Climate Initiative have linked their emissions trading markets to California. If Ontario emitters are planning to buy these California allowances, do these allowances represent meaningful emission reductions or meaningless paper proxies? Why should Ontarians send their money to another jurisdiction to reduce emissions there? Surely, the public would prefer that their tax dollars be spent on environmental initiatives right here within the province of Ontario.", "Speaker, we should think carefully about the beneficial environmental improvements that $261 million could fund in Ontario, or what cleaner technology upgrades Ontario companies could afford to install with that money—technology that would make an actual reduction in greenhouse gases.", "The other problem with California carbon allowances is that they are not recognized by the US Environmental Protection Agency due to the double-counting of reductions. Ms. Donnelly correctly raises the question that when the Environmental Protection Agency sets out greenhouse gas emission tariffs on imports from Quebec and Ontario, will the EPA recognize carbon allowances that Quebec and Ontario bought from California, when the EPA doesn’t accept their reduction claims in the US?", "There are so many questions, and in meeting with stakeholders, the issue of the higher number of free allowances given to large California emitters has been raised. Industry and manufacturers are concerned that the carbon allowances that they buy from California emitters were given to them free by the government. Not only do these allowances not represent an actual emissions reduction; this imbalance puts Ontario industry at a competitive disadvantage.", "For example, in California, natural gas distributors receive free allowances that they must use to assist their customers with cost increases, which helps protect smaller natural gas users who have no other fuel options. The natural gas industry in Ontario, conversely, is concerned that they are not receiving initial free allowances like their counterparts in Quebec and California. If there is not a level playing field in this province, how can our natural gas industry remain competitive?", "Other issues raised by stakeholders are that volatility in the regulations and the price of carbon will create an uncertain climate for investment. Industry stakeholders have been clear that they are concerned at the speed in which this cap-and-trade scheme is being moved forward, and the difficulty in complying with regulations, oversight enforcement and reporting mechanisms. While some large emitters will receive free carbon allowances and will be able to afford the administrative cost of compliance, these extra costs will become one more regulatory burden for small to medium-sized businesses. Many of these same small and medium-sized businesses, which provide 88% of the province’s jobs, may not have viable options for switching fuel or cutting back on transportation costs. The cost of compliance with cap-and-trade will remove capital from businesses that may have been used to expand the operation or hire new staff.", "While the government—the Liberal government in particular—will wax poetic about all the new clean technology and alternate energy jobs this cap-and-trade system will provide, I think a healthy dose of skepticism is warranted. Again, we can’t trust them to get it right. We heard claims from the Liberals about how the HST and the Green Energy Act would create 165,000 jobs, and we all know how that has turned out. Despite previous unsuccessful attempts at social engineering, the Liberal government is once again aiming to change everyone’s behaviour via this cap-and-trade scheme. However, analysts have been clear that the price of carbon would have to be very high in order to effect change.", "As I unfortunately hear so often from my constituents, an alarming number of Ontario residents and businesses are struggling to make ends meet. I’m sure we all have constituents who have come to us with that problem and that concern. When a bill is introduced that will increase costs for Ontarians even further, as legislators we have a duty right here in this House to review that measure very carefully to see if increasing the financial burden on residents and businesses is absolutely necessary, and if it is, to minimize costs where we can and to make sure we’re giving the best value for their tax dollars. But this Liberal government, time and again, has not done that.", "The one thing I do not understand is that despite the public being very vocal that rising energy costs are causing undue hardships to both families and businesses, the Liberal government has once again introduced a measure that will increase the cost of electricity, heating and gasoline. If ratepayers cannot afford their electricity costs now, logically it follows that they won’t be able to afford the increases this government has announced as of last week, and natural gas or gasoline either. This magical thinking, these stretch goals that bring the government to think Ontarians can continue to absorb endless costs and increases, have got to end.", "Now let’s talk specifically about Bill 172. With all of these concerns in mind, we have to drill down on this particular bill. Some observers of this issue may feel like they’re having a little déjà vu, or, as I said or alluded to earlier, watching the movie Groundhog Day. They may ask, “Didn’t the Liberal government champion a cap-and-trade scheme in the middle of a recession seven years ago?” The answer is: Yes, they did. In fact, the Liberals passed amendments to the Environmental Protection Act in 2009 under Bill 185 to set up a cap-and-trade scheme. Then they established reporting regulations for greenhouse gas emissions. At that time, we were told that this bill was vital and that the Liberals would be setting up cap-and-trade any day. That was 2009.", "In fact, the former Liberal environment minister said during debate, “Bill 185 is a critical piece of legislation that, if passed, would allow us to create a ... cap-and-trade system for Ontario that could link to other emerging North American systems.” Well, Speaker, it appears Bill 185 wasn’t such a critical piece of legislation after all. Out of fear of collapsing Ontario’s economy after the great recession, the Liberals shelved their emissions-trading law and waited for a more opportune time to lock the province into the scheme. With the law on the books it was left to collect dust for a few years, but with the reporting regulations in place everyone assumed it was only a matter of time until the Liberals imposed their cap-and-trade scheme.", "But that wasn’t the case. The Liberals missed the 2012 start date for the Western Climate Initiative, and they didn’t say a word. Why was that? A minority government, perhaps? But I’d look at my colleagues who were elected in 2011. Our party asked questions about the scheme, but the Liberals pretended that it was a figment of our imagination; that is, until last year when it became politically advantageous for the Premier to, once again, push cap-and-trade.", "The Premier stood in front of the cameras—yet another photo op in April 2015—to proclaim she was going to introduce cap-and-trade for our children and grandchildren. Never mind the skyrocketing hydro; forget about the increased cost of living; and, according to the Premier, leave the province’s $300-billion debt to the next generation.", "It’s not really hard to see why the Liberals have this arrogant perspective. They have grown so out of touch with ordinary Ontarians that they can’t understand the priorities of families who are struggling to make ends meet and who are sometimes left scrounging for some extra cash just to pay the next heating or electricity bill. They can’t understand that the increased hydro rates are leaving seniors with fixed incomes in the cold during the winter. These are our realities in our ridings.", "As I said earlier, Speaker, the only things that matter to this Premier and this government are taking more money out of Ontarians’ pockets and smiling for the cameras at a good photo op. The Premier herself admitted that cap-and-trade is just about the money when, last year, in April 2015, I was standing there and she arrogantly challenged the media to “go ahead and call it a tax.” We just shook our heads.", "The troubling part is that this tax is about to become a reality very soon. Here we are debating Bill 172 seven years after the government passed its first cap-and-trade legislation, yet the speakers want you to believe they’re sincere when they say they need to scrap the old cap-and-trade law to replace it with a new one. Is this government saying that they failed with the first law? We know they failed with many other initiatives. Or is this government’s true motivation to pass a new cap-and-trade law that could be used, as I said, as a PR document to peddle the Liberals’ latest spin?", "I think the answer is that the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change needs to be honest and truthful, not only with this House but Ontario’s people as well.", "Let’s talk about the regulatory scheme. The old cap-and-trade law and Bill 172 share one distinct feature: Virtually every pertinent detail is left to regulation. All we know from reading Bill 172 is that the Liberals design the system, set the rules, select the participants, appoint the officials and, of course, pick the winners and losers, just like their failed green energy scheme. Because everything is left to regulation, the government at any time could change the structure of the scheme, the trading rules, the reporting requirements or the powers of the minister to intervene in the carbon market—all dangerous red flags right there.", "To quell opposition, the Liberals have doled out free allowances to certain sectors while only targeting the natural gas and petroleum industries with excessive new compliance costs. Still, industries that have bought into the cap-and-trade need to see it for what it really is.", "The Liberal scheme is a Trojan Horse under the banner of a market-driven solution. It’s a Trojan Horse. Does everybody know and recall the story about the Trojan Horse? Once it opens up, it’ll be nothing more than command-and-control economics. This is a very dangerous path that this Liberal government has chosen to put Ontario on, and I am very concerned about the future for taxpayers, our seniors on fixed income and the next generation.", "The government will create onerous new rules for the industry that, if broken, will result in severe penalties. Like any command-and-control structure, we know that the game will be rigged. Those who will stand to benefit are the Liberals and their friends, as I’ve alluded to before, just like their green energy scheme. It’s very frustrating and maddening.", "In terms of administration, of course, the two groups that stand to lose are Ontario taxpayers and manufacturers, as I’ve mentioned before. And there are no signs that this government will do anything to prevent excessive increases to natural gas, fuel and electricity bills. Why would the Liberals care in the first place? After all, they need $300 million just to set up cap-and-trade, and that doesn’t even account for the scheme’s operational costs.", "The Liberals have provided estimates. We know that the environment ministry will need a department of staff to pore over registration, reporting and verification data from the companies that are in the system. Of course, part of the funding for these services will be from general revenue and part will be from administrative fees. How much will the fees be? We don’t know, Speaker. How many fees will there be? Yet again, we don’t know, and that’s because, again, the Liberals have not released the regulations to the public.", "Let’s talk about enforcement. As I said before, we don’t know much about the real meat on the bones, but unlike Bill 151, the Liberals are relying on existing enforcement officers rather than creating a whole new branch of cap-and-trade cops. Bill 151 is creating a whole new team of “waste cops” but, with regard to cap-and-trade, they are keeping the enforcement close at hand. Speaker, I must say it’s always a pleasant surprise to see when the Liberals don’t include provisions that attempt to create an entirely new enforcement branch for one proposed law.", "Bill 172 contains stiff penalties for serious offences like fraud, market manipulation and insider trading. These offences, which are rampant in other cap-and-trade markets around the world, must be dealt with swiftly and harshly, but prevention is also the key. One way to prevent these offences is to deter people. Another, and I believe the better, way to prevent these crimes is not to set up a cap-and-trade market in the first place.", "There are much simpler pricing systems, and do you know what? The Liberals have completely overlooked them. They are so ingrained, as I said. They first set up their mechanism legislation in 2009. They were not interested in any other pricing system. They totally ignored all the aggregated comments that were generated through climate change consultations last winter. Every consultation I attended—and I attended four and I read the reports from the other three—the general consensus, by the people attending them, was that perhaps a carbon tax was a better place to land. But the Liberals, knowing what they needed, knowing that they were cash-strapped, knowing that they had to get their hands on dollars in a quick way, continued to favour their cap-and-trade scheme. We all know that simple pricing systems are easier to enforce, require less administration, and don’t create a system that can be easily gamed by fraudsters. Again, the Liberals set their stake in the sand in 2009, and here we are dealing with it today in 2016.", "In terms of penalties Bill 172 also covers administrative infractions, which one would assume would be failures to submit reporting or registration information. But of course, Ontario businesses don’t know what would be considered an administrative contravention because—you guessed it—we’re still waiting for yet another regulation to define exactly what that means. All we know from the bill is that individuals can face fines up to $1 million and that they are subject to absolute liability. Again, for everyone who’s listening, because this part is important, individuals can face fines up to $1 million and they are subject to absolute liability.", "Speaker, I just want to make sure everyone is clear on what “absolute liability” is. Subsection 54(10) says that a person must pay an administrative penalty applies “even if,", "“(a) the person took all reasonable steps to prevent the contravention; or", "“(b) at the time of the contravention, the person had an honest and reasonable belief in a mistaken set of facts that, if true, would have rendered the contravention innocent.”", "Speaker, could you imagine, if you had a business that was about to be regulated under this proposed law, that even though you do your best to comply, even if you’re honest, even if you took all reasonable steps forward, you’re guilty? That’s a daunting standard to set for this industry, in this province. The minister should clarify this section, and how the regulation will work, as soon as possible.", "Now let’s talk about the greenhouse gas reduction account. Of course, there’s total immunity for the government, just like there’s total discretion for the minister on how to spend the $1.9 billion created from the cap-and-trade every year. This is the part of the proposed act that I have a lot of trouble with. According to Bill 172, the money from emissions trading will flow into general revenue, and the amounts will be recorded in the Liberals’ GHG reduction account, or slush fund. The environment minister then has the authority to decide which programs and projects will receive funding from the amounts recorded in this account.", "Speaker, the government has said it is going to use cap-and-trade revenues to cover its $325-million spending spree on the Green Investment Fund, but we all know it will be used for much more than just this. The Liberals will rake in cap-and-trade money and use it to pay for years of government waste and a long list of Liberal pet projects.", "In schedule 1, there is a lot to be said, so I’d like to speak a little bit more about my concerns about what projects the Liberals intend to fund with the cap-and-trade money. Schedule 1 has them all set out.", "There are segments of schedule 1 that truly are alarming. It states that projects which reduce greenhouse gases may be funded, in whole or in part, from this account. It then lists different types of projects that would qualify: “The production or installation of renewable, low-carbon, carbon-free ... energy.” It sounds like more turbines, perhaps.", "“The research, development ... of technologies that eliminate or reduce” the use of greenhouse-gas-emitting fuels: It will be interesting to see where that lands.", "Another segment is, “Distributed renewable energy generation and ... technologies to support load-shifting, energy storage, net metering and other measures to eliminate the need for grid-based electricity during natural gas peaking.”", "Honestly, Speaker. Apparently, this Liberal government did not learn anything from the economic and technical chaos unleashed on this province through their Green Energy Act. In Bill 172, the government is planning to double down with another ill-advised energy scheme. Instead of private companies borrowing capital and building energy projects, it appears the Liberal government will be using the revenue extracted from Ontarians through the increases in gasoline, natural gas, and goods and services to fund renewable energy initiatives. If these types of projects were cost-effective, the private sector would already be investing in them. Why does the government have to dabble? If they were cost-effective, market-driven initiatives would be leading the way with private investment. In terms of emissions, will these technologies ever recover the emissions required to construct them? A quick Google search provides an extensive list of renewable energy firms which have gone bankrupt as soon as their government subsidies ran out. It is a sad state of affairs.", "Now we have 570,000 households living in energy poverty in this province. I question whether Ontario ratepayers can afford more expensive, subsidized power, especially as our electricity supply is about 80% emissions-free already.", "This section of schedule 1, combined with Bill 135, which transfers independent planning and procurement authority from the IESO, and the transmission approval from the Ontario Energy Board, to the Minister of Energy, is bound to cause further instability in the energy sector.", "As we all read in the Financial Post, Ontario is the most indebted sub-sovereign borrower in the world. We most certainly do not have money to waste on unproven generation sources which will not be able to power a modern industrialized society.", "Let’s talk about agriculture for a second as well. I’m proud that my riding is a breadbasket for Ontario, and I’m concerned about the impact that this Liberal scheme will have on our agricultural industry.", "As I reflect on it, I’d like to share with you a few lines from a press release my office received back on December 18 from the Ontario Federation of Agriculture that I think perfectly highlights the concerns I’ve been hearing from our farming community.", "“New regulations to reduce emissions mean carbon will have a price tag at the farm. That means farmers could see the cost of inputs rise as additional charges are added to things like electricity, steel, concrete and fertilizers, where emissions arise from their production.", "“Agriculture must be recognized for the existing efforts made to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through carbon sequestration with no-till practices, feeding regimes for ruminants, and fertilizer management. Ontario farmers could see future opportunities in carbon credits, offsetting emissions from other companies producing greenhouse gases....", "“Farmers need to be consulted and engaged to reach transparency and equity.”", "If this government truly wants to take action on climate change, they should be looking to those who depend on the earth for their livelihoods for solutions. They must recognize the efforts that Ontario farmers have made to be good stewards of the land and allow them to work with businesses to offset their carbon emissions. This is especially important when you consider the benefits that their efforts are bringing to our economy.", "According to the Ontario Federation of Agriculture, in the greater Golden Horseshoe area alone, the industry supplies $1.6 billion in environmental benefits per year, including absorption of carbon pollution, water filtration, protection against erosion, and runoff control. If this government isn’t already looking into opportunities that the agricultural community can afford industry in offsetting carbon emissions with figures like these, they need to consult more.", "Another issue with this proposed legislation is the government’s underdeveloped plan to accredit offsets. Offset credits are intended to give emitters an opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The government has offered little explanation about how it intends on structuring the allocation of offsets.", "I’m very concerned about this whole Bill 172. It’s just a reason to set up and support the Liberal slush fund. After all, it doesn’t make business sense to promote green initiatives if the government might only credit them in the future.", "And, as always, there is the question of cost. What will be the costs associated with the regulation of offsets and of the cap-and-trade scheme more broadly? Will the government need to train new employees? Will businesses have to cut jobs to hire someone familiar with this complicated system? How will the government find the financial resources to train or hire qualified employees? The government has yet to answer any of these questions. This lack of transparency will only serve to diminish investor confidence in Ontario." ],

That is an argument that can be used, frankly, around the world to take no action.

I know that’s her role as the critic for the party, and it’s very important to have heard some of the materials coming from her.", "I particularly want to focus on what I thought I was hearing early in her speech, which was a bit on the Conservative plan. I remember her saying, “The Conservative plan is”—and as I went to get a piece of paper to start writing it down, that was the end of it. I’ll have to go back to Hansard tomorrow, maybe just to review what the Conservative plan is because it was so very, very short and sweet. We are hoping to get more details on what they think they would do that was somewhat different, as they’re certainly not in that speech I got from the critic today.", "I want to focus a little bit on this concept of her concern about fraud and how it may be identified in other markets in Europe particularly, the early adopters of cap-and-trade systems. The world has learned from mistakes that were made in how to set up the proper initiatives to cover off fraud. We’re very clear that, as a result of what we know—and we are setting up very strict oversight rules for the cap-and-trade market that will guard against fraudulent behaviour. We’re working very closely with the Western Climate Initiative, an agency that helps to monitor and put the systems in place; that is consistent with what they’re doing in California, which is consistent with what they’re doing in Quebec. It’s extraordinarily important that we recognize that. I agree with the member from Toronto–Danforth. This whole notion that we are only a small piece of the puzzle, that we shouldn’t do anything but throw our hands up in the air, and we have to understand that we think globally but we act locally, and every individual can do their part and by doing their part send a signal to the neighbour, the people down the street and the country next door to do their part—it’s absolutely critical that we not use a de minimis argument like: We’re only a little part of the problem; therefore, we should do nothing." ],

She takes her role as our critic for the environment and climate change very, very seriously. She researches, she delves into things, and she’s got backbone, and that’s one of the things I truly appreciate about her efforts in our caucus. When we talk about proper consultation—I was touching base with her earlier, and I asked, “So, how much consultation has the government done on this?” She told me: “Listen, do you know what? They don’t listen to the recommendations and the consultations. They just have their minds set, and that’s the way they want to go.”", "I heard earlier a member’s comment about, “Oh, the Conservative plan”—and then stop there. The fact of the matter is: They’re the government. They’re the ones that are supposed to be coming up with the ideas, recommendations and suggestions, but they do that by effectively listening to people throughout the province. They’re not doing that. They have their minds set, and this is the direction they’re going to go. As far as I’m concerned, they just don’t have a credible plan to tackle climate change.", "One of the other things that I’m kind of concerned about is that they like to throw out what I call shiny objects. They get people chasing shiny objects to distract them or detract from the real message.", "The last thing that I want to simply talk about here is the fact that they are requiring natural gas and petroleum industries to purchase all their emission allowances during the first compliance period. That’s why the cost of natural gas, gasoline, diesel and propane are going to go up. I’m concerned because Union Gas is in my area, and that’s going to affect a big company, a big employer in Chatham–Kent–Essex." ],

We need to make sure that the bill is fair, that people can afford their Union Gas bill when it comes into their home, that an increase on them when they are already struggling paycheque-to-paycheque, month-to-month to get those bills paid is difficult. I’ve heard from a lot of people in my community about the increase of gas at the pump. The prices were just starting to come down. People were starting to be able to breathe a little easier with the price of gasoline, and now there’s a 4.3% increase on every litre. It’s a huge chunk, again, being put into taxes.", "We are also concerned about where these dollars are going to go. It’s a lot of money that’s going to be going into the provincial coffers. Where is that money going to go? Is it going to be designated completely for climate change and environment? We’re not sure, so we’re concerned about the fairness and we’re concerned about the transparency and where that’s going to happen.", "I’ve also read concerns about the Environmental Commissioner being let in on initiatives and what’s happening; there are no regulations to make sure that they are being brought in. That’s a huge concern. We need to make sure that our Environmental Commissioner is on top of this also." ],

We all have to home in on one thing: We have to do right by the Ontario taxpayer. No matter what partisan flavours would like to paint us differently, we all want to do our part to protect the environment, but all the while, we can’t take Ontarians for granted, because their pockets are becoming lighter and lighter.", "I believe, honestly, that Ontarians want to do their part to reduce emissions. Again, Ontario’s total global greenhouse gas emission is less than half a percentage point, and in no way should my comments be misconstrued to mean we can’t do better. We all can do better because we care about the environment. My point is that less than half a percentage point should not be generating $1.9 billion in a slush fund for Liberals to use for pet projects, for Liberals to fill their coffers because of their mismanagement and waste. That’s what’s unacceptable. They are raising $1.9 billion on the backs of Ontarians, and they’re also using their plan for a PR stunt. It’s unacceptable.", "Ontarians deserve to know the truth. Our party will go forward in an honest matter. We’ll listen to our stakeholders, because we need a credible plan. We need to embrace innovation. We need to allow industry to lead the way. Our party doesn’t ever want to see industry chased out of the province. In the manner in which this government has set up their cap-and-trade scheme, Ontarians are going to be poorer and we’re going to lose more jobs because industry is going to choose to relocate elsewhere. That is an absolute shame." ],

This means that families on social assistance are no better off when they receive child support, and the parent responsible for making payments may feel little incentive to pay.", "We would like to see a full exemption of child support for social assistance recipients, but it is important that we get the opinions we need on how best to solve the problem here in Ontario.

It was truly wonderful to see and meet three generations—grandparents, parents and their children—all together as they joined in the fun activities. We had an amazing turnout of more than 200 people.", "Les résidants de ma communauté ont répondu à l’appel en grand nombre et ont pu partager de beaux moments en famille.

I’m delighted to rise in the House today to speak to this conversation on Ontario’s 2016 budget, on behalf of the citizens of my riding of Burlington.", "Our budget is a commitment for our government to stay the course we mapped out in 2014 and to move forward with our four-part plan to invest in people’s talents and skills, create a dynamic and supportive business environment, invest in public infrastructure and built a secure retirement; all while committing to our path to balance, which will see us eliminate the deficit by next year—a remarkable achievement.", "Ontario is delivering on its number one priority: to grow the economy and create jobs through unprecedented investments in public infrastructure, increasing the competitiveness of our businesses and taking action in the transition to a low-carbon economy, while at the same time encouraging the very innovation inherent in the number one challenge facing humanity.", "At the same time, we must ensure that we are meeting the challenge head-on, and are also seizing the opportunities that come with it. Why is that? Because our government believes in the innovative capacity of Ontarians, of businesses and of entrepreneurs. This budget seeks to harness their knowledge, skills and abilities, which will not only enhance job creation, but also build on our efforts to make Ontario a global leader in sustainable technology and innovation, while fostering the kind of business climate that will encourage the leaders of tomorrow to remain right here in Ontario.", "Companies like Terrapure Environmental in my riding of Burlington are a great example of this. Relying on a highly skilled workforce, Terrapure develops innovative, cost-effective solutions to environmental challenges facing key industry sectors, helping businesses become more sustainable while supporting Ontario’s transition to a low-carbon economy. Further, as a national company that operates in regions of the country that have put a price on carbon—notably, BC and Quebec—Terrapure is benefiting from its investments and innovation, and consequently from the cap-and-trade marketplace, as so many other Canadian companies are and will continue to do.", "In my riding of Burlington, we have a nexus of small and medium-sized advanced manufacturers who rely on a highly skilled workforce. We know that seven out of 10 new jobs in Canada will be in highly skilled or management occupations which require higher education or specialized skills. That’s why our government is transforming student financial assistance to make college and university tuition free for students with financial need from families with incomes of $50,000 or lower. We’re also making tuition more affordable for middle-class families, because this will broaden access to public education and fulfill the hopes and dreams of thousands of Ontarians.", "In terms of creating a dynamic business environment, through the Business Growth Initiative, this budget makes significant investments to create a more highly skilled workforce, support world-class research at Ontario’s post-secondary institutions and provide significant support for innovation, research and development, so that we can shorten the distance between innovative ideas and commercialization.", "We’re also supporting competitiveness and job creation in key industry sectors, by partnering with colleges to establish a $20-million fund to be invested over three years. This fund will better connect colleges and Ontario companies on applied research projects that result in breakthrough products and services for sale at home and abroad. I know this kind of investment pays dividends; I see it already in my riding.", "We know that companies in Ontario operate in a global environment, and that keeping pace with other jurisdictions means enhancing the access to technology, particularly for our advanced manufacturers, a good number of which we have in Burlington. As a consequence, our government is supporting the development of these kinds of innovative technologies through a $35-million investment over the next five years that will establish a $50-million partnership in an advanced manufacturing consortium. This academic collaboration, with three leading Ontario universities—McMaster, Waterloo and Western—will focus on long-term industrial innovation projects to make Ontario a leader in fields like additive manufacturing and digital components and devices.", "Investments like these are helping Ontario prepare for and contribute to a rapidly growing tide of disruptive technological innovations that are bringing significant and permanent change to the global economy.", "Our government is preparing for tomorrow, starting today. This budget demonstrates how the four pillars of our plan are working together to establish conditions for a growing economy, well-paid jobs and a higher standard of living for all Ontarians. Together, we are building Ontario up, and I urge all members of this House to join us." ],

It’s a budget that will touch the lives of the young, the old and those in need. It will have a significant impact on the everyday lives of Ontario residents. That’s because it’s a plan that will support our economy, provide jobs and build our communities; but most importantly, it’s a plan for people, one that has compassion and yet works to eliminate the deficit.", "When Minister Sousa announced last week that Ontario will offer free tuition to low-income families, the reaction was instant. In fact, the announcement went viral, with young people all around the province tweeting the information out to Ontario and around the country.", "The Canadian Federation of Students said it was “an affirmation that government has taken student concerns and suggestions seriously.”", "The Council of Ontario Universities says it will “encourage greater participation in post-secondary education.”", "Starting in 2017-18, the new Ontario Student Grant will offer free tuition for students with financial need from families with incomes of $50,000 or less. But it doesn’t end there. Tuition will be more affordable for middle-income families as well. More than 50% of students from families with incomes of $83,000 or less will receive non-repayable grants in excess of average tuition.", "Our government understands the importance of making sure that access to quality education is fair to all Ontario students. I know a little bit about unequal access, since the country I was born in didn’t grant fair and equal access to education.", "Education pulls us all up. It’s a gift that keeps on giving, and no one can take this gift away from us. This is an investment in our youth, new immigrants, mature students and families. Eventually, as these students graduate and enter the workforce, it will translate into a more prosperous province.", "On that note, I want to point out the continued progress we are making on job creation. People are concerned about the economy and how it could affect their family and friends. They’re concerned that we are living in uncertain economic times, in a fragile economy, so they want to know that their government is taking care of their interests and their future, which is why Ontario’s number one priority is growing the economy and creating jobs.", "Let me tell you, Ontario is on track. Ontario is on track to create more than 300,000 net new jobs by 2019. That’s 300,000 jobs, bringing total job creation to more than 900,000 jobs since the recessionary low in 2009. In addition, our unemployment rate continues to be below the national average.", "Knowing how important it is to keep people working and keep Ontario competitive, the government is committing to $400 million over the next five years to the Business Growth Initiative. This will modernize business regulations, lower business costs and make more Ontario firms into global industry leaders. Just think about that. I just returned from a trade mission to India. What this means is that this is going to open doors for us and for Ontario businesses around the world, and that impacts on all of us.", "The 2016 budget also makes critical investments in the health and the wellness of Ontario residents. Hospitals are at the heart of every community. It’s where we go when our babies are born, when we are hurt and scared, and even when we have to say goodbye to loved ones. That’s why, for the first time in five years, hospitals are getting more money, a funding increase of $345 million. That’s fantastic news. In my riding of Halton we are served by four hospitals, and this funding is great news for them.", "Our government also knows how important it is to give more patients the option of staying home when they are sick or injured.

This budget makes historic investments, Mr. Speaker. That money will be funneled into Ontario hospitals along with schools, roads, bridges and public transit.", "My riding of Halton is an excellent example of why this infrastructure money is so important. The Halton region is one of Canada’s fastest-growing areas, and it’s important we keep people moving and provide them with the services and facilities they need. In fact, I’m pleased the budget includes additional GO train service in Milton and I’m glad to hear that the Ontario government is committed to working with freight rail companies to provide two-way, all-day rail services on the Milton GO line.", "Families will also be happy to know that the budget includes $333 million over five years to redesign and consolidate autism services in Ontario.", "To support the goal of ending homelessness, an additional $178 million will be put into affordable housing over the next three years.

This is a plan, Speaker, that will invest $13.5 billion in improvements across the GO Transit network to both increase ridership and reduce travel times.", "I was very proud to see, on page 71 of the budget, that there’s a section in there that talks about new and improved GO bus connections to the GO rail network for Cambridge and the Brantford communities. This means, as our government continues their ongoing dialogue with CN and CP, who are owners of parts of the track not only on the Kitchener corridor line but also on the Milton line—in order to be able to acquire and work with these communities to make sure we can deliver not only on our two-way, all-day service commitment, but also to be able to hopefully expand out to these areas sooner rather than later. As I said, we’ll be continuing to find new ways to work with CN, who owns a portion of the Kitchener line, to complete that.", "The other piece of the budget that I was really pleased to see was our ongoing commitment to health care, having a $1-billion increase in the budget to manage our health care system over the next few years. I wanted to specifically point out, on page 80, that the government has an ongoing commitment to ensure that Cambridge Memorial Hospital will continue its expansion and improvements in order to be able to better serve our communities of Cambridge and North Dumfries township.

That’s down 32,000. Their own forecast tells us that they’re not on track, which is quite opposite of what the member just said. In fact, if you look at last year’s budget, they said that next year they would create 93,000. This year they said, oops, it’s really only 78,000, down another 15,000 jobs. The next year it’s 99,000, again another oops: They are down to 93,000, down another 6,000 jobs. Speaker, I can add these together and we can see over 50,000 fewer jobs forecasted than they forecasted only a year ago.", "So they are not on track, and they are not on track with their deficit either. Yes, they came up with a fake number. The Financial Accountability Officer showed us. Last year, he said they were overstating their revenue projections for each year, and he encouraged the government to adjust their revenue projections to reflect this lack of revenue. Instead, they actually amped up their revenue projections, but it’s all from one-time money. It’s from the sale of Hydro One, from the cap-and-trade revenue and from other revenue that is merely one-time money. They have not met the revenue projections at all, and we are going to be faced with a severe hole in their budget come the election." ],

I came across a couple of things.", "I want to speak about something that’s going on in my riding: The Cordick program is facing closure due to the government’s incompetence when it comes to financial matters.", "There’s something else that came up. In our daily papers today, I came across an article by Jack Mintz. Everybody will be familiar with Jack Mintz, of course, on the Liberal side. Jack Mintz is a renowned economist and professor at the University of Alberta. He spent a lot of time in the early years of the Dalton McGuinty government providing advice and much policy consideration for the McGuinty government. Jack Mintz wrote an article in today’s paper and the title of it is, “Who Really ‘Rigs’ the System?” I’ll just paraphrase a little bit from it.", "The Mintz article states that Bernie Sanders has repeated this line in his nomination: that the system has been rigged. Dr. Jack Mintz says that Bernie Sanders does have a point but things are not as simple as he portrays.", "“What he should be railing against is politicians seeking power by bribing their base with free gifts from the government. If anyone is rigging the system, it is the vote-maximizing politician who achieves power with favours funded by others.” That comment struck me clearly as from the Liberal government.", "Jack Mintz goes on to say, “And, of course, politicians rig the system by shifting the tax burden of spending giveaways to future generations through higher deficits. Future taxpayers can’t vote, so they matter little to politicians today.” That’s another spot-on comment by Jack Mintz when it comes to this Liberal government.", "He goes on to talk about the “breathtaking list of subsidies for venture capitalists, automakers, renewable energy companies and financial businesses.”", "He goes on to state that the new Ontario Retirement Pension Plan will be a new tax for everyone except unionized employees. “The ORPP benefits are least for the lowest-income groups” in Ontario. That’s pretty powerful stuff coming from such a renowned economist and former adviser to the Ontario Liberal Party.", "He also goes on to say, “The most important rigging by Ontario politicians is the debt that must be paid back by future citizens. With some hocus-pocus, including counting one-time asset sales as revenue....” Hocus-pocus: That’s what the budget is.", "Anyway, Jack Mintz concludes his column in today’s paper with the statement, “Sanders is right. The system is rigged.” He also went on to explain who has rigged the system, and it’s the government opposite of us. Important—I hope more people read and see what Jack Mintz has written about.", "I want to just give a couple of other indications—just some proof points about the Jack Mintz article. One of the most important ones is found on page 286 of the budget. If you go to page 286—and I know some of the Liberal members will have it—there’s an interesting financial table in there. Since 2008, per capita incomes have gone up in Ontario by 16%. Over the same period of time, the per capita debt that the government has accumulated has gone up by 44%. Wages have gone up by 16%; this government’s debt has gone up by 44%. A little hocus-pocus there, a little shortchanging, short-selling, today’s voters, and certainly shortchanging tomorrow’s.", "One of the other things that Jack Mintz talks about in the article is found on page 297. There we see what’s really going on. This government, in 2009, had an average maturity on our debts of eight years. That debt is now maturing at 14 years. We’re ever extending the length of time. We keep re-amortizing the mortgage on Ontario. All of us know that in our homes, we try to pay off our mortgage. We try to reduce the amortization. We try to build up equity. This Liberal government keeps extending out the amortization every budget, every year. We know what that game is all about. It appears that they’ve got a little bit more money for cash flow at the end of the month, but they just keep extending the debt.", "You can go through this budget and go through the tables, on and on, and you can see what this government is doing. It’s not been of benefit to the people of Ontario. Also, if you take a look at these tables, you will see that although we’ve near doubled our debt in this province, our assets have only grown by about $30 billion. We’ve increased the debt over this period of time by $150 billion, but we’ve only increased our assets by $30 billion. That’s a hole; that’s a big hole.", "They talk about spending money on infrastructure? Their budget demonstrates that it’s not in infrastructure where we’re going into debt. We can’t pay the monthly bills because of the financial incompetence of this government. The money is not going into infrastructure; that’s not what we’re going into debt for. We could all accept going into debt to buy a house, or to buy an asset. But these guys are going into debt just to pay the credit card bill at the end of each month. They’re extending the mortgage and amortizing it longer so that they can pay the credit cards.", "This became really significant to me a little while ago—how this impacts people, how the financial budgetary measures of this government impact people. I had a Dr. Carl Rubino come to my office in December. Dr. Rubino is a clinical psychiatrist. He used to be a deputy minister in the Ontario government’s Ministry of Community and Social Services. He retired about 20 years ago, and devoted his retirement to a group called the Dalhousie Group, who provide a program called the Cordick Education and Treatment Program to youth who have intellectual disabilities, or mental health or behavioural problems, and who have been excluded from the education process. They can’t function in regular schools, so the Cordick Education and Treatment Program was developed to give these kids an opportunity to get an education. Dr. Rubino came to see me and he said, “This program is in jeopardy of closing. Can you help us out?” I said to Carl, “I’ll certainly do my best.” On February 11, 2016, this letter was sent to all the parents of those children at the Cordick Education and Treatment Program:", "“The Cordick Education and Treatment Program ... will, with regret, be forced to close its provision of the treatment side of the program as of February 29, 2016.", "“After 19 years of operation, and supporting over 600 youth from our local schools, who were not able to function in our mainstream school system due to significant social/emotional (mental health) struggles, this is a truly disappointing result.”", "I’m not going to read the whole letter. But that was the letter that was sent out to the families.", "To give you an idea of just how convoluted, complex and complicated—unnecessarily so—this government has made things: It took me two months to find out who funded this program from the government. There was funding from the Ministry of Education, there was funding from the children’s aid society and there was funding from the Ministry of Children and Youth Services. But guess what? No one knew who the program coordinator was. It took me two months. I eventually tracked the fellow down. His name is David Remington. He’s in Kingston. It’s interesting. I challenge everybody in this House: Go on the Ontario government website, their directory, and punch in the name David Remington or Barbara Landry. You will not find them. He’s a director; Barbara is a program supervisor. They do not exist—but they do. It took me two months to find them, and we did.", "On Monday of this week, we got approval for six more weeks of funding for the Cordick Education and Treatment Program. Let me put this in perspective here. The program runs the same as the school year. We were looking to keep the program running until June. The amount of money that the Cordick Education and Treatment Program needs to keep operating until June is a staggering—staggering—$25,000. That’s what they need. We’ve managed to get them enough funds to go to the middle of April—so far.", "You hear about this compassion and this protection of the vulnerable from the Liberal side. After three months, we finally squeezed out six weeks of funding for children who have social and emotional struggles and who can’t function in a school setting. It’s going to take more efforts and more time to get that funded to the end of June. We need to do these things, Speaker. Those, really, are their responsibilities. That’s who government is here to help: those who are disadvantaged, who are vulnerable and who need our assistance. That’s who we need to help, not Samsung. We don’t need to help Samsung, and we don’t need to help the Chris Mazzas of the world. We need to help those people who rely and are dependent on others for their well-being.", "But isn’t that a story? Two months to find a director—as I said, his name’s David Remington. I truly wish and hope—because there’s going to be somebody on the other side of this aisle, somebody in the Liberal benches who’s going to be approached one day by a treatment and education program in their riding that doesn’t have funding. They’re going to be coming, pleading with that MPP to find funding to keep the programs in their riding. I don’t mind sharing with you David Remington’s phone number. I’ll help you along. That’s what we need to do. But it is going to happen.", "We have to fix things, Speaker. We have to fix things. This is unacceptable. It is intolerable that a program that helps the emotionally disturbed and troubled and people with struggles, which is funded by the Ministry of Children and Youth Services, funded by the Ministry of Education, funded by the children’s aid society—funded by who knows what else. Why does it take three substantial bureaucracies of this government to find how to spend $25,000 effectively? I know they can spend money. We’ve all seen them do it. We all saw them take moments to spend a billion dollars on gas plants. But to take three months to get them to agree to spend $25,000 for kids who need help? That’s a tragedy. That cannot be justified in any manner.", "But that’s what we see this government do: Spend the big announcements. The $7 billion for Samsung, the billion dollars on the gas plants: Those are all easy to do. Nobody can hold them to account for anything. But I can tell you, the families in my riding, the moms and dads of these kids, are going to hold you to account. They are going to hold you to account, and you’re going to have to stand up and justify to them why you’ve let them down. Why did you only find enough to keep their program going for six weeks?", "I want to hear the response to the Cordick program during questions and comments. I want to see if any Liberal member will take up my challenge and go look for that program director of section 23 program funding. That’s what it’s called: section 23 program funding. Try to find it; and I want you to give me a call back, but take up the challenge. Go around and talk to the other groups in your ridings and see how their funding is being affected by your party—by this government. Maybe you’re fortunate. Maybe the Cordick program is the only one like that. I doubt it. I doubt it very much.", "We know that there are consultations going on across the province right now for these demonstration schools for alternative learning. They’re all in jeopardy, and they don’t make the headlines with this Liberal government. It doesn’t seem to pull at their heartstrings when it’s just moms and dads who can’t find a way to take care of their kids. That’s not a big photo op; it doesn’t sound good.", "They’ll get up there and talk about their budget. They’ll hide the truth. They’ll keep extending the mortgage, keep extending the amortization. It’s just a shell game. As Jack Mintz says, the system is rigged. And we know who has rigged it." ],

The reality is that this government, in one year, through one policy, decreased the costs that the insurance companies pay out in the province of Ontario by $1 billion.", "What did that actually look like? These are the facts. This is your evidence. You saw the same evidence when we were in committee together. The evidence is this: We used to have benefits that—one part still exists: catastrophically injured people get $1 million of coverage. That’s not a straight $1-million cheque; that’s $1 million to cover a lifetime for folks who are paraplegic, for their rehabilitation and for the services they need so that they can live in their communities, and it barely covers their necessities. They have that. Those are the most vulnerable, seriously injured people in our province. They are seriously injured folks, and they have $1 million of coverage.", "After that, people had the ability to claim up to $100,000.

People who needed $100,000 now only got $50,000.", "What makes matters worse—this is the part that’s the most terrible part of this whole thing—is that the government created a third category that didn’t exist before: the minor injury guideline. That cap is at $3,500, and 80% of people who make a claim in this province are forced into the minor injury guideline. Put bluntly, 80% of people who are injured in a car can only claim $3,500. Before, those very same people could claim up to $100,000, depending on how injured they were, but now they can’t.", "As a result, this is what has happened—and these funds aren’t settlement claims; those settlement claims are separate. This is strictly for patient care. That patient care amount went down to $3,500. I’m sure some of the doctors in your caucus will tell you that this is the reality. The care went down to $3,500, and 80% of people now only get that amount.", "What that did is, legitimately injured people do not get coverage anymore. You’ll hear countless stories of people telling you that, “We’re seriously injured but we are forced into the minor injury guideline and we don’t get coverage.” So legitimately injured people were cut off from care—and yes, there were some fraudulent people; absolutely. Those folks were cut off too.", "These caps—that $1 billion of savings didn’t just happen one year and stop. That’s forever. You are placing caps on the amount that people can claim; that has eradicated the issue of fraud in a massive way. I asked this question to the anti-fraud task force chair in the auto insurance committee. I said, “The amount of savings that you have enjoyed as the auto insurance industry from the reduction in these caps is colossal. It’s more than all of the fraud combined because you got rid of fraud and you also got rid of legitimately injured people.” But this is about the priorities of this government. This government doesn’t care about people. This government cares about the insurance companies ensuring that they get massive profits. They don’t care about the fact that fraud has been eradicated in a massive way. They’ve got rid of legitimately injured people as well as fraudulent people. They don’t care about that. They wanted to make sure that the costs went down for the insurance industry. Guess what? Surprise, surprise: Their profits have skyrocketed.", "What has happened to the premiums? This is the question. The premiums have gone up by 5% in that time period, from 2010 when those cuts came in. So we got less benefits but the premiums went up by 5%. How does that make any sense? On top of that, this government has taken away the right of people to sue if the insurance companies deny them a claim. So if I’m an insurance company and I deny you the right to have a cane or a walker, you can’t sue to get that cane or walker back. That’s what’s the your government has done.", "On top of that—here is the kicker—do you know which regions, which communities, are the hardest hit for auto insurance rates? It’s not downtown Toronto. It is an interesting point. The Auto Insurance Anti-Fraud Task Force: I asked them this question in committee directly. I said, “Sir”—this is in Hansard—“can you tell me which city fraud occurs in?”", "He said, “No, I can’t.”", "I go, “Can you not pinpoint a particular city? People claim that there’s higher fraud in Peel, that there’s higher fraud in Brampton.”", "“I cannot,” he said. He said, “I can only tell you that the GTA is more expensive than other parts of the province.” That’s all he could say.", "Those are the facts, and that’s fine. But the issue is that communities that are racialized, that have new immigrants, that are hard-off, that are lower-income—those are every community that has higher costs. Scarborough has higher costs, North York has higher costs, and Brampton and Malton—which are in Mississauga—have higher costs. All these communities are racialized, all these communities are low-income or lower-income, and all these communities have newer folks that have come to the country.", "This is exploitation, and this government is responsible for these policies that are exploiting racialized people, that are exploiting new Canadians, and that’s why we see very clearly the true priorities of this government. Those are some of the major issues.", "Let’s talk about health care. On the health care issue—we’ve talked about this but let’s just touch on it one more time—this government decides that a senior earning $19,500 is somehow affluent and they think that they can double their cost for a medical prescription. That is simply unacceptable. That is low. Why would you do that to seniors that are not even, in any way, in any broad definition, affluent? Why would you put that burden on them? That shows you, again, the priorities of this government.", "Let’s talk about the tuition promise that the government has given—again, great language. I support this idea. It’s a fantastic idea to ensure that people can afford post-secondary education. That is beautiful. It’s a beautiful idea. But when you start looking at the realities, initially the government didn’t really talk about if it’s indexed to inflation. They said, “No, no, it is. It is indexed to inflation.”", "What about the fact that tuition rates increase every year and we have skyrocketing tuition rates? “Oh, no, we actually didn’t factor that in. We didn’t really address that.” Well, how can it then be completely covered if it’s not indexed to the increasing tuition rates? Now the government is saying, “Hey, we’re going to backtrack. We’re going to address it,” which is great. I support you backtracking. It’s important. Sometimes you make mistakes.", "But the problem is that you’re making so many mistakes. You’re making all these mistakes. You made a mistake with respect to seniors, you made a mistake with the rollout of this plan because you didn’t factor in the fact that tuition rates increase, and—the biggest mistake—you’re selling off a public asset. It doesn’t make sense to do that. There’s no evidence to support this. In fact, the evidence supports not selling it off but you’re still going to do it because evidence doesn’t work with you.", "Here’s another example of evidence. I’ve got to give credit to our member from Parkdale–High Park for bringing up the issue of the Union Pearson Express. The model was so flagrantly a fail. It was such a failed policy. It was such a poor model, and no one can hold their head up when they look at that model. It makes no sense. What industrialized nation is making diesel trains now? What industrialized nation in the world is like, “Hey, we’re going to build a brand new diesel train. On top of that, let’s just compound it”—maybe there could be a reason for just that—“let’s make it go from one spot to only one spot.” Where every other airplane link in major cities of the world is integrated with the subways, and those are the ones that are successful—“No, we’re not going to integrate it with the subway. We’re just going to keep a separate line that goes from one spot to another spot and comes through communities that actually need public transit. But let’s not put a stop in those communities that could actually benefit from it.”", "The people of Davenport would love to have a train that would stop for them, but now they have a diesel train that can’t increase its stops because it takes too long for it to speed up and slow down, that’s not electrified and that’s way too expensive. It’s such a flawed model that no one is using it. No one is using your train because it’s not a good idea. You didn’t design it properly; you didn’t build it right. We told you before that there were serious problems with it, but you didn’t listen because you don’t like evidence-based decisions. You’ve got to look at the evidence. If the evidence isn’t there, you can’t do it. It doesn’t make sense.", "The final piece that I really want to touch on is the Anti-Racism Directorate. Now, I think that’s a great initiative. The government did a good job. Years and years of activists—over a decade of activists—raised issues around the fact that we need to have an anti-racism directorate or secretariat to provide that lens to address systemic racism. It’s a great issue; years and years of activists raised the issue. The NDP most recently pushed for this; New Democrats pushed hard for it. We’re honoured that the government decided to move on the issue.", "But we expected something. A budget just occurred. When this directorate was announced, a lot of people felt that, although it’s a great announcement and a great issue, an announcement without any funding is really just an empty promise. People have been a bit jaded, to be honest, with this government and its broken promises. Did this budget include any funding for the Anti-Racism Directorate? No. You think that you can trick people by announcing beautiful things without any funding; it’s not going to work anymore. People will see through that." ],

We are increasing funding to hospitals: $345 million toward hospitals. Having taught nursing for a number of years before I came here, the data and the evidence show that the focus must be on primary care and primary prevention, not tertiary care or the hospital piece. But we are increasing funding to hospitals to the tune of $345 million.", "The member opposite did not even mention that we are increasing a million dollars toward those affected by pregnancy and infant loss, $75 million dealing with hospice and palliative care—$170 dealing with the shingles vaccine for seniors between the ages of 65 and 70.

  "text" : [ "It’s a pleasure to join the debate and hear the opinions of all members of this House, from all sides. My colleague who just spoke I think certainly did a good job of outlining some of the positive aspects of this budget.", "I spent 18 years at the local level of government, at the regional level and the town level, before I came here. Those other members who have served at that level will know that we go through a very similar process, in that we all get together—the council gets together, forms a budget committee, and then everybody brings their ideas to the floor as to what they think should be in the budget and what shouldn’t be in the budget.", "I was counting, and I think I was first elected when I was still in my twenties. So this, I think, will be either my 30th or my 31st budget, and each one of them has been roughly the same. People have brought forward ideas that they’d like to see included. Of course, at the local level, you don’t get the partisanship. At this level, obviously, you get the parties bringing forward either what they have run on in the election or what their philosophy holds. But each and every time, Speaker, it should be a healthy exchange of ideas, which I think we are having today.", "But what used to make me mad at the local level, and makes me mad here as well, is that often the same people that are asking you to spend are the people that are also asking you to cut, in the same sentence. It doesn’t matter which party is in power: That simply can’t be done. Often you get fairly reasonable advice from the opposition party, saying, “We’d like to see this,” or, “If you tweaked this a bit or if you spent a bit more money there, perhaps that would work better.”", "But, Speaker, when I look at this budget—obviously, when you take it out, as a member of the government, your job is to defend it. It’s to tell people why you think it’s the best way that we should be conducting ourselves financially in the upcoming year.", "I’ll tell you, it was just a complete fluke, Speaker, that the day after the budget I was visiting a grade 10 class. They hadn’t paid much attention to the budget in the paper that day or they hadn’t gotten it online yet. When I explained the tuition advances that we’re proposing in this budget—grade 10s are pretty hard to impress, and these people were very impressed. I didn’t ask them their own income levels—that would have been rude—but I think I could see in some of their eyes that this was going to make a change in their lives. Suddenly, post-secondary education was something that they could do. I think that perhaps before that some of them had counted themselves out simply because they knew that the family means may not have allowed for that.", "When you see the things that are included in the budget—I find when I’m talking to people in my own community, when I talk about the tuition advances that we’ve been able to make, making university or college or skills training basically free for those people who earn under $50,000, and certainly about half-price for those who are earning under $83,000; when you look at the infrastructure investments that we know that this province needs—and people from all parties, there’s nobody in this room going to heaven based on what they’ve done on infrastructure in the past—we are finally starting to get a grip on what we need to do. We are spending $137 billion over the next 10 years and $160 billion over the next 12 years.", "I’ve seen the changes in the GO train service in my own community. I’ve seen those changes. I know what it means to the community. The community comes up and thanks me for it. It’s my job to do it. Certainly, you can tell it has made a change in their lives and that they’re able to go to the GO train station and essentially treat it as a subway. You don’t have to arrive at a certain time; you arrive and a train will show up. When you go throughout the rush hour, trains are running in every 15 minutes, every 10 minutes. During the day they’re there every 30 minutes.", "We’ve just invested about $2.5 billion in Oakville in a brand new hospital. It’s the sort of thing you can only do if you plan for it in advance. It’s only a thing you can do if you don’t run from election to election. Instead, you look 10 or 12 years into the future and put the political election cycle to one side and you start to work on a forecast, because you know—", "Interjections." ],

Certainly, all of us have been approached by parents who are dealing with children who are dealing with the challenges of autism. We see the investment in here for autism services. We’ve all said it should be done. We’ve all tried to find a way to do it. This budget allows us to invest about a third of a billion dollars for autism services, little things like hospital parking, things that people complain daily about. I complain about it; they’re simply too high. We’ve been able to do things like that.", "I think, on balance, if you look at this from an objective point of view, you put the partisanship aside and say, “Is this a good way to manage the budget for the next year in the province of Ontario?” When you compare Ontario on a financial basis relative to the rest of the world, Ontario is doing very well and should continue to do well. It’s budgets like this that plan responsibly for that to happen. I understand it’s the job of the opposition to criticize, and I expect them to do exactly that, but what I’m finding in the community is that people, by and large, think that this is a reasonable budget and that this House should support it." ],

So, Speaker, I would need much more than the nine minutes I’ve been allotted here today to try and fully address that, but in the few minutes I have, I’m going to do the best I can to just highlight some of the advancements that have been made not only in this particular budget but in previous budgets by our government on behalf of northern Ontario.", "What I would add, before I make my comments, is that all of us on this side of the House are aware that the Leader of the Opposition, of course, sat in the federal House for nine years and had plenty of opportunity to represent the interests of northern Ontario when he was there, and I think, over time, it will become a bit more clear for all of us who are working here in the provincial Legislature whether or not he did a very good job, if a job on that front at all. So we’ll look at that as time unfolds and as we get near the end of this particular election cycle and the beginning of a new one.", "I want to begin by—and hopefully somewhere along the line the Leader of the Opposition may have an opportunity to correct his record. He stood on his feet, I think at least once, maybe twice, in the House to tell people—not just in northern Ontario but primarily in northern Ontario—that recreational hunting and fishing licences are increasing; in fact, he’s wrong. I just want to say that clearly, Speaker: Recreational hunting and fishing licences are not increasing. The leader of the official opposition has stood on his feet at least once and said that. If he’s not going to correct his record, then I’m going to have to do it for him. Unequivocally, that is not the case. I’m not sure why he said that, but perhaps he can go back and just find some capacity to check on the research there, because it’s just not the case. It’s wrong. I apologize for him—not on behalf of him; I shouldn’t do that. He can do that on his own. It’s wrong.", "On a bigger piece, we have some items that I really do want to highlight in terms of investments that have been made that have resulted in investment in northern Ontario and have directly resulted in investment in northern Ontario.", "In 1995, the Conservatives took a public policy position—that’s their choice: “We’re not in the mass transit game.” They did that in 1995. By the time 2003 rolled around, when we won the election in 2003, the Bombardier plant in my riding was down to 200 to 250 employees. Our decision as a government to invest in mass transit in the province of Ontario has led to that particular manufacturing facility going from 200 to 250 people up to around 1,400 or 1,500. It may be down to 1,200 right now, I’m not sure, but maxing out somewhere in the range of 1,400 to 1,500 employees. That is, by far, the single-biggest private sector employer in Thunder Bay or northwestern Ontario. The impact of 1,000 private sector jobs that pay well, that have pensions and benefits, to a community like Thunder Bay and northwestern Ontario is difficult to calculate, but of course it is very, very large.", "What continues on that front is the fact that we have articulated very clearly our intention to continue to invest in a large way in infrastructure over the next 12 years: $160 billion. But when we hear infrastructure, what does it mean? Well, a lot of that infrastructure spending—and the Minister of Transportation is here and very supportive, because of course what it means is that there will be more continued investment in mass transit. What that means is, there will be more continued opportunity for the Bombardier plant in Thunder Bay to bid on and win those contracts so that the employee workforce of 1,200, 1,300, 1,400 can be maintained for years into the future. That opportunity will be presented to them as a result of our broader infrastructure investments.", "Speaker, I want to make another point as well. Previously, the member from Bramalea–Gore–Malton was speaking about insurance rates and how we’re talking—at least, I am now, in terms of the northern Ontario context. He brought a private member’s bill into the Legislature three, four, five years ago that would have helped insurance rates in southern Ontario, but the number that it would have increased rates by in northern Ontario—it was something like 35% or 40%—was never argued by the member. He was advocating on behalf of his constituency. I won’t take any affront to that, but it’s important to note that, in the northern Ontario context of my speech, he brought in a private member’s bill that would have increased insurance rates in northern Ontario 30%, 35%, 40%. He doesn’t debate it. I’ve spoken against it here, I’ve spoken against it in northern Ontario communities, and it has never been challenged. But that’s okay, on that one; he was working for his constituents. But in northern Ontario, that would have been the impact and the effect.", "Our northern highways program in northern Ontario, again, with the help of the Minister of Transportation—the single, high-water mark for investment in northern highways previous to our party coming into power in 2003 was about $250 million. That was the most money that had ever been expensed on northern highways in any single year. This year’s budget—thank you, Minister of Transportation—through the northern highways program, will see that annual allocation this year be at $550 million. Speaker, it has reached as high as $650 million, and I think we even might have reached $700 million in one particular year.", "Overall, the increase in the northern highways budget since we came to power in 2003, the incremental number—not just the base number that usually is there—is in the billions. It’s massive in terms of what we’ve been investing in northern highways. People in my riding of Thunder Bay–Atikokan and in Thunder Bay–Superior North are very supportive and very happy to see the investments that have been going on for a number of years in northern highways.", "One example that stands out for all of us, of course, is the four-laning that is occurring—a large part of it actually done now; maybe one third of that distance, give or take, has been completed between Thunder Bay and Nipigon. A very significant project for us, and one that I say has been requested for decades by people. When are we going to four-lane the highway? Well, we’re doing it now, and it’s going on.", "One other major highway infrastructure project that we’re starting—there are not shovels in the ground—that I’m very proud of: A few years ago, I was pleased to announce about $4 million. We started an environmental assessment on a piece of highway in Thunder Bay between Arthur Street and Balsam Street called the expressway. People in Thunder Bay will be very well aware of this particular stretch.", "There are six intersections that exist on that stretch of highway—it’s called an expressway, Speaker. Since it was first built, much of the expansion and population growth in Thunder Bay has been on the western side of that expressway. Now much of the population has to cross these intersections, which, in my opinion, are very, very dangerous. There’s an intersection at Arthur Street, at the Harbour Expressway, at Oliver Road, at John Street, at Red River Road and at Balsam Street—on an expressway.", "We’ve started and are close to completing the environmental assessment—a $4-million commitment. I think the last public information session on that piece of roadway will be happening this spring or sometime this summer. Once that is completed, I’m going to be looking to the Minister of Transportation on my right here to say, “Here’s what we have. Here are the design options that have come back. Here’s another long-overdue project that needs support in the city of Thunder Bay—a northern infrastructure project that helps these communities be safe in their own neighbourhoods.”", "It is very important, Speaker. The recommendations will come in, and we will be looking for further assistance from the Minister of Transportation to help those projects go forward.", "I’m seeing that my time is almost up. I wanted to speak quite significantly, if I had the opportunity, on health care. I don’t have that opportunity. I have 40 seconds left.", "What I will highlight, as quickly as I can: Years ago, angioplasty was established in Thunder Bay, for the first time in the history of northern Ontario: 700 people a year, lives saved; jobs created; better health care in northern Ontario at Thunder Bay Regional Health Sciences Centre. An angioplasty program: people not having to come to southern Ontario to receive that life-saving service.", "We very recently announced with the Minister of Health, on top of the angioplasty program, that very soon, within the next few years, we will have established a cardiac surgery program to complement that stand-alone angioplasty program.", "Very significant investments in northern Ontario. The list is much longer, Speaker, and I’m sorry that my time is up." ],

We see driving costing us more.", "The only places I’ve seen health care improvements is where the community has raised money and actually funded their own projects. Unfortunately, too often we see, a year or two later, the facilities being shut down, like they were in Winchester, where we completed a major reconstruction or addition. The ICU is closed. Some of the doctors say that the doors are chained shut. These things are under two years old. Look at the money we put into that, and that’s the result. Meanwhile, we have money to pay for political things like the gas plants—wasted billions—but we can’t operate our health care units." ],

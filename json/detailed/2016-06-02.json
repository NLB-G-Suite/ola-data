  "text" : [ "I rise in the Legislature today to speak to Bill 135, the Energy Statute Law Amendment Act. What’s clear is that across the province, families are struggling to make ends meet, yet Ontario ratepayers continue to see unaffordable increases to their hydro bills. There’s nowhere in North America where energy rates have risen like they have in Ontario over the past few years. While the Liberals would rather blame this rate increase on the weather, it’s clear this is a direct result of years of scandal, waste and mismanagement in the energy sector. Companies see rates as a barrier to doing business in the province, and average Ontario families continue to struggle to pay their hydro bills.", "With respect to electricity, the main issue with this bill is that it removes the autonomy of the Independent Electricity System Operator. The bill centralizes all transmission and electricity sector planning with the minister’s political staff and cabinet, thereby overriding the industry experts at the Independent Electricity System Operator and the Ontario Energy Board.", "When it comes to choosing what is best for the province and the electricity system within it, that decision will be made with a partisan and political lens. Building power lines to the north could easily be vetoed by a desire to bring in hydroelectric-generated power from Quebec. Clearly, energy is a necessity of life, and the Liberal government should not be able to dangle needed electricity projects that would improve affordability and reliability in front of certain ridings come election time to secure victory. We should do what’s best for the province, not what’s best for the Liberal government.", "By making the Independent Electricity System Operator bend to the will of the cabinet, the political goals may differ from what is needed on more than just transmission. Essentially, the minister or the government can create whatever policy they like, on whichever grounds they like. That is hardly a stable system that acts in the best interests of all Ontarians.", "The Independent Electricity System Operator does not have the ability to object to any of the directives or targets that are given by the ministry, even if functionally impossible. They are forced to create an implementation plan that the minister can alter or outright reject until he or she is satisfied. Again, Speaker, the Independent Electricity System Operator cannot reasonably object to any project.", "Further, there is no requirement for the minister to hold consultations with Ontarians or people within the energy sector. The bill only suggests that the minister must consult with “groups that the minister considers appropriate given the matters being addressed by the long-term energy plan.” Even if the government does consult these groups, they’re under no obligation to act on their advice. They are only legislatively required to “consider the results of such consultation.” Since cabinet and the minister write and approve the long-term energy plan, none of the documentation rationalizing any of the plans will be made public.", "In addition, because the Ontario Energy Board and the Independent Electricity System Operator are no longer allowed to hold hearings or raise opposition to any plans put forward by the government, the technical analysis regarding cost to impact on energy supply will not be brought forward. This means that if the government wants to move ahead with an expensive transmission project, they can put the entire cost onto the rate base without any objection from any entity.", "The government can also do this even if the project is not needed in the first place. For example, the Caledonia power line, which does not connect to the grid, was built even with objections and analysis from the Ontario Energy Board. Speaker, imagine what kinds of decisions will be made if no objections or analysis are ever required.", "However, the changes to the Ontario Energy Board Act and the Electricity Act are not the only problems with the bill. This bill will also allow the government to quietly enact home energy audits through changes to the Green Energy Act and the proclamation of past sections of that act. The bill also leaves the door open to applying these mandatory audits to businesses, as well.", "This government has shown, time and time again, that it can’t get anything right, and that it’s not concerned with what is best for Ontarians. It is only concerned with its own political survival.", "As I said at the outset of my remarks, I’ll be opposing this bill. This bill does nothing to combat skyrocketing energy prices. In fact, this government doesn’t appear to have any plan to do that. Instead, this bill seeks to give broad, new powers to the minister.", "On energy, this government continues to show that it just doesn’t get it. When they’re not talking about banning natural gas, they’re talking about selling Hydro One. This Liberal government’s energy policies are not only hurting ratepayers; they are seriously damaging our economy and businesses.", "My colleagues and I continue to question the government on hydro-related issues, and we’ll continue to do that. In fact, we called for specific action to be reflected in this year’s budget, which included a viable plan to deal with rising energy costs. Instead, the Liberal government put forward a budget full of tax increases and limited funding that will do nothing to ease the pressures of life on my constituents in Whitby–Oshawa.", "Governing is about priorities. It is clear that this government is more concerned about banning natural gas than putting in place policies that make hydro affordable for Ontarians. I want to take the opportunity to assure Ontarians that we will continue to stand up for ratepayers in this province while the clock runs out on a government whose moment has come and gone." ],

He goes on to criticize this government. He has written to the Honourable Bob Chiarelli. He talks about his meeting. Basically, in Sudbury, in the city of Greater Sudbury, there is Greater Sudbury Utilities, and then 30,000 people who live in the city of Greater Sudbury are serviced by Hydro One. What the city of Greater Sudbury wanted to do was quite simple: It was to purchase the assets of Hydro One so that everybody in Sudbury would pay the same hydro rate under Greater Sudbury Utilities. You figure that could be possible, Madam Speaker? Absolutely not. The government was so bound and determined that they were going to sell off Hydro One to the highest bidder so that they could bring money in that they failed to take, basically, an equitable view of the taxpayers of Sudbury and the ratepayers of Sudbury. So Greater Sudbury Utilities was never able to have a truthful conversation so that everybody in Sudbury would be covered by Greater Sudbury Utilities. Instead, half of us use Hydro One and pay through the roof." ],

The reality is that in this province, we have a very comprehensive energy supply system that is not cheap; it is not free. It takes hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars to keep our energy supply available. Look at what is going to be required to refurbish Darlington, the Bruce Power cost. These are billions of dollars that are needed to invest in our energy sources, whether it be nuclear, whether it be natural gas, whether it be hydroelectric.", "The other parties think that somehow this is done for free, that somehow we get this magical power when we turn on the light switch in our homes. It is an incredible investment that we’ve made in this province, and it is really illusionary to think that somehow you can freeze hydro rates, as the former Conservative Party did. I remember in 2003, we had a massive blackout. I remember standing at the corner of Avenue Road and Eglinton directing traffic because the Conservative government didn’t invest in energy supply. So whether it’s the natural gas we’re investing in, whether it’s nuclear we’re investing in, you can’t have a free lunch." ],

I think that one of the key issues he identified that we feel very strongly about is the question of where the decisions are being made, the concentration of decision-making by the political side of the equation when in fact it should be that the planning is based on engineering and on science, on best practices and the kinds of things that stand up to public scrutiny and transparency. That is the key to good decision-making, not ones where you are legislated an avenue into a minister’s office, as opposed to the engineering work that’s done before decisions are made. That is the problem.", "Of course, if we look at the cost of hydro, it is out of control. It is not competitive. It acts as a deterrent for investment and for job creation. Those are the kinds of things that we on this side feel are the most important. This bill falls short of providing that kind of transparency that taxpayers need." ],

That’s because this is a hot topic in the province of Ontario. The people of my riding and, quite frankly, people wherever I travel within this province—this is one of the first issues out of their mouths: the price of hydro in the province of Ontario and the concerns that brings upon a family.", "The members talked about blackouts that happened in 2002. Well, we have blackouts that are happening today. They may not be off-the-grid blackouts, but they’re blackouts because people can’t afford to pay their bills. That’s a concern. When we talk about dollars and the costs that go into producing a hydro system in the province of Ontario, how about the wasted dollars that they put into that energy file in this province?", "I’ll be happy to go further into those things in my portion of the debate. It’s definitely something that needs to be highlighted in this House. People on the other side of the bench—the government—need to get it. I think these new members—I’m not sure what they talk to their constituents about, but when my constituents come and talk to me, it’s about how they can’t afford any higher hydro costs, that there isn’t any more money in their budget, that they struggle to turn the lights on and they struggle to heat their homes. And it’s not necessarily electric heat. It’s just keeping the lights on, keeping the house warm. Making sure there’s enough food on the table these days is a struggling attempt for many people in this province.", "So for the member opposite to be talking about “it costs a lot of money for the energy file,” I think he’d better look at his own back door and see really where the money has been spent on the energy file." ],

I have those discussions on a regular basis with constituents whom I represent in Whitby–Oshawa.", "In those discussions, it’s not only families who tell me that it’s a struggle to make ends meet; it’s local businesses as well. I recently met with some members of the Whitby Chamber of Commerce and the Oshawa chamber of commerce, and they told me that it’s really a struggle, given the unaffordable increases that they’re trying to deal with overall.", "They also spoke specifically to the energy rates and how high they’ve risen over the years here in Ontario. They just see it as an impediment to succeeding with their businesses and creating jobs here locally. Those companies see the rates as a barrier to even expanding their businesses as well. In summary, I think that there are a lot of challenges within this bill.", "Another aspect that constituents tell me they’d like to see more of as we move ahead is consultation.

They have a lot to say, Speaker, and I have a lot to say, and I have to warn the government now that none of it is going to be positive, as this bill does nothing to make people feel better.", "The most common complaint I hear is about the ever-increasing cost of hydro in the province of Ontario. I hear it from families who are furious that their hydro bills are going through the roof. Prices went up by 80% between 2004 and 2014, and they’re still going up. One constituent called to tell me what he had done, which he thought was a very wise approach: conservation. Quite frankly, I agreed with him, thinking that conservation was the right way to go. Then he continued to tell me the rest of his story. He managed to conserve so well that his usage went down to zero kilowatt hours, but he still received a bill for delivery charges. It just infuriated him that he had to pay those charges.", "I hear from businesses that tell me about skyrocketing hydro bills and how they’re making it really hard to survive. We know that businesses are failing, thanks to energy costs. When my colleague from Timiskaming–Cochrane spoke to this bill, he told us about businesses in his riding in the north that use a lot of energy, and they actually find it cheaper to run diesel generation than use electricity. That’s incredible. One of the biggest selling points for electric cars these days is their much lower fuel costs, but diesel generators can be cheaper than electricity coming from the grid. What sort of energy system allows this to happen? People are angry about what they have to pay for electricity, and so they should be.", "They’re also angry that this government is selling Hydro One, because they know that it will only add to what they have to pay. They know that privatization will mean higher bills than they’re already paying. They know that they didn’t ask for it, and they know that they never gave anyone permission to sell it. After all, Hydro One belongs to the people of Ontario—public not private. But this Liberal government comes along and says, “Too bad. We’re selling it. It’s gone. We’re selling your property.” And they’re allowed to get away with it.", "So here we have a public utility that built Ontario over the past 110 years or so and a grid that has spread its tentacles throughout Ontario and facilitated the growth of a manufacturing economy, and was, quite frankly, the envy of the world. But what has this government done with that? Well, let’s listen to what the Auditor General had to say, because she had quite a bit to say about this in her report last year when she spoke about electricity planning in Ontario.", "She noted that determining future electricity demands requires a huge amount of technical planning, and that this was reflected in the 2004 amendments to the Electricity Act, which required “the Ontario Power Authority ... to conduct independent planning and prepare an ‘Integrated Power System Plan.’” The Ontario Energy Board was “to review and approve the technical plan” so that the interest of consumers would be protected. That was how electricity planning was supposed to be conducted in Ontario, according to the 2004 amendments.", "Sadly, that isn’t the case. As the Auditor General says, “Over the last decade, this power system planning process has essentially broken down, and Ontario’s energy system has not had a technical plan in place for the last 10 years. Operating outside the checks and balances of the legislated planning process, the Ministry of Energy has made a number of decisions about power generation that have resulted in significant costs to electricity consumers.”", "She also pointed out that although the OPA developed the technical plans—one in 2007 and one in 2011—neither went forward. Instead, the ministry published its long-term energy plan, a shorter, more policy-oriented document. The Auditor General noted several problems with this plan, what she called their policy plan, and that it had no cost-benefit analysis or other alternatives.", "There’s a lack of transparency. Consumers are not being informed of the reasons behind the rising electricity costs. She questioned the stakeholder consultation process, and with good reason: After a two-month consultation process, the ministry couldn’t provide her with a summary of the responses that they received. The plan was released just five days after the consultation period ended. I think that any reasonable person would agree that’s not enough time to digest the consultation and incorporate the input into the plan.", "That’s a pattern that we’ve seen over and over and over again with this government. Consultations are no more than window dressing. We saw it earlier this year when the budget was introduced before the legislative committee could do their pre-budget report. Before that report was tabled, the government already had their budget written, so nothing from the people of Ontario whatsoever.", "The Auditor General has also pointed out that “the ministry has effectively cut the Ontario Energy Board ... out of the picture.” One of the main reasons, Speaker, as you know, for the OEB is to protect the interests of consumers and to consider the prices and adequacy, reliability and quality of our electricity service. But with no oversight of the power planning system and a very limited oversight of the generation costs, the Auditor General notes that the OEB cannot do what it’s meant to do. That’s a problem, Speaker. The two technical plans that were submitted never made it far enough to get reviewed by the OEB, something the OEB is required to do by legislation from 2004.", "The policy plans that the ministry says replace the technical plans are not required by legislation, which also means the OEB is not mandated to review them. The OEB wasn’t consulted at all over the privatization of Hydro One. It’s one of the largest privatizations of a government-owned generation asset in Canada, and the Liberal government sees no benefit in engaging the Ontario Energy Board, a board whose job it is to protect consumers’ interests. That is just more evidence of the unbelievable arrogance of this government.", "This arrogance and mismanagement of our hydro system is costing the people of Ontario dearly. Smart meters were supposed to move power consumption from peak times to other times of the day. That didn’t work and it cost us $2 billion. A boondoggle, they call it—$2 billion. Think how that money could have been spent. We are starving our hospitals. We have wait-lists for residential services for people with severe developmental disabilities whose parents are unable to adequately care for them, people struggling to survive on minimal social assistance payments, autistic children over the age of five being denied treatment they were promised, yet we can blow $2 billion on failed smart meter plans. Brilliant.", "We dump $1.5 billion in surplus power every year from our electricity market. The Auditor General reported last year that we actually paid $32.6 million between 2009 and 2014 for other jurisdictions to take the power we produced. And let’s not forget the gas plants scandal, Speaker—another billion dollars more down the drain, thanks to this government’s energy file. And how does the government address their abysmal record? By bringing us this bill that puts the legislative requirements in place that actually codify their bad behaviour.", "As bad as the past 10 years of electricity policy have been, there has at least been a legislative framework that, if followed, would have prevented some of the worst excesses, but this bill wipes all of that away and gives the minister free rein to bring further havoc to Ontarians. Several respected professionals presented to the committee. By the looks of my time, I’ll have to try to get them in and their quotes and what they said at committee during that time, because there’s definitely a lot to say on this bill and the hurt it does to the people of this province." ],

All of a sudden, we have to have the downtown relief line built, which will take 14 years, before we can have the Yonge subway.", "I’m asking if this government has discussed the possibility, which many experts have recommended, of a Yonge subway express route which would tunnel under the existing Yonge subway, as is done in many other cities, like Seoul, Korea. It would stop only at major stops along the way. It would be very fast. Maybe they could charge extra for it. It would stop at, say, Union, Bloor, the Eglinton LRT, Sheppard and, of course, up in Richmond Hill.", "We all know that a Yonge subway expansion would get tens of thousands of commuters off our roads. Maybe we need to reallocate, as I’ve been begging, money that’s being spent on very low-priority bus lanes.

They were willing to do work that others would not. They were willing to do work that too often was very hazardous, but they were doing it in order to achieve a better life for themselves and for their families and children.", "The names on the memorial that was dedicated that day represent much more than a list of those who were lost. They were human beings. They were loved and they themselves loved. They hoped and they dreamed. They built our province’s railways, they built our bridges, they worked in mines, they dug up our tunnels and they constructed the roadways we drive on today.", "From the start of their immigration to Canada in the 19th century, often under very harsh conditions, to playing the predominant role that they do in the construction industry in the latter half of the 20th century, Italian Canadians have built this province with their sweat and with their spirit. They sacrificed for their families and too often they sacrificed their own lives due to unsafe working conditions. They are a huge part of our province’s and our very country’s heritage.", "While we remember those we’ve lost in the past, we also must remember there are those who could be lost in the future. It’s an excellent time to recommit ourselves to simply eliminating workplace injuries, illnesses and fatalities for all Canadians and Ontarians.", "We know that these incidents are preventable. We know we all have a role to play in ensuring they are prevented; it doesn’t matter if you work in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, in an office, in a mine, on a construction site or in a school. We were again reminded of this yesterday during Injured Workers’ Day.", "As we continue to build our province up, we also need to do what the fallen workers memorial committee wants us to do. We need to build a culture of prevention, in which workplace deaths and injuries are not acceptable and where safety is always a top priority, because one injury or one fatality is just one too many.", "The memorial that was dedicated that day is a living reminder that when workplaces are unsafe, families suffer, people lose friends, co-workers are traumatized and companies lose both money and their own reputations.", "Speaker, we’re committed to building health and safety in all of Ontario, working with men and women throughout this province. It’s a shared responsibility. But no matter how much training we bring in, no matter how much legislation, how we mandate that training or how many fines we issue, if the rules aren’t followed on the ground by the companies, or sometimes by the workers themselves, and if workers aren’t looking out for each other, it all goes for naught. We need to be in this together. Lives are at stake.", "The Italian Fallen Workers Memorial is a sobering reminder of the duty we have to each other. It’s a reminder of those who lost their lives ensuring that we have the province we have today. Today, with these gentlemen in attendance, let us remember those who worked hard building this province up to what it is, those who paid the ultimate price, and let us remember that we’ve got a lot more work to do." ],

That same afternoon, I was honoured to represent our leader, Patrick Brown, and my colleagues in the Ontario Progressive Conservative caucus at the formal unveiling of the Italian Fallen Workers Memorial, unveiled to the city on the day recognized worldwide as being dedicated to the victims of work-related injuries. I was glad to join the Minister of Labour at both of those events, and I appreciated the fact that he acknowledged my presence at the second one.", "Located at the Columbus Centre here in Toronto, the memorial is made up of 11 columns which represent the decades since 1900 and bear the names of fallen workers of Italian heritage discovered by a committee of volunteer researchers over the last six years. The contribution of Italian Canadians has had a vast impact in the building of this great nation and our great province. However, until the dedication of this memorial, those losses were an unrecognized part of that legacy and our history. These Italian Canadian workers literally laid the foundation for our prosperity, and they are now being honoured for their sacrifice.", "While organizers originally estimated finding between 300 to 400 names, they’ve uncovered over 944 verified names of victims of workplace fatalities for people of Italian origin in Ontario and over a thousand names in total. Subsequent names will be added annually.", "To the families of these fallen workers, I say, Partecipo al tuo dolore. I share your sadness.", "I’d also like to take this opportunity to thank Marino Toppan, the activity coordinator for the project; Nick Pinto, who was involved in a memorial in Vaughan; and Villa Charities Inc., which played a key role in the memorial project. I also want to recognize our former colleague Joe Cordiano, who I understand was instrumental in the project as well.", "While this memorial reminds us of the many Canadians of Italian heritage who have been tragically killed in the workplace, it’s also a powerful tool so that we cannot forget about all Canadians who died in the workplace.", "I remember my shock and horror when I first read about the two Brampton men killed in separate workplace incidents on May 10. On the day a boom lift type of vehicle crushed a 20-year-old construction worker at a new housing development, a lawn-cutting machine rolled over a 77-year-old worker at a golf course. Unfortunately, incidents like these are all too frequent across Canada.", "This past April 21, I stood in this House to discuss the number of workplace deaths in Canada. According to the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety, in 2014 there were 919 workplace deaths recorded in Canada, and that’s up from 902 in 2013. This represents an average of more than two deaths on the job each and every day across the country. From 1995 to 2014, over 18,000 people lost their lives due to work-related causes across Canada, an average of 918 deaths per year. In Ontario alone, 226 workers reportedly lost their lives in 2015 due to workplace tragedies or occupational disease.", "What’s even more tragic is that it’s estimated that 90% of these workplace deaths are entirely preventable.", "The day of mourning is also an opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to ensure that all our workplaces are safe. As MPPs, we must work together to improve workplace safety, with the goal of preventing any death or injury in the workplace. We have a responsibility to ensure that workplace safety is a priority and that our workplaces become safer, not more hazardous.", "One of the speakers at the fallen workers memorial was a woman who had been widowed by a workplace accident in 2009. In her address, she stated that the best way to honour the men and women on the memorial is for everyone to remember and remain committed to worker safety in all workplaces. We must do this, not only for these fallen Italian Canadians, but for all Ontario workers whose lives have been cut short by workplace accidents.", "I’d again like to thank the organizers and volunteers behind the Italian Fallen Workers Memorial. I think the timing is especially important because this month we mark the beginning of Italian Heritage Month.", "Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, I am running out of time, but I want to again express my view that we need to do more to make our workplaces safer.", "I want to express my appreciation to my colleague the member for Nipissing, Vic Fedeli, for his thoughts and his contribution to the remarks that I prepared for this afternoon, as well as to a volunteer who has been working in my office for the last three weeks, Tim McIntosh, who’s joining me here, who helped me organize my thoughts this afternoon.", "Once again, thank you very much, Mr. Speaker." ],

I had the good fortune to work with many Italian Canadians. They taught me a lot. They taught me a lot about hard work, how to do the job right and to take pride in the work. You see evidence of that work for generations all across this province, and I’m certainly proud to be a part of that history.", "My riding of Essex can boast that approximately 20% of residents claim some level of Italian ancestry, and that is evident in just about every community one might visit in Essex county. From wineries to greenhouses, farms and factories, Italian immigrants have built successful businesses and are leaders who continue to contribute and make our riding a great place to live and raise a family.", "The history of Italian workers in Canada is deeply textured, however. It is a story of enduring hardship, of leaving family and loved ones behind, of coming to a place where you don’t speak the language, and even enduring bigotry and being treated like second-class citizens. Italian immigration to Canada began in the late 1800s, with most arriving between the period of 1900 and the First World War. Like other European countries, Italy was targeted by labour recruitment campaigns on behalf of the railroad, mining and forestry industries. There was a strong need for labour from Europe as our country continued to grow and the railways opened up the West to settlement." ],

In some cases, Italian workers were traded like commodities. They found themselves sent to labour camps in northern Ontario, indefinitely. Seeking an opportunity for a more prosperous life for themselves and their families, many Italian men left the Old World for the New World and made a perilous journey across the North Atlantic. Most landed in the US first and then came to Canada.", "When they arrived in Canada, they found themselves doing gruelling work in unimaginable conditions. The dangers were ever-present. At that time in our history, workers being maimed and killed was largely looked at as the cost of doing business, the cost of building a nation. Whether it was on a railway or the Great Plains or deep in a mine in northern Ontario or on a construction site in downtown Montreal, Italian immigrants sacrificed their time, their bodies and even their lives.", "It is fitting that these workers who have given so much to make Canada what it is today are honoured with a memorial, as we should always honour all workers who make the ultimate sacrifice while simply trying to provide for themselves and their families. It’s also fitting that we honour the over 830 names on the monument here in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario and that we use this opportunity to remind ourselves that one worker killed is one too many and to remind ourselves that in this place we have the power to enact laws which mean that fewer workers will leave in the morning and never return home to their loved ones. In thinking about this statement, I am reminded of the message from the annual National Day of Mourning: We must mourn the dead and fight like hell for the living.", "On behalf of my riding of Essex, I want to thank the committee members who dedicated their time and energy to see this project through to completion: Marino Toppan, Gino Cucchi, Fulvio Florio, Fortunato Rao, Mario Marra, Odoardo di Santo, Paola Breda and Pal Di Iulio. Thank you, and congratulations to you all.", "I would also like to thank the donors and the sponsors, Speaker. That list is far too long for the time that I have here today, but they all know who they are and I want to thank them again. I would also like to invite every Ontarian to visit the memorial at the Columbus Centre here in Toronto and to pay their respects to these Italian Canadians who lost their lives on the job. Lastly, I’d like to thank the families of the workers who have perished for enduring the loss.

Currently, section 5(1) of the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act states, “A person shall not hunt or trap specially protected wildlife or any bird that belongs to a species that is wild by nature and is not a game bird.” This section creates protections for all birds that are not otherwise protected by the federal Migratory Birds Convention Act.", "Bill 205 amends the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act of 1997 to permit the hunting and trapping of double-crested cormorants. This amendment to the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act places double-crested cormorants in a category of birds along with the American crow, the brown-headed cowbird, the common grackle, the house sparrow, the red-winged blackbird and starling that section 5(1) does not apply to.", "Madam Speaker, after researching this issue, speaking with stakeholders and considering the potential impact of this amendment, I believe that this is an appropriate and reasonable response to the issue of the rapid double-crested cormorant population growth in the Great Lakes region.", "I look forward to all of the comments on Bill 205 today. I’ve had many conversations with my colleagues in the official opposition regarding the impact of these birds on the delicate ecosystems in their ridings. I’m also very interested to hear the comments from both the members of the government and the members of the third party, because I know that the double-crested cormorants are also having a major impact in many of their ridings as well.", "The idea of this particular amendment of the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act had been put forward during previous Legislatures by the former Liberal member for Algoma–Manitoulin Michael Brown in 2001, and the Liberal member from Prince Edward–Hastings Ernie Parsons in 2006. In the decade since those members first brought forward the issue of overpopulation, the double-crested cormorant population has exploded. This is stressing delicate ecosystems, impacting biodiversity and creating concerns for property owners and the fishing and tourism industry throughout the Great Lakes region. I also understand it’s very damaging to the islands here just off Toronto. On Toronto Island, the people who boat in the harbour tell me that this is causing a lot of damage to a number of properties and to the islands there.", "The double-crested cormorant, or the crow duck, is a large fish-eating bird found throughout the Great Lakes region, as well as large swaths of North America. A fact sheet issued by Environment Canada indicates that historically, the double-crested cormorant did not nest originally in the Great Lakes region. Evidence of double-crested cormorants around the Great Lakes did not appear until sometime around 1913, along the very western edge of Lake Superior. The nesting colonies of these large predatory birds continued to spread east to the Great Lakes, making it to the St. Lawrence River valley by 1945. In the 1950s, the number of double-crested cormorants in Ontario numbered at about 900 nesting pairs. By 1973, that number had dropped by 86% to approximately 125 nesting pairs. Scientists at that time believed that the decline in the cormorant population was a result of the high levels of toxic contaminants such as DDT and PCBs that were present at that time in the Great Lakes.", "At the same time, the Great Lakes themselves were experiencing a change in fish populations as a result of many factors, including the decline of large predatory fish and also the introduction of invasive species and, again, the presence of toxic contaminants in the lakes. As a result of this, governments of both Canada and the United States, including the province of Ontario, began to pass legislation which banned the use of a lot of these types of pesticides, while also passing legislation to improve the overall water qualities in the Great Lakes region.", "Six decades, or 60 years, later, we’re all thankful that the leaders of the day saw fit to take those actions that they did to protect the Great Lakes, our greatest natural resource. But, as a result of this confluence of factors—the banning of toxic pesticides, the steadily increasing numbers of smaller fish in the Great Lakes and the seemingly hands-off approach to population management by the MNRs of different governments—population numbers of the double-crested cormorant rebounded quickly from the 1970s through to the 1990s, and have exploded even more so in recent years.", "From that original group of 125 nesting pairs in 1973, the most readily available government of Canada statistics from 2009 indicated that there were more than 58,000 nesting pairs in the Great Lakes. Some bird count surveys suggest that the population increase may be happening at the rate of 7% a year, which would be unsustainable if that is the case. And from the numbers, that probably is the case.", "As a result of the rapid recovery and population explosion of the double-crested cormorant, the federal Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada has listed this bird as “not at risk” since April 1978. Various other national and international conservation groups, such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the North American Waterbird Conservation Plan, Wings Over Water and Wild Species Canada, all list the status of the double-crested cormorant as “least of concern” or “not at risk” or “secure.” This is obviously a testament to the resiliency of this species of bird. In only a few short decades, the double-crested cormorant has gone from relative rarity in the Great Lakes region to one of the most populous species of bird.", "Unfortunately, this explosive population growth has led to many concerns that these birds are negatively impacting Ontario’s fishing industry, vegetation base, sensitive island ecosystems and other protected water birds in our Great Lakes and freshwater system. The cormorant, a very sociable bird, almost always nests in large colonies. These nesting habits, while commendable in humans, result in the rapid destruction of existing site vegetation through breaking of branches, stripping of foliage, and loss of important ecosystem and canopy cover.", "Moreover, the impact of the toxic guano of the hundreds of double-crested cormorants at a nesting site kills trees and vegetation, leaving roosting sites of double-crested cormorants ecologically barren in only a few short years. I know there’s a case near Pelee Island—I think it’s called Middle Island—where the ministry and the federal government went in and tried to repopulate and get that island ecosystem back, because these birds literally destroyed it.", "This has been the case in many areas across the Great Lakes in Ontario. I hope to hear examples, from some of the other members who speak to the bill this afternoon, of the destruction caused by these birds in their own communities.", "Moreover, there are ongoing concerns that the overpopulation and range expansion of the double-crested cormorant is having a significant impact on fisheries in the Great Lakes. Double-crested cormorants consume large amounts of fish in the areas they populate, and place a significant impact on species. A typical cormorant can consume 20% to 25% of its body weight, or roughly one pound of fish, each day. Dietary studies on these predatory birds have shown that cormorants consume a wide range of prey species and are opportunistic, generalist feeders. In other words, I guess they’ll eat pretty near anything.", "A report by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources indicates that cormorant prey selection primarily depends upon the abundance, availability and catchability of fish near their colonies. This includes fish up to 40 centimetres in length. The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation has associated declines in smallmouth bass and yellow perch abundance in the eastern basin of Lake Ontario with cormorant population increases.", "Some fishermen and hunters that I know tell me that they’ve seen them in action. They’ll see a school of fish and actually circle them, come down close to the surface of the water and beat their wings, drive the fish into the centre and then the other birds will catch them. They’re quite organized. Probably a lot of people could use organization like they can put together.", "This unchecked predation by cormorants should be of concern to this provincial government, as their population growth has the potential to have a very serious consequence for fishing and fishing-related industries in Ontario, which we all rely on. A simple Google search will turn up numerous stories on the impact cormorants have had on public lands, private property, businesses and communities across Ontario. Unfortunately, despite all this information and the growing concern with the impacts of the cormorant population, the Ministry of Natural Resources has been slow to take action on this issue.", "Bill 205, the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Amendment Act, is designed as a simple first step that this government can take to control the growth in the numbers of this predatory bird. As I stated earlier, Bill 205 will add the double-crested cormorant to the list of unprotected birds in Ontario, which I listed earlier. I believe that removing this unnecessary protection of the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act is a reasonable step for this government to take. It’s one more tool that will be at the disposal of those dealing with the issue of cormorant overpopulation.", "I hope that members of both the government and third party will join with the official opposition to support Bill 205. I would like to see this bill moved through to the committee stage where we can all learn more about the impacts that double-crested cormorants are having across this province.", "Let me make clear that in no way am I supporting the extinction of cormorants or any sort of mass culling, but I am asking the government to take action. By failing to take action for the last number of years—by all governments—we see a shift in the delicate balance of this ecosystem. This imbalance and the overpopulation of a predatory species must be addressed before the scope of the problem is too large to handle and the damage to our ecosystem is too great to recover from.", "Thank you, and I look forward to all of the comments during this afternoon’s debate." ],

  "text" : [ "How do you begin talking about an issue that has been going on for quite some time across this province, particularly, as the member from Sarnia–Lambton mentioned, as a private member’s bill came out of my riding from the previous member?", "If you look at the history of cormorants, particularly as it comes to Manitoulin Island, they have been an issue, but the issue has been addressed through previous programs, through culling programs from the MNR. Actually, that’s where the responsibility falls as far as controlling and monitoring cormorants, but I’ll come back to that a little bit later.", "I do want to talk about some of the concerns when it comes to cormorants during my brief amount of time, because I’ve got a lot of my colleagues who want to talk to this as well.", "Anglers, of course, across the island and particularly individuals who are in the aquaculture sector are very much concerned with the increased presence of cormorants on Manitoulin Island, across the North Shore. You ask yourself why. What happened and why do we have such a high population now of cormorants?", "A few years ago—I would say about four or five years ago—when we had the very cold winter, there was a lot of the natural feed for cormorants that was destroyed in southern Ontario. They all pushed up to northern Ontario and that became a big issue, and the impacts it was having on the fisheries and on some of the businesses.", "Just on cormorants, really quickly, they’re a very crafty bird. Their beak is kind of shaped with a hook at the end, so just picture this: They can sit on the side of a net where you have an aquaculture farm, and they shoot their beaks right through the mesh of the net and actually sometimes pierce that net and harm the fry that is within those nets. It affects production and, at the end of the day, it affects their aquaculture business. So there are the big concerns there.", "Again, tourism is one of those biggest things across the North Shore when it comes to the fishing industry, and it has a negative effect on it.", "However, let’s look at the positive that can come out of this. When we’re talking about the positive, let’s also look at MNR’s role, which hasn’t been exercised for a very long time when it comes to monitoring cormorants in the environment. Why MNR hasn’t been doing their role is because their budgets have been cut. They do not have the individuals out in the field. They do not have the technicians and they do not have the biologists to monitor and make sure and actually account for the populations that are out there.", "I’ve talked to previous individuals who had worked in their roles with the MNR, and they are devastated because they are proud individuals who used to be able to go out and actually work in the field and give concrete evidence. But right now, a lot of the decisions that MNR is making are based on third-party findings that they do in their reports. That is not good enough. I think we’re missing out on an opportunity to make sure that the specially trained individuals can go out and actually do the cull in order to regulate the cormorant population. That’s very important.", "Now, I did talk about a positive spin that we can do on this. If the MNR is not going to do it, why don’t we engage with our fish and wild game clubs? The fish and wild game clubs are just sitting on the side waiting to give their volunteer hours. They volunteer thousands of hours every year. Why doesn’t the MNR take the time to go out and engage with these individuals and train them?", "There is a benefit to having cormorants in areas, believe it or not. On the islands where they nest they have their excrement that falls off of them, and in their areas it creates a whole new aquatic life around these islands. Freshwater shrimp are growing in these areas in great abundance.", "When you look at the negative and you look at the positive, monitoring and making sure there is a proper control on this is really key. And who has that role? That’s the role of the MNR. That’s where this bill should lie. We shouldn’t have to deal with these bills. It’s not the first time I’ve heard of a bill such as this come forward from the Conservatives in order to address an issue because of the lack of initiative by the government. This is just the second, third, fourth one that I’ve heard over the numerous years I’ve been here.", "Now, there is a little piece of training that will be involved in this if we are going to reach out to these other organizations to prepare for the cull, because cormorants nest on islands. Of course, they do. But there are other nesting birds there. So you have to be careful in regard to what eggs you’re going to oil, what areas you’re going to go into, so that you do not harm the other birds that are there in that area.", "Having said that, there are definitely negatives to having cormorants in your area, but if they’re controlled and if you monitor them, there’s an opportunity for some positives as well. For individuals who are affected negatively by this, there is a course of action presently in the act that gives them the opportunity to regulate it as well.", "With that, I’ll let my other colleagues speak, but this is something, once again, that is a government responsibility that they should be doing." ],

As an MPP who actually represents a riding that is situated on the Ottawa River and that has a diverse ecosystem which goes from farmland to wetland, I understand the importance of having a healthy ecosystem. And I have to say, much like the member opposite, I’ve sought to protect the Great Lakes ecosystem myself, through Bill 75, Microbead Elimination and Monitoring Act.", "I do understand the concerns brought forward by the member for Sarnia–Lambton about the double-crested cormorants and how they impact the ecosystem and landowners. Currently, as our law stands, the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act allows landowners to kill double-crested cormorants if they are damaging or about to damage their property. In fact, they can take this action without authorization from the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry.", "We must be good stewards of the environment and our ecosystem, and that means taking a measured approach to any sort of population management and control. Double-crested cormorants are native to North America. During the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, their populations were decimated. After these decades their populations were restored, and research has shown that their population has stabilized or actually declined slightly in recent years.", "Madam Speaker, I have significant concerns about the effects of this bill, if passed. The bill strips protection from double-crested cormorants and allows for small game hunters to kill these birds. This would take Ontario out of Canadian alignment and would be the only Canadian jurisdiction to remove protections from these birds.", "This bill also would create problems and possibly not even solve what is seen as a problem. If passed, the bill will allow those with small-game licences to kill these birds. It would also allow them to kill an unlimited amount, and it will not mandate these hunters to properly dispose of their bodies, leaving these dead cormorants to waste.", "There is also the question of the effectiveness of hunting cormorants as a method of population control. The destruction of a cormorant’s colony can remove that colony, but another could immediately move in to fill that space. Shooting can frighten these birds from the area, but they often return a few weeks later to the colony. Destruction of these colonies can also shift these colonies and birds to somewhere else in their natural habitat, setting up a colony elsewhere.", "If it is determined through research and studies that cormorants are putting significant pressure on certain fish species, then the actions that the government should take should be measured. Any approach to the double-crested cormorant should be based on research, studies and scientific data. A poorly planned population control effort, such as the one that seems to stem from this private member’s bill, can have medium- to long-term negative effects on the biodiversity in our ecosystem. This type of population control effort can push birds into more sensitive areas of our ecosystem. Eliminating birds in the short term can lead to a rapid population increase in the long term, putting these ecosystems under strain from this population growth. Given that the birds are native to North America and they go across many jurisdictions, any action—if decided by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry—that might be taken should be done, I believe, in collaboration with other jurisdictions for lasting population control of cormorants." ],

It’s always nice to see you in the chair.", "I’m honoured to join in this important debate on Bill 205, one that is being watched very closely in my riding of Leeds–Grenville.", "I want to start by commending the member for Sarnia–Lambton. Bill 205 is another example of why Mr. Bailey is such an effective MPP and one of the most successful in getting private members’ bills passed. He brings forward very reasonable legislation that provides a solid basis to address an issue that affects many members of this House and our constituents. As a result, members are eager to pass it on second reading, get it into committee, where we can tweak it, and come back here and have it adopted by the government. We saw that recently with his bills dealing with a tax credit for farmers donating to a food bank and with a One Call system to locate underground infrastructure.", "I believe he has repeated this approach with Bill 205 to address the exploding double-crested cormorant population. We’ve heard how these birds are devastating the environment. They’re devastating sport fishing and the bait fish industry throughout the Great Lakes and beyond. To address this issue, Mr. Bailey, the member for Sarnia–Lambton, has brought forward legislation to amend the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act, 1997, and put some tools in our tool kit.", "Certainly, we’ve been dealing with the problems caused by cormorants on the St. Lawrence River for years. I personally want to thank the Thousand Islands Association and their membership for helping me advocate for this action. The association, for those that don’t know, has members on both sides of the river, and they’re extremely frustrated with the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry. Their frustration, Speaker, is heightened because they see the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation taking action on the US side of the border. Recently, we started to hear, especially in my riding, about the cormorant devastation that many constituents are now seeing on the inland lakes and rivers in the riding.", "These are small lakes. They’re very fragile ecosystems, and a sudden influx of hundreds or thousands of cormorants will quickly strip vegetation and they will wipe out fish populations in those small inland lakes. There is an urgent need for the ministry to get engaged. So, Speaker, you can imagine my disappointment when I filed order paper questions to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry—and the two questions I asked were very straightforward: What is the ministry doing, and would they consider the measures we’re debating today? Do you know what their answers were? “Nothing” and “no.” Those were the answers to the two questions. The minister said the ministry did a comprehensive review in—get this—2006 and would rely on that knowledge to continue doing nothing. That’s right. People in my riding and in ridings all across the province are reporting that this is a big problem, but the government is content to use 10-year-old data as an excuse to bury their heads in the sand. Given the threat to the environment and our tourism economy posed by the uncontrolled explosion in cormorant numbers, that response is unacceptable.", "I want to commend the member for Sarnia–Lambton for this very proactive piece of legislation that we’re debating today. It’s a great basis for a broader discussion that I hope will get to committee.", "I urge all members to join me in supporting Bill 205 this afternoon." ],

The privilege of living in northern Ontario is that we get to do that.", "Of course, I knew of cormorants because I had gone to his riding, to Manitoulin Island, and I had seen all those black birds that I had never seen before. People explained to me that they were cormorants. So you can imagine my surprise when, about three years ago, we were sitting on our deck, looking out, and I said, “Wow, what a weird-looking loon”—because they’re dark like a loon and have a long beak. My husband said, “No, that’s not a loon. That’s a cormorant.” Sure enough, we got into the boat and we started to go around. We only had two or three. By the end of the summer, we had two or three dozen. Fast-forward to the next spring: We had 200 or 300. Those little birds multiply very fast, don’t they? Then the second thing we noticed really quickly is that if you wanted to know where the fish were, all you had to do was to go where the cormorants were because they feed on the same fish we feed on.", "After about three years of this, the fishing for walleye and pickerel and bass and perch in our lake was not so good anymore. The cormorants were getting fatter, bigger and more numerous all the time. People started talking and bringing ideas like the member is bringing forward.", "I also have the privilege, in Nickel Belt, to have the highest percentage of retired MNR people in the entire province. I think they all retired in Nickel Belt. We have a lot of active conservation officers, but more are retired, because the workforce of conservation officers, let me tell you, has gone down since the resources to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry have also gone down.", "We started to learn more about what those birds were all about and what their role is within the ecosystem and what should and should not be done to look after those birds.", "Fast-forward to this spring: I had a really busy weekend with events last weekend, but I managed to go fishing for about an hour and a half. We went to my favourite spot, close to the narrows—I’m not going to divulge all of my good fishing spots, Madam Speaker—and it was non-stop. When my husband didn’t have a fish on, I had a fish on. It came to the place with just one line at a time in the water because we could not net them fast enough. I threw them back because I hit my limit in 10 minutes and that was it. The rest of them we threw back because we respect the limits. All this to say that although we do have a whole lot more cormorants than we have ever had, I would say the population seems to have stabilized right now and the fishing has—although, in the transition, it was tough. It’s pretty boring to go fishing when you don’t catch anything, let me tell you. I can only take 20 minutes of that; then I say, “Sayonara. I’ve had enough fun.” But it has bounced back. It has bounced back because nature is like this.", "That’s not to say that the government does not have a role to play. The government does have a role to play through the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry. There should be enough resources there to make sure that they do a good job of looking at where it is a threat to our ecosystem and where it is not a threat to our ecosystem. But when you have one conservation officer for an area the size of Toronto—this is part of my riding; I’m many times the size of Toronto, and my riding is one of those big northern ridings. You have one conservation officer for all of this? I look at their map, Speaker, and some of the lakes they will patrol—it is on the map and it’s scheduled once every 25 years. That’s because this is working flat-out trying to do their job. This is not acceptable, and this falls squarely on this government, who, year after year, has cut back.", "There’s a role to play. But we have the tools in Ontario. It is called the Ministry of Natural Resources. Give them the resources to do their job. Make sure that there are enough conservation officers out there that can do that and certainly meet—we also have lake associations throughout my riding—with the people who belong to those lake associations that have questions. Ours—part of the Vermilion River Stewardship committee—had serious questions when all of a sudden there were no more fish to be caught. I even caught a crayfish—not easy to do on a line, Madam Speaker, but I managed. That was all that seemed to be left.", "We have recovered, partly because we have those conservation officers that came and helped us. But they did that on a voluntary basis. There should be a conservation officer available to all of the stewardship committees of all of the lakes and rivers in northern Ontario so that when they do see an issue like this, you have access to people that have the knowledge and the skills to guide you through so you continue to have a healthy ecosystem, because this is what we all depend on. Believe it or not, Madam Speaker, we are part of that food chain, and if there is no food for those birds and those fish, there will be no food for us either.", "I urge the government to really listen clearly to what people are saying.

If this bill was before me, I would say, 15 years ago, in the early 2000s, I would have not hesitated one little bit to jump in the fray and say, “Let’s do it.” Let me tell you the story, Speaker.", "I live in Brighton, Ontario, home of Presqu’ile Provincial Park. The park had become a colony for cormorants. There are two small islands off Presqu’ile park on the west shore, right by one of the most beautiful beaches in Ontario, almost as good as the one in Prince Edward county, Sandbanks—almost.", "The two islands were destroyed. Vegetation was destroyed. Because they’re not very far from this beautiful beach, it was damaging the beach as well. As a matter of fact, crews had to clean that beach every day during the summer in order to keep it safe for kids and swimmers.", "To add to that, there was—there isn’t as much anymore, but the Quick family in Brighton had a phenomenal commercial fishing business. Speaker, as you heard from other members that spoke about this, cormorants are very good when it comes to fishing. Actually, they could see the difference in their livelihood.", "I was the mayor of Brighton at that time, and for two or three years it had become quite a thing in our community. I’m referring to Brighton, because that was where the biggest colony we knew of was at the time, but we knew there were others.", "There was very little action from MNR back then, and some people were taking responsibility on their own. It wasn’t a very good way to do things, and I won’t get into those details. That was yesterday.", "Finally, in 2003 or 2004, I would say, I happened to be in this place, and the ministry did start taking some action. Along with park staff, the folks from MNR in Peterborough started looking at the situation, because it was frankly becoming a bit of a health issue, plus it did destroy the vegetation of two islands.", "When the member from Carleton–Mississippi Mills asked me two or three months ago, I did go back, because frankly, it went silent. But before I move ahead, I’ve got to tell you this story, Speaker.", "There was a real faction when MNR started talking about controlling the bird population. Some of it was with guns. Of course, it brought a number of people who are fairly strongly opposed to that kind of activity. As a member of this place, I was lobbied pretty heavily to make sure that MNR would not take that action in what they call culling the birds. I was having my annual summer barbecue, with 300 or 400 people, and some of these activists, to prevent culling of the birds, dressed in chefs’ uniforms and picketed outside my barbecue. Actually, some of the visitors who came to my barbecue said, “Wow, look at Rinaldi. He’s got valet parking at the end of his driveway.” But that wasn’t the reason. Anyway, at the end of the day I spoke to the folks; they came in. I had real beef hamburgers, and they joined us for a barbecue and the day turned out well.", "Let me fast-forward. I’ve only got—oh, my God—less than three minutes. MNR got involved. There were different ways. One was by scaring the birds. The other was by oiling the eggs to stop them from—because they do reproduce quite rapidly. And there was some controlled culling.

They said, basically, “Yes, there are still some cormorants in the area, but we’re controlling them. We’re keeping an eye on them, and whenever we feel that things are changing, we have some control mechanisms, based on the time of the year and based on when this is happening, and we’ve been very successful in keeping the population under control.”" ],

They’re making their own observations, I guess, on an alleged decline in cormorant population. I know there are some more radical environmental and animal rights’ groups that have a significant foothold in the Ontario Liberal Party and New Democrats, but I think their view would be not to touch any animal population whatsoever. Some would be of the view that it’s humans who are causing all the problems and we need to control humans, but they would object to this.", "I try to look at this from a very objective perspective, and good advice from folks in Niagara. I don’t know what he’s talking about in his neck of the woods—I know my colleague from Prince Edward–Hastings will address it—but we’re actually seeing an increase in population and increased damage. A quick scan of media, Madam Speaker, as I was listening to the member’s speech, shows that throughout the northeastern United States, across the Great Lakes, from Milwaukee to Vermont and New York state, the cormorant populations are causing significant damage.", "I spoke with Felix Barbetti about these issues over time. Felix was a respected senior civil servant in the Ministry of Natural Resources. Felix said that he remembers once driving from Thunder Bay to Lake Nipissing to see two cormorants, years and years ago. That was the drive he had to do to actually see them in the wild. Now he sees them in his backyard—well, not exactly, but in the Niagara Peninsula, along the waterfront, like where I am, and Lake Erie. The damage to bait fish is significant. The impact on the commercial fishing industry is real and large and damaging. In fact, Felix Barbetti told me that a Brock professor and researchers were once setting up nesting sites for terns in Port Colborne, and cormorants took over those artificial nests and displaced the terns. They’d push more fragile species out of nesting areas, including great egrets and blue herons, which I love to see along the Welland River, where I live.", "Felix also told me about an experiment at Oneida Lake, New York, which is a laboratory for Cornell University. They saw a significant decline in fish populations. When they researched it, they found that the main cause was actually cormorants overfishing.", "Erno Rossi, a very respected naturalist in the province of Ontario, very active in the Niagara Peninsula, remarked that many shorelines in Niagara, as well as islands including off Hamilton Harbour, are bare because the bird droppings are so toxic that they kill trees and other vegetation.", "Ken Lounsbury, who’s very active in the OFAH and is a resident of Beamsville, says that the best method in moving forward is to start oiling the eggs. I know that colleagues across the floor who are looking for an excuse to vote against the bill are making it seem like we’re all going to go out with shotguns and start shooting them one by one, like some kind of video game. No; I think what the member from Sarnia–Lambton, Mr. Bailey, is calling for are sensible, ecologically sound measures, as in oiling eggs, to reduce populations overall. I think the evidence is strong, from an environmental point of view, from achieving an ecological balance, from the economic impacts, that Mr. Bailey’s bill is a sensible, thoughtful and balanced approach to controlling cormorant populations, just as they are doing in states across the lakes to make sure we maintain habitat for other species and support commercial fishing." ],

What we have is a particularly harmful predator to long-term ecosystem sustainability and biodiversity, both because it engages in predatory activity by consuming other species and because it destroys the habitat of other species by destroying vegetation. One cormorant can take one pound of fish out of our lakes and rivers. So we have a predator that is having a detrimental effect on species management and biodiversity. We know that to be the case.", "I know for a fact that conservation authorities in my area are of the opinion that the cormorant is having a detrimental effect on conservation efforts. We therefore do have a responsibility to do something.", "Too often, this debate revolves around culling. That’s the option that gets the most attention because it’s the most violent, but it’s also the option of absolute last resort, and as a result, it is seldom used. There is also a reasonable argument for why culling should be the last resort: The European Union found that where forcible culling occurs, what can end up happening is that the short-term reduction in the cormorant population results in less competition for resources and larger nests.", "There are, however, methods of cormorant control that have long-term positive impacts on species management. These include egg oiling and nest disturbance, among many other viable methods for reducing the cormorant population to sustainable levels. Those are the kinds of measures that we saw, for the most part, in Presqu’ile Provincial Park in the Bay of Quinte region.", "We know that we have natural cormorant habitats or breeding grounds where cormorants tend to thrive. Historically in southern Ontario, that has been the major bird migratory route, along the north shore of Lake Ontario between Presqu’ile Provincial Park and the Thousand Islands, but there are other problem spots across the province, as well.", "What we’re doing by not being active as the Ministry of Natural Resources in dealing with this is letting down our neighbours who are doing things about this. They’re doing the best they can to manage this predator that is in our lakes and rivers and destroying our property.", "Guano destroys property. It destroys islands. It destroys other habitats.

But over the last decade, the organization has lost sight of its purpose, and as a result taxpayers and people in need are paying the price. My bill will ensure accountability by allowing the Auditor General to investigate the HSC, like the government gave her the authority to investigate the TSSA, which has the same corporate structure.", "The Housing Services Corporation Accountability Act would add transparency by requiring salaries over $100,000 to be reported on the sunshine list.

That’s enough to provide rent supplements to house almost 1,000 families or to repair 126 units a year that have been boarded up because they are uninhabitable. In Hamilton, where there are 5,685 families on the wait-list, purchasing through HSC cost CityHousing Hamilton $1.1 million extra in a single year. In Peel region, it added $182,000 to the cost of gas.", "The minister would have us believe that a few larger housing providers are paying more to help the smaller providers, but the facts show that just isn’t the case. A detailed city of Stratford study last year showed they are paying $40,000 more for natural gas because they are forced to purchase through the HSC and $4,000 to be allowed to purchase insurance from a cheaper source. A Niagara region study found that for natural gas, “The HSC program has been more expensive than either Union Gas or Enbridge.” A report from the Thunder Bay district social services board estimated that purchasing natural gas through the HSC added $750,000 to the cost.", "The county of Oxford, which has 1,219 families on the wait-list, estimates that they could save $100,000 a year if they didn’t have to buy insurance or natural gas through the HSC. In fact, Oxford and about 100 housing providers pay HSC every year just for the right to purchase their insurance from a cheaper source. That means their insurance isn’t required to obtain volume discounts, as the minister would have us believe. It is simply about HSC taking money from housing providers.", "That money is funding for-profit subsidiaries and a lifestyle that the 171,000 families waiting for housing could never afford: $8 for water, bottles of wine, a luxury seven-day vacation in South Africa and over $5,000 in business class air fare for one board member, all paid for with money intended for housing.

Expenses for just the top four show that in 2015—that’s after the government says the problems had been cleaned up—housing money went to send multiple people to London, England; Manchester, England; Chicago, Illinois; Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island; and Winnipeg, Manitoba. Thousands and thousands of dollars that were intended for housing instead are paying for travel.", "But not all expenses appear to be reported. One person reported $1,700 to attend a conference in Chicago, but failed to include the registration fee she charged on her HSC credit card, which made the total cost $3,000. Through freedom of information, we found over $3,000 spent by employees who don’t publicly report their expenses to attend a conference in Nova Scotia. We also found multiple other trips to Nova Scotia and a trip to Calgary by these same employees. Unless the auditor investigates, we may never know how many trips are still being paid for with this housing money. Clearly, the problem is not solved. While 171,000 families are waiting for affordable housing, executives at the HSC are still expensing $4 coffees and over $200 to rent an SUV for a day to travel to meetings.", "My bill would stop HSC executives from overcharging housing providers for a luxury lifestyle by allowing providers to purchase from another source if it is cheaper. It would ensure that the HSC can run efficiently and save municipalities money. That is why 65 municipalities across Ontario passed resolutions supporting this bill. Municipalities recognize that this bill will also increase accountability.", "Housing money hasn’t just gone to world travel; it also went to create for-profit subsidiaries, similar to those at Ornge air ambulance This is where we need the Provincial Auditor’s expertise to get the answers.

We know that, with a British partner, HSC created CIH Canada and loaned it $125,000. We also know that HSC’s executives have flown all over promoting it. Now it seems that they have put more money into the subsidiary.", "Weiler and Company’s recent report says, “All requests, in the 2015 fiscal year, for additional funding, or waiver of shareholder management fees have been approved by the HSC board of directors.” They don’t report how much was approved, so until the auditor investigates, we won’t know how much more housing money has been diverted. But we know that even though HSC keeps putting money in, their British partner has the option to take over more than 50% of the organization for only a nominal fee.", "We also know that over the last two years, HSC has been working with partners to create a new subsidiary that appears to duplicate the lending programs of Infrastructure Ontario. According to their briefing notes, the feasibility study alone will cost $250,000. Madam Speaker, public money that was intended to provide housing for people in need should not be going to pay for world travel, fancy meals or empire building.", "It has also been more than a year since one of the two provincial appointments to the HSC board resigned after it was revealed that he was receiving more than $70,000 in payments to his personal consulting firm as well as his pay on the board. It’s more than a year, and the minister still hasn’t bothered to replace him on the board to ensure provincial oversight.", "During that time, the minister introduced a bill on affordable housing that actually amends the Housing Services Act, the legislation that enables HSC and requires housing providers to purchase natural gas and insurance through them. But the minister failed to introduce changes to fix these problems and help housing providers save millions of dollars by allowing them to purchase gas and insurance at the best price.", "Ontario taxpayers and the 171,000 families waiting for housing need the members in this Legislature to see beyond partisan politics and House leader negotiations.

Housing service providers would also no longer be forced to participate in HSC programs. But the bill has gathered dust for nearly a year.

We’ve dealt with it in other situations, where the government spins off these corporations, which are not accessible to the Ombudsman, the Auditor General or other officers of the Legislature, so our ability to actually bring in the reins on a corporation that’s spending public money is dramatically reduced. I think it’s entirely reasonable, the fact that we should be looking at the operation of this organization.", "The job of the HSC is to provide managerial and business services to housing providers, including a bulk insurance purchasing program. In 2011, municipalities were told they could no longer buy insurance outside the Housing Services Corp. Several municipalities, including the Eastern Ontario Wardens’ Caucus, opposed this decision, asking, “If the HSC is so confident that their pricing is better, why are they unwilling to let us test the market?” The HSC said mandatory participation was needed in order to ensure the broadest pool and thus the best prices overall.", "After a review, which was prompted as a result of these complaints, the HSC changed the policy yet again to allow municipalities to seek better deals under an alternate broker program. But under that program, if the municipalities used an alternate broker, they had to pay a service fee of 2.5% of the insurance premium, plus HST, effectively penalizing municipalities for seeking the best deal, which is supposed to be the job of the HSC in the first place.", "Despite the HSC’s mandate to deliver the most cost-effective insurance to municipal housing service providers, several municipalities are still finding better deals outside the HSC. For 2013-14, Waterloo chose to pay the $9,300 opt-out fee to HSC because they found insurance that was not only slightly cheaper—even with the fee—it also covered up to $400 million in damages, as compared to the HSC policy, which covered only $150 million. The Bruce County Housing Corp. board also chose an alternate broker in 2013-14.", "There are many other examples. The NDP found that the HSC collected $95,000 in alternate broker fees in 2013, representing nearly $4 million worth of insurance policies purchased through alternate brokers. This is roughly one third of the value of insurance policies sold through the HSC in 2013, according to documents the NDP has obtained.", "The HSC also has a bulk natural gas purchasing program. In July 2015, Mr. Hardeman revealed a confidential city of Toronto report claiming that Mayor John Tory had quietly asked Premier Wynne to change Toronto’s agreement with the HSC that, according to city staff, forces the municipality to pay an extra $6.3 million a year for natural gas purchased through the HSC.", "Speaker, I don’t think there’s any question that there are substantial issues here that need to be probed, that the Auditor General needs to go through and look at the question of value for money. It may be that everything we’ve heard is misleading: that, in fact, everything is fine with this corporation.

I can understand the motivation of the member opposite in putting forth this motion. As members of provincial Parliament, we all hope to have our private members’ bills pass third reading and receive royal assent.", "However, in order for this to take place, there is an established protocol that is followed, which is collaborated upon through regular conversation with all House leaders. This motion, in essence, looks to circumvent this legislative due process that surrounds all pieces of legislation that have passed second reading. Therein lies the challenge.", "That is not to say the member from Oxford’s bill in question, Bill 74, the Housing Services Corporation Accountability Act, is not without merit or should not be called to committee. I know the member to be an honourable and hard-working MPP who is a strong advocate for these kinds of issues and we appreciate that work.", "Rather, it is that this bill should go through the same process as every other piece of legislation here in the House. Bill 74 proposes allowing municipalities to opt out of the mandated provision of services by the Housing Services Corp., or HSC, to municipal social housing providers and service managers.", "Madam Speaker, the Housing Services Corp. is mandated to provide certain vital and valued services centrally, with a goal to reduce costs and improve efficiencies to the housing providers accessing them.", "Our government recently, in 2011, reformed the legislation that governs the HSC under the Housing Services Act. These reforms included the fact that, as the member from Oxford noted, providers have been allowed to obtain equivalent insurance coverage from an alternate broker. We strengthened the accountability standards inherent in the act that require HSC to report annually to the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing, and also to provide its audited financial statements.", "The minister has previously welcomed feedback from municipalities and service managers on this matter, and our government is committed to continuing to work with partners to strengthen how social and affordable housing providers acquire these services and programs.", "Having said that, it would still be improper to circumvent the time-honoured process which takes place between the three House leaders. It is this process and this process alone which should decide the bills that are called to a given committee. It is a mechanism which is part of the democratic process; as such, it allows all sides of the House to be heard through their House leader, and it functions well.", "I can truly appreciate the member’s desire and passion to see his bill, which I am sure he has put considerable effort into, reach the next stage of its legislative process. But rather than support this motion today, I would encourage him to follow the procedure and process already in place to have this done.", "As such, I will not be supporting this motion here today. However, I would ask my colleagues here to think about their support as well and to respect the processes and procedures of this House. In closing, I would just add that I am sharing my time with the member from Etobicoke Centre. Thank you." ],

I bring two perspectives to the debate this afternoon, not only as the MPP for Whitby–Oshawa, but as the past chairperson for the health and social services committee at the region of Durham, where housing was one of the main issues that we discussed within that committee.", "What is clear in the discussion of the motion before us is that Ontario is facing a housing affordability crisis, but over the last year the government has done nothing to move forward the Housing Services Corporation Accountability Act that would have helped. It would have helped, Speaker, to stop the waste and abuse of affordable housing dollars.", "The government is quick to do photo ops on housing, but when it comes to a bill—a bill that could save millions of dollars intended for affordable housing—they drag their feet. In the course of that, they’re ignoring families that are on the waiting list.", "As my colleague from Oxford pointed out in his comments, the Ontario Non-Profit Housing Association released its annual waiting list. This is not the first time they’ve done this, Speaker; they do it every year. Again, it showed that there are now approximately 172,000 families waiting for affordable housing, and the wait-list has increased by 40%—40%. The government has had 13 years to fix the wait-list, yet now we have the highest wait-list for affordable housing there’s ever been.", "If you cut through it all, life is simply harder under the Liberals. That is resulting in more and more vulnerable families being unable to put a proper roof over their heads. What these families need is a government that understands the importance of keeping life affordable and making sure that taxpayers’ dollars are actually used to provide the support that people need.", "This government’s policies, from spiralling hydro rates to higher taxes, are simply making life more expensive—making life more expensive for seniors, making life expensive for all aspects of the community. The only real measure that we have seen from this government is that every year, the wait-list for affordable housing hits a new record high and is increased every year.", "While I’m on my feet, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the member for Oxford’s tireless work on this file. It’s a difficult file and a complex file. Yes, it does include municipalities, and it did include the region of Durham in the course of developing its affordable housing strategy. We had so much optimism when the government introduced the Long-Term Affordable Housing Strategy and spoke about the timing of bringing forward the Housing Services Corporation Accountability Act in parallel and on a similar track. But it simply hasn’t happened. The member for Oxford has repeatedly pushed the Liberal government to end the misuse and waste of housing money by the Housing Services Corp.", "What’s clear is that the constituents in Whitby–Oshawa have sent a strong message in the recent by-election to the government that they’re tired of their failed policies, which lead to longer wait times, watered-down services, waste and mismanagement.", "One of the main issues that I deal with in my constituency office is affordable housing and the wait-list. It crosses all sectors of my community, and I’m sure it does in yours too, Speaker.", "As I said at the outset of my remarks, I’m proud to stand in support of the member for Oxford’s motion. I encourage all members in the House to support his important work. The crux of what he’s asking for is a broader engagement of all sectors that are affected by the lack of affordable housing. Again, broader consultation is required, and I would encourage all members in the House to support his important work and bring this legislation back to the Standing Committee on Social Policy, of which I’m a member." ],

I listened very closely to not only the presentation by the member from Oxford, but to what the government was saying about this motion and the position they’re taking. I’ll elaborate a little on what I think about their position a little bit further after some background.", "I do believe that the member from Oxford is warranted in bringing about this bill, and also that it is clearly borne out of frustration with a government that I think knows the member is on to something, and is fearful that where there is smoke, which they are aware of, there certainly will be fire, as we’ve seen in so many other instances. The member from Oxford presented a massive amount of anecdotal evidence to definitely warrant action and to warrant our involvement and oversight on this. It is our hope that the government would do the same.", "As background, in April 2015 the Legislature passed at second reading the member from Oxford’s Bill 74, which would put the Housing Services Corp. and its subsidiaries under the oversight of the Auditor General and the Public Sector Salary Disclosure Act. Housing service providers would also no longer be forced to participate in HSC programs. If you have been following this debate, the member from Oxford has given us many points of information as to why a municipality wouldn’t want to participate in some of the programs. They’re not getting the best value for dollar. They’re not getting the accountability, the transparency and the partnership, it seems, that the agency was initially constructed to deliver.", "So here we are. We’re forced to follow the money. The government’s position, as I’ve heard and as I understand it today, is that the member from Oxford should simply follow procedure in this House or the convention that bills be talked about and worked on through House leaders. For those who may not know, that is certainly the convention. It’s tradition, and it’s something that we rely on our House leaders to talk about and to figure out how this place can flow and the agenda of the House can get through and that opposition parties can have their bills looked at and scrutinized. That’s the democratic process. However, ultimately, it is the government House leader that dictates any of the scheduling of the bills through this House. It’s not done through a majority vote in House leaders. Whether the NDP and the Progressive Conservatives have a majority does not matter. If the government House leader decides that they don’t want a bill to see the light of day, that is what’s going to happen. Of course, this is why we’re debating this bill today.", "I believe and I support the member’s ability and his right to use his private member’s slot—and we all know in this House that that’s a precious spot. He’s using it once again to shine light on this subject, and I commend him for that, because there are so many subjects that I know we all want to touch on. To have to do it twice shows how deeply important this issue is and how he truly believes, through the research that he’s done, that there’s something for us to look at here.", "I support the member’s position. I will support the bill. It’s an indication that, when the process fails in this place, we have to take all the measures that we can to ensure that our people are served and our constituents are served.", "Again, I thank the member from Oxford for doing that. I think it’s the right path, and I hope that government members see this argument and understand that this is the right thing to do. We don’t need another Ornge Air Ambulance. We don’t need another eHealth. Perhaps that’s what the government is afraid of, but do the right thing and ensure that we’re all working together to ensure accountability and transparency." ],

Motion number 77 calls on the House to express the opinion that Bill 74, the Housing Services Corporation Accountability Act, should be referred back to the House as soon as possible and that the House should conduct third reading without delay.", "Madam Speaker, I haven’t been here as long as some other members, but I do understand that this motion seeks to supersede the legislative due process that surrounds all bills which have passed second reading. As with all other bills that have been referred to committee, this process is collaborated upon through regular conversation between all the House leaders. For these reasons, this matter, like all other similar private members’ bills at second reading, would best be dealt with through the established process.", "Furthermore, I’d like to add and insist that the fact that Bill 74 passed the Legislature unanimously at second reading has little bearing on the discussion at hand. Unanimous support to move a bill to committee should not be mistaken for unanimous support for the bill itself and does not mean that there is unanimous support to supersede legislative due process.", "On April 16, 2015, I had the pleasure of rising to speak to Bill 74 itself. I thanked the member from Oxford for a sincere and well-intentioned private member’s bill that wants to address some issues that I think all members of the Legislature are concerned about. However, I did point out at the time that the government had already reformed the legislation that governs HSC in 2011 and strengthened the accountability standards that require HSC to report annually to the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing.", "As I also stated in 2015, the Housing Services Corp. had asked the ministry to help facilitate an independent third-party review of itself and its subsidiaries. That was selected through a competitive process. I supported Bill 74 at the time because we were still eagerly awaiting the results of that review, so that we could know what further steps should be taken. However, as the June 1, 2015, report by Weiler and Company stated, the HSC has taken steps to improve its efficiency through targeted expenditure controls that have resulted in significant overall expenditure reductions.", "Finally, Madam Speaker, I’d like to point out that the report also concluded that HSC has instituted revised policies enhancing the accountability of its subsidiary and related companies, to align their policies with those of HSC. HSC is also in the process of winding up subsidiary companies that no longer serve an integral business purpose.", "For all of those reasons, both procedural and substantive, I will not be supporting this motion today.", "But I also cannot let pass some of the observations made by members of the Legislature about the housing wait-lists in our province. Indeed, they are large and they are growing. I’m very pleased that in the previous week, the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing introduced new legislation that will include, among other things, inclusionary zoning, which I believe will address this long housing list.", "But the reason why we have long housing lists, the reason why much of the social housing in this province is not in as good repair as it should be, was that a previous government deliberately cut funding, starved social housing of funding and downloaded those costs onto municipalities. Municipalities and this government have been working for a number of years now to reverse those cuts and bring social housing back to where it once proudly was in this province. We’re undoing the damage that was done." ],

I think it simply demonstrates the fact that while the member opposite has referred to some changes that have been made, clearly the egregious spending and management that brought the member to this issue in bringing Bill 74 was predicated on the fact that not enough had been done, and I think that that serves, then, to clarify the purpose of today’s debate.", "The Legislature gave unanimous support at second reading over a year ago. It needs to undergo third reading without delay. While this bill waits in committee, Ontario is facing a housing affordability crisis. And yet, over the last year, the government has done nothing to move forward this bill that would help put an end to the waste and abuse of affordable housing dollars. This is an opportunity to get better value for taxpayer money and to provide better help to those who need it most. The government has the opportunity to help move this bill into law.", "This bill would allow the provincial auditor to investigate some of the questionable expenses at the Housing Services Corp.—consider expenses to the Housing Services Corp. such as European travel, alcohol, expensive meals or a luxury seven-day vacation to South Africa for a board member. Just like other boondoggles, such as Ornge air ambulance, the Housing Services Corp. has lost money in various failed attempts to create for-profit subsidiaries. Millions lost in a failed solar panel venture and money invested in a highly questionable corporation in Manchester, England, simply add to the list.", "Imagine the good that money could have done for those who need it most. Imagine how many more affordable housing units could have been created if the Housing Services Corp. had stuck to their core responsibility and mandate rather than followed the path of these failed ventures.", "This bill would empower the auditor to investigate these expenses. It would increase transparency and accountability, while making sure that the funds provided for those in need really do go to those in need and not to luxury perks for staff or board members.", "Countless housing providers have reported that they could save considerable money on their operating expenses if the government did not continue to force them to purchase natural gas and insurance through this agency.", "Consider the following: Toronto Community Housing paid an additional $6 million more than necessary if they had been able to purchase gas and insurance with the rest of the city of Toronto. The city of Waterloo was forced to pay $30,000 over three years just to be permitted to purchase natural gas from a different supplier.", "This issue doesn’t just impact the larger municipalities in Ontario; it impacts smaller and mid-size ones as well. It flies in the face—the reality is that there are people across Ontario who need help in order to be able to afford each month’s rent.", "In fast-growing York region, there are several different types of affordable housing, including Housing York Inc., co-op housing and rental supplements. Housing York Inc. was established in January 2003 and is the seventh-largest social housing provider in Ontario. With a portfolio of 36 properties and 2,483 units, they serve approximately 4,000 tenants.", "Ontario is facing an affordable housing crisis. It is not just that the price of home ownership is increasing; the price of rental units is increasing as well. This leaves society’s most vulnerable behind, without access to an affordable place to call home. The money that has been wasted by this failed government initiative could be better spent building more affordable housing units so that those on the wait-list in York region and across Ontario can have an affordable place to live.", "The government is quick to do photo ops on housing, but when it comes to a bill that could save millions of dollars intended for affordable housing, they continue to drag their feet and ignore the roughly 170,000 families on the waiting list. These families need our help and support. It is a shame that they languish on a waiting list while board members jet-set across the world.", "Millions have been lost, under this government’s watch, to scandal, waste and mismanagement. Passing this bill would be a step forward in favour of accountability and transparency. I’m proud to be able to support my colleague from Oxford on this motion." ],

As somebody who has come from a business background and who has worked on this type of work for clients, I know how important this type of approach can be, where you can consolidate purchasing and enjoy economies of scale and the benefits of expertise consolidated in a single organization. That’s the principle behind the Housing Services Corp., as it follows good business practice. Of course, they support housing providers in their day-to-day operations by servicing programs such as insurance, investment pooling, bulk natural gas purchases—again, trying to leverage economies of scale.", "In 2011, the government reformed the legislation that governs the HSC and we strengthened accountability standards that require HSC to report annually to the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing and also provide audited financial statements. Basically, we increased the scrutiny, oversight and accountability around the HSC.", "Since 2012, we’ve also instituted flexibility because providers have been allowed to obtain equivalent insurance coverage from an alternate broker. So we’ve provided some more flexibility outside of the HSC for insurance purposes.", "These are some of the things the government has done to address some of the issues that the member is trying to address in the proposed legislation.", "I certainly sympathize with the member on what he’s doing as far as advocating for his private member’s bill, and I applaud him for his advocacy and persistence on something I know he believes to be very, very important. On that front, I have a tremendous amount of sympathy for what he’s trying to do. The flip side of it is that we have a process here at the Legislature where private members’ bills are negotiated between the House leaders, and those negotiations ultimately determine how many bills move forward, which bills move forward and that sort of thing. So one of the challenges is that this goes outside of that current process. Perhaps the member doesn’t agree with that current process. That’s a discussion we could have. But given that we have a process in place where the House leaders negotiate the moving forward of legislation, what I don’t understand is how this one would fall outside of that. That said, like I said earlier, I do applaud the member for, first of all, being committed to efficiency and accountability in government, and I do applaud him for his commitment and advocacy toward his private member’s bill.", "I myself have a couple of private member’s bills that are in a similar position, that are waiting for a committee to hear them. I don’t know if they have the same support from the opposition, but I would certainly like to see them move forward, as well. I’ll take the 10 seconds of opportunity to plug both bills, Bill 127 and Bill 193—one that has passed second reading and one that is going to be debated next week. I hope I have the opposition’s support on those." ],

The government, from time to time, will take a private member’s bill and put it in place within one of their own, which, when the Housing Services Act, that the minister had just got through putting through the House—if the minister really believed this was the right thing to do, then this could have been incorporated there.", "The suggestion from Etobicoke Centre was that, in fact, I was doing this and advocating on my private member’s bill.

It suggests that there were two groups that fought against each other. In fact, it casts aspersion and blame against communities who are innocent.", "The facts in this case are very clear. There was a Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of India, India’s Supreme Court, a retired Justice, Justice G.T. Nanavati, who was commissioned to do a report, which is called the Nanavati report. In that report, he makes it abundantly clear that these attacks were not spontaneous. He makes it clear that they could not have happened but for the organization of elected officials. He points out that public transit, the DTC, the Delhi Transport Corp., was used to bus in people from other locations so that these attacks could occur.", "In fact, other reports point out that voter lists were used. Voter lists, which are tools for democracy, were used to identify homes that were Sikh homes, and then the mobs were directed to attack and kill those people.", "In addition, the police were told, before this attack occurred, to disarm and to remove from Sikh homes any sort of weapons that could be used to protect themselves.", "This was all done in a systematic and planned way.", "In fact, Hindu families and Muslim families put their own lives at risk to save their Sikh neighbours. They put their lives at risk to save their neighbours. If it continues to be referred to as a riot, it does an injustice to those Hindu families who stood up to protect their own Sikh neighbours. It does an injustice to the Muslim families that almost risked death to protect their Sikh neighbours. It does a grave injustice because it’s false.", "The truth of the matter is, the evidence all points very clearly to the fact that this was a state-organized attack. It was systematic, it was organized, it was planned and it was to target anyone who was of Sikh descent. The kara, which I wear on my wrist and other articles of faith were used as the identifiers that this person would be killed.", "The evidence, as I said, is outstanding, but it’s important to frame this and to understand why it’s so important. The term “riot” divides a community, because it suggests that people just spontaneously erupted and try to kill their neighbours. That is false. It could not have happened.", "The evidence in the Nanavati commission points out that it could not have happened that way. This was not a spontaneous set of circumstances, and it wasn’t neighbours who were killing neighbours. They were people who were bused in from outside. They were organized; they were directed to do this. In fact, the Nanavati commission points out that key elected officials from all levels of government—there’s evidence, there are affidavits that point to them being responsible for organizing these attacks.", "It’s important that we move away from the language of riot, which divides our community, and move towards the language of genocide, which casts the blame on the true organizers of this attack.", "This attack didn’t only impact people in New Delhi, which was the concentration of the attack, but impacted people across India. The Sikh community was targeted across India.", "Some of the stories are tremendously harrowing. One personal story: I was getting my robes fitted, as a lawyer—one of the things we wear. Much like what you’re wearing, Madam Speaker, we wear robes. The tailor who was fitting my robes asked if I knew much about what happened in November 1984. I said, “Of course I know what happened.” He said, “I lived through it.” I said, “Really?”", "I knew, by his name, that the man was a Hindu man. He said, “In fact, I can tell you a story about what happened.” I’m like, “Yeah, definitely, tell me the story.”", "He said, “I was a tailor then as well, and my best friend was also a tailor. He was a Sikh man. His shop was burnt down, and he fled his home. I took him into my home, and I was afraid; I was deathly afraid for my life. But I knew they were targeting Sikhs, so I let him into my home. Afterwards, he asked me if I could go”—the friend who was a Sikh said, “Could you go back to my tailor shop? There’s a lockbox in which I kept all my savings.”", "At night, when there was a curfew, this tailor said he left his home. There was a curfew. Again, he could have been killed himself. He went to the tailor shop, which was all burned down, found and retrieved the lockbox and brought back the entire life savings of his best friend.", "It’s just one small example, but there were so many harrowing stories.", "The one story that I want to share with you that, to me, is something different from what I normally have heard is a story of a reporter. I’ve met witnesses; I’ve met survivors who talk about what they experienced. They tell me how horrific it was to see their family members slain in front of their eyes—the fact that they saw their brothers being killed.", "Many Sikh men were targeted because of the very visible identity of being a Sikh, but women were targeted if they wore a kara, which is that steel bracelet. So the articles of faith were used to identify someone and to kill them.", "One of the things, though, that really impacted me a lot was a story by Rahul Bedi, who is a Delhi-based correspondent writing for the BBC. In this story, he writes about when he was a reporter with the Indian Express newspaper. He talks about being with two colleagues and visiting the area where the attacks occurred, right after the funeral of Mrs. Gandhi. He talks about walking through laneways littered with bodies. He sees body parts that were hacked off, hair that was brutally hacked off people’s heads.", "At one point, he went to certain tenements, certain buildings, where the bodies were piled up so high that the drainage was blocked and there was flooding going on in the streets.", "He went to a certain area and noticed a mother, who was polio-afflicted, holding onto her daughter. They went to lift the daughter up to see if she needed some care. The woman just froze in terror and screamed out, because she thought this was someone else who was going to kill her child.", "This reporter, who is writing after the fact, writes about seeing a young child who was hiding underneath a bed. That room where the child was hiding was littered with dead bodies. The child had wrapped a cloth around his stomach because of a wound he had suffered and was hiding there to survive. They took that child to the hospital. That child, later on, passed away.", "They were at this location, and 24 hours later, police arrived, but the carnage had already left so many dead. The reporter writes, “Police arrived in Trilokpuri 24 hours later when the Indian Express revealed the horrific massacre.", "“Sadly, there were no Sikhs left to protect.”", "There are other cities that have recognized this genocide, and I want to point out some of the cities that have done so already. These cities are in California, many of them, and I just want to list some of the cities that have recognized it: the city of Stockton in California, April 27, 2016; Kerman city in California, November 4, 2015; Bakersfield, California, December 12, 2015; and Harvey in Cook county, Illinois, November 13, 2014.", "These are cities that have already recognized November 1984 as a genocide. In fact, the California State Assembly released a resolution on April 13, 2015—the resolution chair was Richard Gordon—ACR-34, and this was amended on April 8, 2015. The subject was “November 1984 Anti-Sikh Pogroms: Remembrance.” In this, the assembly of California recognizes the attacks on Sikhs as an anti-Sikh pogrom.", "“Pogrom” is much closer to the truth. A pogrom indicates an organized attack against a minority community. But what we’re asking today is to recognize this as a genocide. The definition of genocide, as defined by article II of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, 1948, states “any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.” The acts can involve killing members of the group, causing serious bodily harm or mental harm to the group, deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction, or forcibly transferring the children of one group to another.", "The definition makes it absolutely clear, and in fact, the current government of India, the home minister—and this is an article from the Hindu, a very well-established newspaper. This is the headline of the article in the Hindu, December 27, 2014: “1984 Riots Were Genocide, Says Rajnath.” That’s the Union home minister, Rajnath Singh, of the current administration in India.", "The Delhi state assembly passed a resolution condemning the Sikh massacres of 1984. This was on July 1, 2015. The Delhi state assembly, much like our assembly, passed a resolution condemning the massacre of 1984 and specifically calling on the investigation of Congress leader Jagdish Tytler and other individuals who were involved in the planning and organization.", "Listen, Madam Speaker, this is an issue that is so deeply important. In order to ensure that there is reconciliation and healing, the first step for reconciliation and healing is to ensure that the harm that a community suffered was recognized, and to also eradicate any misconception that this was two communities fighting against each other. There is a horrible misconception this was somehow a Hindu-Sikh conflict. It was never a Hindu-Sikh conflict, and I want to highlight that. Hindu families put their lives at risk to protect Sikhs.", "This was a state-organized, systematically organized attack, and it’s so important for the healing and reconciliation of those individuals who suffer from the trauma of this incident to have it recognized here in Ontario. Ontario has recognized, at the provincial assembly, other genocides, like the Holodomor in Bill 147 in 2009, as well as the Armenian genocide on March 27, 1990. So there a precedent for this assembly to recognize genocide. This assembly has recognized it before.", "This would do a great justice to the people who are suffering. It would clear up the misconception, which is very harmful. The notion of a genocide unites communities. It says that it’s not the community’s fault; it was those who are the organizers, the state, that was organizing this attack. It was not community members and it was not your neighbours who were responsible. This will bring people together instead of dividing people. The terminology “riot” continues to divide our community, continues to hurt the community, and it doesn’t offer an opportunity for healing and reconciliation.", "People fled the human rights violations in India. They fled this genocide. They fled the attacks in November 1984 to come to Canada. Canada is a beacon of human rights, a place where human rights are celebrated and protected. Let’s send a message that we denounce these acts of violations against human rights, we denounce genocide and we support human rights." ],

But before I do, I want to recognize the members of the Sikh community who are in the Legislature to watch this debate.", "The strength of our province is rooted in the diversity of our people. Ontario is proud to be home to a vibrant Sikh community that has contributed immensely to the life of our province. The principles of Sikhism—honesty, hard work and service to others—resonate with all Ontarians and represent vital building blocks of a strong society. The Sikh community is integral to the stability and success of our country. From working in the logging and forestry industry, to building the railway, to fighting on behalf of Canada in World War I, the Sikh community has played an important role in Ontario and in Canada.", "We are debating a motion pertaining to the events of November 1984 in India. This week, we mark the 32nd anniversary of the invasion of the Golden Temple. Earlier this year, as part of Premier Wynne’s trade mission to India and Punjab, I had the honour to visit the Golden Temple again. The tragic events leading up to and following the invasion of the Golden Temple and the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi resulted in the unnecessary loss of thousands of innocent lives. We have all heard—and the member from Bramalea–Gore–Malton talked about—some of the heart-wrenching stories from the families of the victims, seen through print media, through TV interviews and some personal contacts. We can all share some personal stories as well.", "Madam Speaker, those stories are true. Innocent people, for no fault of their own, were killed. Mothers witnessed their young sons at their prime age being killed. Wives saw their husbands, fathers, fathers-in-law and brothers dragged out of their homes and murdered in front of their own eyes. Young children saw their parents being killed in front of their own eyes. Parents saw their daughters being raped, and they watched helplessly. Their homes and shops were ransacked and set on fire.", "I salute the human beings who provided shelter to, and saved the lives of, some of the people who were targeted. Several countries have recognized the grave atrocities that took place in 1984. In responding to an online petition campaign that had generated over 30,000 signatures in 2013, President Obama, even though he refused to declare the 1984 anti-Sikh violence as genocide, noted that grave human rights violations had occurred and continued to say that, “We continue to condemn—and more importantly, to work against—violence directed at people based on their religious affiliation.”", "In offering his government’s apology in 2005, then-Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said the following: “I have no hesitation in apologizing to the Sikh community. I apologize not only to the Sikh community but to the whole Indian nation, because what took place in 1984 is the negation of the concept of nationhood enshrined in our constitution.", "“On behalf of our government, on behalf of the entire people of this country I bow my head in shame that such a thing took place.”", "Then-Prime Minister Manmohan Singh went on to say the following: “We cannot rewrite the past. But as human beings, we have the willpower, and we have the ability to write a better future for all of us.”", "For some victims and their families, the 1984 event’s wounds may have healed. For others, this tragedy still carries on as an open wound to this day.", "For 32 years, families of the victims have been asking that those responsible be brought to justice. Mothers have been raising their children by doing manual labour without any relief or support. In addition, some bad elements in society have further committed crimes and taken advantage of the situation by demanding money, extorting money and exploiting young women. This is shameful. My words in this House today are really empty words, and they are no relief to those families.", "Moreover, this is not a partisan issue. It is so unfortunate that the member who brought up this motion failed to discuss it with the other four members of the Legislature who are also Sikh members. If he had done that, we could have introduced this motion together, which could have made this motion more effective and meaningful.", "I want to watch this important debate. I have an open mind on this issue. My objective as a legislator is to ensure that justice is served, those who committed crimes are punished, relief is provided to mothers who have been struggling to raise their children, steps are taken so that these kinds of unfortunate acts do not happen again, and bad elements of society do not exploit situations again.", "I look forward to the debate." ],

More than 8,000 deaths occurred in the ensuing chaos, and more than 20,000 individuals left the city in the aftermath of the violence and riots; the worst, of course, in Delhi, where 3,000 Sikhs were beaten and burned to death, and in neighbouring Haryana.", "Many thought it would be reasonable that by hiding in the local gurdwara—a religious institution, a place of worship—they would be safe. But they, too, were shown no mercy. They were massacred. Any Sikh the rioters could get their hands on was beaten and killed.", "We should note, for the record, that there were many Hindu and Muslim citizens who helped to hide Sikhs, helped them to escape and protected them; ordinary citizens rising up against the government-sponsored genocide of Sikh individuals. One member who survived the riot shared his experience:", "“The loss all around was unprecedented. The nearby gurdwara was strewn in blood (and those marks have barely rubbed off to this day). The head priest was slashed to death and his young children were beaten and harassed. The broken windowpanes of the gurudwara remain, a bitter memory to the stone pelting that went on for hours on the holy shrine. In Daltonganj, countless Sikh men were beaten up. A dozen died. Some houses were stoned; others set ablaze. Some local Sikhs who were travelling out of the town were dragged out of trains,” put on the ground “and killed. The hospital refused to admit the injured, unless men cut their hair. Turban-wearing Sikhs had to make a choice:” they could either cut their hair or get no medical care and die. “Across the nation, more than 8,000 ... were killed, women were raped, burnt alive, homes brought down....”", "Those who survived—my colleague mentioned his friend the tailor—had their psyches impaired permanently.", "Speaker, I know that I have many colleagues who want to speak to this motion as well, but I want to say that we are pleased to support the member’s initiative and hope that other provinces will join with Ontario and recognize this massacre as a genocide." ],

A formal resolution renews the call to ultimately bring the perpetrators to justice.", "We cannot change the horrific events of 1984, but, as members of this Legislature, we have an opportunity to represent the families of genocide victims and we have an opportunity to stand up for them.", "Madam Speaker, I was six in 1984, and that was a long time ago. But time does not heal all wounds. When a community has been cut down, when families have been ended and when those who were behind the organized violence are not brought to justice, those wounds can’t heal; they fester. That is a long time without justice and without healing.", "Though the total number of victims is unconfirmed, more than 8,000 people lost their lives during this massacre, this genocide, and thousands of others were affected by injury, displacement and oppression. We’re talking about mass murder and massive suffering, so it’s important that our voices are loud and that our voices are heard. There are also a lot of voices that came together and inspired the creation of this particular motion.", "In May 2000, a commission was appointed by the National Democratic Alliance government in India to investigate the violence and its causes. The one-man commission consisted of former Supreme Court of India Justice G.T. Nanavati. The commission was granted a mandate to look at the following points: What were the sparks that led to the attacks targeting members of the Sikh community? What was the sequence of events? Could these crimes have possibly been averted and were there any lapses on the part of authorities? Were administrative measures taken to stop and to deal with the violence useful? And finally, what solutions can be recommended for adoption to ultimately serve justice?", "In the report, former Supreme Court of India Justice Nanavati stated that the killing of Sikhs in India in 1984 was planned and organized. Human rights organizations have also reported that democratic voter lists were used to identify and target Sikh businesses and homes and that children were found beheaded in the aftermath of those horrendous days. We’ve heard more specific and awful examples of the violence here today.", "The words “planned” and “organized,” though, are very important. They distinguish this from being a random act of violence and acknowledge that there were systemic and concerted efforts to kill thousands of Sikhs in India.", "The report also states, “All this could not have happened if it was merely a spontaneous reaction of the angry public. The systematic manner in which the Sikhs were thus killed indicate that the attacks on them were organized.”", "It also says, “There is also evidence on record to show that on 31 October 1984 either meetings were held or the persons who could organize attacks were contacted and were given instructions to kill Sikhs and loot their houses and shops. The attacks were made in a systematic manner and without much fear of the police.”", "New Democrats have always supported the right of all people to live in safety and practise their faith in peace, and that is why my colleague brought this motion for debate. Today we are acknowledging the systemic murder of thousands and calling for justice in their honour and their memory. Too often, it takes us too long to acknowledge when an atrocity occurred. That prevents us from taking the necessary steps to avoid future atrocities from occurring.", "By acknowledging that the violence against Sikhs in India in 1984 was, in fact, genocide allowed by those who should have kept them safe and secure in their homes, we are acknowledging that justice must be served.", "In November, when we reflect on the anniversary of this genocide, it is also important to recognize, as we’ve heard today, the brave actions of many from other faith backgrounds and communities. They provided protection and refuge to their Sikh brothers and sisters at great personal risk to themselves. It is a reminder that our shared humanity can triumph even in the face of such a dark tragedy.", "Madam Speaker, it is often at our darkest hours that people have the opportunity to shine the brightest. When we acknowledging the depths of evil and malice that can grow within humanity, we must also see and remember the spirit and virtue that can break through.", "On passing this motion, we can send a message to Sikhs and other community groups around the world that here in Ontario, we stand up for human rights and denounce intolerance and violent hate crimes.", "Also, Madam Speaker, we are members of a state assembly, and it is our job to make decisions to keep our constituents safe from harm. It is also our duty to call on other state legislators to remember their roles and responsibilities and, when we see that they have done harm, to speak up and say so.", "I will be supporting this motion, and I hope that my colleagues from all parties in the Legislature will join me." ],

The term “genocide” was coined in 1994 by Raphael Lemkin as part of a UN declaration which was incorporated into the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide in 1948.

It would be wrong for us to be inserting ourselves into that process at this point.", "I’m particularly concerned, if you look at the history of genocides—the Assyrian genocide, 750,000 people over a four-year period; the Armenian genocide, 1.5 million people over a six-month period; the Holocaust, upward of six million Jews over a 12-year period. This, and so many more genocides—we don’t want to in any way diminish how atrocious the genocides were, but at the same time we recognize how horrific what happened in 1984 was to the Sikh community. It was, absolutely. We stand strong with our Sikh friends all across this province in declaring that what happened there, as the Americans have done, is a grave human rights violation at the very least. It may well qualify as a genocide in the court of international justice, if that opportunity comes up.", "I think that’s a debate that, at best, the federal government has to be having.

If you haven’t heard it yet, a member of the Sikh community has become a YouTube sensation this week in calling the game-winning goal for the Pittsburgh Penguins in their series: “Nick Bonino! Bonino! Bonino! Bonino! Bonino! Bonino!” It was quite a call, so if you get a chance after this very serious debate to check this out, it was quite something to see in the Stanley Cup playoffs. He has become a real sensation.", "On a more serious note, though, we spoke last month about Canada’s history with South Asian immigrants and their treatment in trying to migrate to Canada. For a long time, members of the Sikh community and other immigrants from South Asia were subjected to prejudicial regulations imposed by other governments as a means of restricting their immigration. In spite of the fact that Canada and India, for decades, have been members of the Commonwealth, and previous to that were members of the British Empire, the South Asian population in Canada was in the low four digits until the late 1960s.", "Recently—and I have a number of books in my office about the Sikh religion and the various ordeals and tragic circumstances that they’ve gone through—I’ve learned a lot about religious violence in India and in South Asia during different points in history. While the member for Bramalea–Gore–Malton has highlighted the actions of 1984, there have been multiple instances of anti-Sikh violence, anti-Muslim violence and general religious violence throughout India’s history.", "Immediately after the partition of India and Pakistan in 1947, for example, Indian authorities gave the army a free hand to go after Sikh demonstrators in the streets of New Delhi. The home minister of the Indian government actually threatened to throw leaders of the Sikh community into concentration camps after days of religious violence between different Sikh, Hindu and Muslim factions, both in New Delhi and across India.", "Violence against Sikhs in India, unfortunately, has a long and deeply rooted history.

So we, all of us, have some blame to bear and we, all of us, need to make recompense every moment that we can, and here’s one of them.", "So I urge all my colleagues to vote for this motion, to vote on behalf of our Sikh community and to vote on behalf of everyone in every community who has experienced the horror of racism and of every community that has survivors of genocide." ],

The history of nations bears evidence that violence is not a solution for resolving political and social conflicts. My heart goes out to those innocent Sikhs and their survivors who lost their lives and properties in that 1984 tragedy.", "Madam Speaker, despite what I said and how deeply sad I feel, in my opinion, the Legislative Assembly of Ontario is not the proper forum to bring this motion and debate it; the House of Commons may be. The issues of state complicity and genocide are legal concepts that beg for an evidentiary basis. The proper forum to debate these issues is a court of law, not the Legislative Assembly of Ontario." ],

What a further tragedy it would be if we, as a society, did not learn lessons from these sad events, now over 30 years ago, to prevent similar sector-based carnage from repeating itself.", "Of course, over 30 years after these tragic events, many questions remain as to the lack of justice for the victims and their family members. While true justice in the face of unspeakable tragedies, like those we are discussing today, may never be fully realized, we fail as a society if we don’t work to right the wrongs that we can all agree have taken place.", "One step toward that justice is to recognize the 1984 events for the toll they look on the lives of Sikhs who faced the brutality of riots that claimed entire families. The death toll of Sikhs that was the result of the four days of chaos points toward the declaration that today’s motion asks us to support. Again, we, as a society, must learn from the lessons of the past.", "Today, we stand to indicate that those lessons are not lost on this Legislature or the people of Ontario, and we stand to support the motion brought forward by the member from Bramalea–Gore–Malton.

We just heard the member for Mississauga–Brampton South say that she believes that this should be debated in a court of law. Well, it’s a motion. We’re not looking to fine any companies or fine any individuals or prosecute anybody for the crimes that were committed. We’re looking to create public awareness. We’re a civilized society, and we understand that even civilized people such as ourselves, dressed in nice suits and ties today, can sometimes do horrific things because of horrible prejudice. So we are trying to set an example for Ontario. That’s why we’re here. It’s the Legislature of Ontario. We represent our constituents, and we’re trying to set an example and show that we understand that horrific events in 1984, where thousands of Sikhs were murdered after two Sikh guards murdered the Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi, at the time—that this is something we will not allow to be ignored or be forgotten, and we do not want to see the mistakes of the past return.", "I myself have spoken here about the Armenian genocide. I’ve spoken about the Rwandan genocide. I’ve spoken about the Holocaust. I’ve spoken about the Yazidis and the Christians, who are right now experiencing a genocide in the Middle East.", "This is why we’re here talking about this motion today—not just for all the people of Sikh nationality who are here today and want their loved ones who were murdered to be remembered; but we’re also here to ensure that something is being done and to pressure governments across the world to stop the genocides that are taking place right now, where young girls are being sold, possibly while we’re sitting here debating this, into slavery as sex slaves by ISIS.", "We want to commend, as well, with the motion—yes, we want to remember the victims, but we want to commend what the Jewish community calls “the righteous among the nations.” We refer to those individuals who, during the Holocaust, saved Jewish lives, hid Jewish families and took in children and called them their own during the Holocaust and then tried to find the relatives even afterwards. They would bury in the ground, because they didn’t want the papers to be found in their home—they would bury in a jar in the ground names of the children and their relatives so that they wouldn’t be forgotten, and tried to reunite the families afterwards.", "I obviously commend the member for bringing it forward. Yes, of course, any time you are killing somebody because of their religion, it is a genocide. It means you are trying to destroy that culture and wipe them from the face of the earth. We understand that it’s certainly more than just riots which would be spontaneous and not state-sponsored. We want to ensure that everybody in Ontario understands that hatred will not be allowed, that it will not be tolerated; and to also understand that, yes, we want everybody in Ontario to hold onto their culture, their religion and their past, and to remember it and to be proud of their heritage; and to understand that by knowing your heritage and celebrating your heritage you’re raising yourself up, that you’re a better person and your society is better for that; and to invite us to celebrate with you so that we can learn about your culture as well.", "We will not allow people to somehow feel better about themselves by putting somebody else down. That’s not what we’re here for, that’s not what we stand for, and we are not going to allow that to happen in our Ontario.", "Thank you again for bringing the motion forward, and we on this side of the House are happy to support it." ],

This would be such a powerful statement. It would impact so many people, and it would right such a grave misconception and injustice that these attacks were riots or that these attacks were spontaneous. It is so powerfully important to define what happened as a genocide, not just to give honour to the Sikh survivors but to honour any community in the world that’s seeking equity, any community in the world that’s facing injustice, to honour any community that’s facing a genocide.", "Injustice against one is injustice against all.

This is certainly one of those infamous omnibus bills that people often worry about, a bill so wide in scope that unwelcome changes can be snuck through with less scrutiny. But in the case of Bill 85, I just don’t think there is anything malicious or troublesome to be found. Quite frankly, Mr. Speaker, it’s more of a housekeeping bill than anything else.", "This bill was previously introduced in the last Parliament as Bill 151, and was known at that time as the Strengthening and Improving Government Act, 2013. Of course, that bill died on the order paper when my colleagues to my left decided they weren’t able to support the government’s budget motion, which prompted the Premier to ask the Lieutenant Governor to dissolve the House, triggering the 2014 provincial election.", "The third party was very upset with the government at that time, and that was before they ever mentioned their plans to sell off Hydro One. The Liberals waited for a few more months to go on record with that one, as it was never specifically mentioned once during the campaign. Given the outrage that that proposed fire sale has sparked province-wide, they feel that their decision not to mention the plan at all during the election was perhaps the right one. The government has their version of events and Ontarians have another. Time will tell who was right.", "But back to the bill, Mr. Speaker." ],

Does the act improve government by getting rid of a disastrous two-tier bargaining system that has created chaos for children and parents as teacher negotiations drag on? No, it doesn’t. That’s a real shame, as this two-tier disaster has been so ineffective that it has had a direct impact on children’s experience in the classroom and has resulted in Premier Wynne’s Liberals using taxpayer dollars to pay for bargaining costs.", "Now, if we believe the government, the Liberals’ brand new bargaining system was such a failure that they had to spend millions compensating unions for extra costs. That’s the best-case scenario: gross incompetence from the government. I need to go back and just ensure that, you know, the bill is called the Strengthening and Improving Government Act. Hmm. At worst, it’s a callous and unforgivable misappropriation of government funds to funnel money to protect their own political interests." ],

Does the Minister of Education expect Ontarians to believe that no student will ever struggle to graduate again?

Schedule 3 of Bill 85 provides for a liability exemption for the Ontario Medical Association, the OMA. The Commitment to the Future of Medicare Act would be amended to align with the 2012 physician services agreement between the province and the OMA. It would provide immunity for representatives of the OMA, including directors and staff, but not the association itself.

It seeks to protect the Ontario Medical Association in its capacity as the bargaining unit for Ontario’s physicians and adviser to the government on health matters.", "Unfortunately, it doesn’t mean that the government will actually listen to the Ontario Medical Association. Just last week, Mr. Speaker, we had a number of doctors right here in the Ontario Legislature who took the time out of their incredibly busy schedules to come down to Queen’s Park so that they could participate in our democracy. They wanted to have their voices heard because they say—and this is in their opinion, not mine—that the government is not giving them the respect they deserve and, more importantly, that this government’s cuts are harming patient care.", "They feel betrayed by a government that is hacking away at health care after promising it wouldn’t. They are outraged that the government is suggesting that doctors and nurses are simply imagining health care cuts; that they don’t know what they’re talking about. For not knowing what they’re talking about, they were pretty upset when the Minister of Health didn’t bother to participate in the debate on the future of health care funding in Ontario. He went down the road to catch the Blue Jays game—the only time when Toronto is really blue. That’s where he was. In the minister’s defence, he met with the OMA president, Michael Toth, the previous week. But that was little comfort to the hundreds of doctors in attendance that day.", "As I finish my remarks, I just want to reiterate my support for Bill 85. This is mostly a bit of tidying legislation meant to clean up messes caused by flawed past legislation, updating older legislation and bringing Ontario’s laws in line with federal changes. The bill can also serve as an important lesson for the future for all of us here in the Legislature: If a government can take the helpful advice of opposition parties to strengthen bills before they become law, there will be less need to strengthen and improve government after the fact. Over time, our respective parties will trade places in this Legislature. It is in our collective best interests, Mr. Speaker, to do the job right the first time, no matter who happens to be the government of the day.", "I’m very thankful to be able to contribute to the Legislature as a Deputy Speaker. It has shown me that despite our partisan differences, and there are a few on occasion—just saying—we’re here for the right reasons: We all want to strengthen our home communities and this province. We all have valid insights to provide and unique perspectives to add to issues. Listening to everyone can sometimes be a difficult task when things get heated. Mr. Speaker, sitting in that chair—and I and others have sat in that chair—we know how heated this Legislature can get on occasion. This Legislature is at its best when members are able to bring their concerns to the table and have them heard.", "Mr. Speaker, I’m sure that you’re aware of this bit of trivia, but people watching at home, and even some members here in the Legislature, may not know this, so I think it’s worth mentioning: The motto “Audi alteram partem”—I took Latin back in school, by the way." ],

It’s a good thing that we have consensus in the House. Talking about the bill, as far as how much content there is in here, there’s not a lot to get into as far as opposing. One of the areas this bill expands is in schedule 7, the stretcher transportation services; there are some regulations there that are going to be very helpful. When you have people who have private vehicles and are transporting patients from hospital to home, you want to make sure there is a safe mode of transportation between point A and point B. So there is something there with respect to something that’s going to help this Strengthening and Improving Government Act.", "I look forward to it going to committee and hearing what comes back to the House and what has actually been presented at committee and strengthened this bill that we have today." ],

I remember one time that I was with my good friend the member from Renfrew–Nipissing–Pembroke and we christened a brand new ambulance in the wonderful community of Renfrew, when they took over that vehicle.", "What happens is that these vehicles get to the end of their lifetime. The EMS services across the province of Ontario strip all the good equipment out of those vehicles, and then they’re sent to auction houses right across the province of Ontario. These vehicles are then picked up through the auction process and used for the process of transporting patients from hospitals home or to other areas. If you’ve ever seen some of these vehicles on the road, they look pretty rickety. I think this aspect of this bill is really important, in terms of people in Ontario. Finally we’ll put standards in place for these vehicles that are frequently used in terms of non-emergency transportation services across the province of Ontario.", "We all know that we stand on the shoulders of others, and previous governments in Ontario brought in high standards in terms of commercial vehicle operator’s registration, CVOR, and this will be applied to vehicles that are doing this service." ],

That’s very, very important if we’re really, truly committed to bringing forth the best possible legislation here as a group, as a collective body.", "It is important that we highlight the fact that there are issues that, if the government is sincere—I suspect there is a certain amount of sincerity in everything they do. If they’re sincere about good governance, they would have sat down with the opposition, the members on the other side of the House whom they are, by convention, compelled to listen to. As my colleague said, listen to the other side. We could have helped them. We could have helped them in drafting a bill that covered off some of the things that they have neglected in this bill.", "I know that I don’t have a lot of time, so I can’t be overly specific. But he did talk about things, for example, like the issue with regard to paying the other side; not listening to the other side, in reference to the opposition, but paying the other side, in the context of the negotiation of a collective agreement. Most people out there find the concept revolting that you would pay the other side you are negotiating with, because it certainly skews the result in the end. Are you, in fact, trying to influence decisions with regard to those negotiations? I think that’s something we all need to look at." ],

Mais ce sont des petits pas par en avant.", "Ce matin, je veux porter attention particulièrement sur deux cédules : ce sont les cédules 4 et 7 dont je veux parler dans mon discours.", "Again, Mr. Speaker, it’s always a pleasure to stand in my place on behalf of the good people of Algoma–Manitoulin. I want to say good morning to Mrs. Trepanier, who is probably watching this morning. Good morning to you and to Rose. You are always some great inspiration to me because when I do go out and visit you, at the long-term-care facilities, you always fill my ear with my oratorical skills, which I always try to improve on a regular basis. Sometimes I still make errors and you are always eager to help me and correct me, so good morning to you.", "Mr. Speaker, the bill addresses some matters that are important and need to be addressed, but mostly, as my colleagues have pointed out throughout the House, this is a thin omnibus bill, consisting of seven schedules on completely unrelated housekeeping issues. It looks to amend issues with the Ministry of the Attorney General, specifically the Courts of Justice Act; there are issues around the Ministry of Labour and allowing for and improving the ability to collect monies owed to employees; and there are also components that address the Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care. So there are a few different ministries that are covered throughout this schedule.", "The one thing I do want to point out and raise with the government is, in particular to schedule 1—I won’t spend much time on it; I hope they do. Schedule 1, the amendment to the Courts of Justice Act: to add proceedings under the Civil Marriage Act (Canada) to the list of proceedings that are within the jurisdiction of Family Court. The schedule is also amended to permit additional family law proceedings to be added to the Family Court’s jurisdiction by regulation and would create a senior advisory family judge. This position will instruct the Chief Justice on matters pertinent to family law.", "Other changes—this is what I want to raise attention to and hopefully raise a few eyebrows with the government—in schedule 1 bring the province in line with federal law around the Family Homes on Reserves and Matrimonial Interests or Rights Act (Canada). That was a law that was imposed by the then Harper government on to First Nations communities and which raised a lot of controversy within those communities. I would hope that this government has learned from those errors and has reached out to First Nations communities and taken the opportunity to consult with them on how this affects them, and also consult with them respecting the matrimonial interest acts that they have developed in their own communities. I raise this with the government in an attempt to have them reach out to First Nations as well.", "I want to go back to, particularly, schedule 7. With respect to the Ministry of Transportation, again, there are minor changes, but important, in terms of allowing or improving the regulations and safety around ambulances, prescribing the inspection and maintenance standards and ensuring that the prescribed equipment is on board. That is going to be very key, because essentially, right now, there are no regulations. There is, particularly in my riding, a pilot project that is in place. I would like to see it continue; however, we need greater transparency and regulation.", "While we are talking about the Ministry of Transportation and safety, it is important to remember how much outsourcing and privatization have put the lives of individual Ontarians at risk. I want to remind everybody of the risk that has been put on Ontarians, particularly with the Auditor General’s report that came out about the snow removal process. The Auditor General released a very scathing report that went into details that looked at the snow removal process and how it affected Ontarians by its outsourcing. She compared it to when it was not outsourced and also to when it was outsourced. What is very troubling is that the Auditor General came out with a report that conclusively stated that lives were lost—yes, Mr. Speaker, lives were lost because of this outsourcing. The Ministry of Transportation is essentially responsible for the roads that were not cleared properly because of this outsourcing—roads where snow removal was not conducted in a proper manner or in an efficient manner. It left people driving on roads that were in terrible condition, resulting in accidents, and those accidents resulted in fatalities. These fatalities were avoidable.", "It’s very troubling that the government decided to go down this route. The evidence all points to the fact that this route is not the right way to go, and we’re still going down that route now. I’m hoping the government listened to that report and plans to, for the upcoming winter, change the process, come up with an alternative, and perhaps go back to public snow removal, because the system is broken and is clearly not working.", "In particular, in my riding of Algoma–Manitoulin and across many northern and rural ridings, we have seen the shortcomings—actually, rather, the complete failure of snow removal throughout northern Ontario.", "I spend many of my days travelling to and from Queen’s Park, particularly to my riding and within my riding. My riding is very big, as you know, Mr. Speaker. I have seen many individuals have close calls. I’ve seen others in ditches. I’ve seen people injured. I’ve pulled individuals out of those ditches.", "There’s something that we need to learn through this bill. It’s got a very nice title: Strengthening and Improving Government Act. Well, let’s do that. Let’s have the discussion. Let’s challenge ourselves in order to make things that much better.", "I want to touch a bit as well on schedule 4, for the Ministry of Labour. The amendment that the government is suggesting does achieve an incremental improvement, but does it truly actually improve the government? I don’t think it does. This is what we see in the Ministry of Labour: If you don’t have compliance, if you don’t have enforcement and if you don’t have the resources to put into it—let me rephrase: no compliance, no enforcement, then there is really no point for this legislation. No enforcement, no resources: Why are you putting this piece of legislation forward? Because there’s really going to be no substance in order to bring the changes that the Ministry of Labour needs to provide or needs to act upon, in order to bring enforcement. Again, if there are no resources, there’s no enforcement.", "I want to go back to the services that are going to be affected across my riding through this, and the complaints that I’ve received from many individuals. Not only in Algoma–Manitoulin but across northern Ontario, we’re seeing an attack on ServiceOntario kiosks that are throughout northern Ontario. These kiosks are having their hours reduced. The services that are normally provided at these kiosks are no longer going to be provided.", "I have seniors who are going to have to drive longer distances, particularly on Manitoulin Island and Gore Bay, as a matter of fact—which is a lovely community, as you know, Mr. Speaker—who are going to be challenged. Now they’re going to have to take their driver’s test at a distance farther away from their home. People across the North Shore in my riding of Algoma–Manitoulin are suffering because the hours are being reduced. Certain kiosks are being shut down.", "These are things that are not acceptable. When we’re talking about a bill which is entitled the Strengthening and Improving Government Act, I’m sorry to say, but I don’t see it in Algoma–Manitoulin; and that’s just not acceptable. People in my riding deserve to have a lot better, and our government needs to provide them with a lot better service as well.", "There are many good things—some that are incremental, some that will make a change—in this bill, but some could be done a lot better. As a representative from northern Ontario, and particularly my great riding of Algoma–Manitoulin, driving safety is paramount in my riding. I want people to take their time. Winter months are coming up. We need to change our driving habits, not just those who are coming from northern Ontario to southern Ontario, but particularly those who are coming from southern Ontario to northern Ontario.", "I took the time to try and highlight some issues that I hope the government will heed. I wanted to highlight those issues from a northern perspective." ],

It prescribes requirements and specifications for the identification of STS vehicles, to distinguish them from ambulances. That’s very important for people to know. For ambulances, as we know, we have to get out of the way immediately and allow them to go through. These vehicles are non-emergency, but they are important.", "I think what this bill does, among many other things—you might say they’re minor amendments, but they are significant nevertheless.

There’s not a lot of meat on the bone here, is the way that it’s been described this morning, and I would have to agree.", "I am very fortunate to have an OLIP intern in my office. Her name is Justyna Zegarmistrz—and I apologize to the folks at Hansard for that, I will give you the spelling in a moment.

All you have to do is look at the front page of the papers—all of the papers—in the last week and you will clearly see that we need to improve government in Ontario.", "Bill 85, the Strengthening and Improving Government Act, attempts to bring forward updates to amend Ontario legislation so that it remains current and relevant for Ontarians. Despite affecting over 15 pieces of legislation and involving over eight ministries, Bill 85 remains limited in its scope and is a piece of legislative housekeeping, rather than a bill that introduces real, substantive change in Ontario. Considering the eight different ministries affected by the bill, the government missed an opportunity to address the numerous deep-rooted problems present in each ministry.", "Considering first the Ministry of the Attorney General, Bill 85 is largely amended only to include new federal legislation. With some additional clarifications on the duties of the senior advisory family justice and the streamlining of internal procedures and financial procedures, the bill could have been more comprehensive in its reach and scope to strengthen and improve government, as is the title of the bill.", "There have been issues that have been addressed in the House recently by the member from Lanark–Frontenac–Lennox and Addington in question period with the Attorney General, and by the member from Haliburton–Kawartha Lakes–Brock in relation to the shootings that occurred earlier this fall in Wilno and some of the issues that we’re facing with repeat offenders who are let back into the community without signing the proper documentation: These are some of the items that could have been addressed in this piece of legislation.", "The amendments affecting the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services are a further example of the surface-level reach of this bill. In this amendment, the bill aims to introduce some minimal cost savings, allowing all out-of-date certificate stock to be used before reprinting new stock. Surely more costs savings could be found than just the recycling of stock in a ministry as large as this, but that’s as deep as the government went in this bill.", "Moving on to the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care: Bill 85 aims to protect the Ontario Medical Association as a representative body for Ontario’s physicians and as its adviser to the government on health matters. Providing immunity to the representatives of the Ontario Medical Association and restricting individuals from pursuing civil action against agreements between the OMA and the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care does very little to affect real change for the thousands of Ontarians who are depending on our health care system. Understandably, this amendment may be necessary to protect representatives from legal action, from negotiations done in good faith, but Ontarians need a stronger and improved health care system, not just amendments that are housekeeping in nature.", "Rooting out waste and building a patient-centric model of health care delivery is what Ontarians really need, and I know that’s what all of us as MPPs continue to hear about at our constituency offices and through the correspondence from our residents. A bill that’s supposed to strengthen and improve government should be more ambitious and farther-reaching than the one that’s presented by the government in Bill 85.", "Continuing down the list, the Ministry of Labour seeks to modernize outdated regulation by bringing Ontario’s legislation in line with federal legislation. Updating the classification and labelling of hazardous workplace materials by introducing the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals is important to keep Ontario workers safe, but, again, this government needs to move beyond just scratching the surface. I’m sure more can be done to keep Ontario’s workers safe. In my office, we hear all the time from people who have WSIB issues. There are so many workplace issues that could have been dealt with in this bill that aren’t addressed at all.", "In regard to the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing, further minor housekeeping changes are being introduced. Amending the City of Toronto Act and the Municipal Act to send receipt notices of bylaws to the Minister of Finance rather than to the Minister of Education does not enact real change for our citizens.", "Allowing the city of Toronto to expand cross-border transit to pick up and collect fares in neighbouring jurisdictions is a small step forward, but the root of transit issues in Toronto and across the province remains a serious one, especially for those folks who are requiring medical treatment. It’s impossible for some of the residents in my rural riding to get to Kingston to receive the treatment that they need, which is a two-hour drive or a two-and-a-half or three-hour drive, in some cases, depending on where you are in the North Hastings part of my riding.", "Repealing obsolete subsections of the Municipal Act and adding minor amendments may be necessary, but this government can and should do better. They can do more in a bill they entitled the Strengthening and Improving Government Act.", "For the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities, Bill 85 follows a similar path as with the previous ministries examined. Clarifying the continuity of the ownership of college assets from the board of directors to the college and allowing the college registrar to appoint investigators to investigate the conduct of a member is, once again, a surface-level change that fails to consider the other issues facing this ministry. Our community colleges are facing cutbacks on a regular basis. Loyalist College in my riding, in the Belleville area, had to remove $4 million from its budget recently. That’s a serious cut to the services that are provided at Loyalist College.", "In respect to the Ministry of Transportation, Bill 85 makes important first steps towards ensuring the regulation of drug-impaired driving. By following suspensions for drug-impaired driving similar to those for drinking and driving, law enforcement officers will be able to do more to make sure roads are kept safe for Ontarians. Nevertheless, the bill does little to detail how drivers will be tested for drug impairment. Ensuring that drug-impaired drivers are apprehended off the roads is critical, but so is ensuring that testing procedures respect the rights of an individual and are conducted in a manner that can be upheld in the courts.", "Furthermore, this bill also makes vague and unclear amendments to regulate medical transportation services. The safety of medical transportation services is undeniably important, but the Liberal government also has an obligation to the citizens of Ontario to outline how they intend to regulate these services. Ontarians certainly haven’t forgotten the government’s track record and lack of oversight in other scandalous affairs such as Ornge services.", "While Bill 85 brings in some necessary updates to Ontario’s legislation, this government needs to do more to make real change to each of these ministries so that they always serve and act in the best interests of all Ontarians. As such, we’ll be supporting this bill while imploring the government to instigate deep-rooted change, especially in the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care and the Ministry of Transportation.", "In my riding, in the Quinte region, Quinte Health Care is facing major, major cutbacks: $12 million had to be cut from the budget. They’re currently going through the process of removing services from four hospitals in our region: Belleville General, Trenton Memorial, North Hastings and Prince Edward County Memorial Hospital. Nurses are going to be laid off again. We saw 58 of them laid off earlier this year. More are going to be laid off next year. These cutbacks are serious, and they’re tied to a funding formula that the government has brought in that relates health care funding to growth in a community. But this government, at the same time, is bringing in legislation in the Legislature prohibiting growth in rural areas because they believe what’s right for Toronto, or right for larger urban centres, works in rural Ontario. It clearly doesn’t. The people in Prince Edward–Hastings need their health care services just as much as those here in the GTA.", "This bill could have been a whole lot better." ],

Here’s the dilemma: What happens is that the opposition hates omnibus bills. Yet today, the members are telling us that there should have been more things in this particular bill. I understand that.

Elizabeth Witmer is now the chair—for several years—and since that time the WSIB cases have tripled and quadrupled in my office with people being denied and services being taken away from them after several years of needing WSIB through no fault of their own; being injured on the job and being told that they don’t qualify for WSIB funds.", "One case in particular is a man who worked in a steel company and was hit with 6,000 pounds—or tonnes, whatever it would be—of steel.

We are discussing the issues that are relevant to the piece of legislation. I would like to inform viewers who are tuning in that of the 36 bills that the government has introduced or tabled in this House since the beginning of this session, 14 of them they have time-allocated, so they have cut debate on 14 of them. I’d like to thank my colleague the member from Renfrew–Nipissing–Pembroke, who gave me the list of the bills there: Bill 6, Infrastructure for Jobs and Prosperity Act; Bill 7, Better Business Climate Act; Bill 8, Public Sector and MPP Accountability—they go on. There are 14 in total that they’ve cut debate on, things that are important, that have real significance to the prosperity of the province and real effect in the lives of the people of the province. They deal with health care. They deal with jobs. They deal with climate change. They deal with MPPs’ accountability. They deal with child care.", "They chopped off debate, really stymied the process in this place and limited the democratic right of all elected members to discuss and bring forward the concerns of their communities.

They don’t want to hear about it. They want to jam through and ram through their agenda. However, when it comes to something that’s innocuous, like Bill 85—and I urge again viewers who are tuning in to look it up, take a look and see how this bill will affect your lives; it really will not. They have a majority government. You would expect that they would put a lot of thought into the construct of the bills to ensure that there is full consideration given to the needs of the province. This is not one of those bills.", "As my colleague from Kitchener–Waterloo stated, when she spoke to the bill, the Clerks at the table must be shaking their heads in reference to who writes these types of bills on behalf of the government, because they are not substantive bills.", "Again, being housekeeping, it affects seven schedules, in very minimal ways that are not contentious. As opposition, we don’t see any nefarious actions on behalf of the government built into the language of the bill. One of the aspects, however, does have some impact on the transportation services which were referenced as “stretcher transportation services” in Ontario. They are currently unregulated. These are private operators that operate ambulance services and medical transportation services.", "What this is essentially, as I see it, is the Uber of ambulatory services. This is what they’re doing. They are regulating an unregulated aspect of emergent transportation services, and they absolutely should.", "It’s interesting to note that they first indicated they needed regulation on this service in 2011. So they needed four years in total to realize that they should bring forward legislation—again, an astounding indication of, frankly, laziness, ineptitude, inability to actually prioritize the needs—real, substantial needs. It’s incredible." ],

We think they deserve to know that it is a mode of transportation that’s regulated, that has oversight, that is safe, that is affordable, that is effective, and that the people who operate it are qualified and in it for the right reasons.", "We’ve seen another mode of private transportation that supports patients and those in medical emergency situations, under the vision of this government and under the watch of the government: Ornge air ambulance. We saw that absolutely fail, again with the guidance of the Liberal government. They took their eye off the ball. They allowed a private operator to bilk the system—milk the system, rather—and it failed.", "Thankfully, we had an effective opposition to raise those questions, to hold the government accountable and to make the necessary changes. I want to thank our colleague from Nickel Belt, who really fought a great and valiant fight on that and brought some necessary changes.", "The patient stretcher transfer service indicates that they will require that these operators receive a CVOR. Stretcher transportation providers would be regulated now as commercial vehicles. It’s interesting that they didn’t, prior to that. They would have been just private vehicles, similar to the ones we drive each and every day.

The expertise of these many voices has helped us to “get it right” and to continue the hard work to challenge ourselves, along with challenging the myths and behaviours that are at the core of sexual violence and harassment.", "Our action plan has also made progress in providing more support for survivors, improving safety in workplaces and on campuses, and emphasizing that we all have a role to play to end violence and harassment.", "Je tiens à remercier les personnes, les organismes et les diverses collectivités de l’Ontario qui sont à nos côtés alors que nous faisons des progrès à l’égard des engagements que comprend notre plan d’action.", "Many voices came forward and provided advice during the development of the action plan, and they’ve continued to share their wisdom regarding the proposed Sexual Violence and Harassment Action Plan Act. Speaker, if this is passed, the act will amend six existing acts so we can better support survivors of sexual violence and harassment in a number of ways. The proposed changes are as follows:", "First, amend the Limitations Act to remove the limitation period for any civil sexual assault claim. This would encourage more survivors to come forward, regardless of how much time has passed since they became survivors of sexual assault.", "Second, amend the Compensation for Victims of Crime Act to end the two-year time limit in which survivors can apply to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board for compensation as a result of sexual or domestic violence.", "Third, all Ontarians deserve, of course, to work in a safe and healthy environment. Our proposed legislation would amend the Occupational Health and Safety Act to include a definition of workplace sexual harassment. It would require employers to address all complaints of workplace harassment, including sexual harassment, and take reasonable steps to ensure that employees experience zero harassment—sexual or otherwise—within the workplace.", "Fourth, amend the Residential Tenancies Act to shorten the length of notice a tenant must give a landlord in situations where the tenant is fleeing domestic or sexual violence. Women, children, families: They all need to be able to leave an unsafe home as quickly as possible.", "Fifth, amend the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities Act and the Private Career Colleges Act so that every publicly funded college, university and private career college in Ontario must develop a stand-alone policy on sexual violence, and review that policy—with student input—every three years. Campus life is meant to be a special and enjoyed occasion, not to be spent in fear or apprehension.", "Speaker, the campaign that began last March to end sexual violence and harassment has reached this legislative chamber, which gives voice to all Ontarians. Ensemble, utilisons nos pouvoirs législatifs pour protéger la population de l’Ontario contre la violence et le harcèlement à caractère sexuel.", "En adoptant ces propositions, nous affirmerons clairement que la violence et le harcèlement à caractère sexuel ne sont pas tolérés.", "In Ontario, sexual violence and harassment are never okay, Speaker." ],

  "text" : [ "I would like to thank the minister responsible for women’s issues for introducing Bill 132, the Sexual Violence and Harassment Action Plan Act. It’s certainly a positive step forward. Many aspects of the bill that we are going to look at when the bill goes through the House and through committee, I think, we had been discussing at the select committee. For those members who have been on the select committee, from all three parties, I want to thank them for their work. And I’d like to thank all the presenters who came forward, the voices of the women who came forward who have been in situations where they have felt they have not been able to come forward and get the appropriate help.", "The select committee’s final report is coming before the Legislature in the next few weeks, and I hope the government would also look at the recommendations that we’ll be presenting and address those concerns in a meaningful way—the many recommendations that can be made to cover the multifaceted nature of domestic violence and sexual harassment.", "Bill 132, the one that the minister has spoken about today, proposes to remove the limitation period for civil suits based on sexual assault or sexual misconduct. That means that victims can submit claims when they feel comfortable. Before that, there was a two-year limitation. That’s something we certainly heard through the committee, also.", "The bill also aims to remove the limitation period for survivors of sexual and domestic violence to file compensation applications to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board, the statutory limitations, so survivors are afforded the time to come forward when they feel safe.", "The bill is also going to amend the Occupational Health and Safety Act. The definition of workplace sexual harassment will now be included, when it wasn’t before, and certainly enhancing programs at the workplace and in consultation with businesses as we go forward, as we heard from the briefing, to make it safer for employees, but also for employers, to assist some of those small businesses with developing that policy.", "The Residential Tenancies Act is going to be amended, allowing survivors to shorten the notice period to 28 days to terminate a lease where a tenant is fleeing from unsafe living conditions. That has been brought up in the Legislature before, by the present Minister of Community Safety and Correctional Services.", "The bill, I think, makes great strides in tackling the misogynistic attitudes and rape culture on our post-secondary campuses. Ontario students from elementary school to university often joke about rape and sexual assault and violence. The fact that our society has these very twisted perceptions about women at times, where they are treated as sexual objects, is certainly not acceptable, and that’s part of the fact that we need to change the culture. Every single Ontarian should be recognized for their intrinsic abilities alone.", "Public colleges and universities will be mandated to have a stand-alone sexual violence policy, with student input, reviewed every three years. I want to commend the colleges especially for having that program up and going so quickly after we started the select committee and started the process of what we can do to address this. The universities, of course, are closely behind. So we have a lot of willing partners to make more positive steps forward.", "I know that in light of the Ottawa Valley murders we were hoping to look at the bill and the fact of what had taken place there, especially this situation of probation officers and especially in rural Ontario and underserviced areas—how we can look at that.", "The Partner Assault Response Program: We certainly heard a great deal in the select committee about the positiveness of that program and about the wait-list that exists for that program and how we could maybe come to some agreement, as we’ve been trying to do in the Legislature, on that topic.", "Also, the recommendations of the Domestic Violence Death Review Committee’s report from 2012, with some key recommendations, going forward, on when an offender, such as what happened in the Ottawa Valley, does not sign the probation orders, and the progressive enforcement that needs to follow up for that.", "And, of course, human trafficking legislation: I’d like to see if we could consider adding a piece about having a coordinated approach to combatting human trafficking in the province of Ontario, similar to what I introduced in May, so that we can give more resources to police officers and survivors so that we can decrease the amount of human trafficking that exists in our province.", "Unfortunately, my time is up, but we know we’re going to have a long time to speak to the bill that’s been brought forward. I thank the minister again for bringing it forward." ],

  "text" : [ "I’m pleased to rise as NDP critic for women’s issues to respond to the minister’s statement on the Sexual Violence and Harassment Action Plan Act.", "First of all, I want to commend the minister for delivering on several of the commitments that were made in It’s Never Okay, which was launched in March 2015. I’m glad to see that the decades of advocacy by front-line agencies and survivors have produced some concrete legislative changes that will improve the safety of Ontario workplaces and post-secondary campuses.", "I also recognize the symbolic importance of launching this legislation on the eve of Woman Abuse Prevention Month in November. We know from around the world that violence against women is one of the key barriers to women’s equality. A comprehensive legal framework to prevent sexual violence, to support survivors and help them heal, and to hold perpetrators accountable is a vital component in ending sexual violence and harassment in Ontario.", "While this legislation represents a significant step forward, I am concerned as a member of the Select Committee on Sexual Violence and Harassment that other necessary amendments may never see the light of day. Additional recommendations for legislative changes are currently being finalized by the select committee for presentation to the Legislature on December 10, which is too late to be included in Bill 132. Those recommendations arise from the hundreds of hours of testimony that was provided to the committee; from the pain and the tears of survivors, who talked about the failures of our system; and from agency staff, who understand first-hand where the gaps are and how they need to be addressed.", "Given the many different priorities that compete for time on the legislative agenda, I hope that Bill 132 does not close the file on the government’s legislative response to sexual violence and harassment, because there are many other issues that need to be addressed. With research showing that fewer than 10% of sexual assault cases are ever reported to the police, it’s vital to understand why people don’t report. The select committee heard that many survivors do not go to the police because they fear they will be stigmatized and traumatized.", "At the same time, we heard about the need for supportive alternatives to the legal system for survivors and the urgency of holding abusers accountable through other mechanisms than just the court system. We know from the brutal murders of three women in Renfrew county last month that there are limits to the ability of the justice system to truly protect women from sexual violence.", "We can’t lock up offenders forever. We must seek out ways to change the abusive behaviours that led to violence in the first place. That’s why evidence-based programs like Partner Assault Response, or PAR, must be a critical part of a sexual violence action plan. It is why the government’s own expert panel recommended in 2009 that PAR be strengthened, that it be delivered on a differentiated basis rather than one size fits all, and that it be made available to abusers who voluntarily want to change, instead of only those who are court-ordered.", "It is troubling that at the same time progress is undeniably being made on sexual violence, warnings from experts and community leaders about recent changes to the Partner Assault Response Program are being ignored. Instead of acting on the 2009 recommendations about PAR, the Attorney General has watered the program down by reducing the number of sessions available to offenders. This is potentially creating a revolving door for abusers and putting women and children at risk.", "The select committee heard over and over that domestic violence and sexual violence are intertwined. Whether a woman is sexually assaulted by her intimate partner or date raped by an acquaintance, she experiences the same life-shattering consequences: devastation, fear, guilt and shame. Yet siloed funding for sexual violence and domestic violence continues to limit the ability of community-based programs to provide integrated and coordinated responses. This must change.", "In closing, New Democrats certainly welcome this legislation. However, we will continue to push for broader, systemic change to create a coordinated, integrated and survivor-led approach to the prevention of sexual violence and harassment, an approach that provides sustainable funding for front-line agencies to truly support survivors and engage in effective community-led public education and awareness campaigns, and that ensures trauma-informed responses at every point, from police, health care, education, social services and the justice system." ],

  "text" : [ "It’s always a pleasure to rise in this House to talk about important issues, and there can be nothing more important than the health and safety of workers in the province of Ontario. So I want to speak today to Bill 109, the Employment and Labour Statute Law Amendment Act, 2015.", "Since becoming the labour critic earlier this year, I’ve spent many hours meeting with workers, with advocacy groups, with labour leaders and countless others to try and get an understanding of the complexity of the still unaddressed labour issues, workers’ issues that people face in this province. These issues are particularly important to me because, as you know, I was a front-line nurse for 20 years, so I consider myself a worker. I represented nurses in that capacity as an elected union president, a health and safety representative—all different areas. I then went to work for the Ontario Nurses’ Association, where I represented registered nurses and allied health professionals for another 20 years. So now I’m giving away my age.", "I can tell you that I understand how important it is for all hard-working Ontarians in our province to have a good, stable job, a job that can support a family, one that they can rely on every week for a paycheque. However, the truth is that there are too many families across this province that are actually living in poverty, too many unable to climb out of poverty because of precarious work—work that has part-time hours, that is for temporary agencies that don’t have enough regulation, or foreign temporary workers who aren’t being monitored under federal regulations to ensure they have a safe work environment.", "This happens even in good jobs in this province, Speaker. Precarious work can be in health care. CarePartners, for example, are still on strike after, I think, almost eight months working for a for-profit agency here in the province. They’re on strike because of that precarious work. The way that they are being paid and their working conditions are not much different than the canning factories of the 1950s and 1960s: running from house to house, not being paid for travel time, all of those kinds of things that are part of the precarious work situation and that become more prevalent each year in this province, not to mention the wait-lists that continue to grow for seniors in our province and other vulnerable groups in every one of our communities.", "So there are lots of issues plaguing workers and there are not enough supports in place. To put it simply, Speaker, the Liberal government is failing to provide any recourse for workers across this province for many of these very important issues.", "Too many workers in this province go to work without a guarantee that they won’t come home injured. I think we had seven or eight falls where people actually lost their lives in 2014. Too many single mothers are struggling with temporary jobs, juggling a family, trying to get by. For over a decade, workers in this province have been lobbying for some simple improvements that would actually improve their work lives because they could join a union; things like automatic card certification, which we had back in 1990 and which the Liberal government gave to the construction industry. But all of the other workers in this province have to have a secret campaign, sign their cards, file their application at the labour board and then fight with employers about whether or not they’ve signed enough cards. People want to join a union, they want to have a voice, they want to have somebody advocate for them, they want somebody to negotiate good wages, good benefits, a pension plan and working conditions.", "I organized for the Ontario Nurses’ Association full time for a period of about five years in the mid-1990s. The vast majority of nurses did not join a union because of wages or because of benefits. They joined because they felt disrespected and they didn’t have a voice.", "Taras, our member from Essex, introduced a bill in 2012, Bill 77, which would have seen a number of easy, progressive changes for the labour movement: automatic card certification, first contract arbitration—here we have these CarePartners nurses and support workers out on strike for eight months and they can’t even get to a first contract arbitration, while we have hundreds of seniors on wait-lists waiting for care—a no-discipline certification process and something easy, like ensuring that your ESA rights are on posters in every workplace. The truth is that the hard-working people in this province shouldn’t have to fight this hard to get these little fixes in the various pieces of legislation that affect workers in this province.", "This bill was introduced at the tail end of the session last year. We know that it’s kind of an omnibus bill, because it is dealing with a number of pieces of legislation. It’s dealing with the Fire Protection and Prevention Act, it’s dealing with the public sector labour relations act and it’s dealing with the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act.", "It’s interesting to me that all three of these are shoved into one bill, because on one hand, parts of it are pretty progressive: looking for improvements in occupational health and safety for all workers and giving firefighters in our province the same rights that other workers have under the Labour Relations Act.", "But then there’s this poison pill, under the Public Sector Labour Relations Transition Act, where the government is proposing to take away the democratic right of workers in an amalgamation or merger of a school or a municipality or a hospital—to actually take away the rights—if they have less than 40% representation, so that they wouldn’t have a right to vote for the union of their choice.", "I don’t know why the government has done this. In my view, I think they should split the bill or they should actually remove this piece because all it’s doing is pitting some unions against some other unions, worker against worker. That’s exactly what it is doing. I think I said this yesterday, when the Tories were up speaking to the bill: It is an infringement of our Charter of Rights and Freedoms.", "Under schedule 1, the Fire Protection and Prevention Act: Basically this schedule just amends the FPPA by aligning it with the existing Labour Relations Act that governs most workers in the province. It would make changes to that act around unfair labour practices, provisions that currently don’t exist under the FPPA: membership in associations, expedited rights to arbitration, with modifications that take into account the unique nature of firefighters’ labour relations.", "It would amend the FPPA to address membership in associations in a number of ways. It would permit associations to require the inclusion of a closed shop in a collective agreement, mandatory dues, deductions and provisions requiring membership in the association, and it would give preference of employment to members of an association.", "It would also amend it by the addition of a range of prohibitions on unfair labour practices that don’t currently exist in the act that governs firefighters in this province. Under “the duty of fair representation” obligation, it would ensure that the union is actually representing firefighters fairly in this province. That language doesn’t currently exist under the FPPA.", "On the introduction of an expedited rights arbitration process, similar to that found under section 49 of Labour Relations Act: Under that act, either party, the employer or the worker, can ask for an expedited process where there is a grievance, and the grievance has to be heard within 21 days. It’s the appointment of a single arbitrator by the ministry, and it’s to decide an unresolved grievance.", "You’ll know from your past life, Mr. Speaker, that it can sometimes take years to resolve a grievance. This expedited process, although it’s good and it gets you to that hearing for the first day in 21 days, it doesn’t mean that your second day, third day, fourth day of hearing—some grievance arbitrations can take that long—are going to happen in any speedy way. If you’ve got a simple grievance, you might get it resolved on that first day of arbitration and then you have to wait for your decision. But in my experience, having dealt with thousands of grievances over the years, that isn’t always what happens. It all depends on whether the arbitrator is available on another date that is close by. It depends on the lawyers or the union representatives who are representing the worker in the grievance. So it isn’t a given that you’re going to get a decision in 21 days.", "Further amendments would provide some religious exemption from paying dues. This issue is already contained in the Labour Relations Act. I can tell you, having organized about 5,000 nurses in my time with ONA, the issue of religious exemption is very minimal. It doesn’t come up very often—I can really only recall once or twice. There was a merger between the Scarborough General Hospital and the Salvation Army Scarborough Grace Hospital. There were a couple of people who worked there who didn’t want to pay union dues and thought they could have that addressed through the Labour Relations Act.", "Bill 109 also provides that the changes will have some retroactive effect, as they will apply immediately to any ongoing matters that are before the OLRB. What that means is that the bill was introduced on May 28, so if there are any issues currently at the Ontario Labour Relations Board and this bill is passed, then the effect would be made retroactive to that date. We know, however, that this Liberal government has a history of delaying bills and delaying the order of things in committee. They also have a history of time-allocating bills, time-allocating amendments, time-allocating clause-by-clause and preventing people who want to weigh in on an issue from having the right to come in and make presentations. I see one of my Tory colleagues nodding here, because we experienced that this week, actually, in social policy. If there are a lot of people wanting to weigh in on this bill, I would say, don’t hold your breath, because it may not get to committee as soon as you think and you may never get a chance to weigh in because of the restrictive time-allocation ways of the Liberals in this majority government.", "The second part of the bill is around the workers’ compensation system. It would make a number of amendments to the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act that we support. Having said that, I want to highlight the amendments that the government is proposing, and say that they certainly don’t go as far as they should to make sure that workers are protected. After years and years of paying lip service to injured workers in this province, many of the amendments that are included here don’t begin to cover the necessary changes that workers, advocacy groups, and consultants who have been hired to write reports have addressed over the last five to 10 years.", "In his leadoff speech, the Minister of Labour stated that this schedule of the bill was “driven by our commitment to protect injured workers and their right to file a claim with” WSIB. If this commitment was real, we wouldn’t have had to wait over five years for recommendations from a government-commissioned report on WSIB to start being implemented here today.", "Over five years ago, the Liberal government’s Ministry of Labour commissioned a report called the Dean report to look at occupational health and safety issues following the tragic death of a worker who fell while working on a high-rise platform right here in Toronto. This was over five years ago. Last year, there were seven more falls, and the recommendation from that report still wasn’t implemented. Absolutely no movement has been made on any of the key recommendations of the report.", "However, as New Democrats, we support the Fair Practices Commissioner that is proposed in this piece of legislation to serve as an ombudsman of the WSIB under this bill. The new commissioner would have the authority to investigate complaints and to make recommendations—effective recommendations, I hope, and, I hope, some authority to enforce—", "Interjections." ],

But there are some questions that we need to ask ourselves before we get into that committee. Who determines how that person will be appointed? What criteria would establish them as being viable candidates, or would they just be a friend of the Liberals? Lastly and most importantly, would the commissioner be appointed by unanimous agreement of the parties, which is the case here with most legislative officers of this House?", "The issue of claims suppression is a huge issue. The bill would amend the act to provide protection to employees who have filed, or intend to file, a claim for benefits due to workplace accident or injury by prohibiting employers from filing claims influencing or inducing workers to withdraw or abandon claims.", "I have a little story here, Speaker. In probably the mid-2000s, I would say it was, I was representing nurses who worked for the Niagara Health System. You’ve all heard about the Niagara Health System over the years. It’s the largest health system in the province. Eight hospitals came together; it has never worked.", "In any event, at that time, I was doing the servicing for the Ontario Nurses’ Association. A couple of nurses brought to our attention that when they tried to get paid for an incidental sick day, where they were off sick with the flu or a cold, they were told by their managers in the occupational health department that they didn’t have any sick days in their bank.", "In the hospital sector, they work under a system of a short-term and a long-term disability plan. Under the short-term plan, you have 15 weeks of short-term, and then you move to a long-term plan that can go up to two years in your own occupation, and longer in any occupation.", "These were people who had injuries in the past. When we started to investigate it, there were 700 workers in the Niagara Health System, both from ONA and SEIU, the support workers, who had not had any lost-time claims reported by the occupational health department of the Niagara Health System to WSIB.", "All of these people were at risk somewhere down the road. So we called in WSIB, and they investigated the Niagara Health System. At the end of the day, we had all of these people’s sick banks reinstated, because what they had done was, while these people were off with their injuries, they had used their sick banks. They had not claimed any lost time for them—even though some of them were off eight weeks, 10 weeks, 15 weeks—and used their banks. Then when they went to use a sick day, that’s when we found out what they had done.", "You know what? It was a terrible thing to find out that an employer was so blatantly doing this across the board, but at the same time getting experience-rating rebates back for a couple of million dollars. That happens across the province.", "I know that this happens, and I also know individually from speaking to nurses over the years that many times they’re encouraged—somebody injures themselves, they need to go for surgery and they’re encouraged by their managers, not just in health care but everywhere, to use their sick time: “It’ll be easier to get the money. You won’t have to wait that three weeks or four weeks to get compensation.” The problem is that if you don’t recover in the period of time that you normally would recover, for whatever reason, you then will be reduced to long-term disability benefits, at a much lower rate than you would have received through compensation.", "Claims suppression is a huge problem in this province. Many workers have reported implied threats when an employer offers to continue a worker’s wages instead of reporting. Claims suppression results in many injuries not being reported, and often, workers are brought in to work just to sit at a desk and do nothing so that the employer does not have any lost-time claims.", "I recently had the pleasure of meeting with the Ontario Network of Injured Workers, a group that’s no stranger to the Legislature. It’s headed, as we know, by Karl Crevar, who so pointedly highlighted how not only problematic but costly claims suppression is. Injured workers and their families are the ones forced to bear most of the brunt of those costs and those injuries, as well as our public systems that people pay taxes for, our ODSP and Ontario Works system. So on one hand, we’re not paying them their compensation benefits, but then we end up paying it out of another pocket.", "It can be subtle, it can be hidden, and it’s difficult to know when it happens unless workers actually report it. A WSIB-funded study said that at least 8% of work-related injuries and illnesses are either not reported or misrepresented when they are reported, because of the lost-time injuries and not wanting to report that. As many as 10% of the cases aren’t reported at all. So there’s reason to believe that it’s widespread.", "In a recent funding review of WSIB by Professor Harry Arthurs, he describes WSIB’s failure to address claim suppression as a “moral crisis.” On May 12, that report came out, and it’s taken three years to get to here today just to bring a bill forward that will address some of this issue.", "He recommended that WSIB commit to making the changes necessary to protect workers against claims suppression and other abuses related to the experience-rating piece. He said at the time that it was so significant that he recommended that it be done within 12 months. But here we are, three years—and by the time it’s done, it will probably be closer to four years.", "He went on to say: “Unless the WSIB is prepared to aggressively use its existing powers ... to prevent and punish claims suppression, and unless it is able to vouch for the integrity ... of its experience rating programs, it should not continue to operate them.”", "Once again, Speaker, claims suppression on this side equals rebates that employers shouldn’t be getting on that side. At a time when we say that WSIB’s liability is underfunded, we’re paying out millions of dollars to employers who may or may not be suppressing claims.", "Claims management is also a problem under the current system. If this government refuses to look at this issue for its most vulnerable workers, then the financial costs continue to rise there as well. This is when employers take an adversarial approach to workers’ claims, or to workers returning to work, to try and limit their responsibility. They accuse workers of exaggerating their symptoms. They appeal claims. They hire private investigators to monitor injured workers. They withhold supporting evidence, and I experienced that as well, in my time representing nurses, where someone would have an injury and then, all of a sudden, when you would get a file, the employer reported, “Well, that woman played piano for 20 years”—which had nothing to do with the injury that she had to her hand or her arm—trying to throw things in there that might ensure that the claim didn’t get supported.", "They pressure workers to return to work early on modified work, even when they’re not ready, to try to avoid those loss claims, and terminate workers’ employment once further claim costs would no longer affect their premiums.", "I’ve experienced that as well, where once that $250,000 premium that the employer had to pay because of that injury was gone, they were then pushing the workers out the door.", "The claims management rules of workers’ compensation make this an adversarial system, undermining the Meredith principles that compensation was first set up under. It stigmatizes and marginalizes workers, and it further undermines their health, because they may be off with a physical problem, but when they have to go through all of these issues in this way, it then affects their mental health as well.", "There’s also evidence that this even goes as far as hiring practices, where there are employers who avoid hiring anybody who may have had an injury, or has some disability. They fear that because they were injured on the job once, they’ll be off again and the premium costs will actually go up.", "The prohibitions, the good pieces of this bill, extend to make sure that all manner of promises, threats and discipline, including terminations, suspensions and otherwise imposing a penalty on workers will end. A new monetary penalty—amount to be prescribed by regulation—would apply any time that the fine could be imposed by the court if the employer was found guilty of an offence.", "We’re certainly keen to see what that penalty is going to be, but I would suggest that it needs to be significant. Just like the quadrupling of the fine from $100,000 to $500,000 under this bill, I think that the penalty for intimidating employees to not file claims should be significant, because at the same time, employers have been receiving huge amounts of dollars—millions and millions of dollars—in experience-rating benefits.", "The further change is that the maximum fine would be increased from $100,000 to $500,000. We’re pleased to see, over five years of seeing this recommendation come in, that the government is finally taking steps to make sure that the penalty actually sends a message that workers need to be protected in the workplace.", "The third interesting piece of the schedule is an amendment that would eliminate the deemed net average earnings provision currently applicable when calculating the level of survivor benefits payable in cases where workers have no net average earnings on the date of injury.", "This actually comes out of the bill that the member from Oshawa put forward a month or so ago. So, rather than applying the statutory minimum amount—there is a minimum of $15,312.51 per year, a benefit to survivors—it is being amended in this piece of legislation. It would be the net average earnings of workers engaged in the profession as the deceased worker at the time that the injury first arose. This could be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on how much money your net average earning was at the time that the injury first arose, if it was quite a long time ago. I personally think there should be at least a minimum, and then your average net earnings after that, but that’s certainly something we can look at putting an amendment into.", "The other piece of this legislation is that it would apply retroactively to any injury that occurred on or after 1998, but not before, which is problematic.", "It permits survivors to request the WSIB to reconsider decisions already rendered, and the ability to refile claims with WSIB that have already been determined. I’d like to highlight that, despite knowing about these two issues for over five years, the government has been really slow about bringing these changes forward.", "The issue of claims suppression and increasing fines to employers found guilty of WSIB breaches was inspired by Harry Arthurs back in 2010. He also was asked to make recommendations on how it could reduce or eliminate its unfunded liability.", "Christine Arnott, who was a spokeswoman at the time, committed to review the program and draw on the report’s recommendations. Speaker, there were more than two recommendations; there were numerous recommendations. But to date, a mere two are being acted upon out of that report that’s been collecting dust for so many years.", "Eliminate the experience rating; the claims suppression piece; deal with WSIB’s tracking of worker complaints; conduct random audits; training WSIB staff: These are all things that are really good recommendations, but they’re not being dealt with in this piece of legislation.", "Every employer, he also said, should be required to designate a health and safety compliance officer, a person who ensures that the company, the employer, actually complies with the act. There is nothing in this piece of legislation that deals with that.", "In his report released last May, Arthurs confirmed that non-reporting is widespread, and he called for greater monitoring of companies and increased financial penalties for claims suppression. That’s actually happening, Speaker.", "To the occupational disease piece: Section 48.1 is a very close rendition of the member from Oshawa’s bill, which she introduced three weeks before the government tabled this legislation. Her bill moved to close existing loopholes in WSIA that allow the victims of occupational disease and their spouses to be denied loss-of-earnings and survivor benefits. It would reinstate loss-of-earnings benefits for workers diagnosed with occupational diseases after retirement and eliminate a technicality in the act that currently allows those benefits to be drastically reduced.", "It would provide death benefits to be paid to survivors when a worker dies due to an injury for which the worker would otherwise have been entitled to benefits under the insurance plan. We know that since 2011 there have been at least 14 of these tribunal decisions that have resulted in a reduction of pensions to the surviving spouses of workers who have died of occupational illnesses. All workers in this province are susceptible to an occupational disease. For example, if a steamfitter, a miner or a firefighter was diagnosed after they retired, then their widow’s survivor benefits would be in question.", "I think the catch in there was the word “earnings.” Some smart lawyers for the government, I guess, picked up on that word “earnings” and went by the letter of the law with respect to the definition of the word “earnings”—as opposed to people collecting their pension, as opposed to the spirit of the legislation, which was to make sure that survivors, the spouses of people who died from occupational illness, would be able to support themselves and their families after their spouses died. Unfortunately, the lawyers won the argument. This is what the member from Oshawa’s bill is reaching to correct. It is addressed in Bill 109, but it is a kind of half-measure. It’s watered down.", "I’m going to borrow from the words of the member from Oshawa herself by saying that it is unconscionable that we have allowed even more to be taken from the spouses of injured workers or workers who had occupational diseases who have passed on, and to let this go on for so long despite the pleas of workers and their families and of advocacy groups across the province who believe that the spirit of the legislation was to ensure protection for them. So employers hope that workers retire before diagnosis so that they aren’t eligible for the loss-of-earnings payment.", "Interestingly enough, my colleague’s bill doesn’t have a date or time stamp, which the government’s bill does. The government’s bill says “January 1998”; the member from Oshawa’s bill didn’t have any date. This is actually problematic, because as a registered nurse, I saw first-hand how latent illnesses are—with some diseases, it can be 50 years. Talk about illnesses like asbestosis—which you would know, Speaker, from your days in the steel mill—COPD, nickel plant sinus cancers—people retired and developed sinus cancers 40 or 50 years after their work ended. Presumptive cancers for firefighters: We have presumptive legislation in the system for our firefighters, which is good, but we don’t have that same kind of presumptive legislation for steelworkers, for miners, for many people who actually come in contact with many chemicals and carcinogens—" ],

The skin burned off the bone. His body was—911 was called, so now we have the police, the firefighters and the paramedics all involved with this chemical issue and the body of this man, this deceased man. They take the body to the hospital, to the emergency department, and wheel him through the emergency department, and so now we have the nurses, the clerical staff, the housekeepers and any patients that happened to be in the emergency department exposed.", "I can tell you that in my time representing the nurses at the Niagara Health System, this issue has come back to haunt those workers. We invited in OHCOW, the occupational health clinics. They have come in and they’ve interviewed many of the workers who were exposed on that day. Some of them went off work fairly recently after that accident happened, but many of them still working now have developed COPD and different respiratory ailments—not only the hospital workers but the firefighters as well.

  "text" : [ "Yes. After a few by-elections during this period and a loss for the Conservatives of most of those seats, Mike Harris stopped that process, and it didn’t continue.", "Anyway, out of that came this Public Sector Labour Relations Transition Act. It was a process put in place so that, if you were represented by a union, or if different groups of people were represented by different unions—say two hospitals were merging, for example, or eight hospitals, like in Niagara—there would be a systematic process to determine who was going to represent those workers at the end of the day. It included non-union workers as well, so that non-union people would also have their democratic right to either vote for a union or not vote for a union. It got expanded. Initially, it just talked about hospitals, but then it got expanded to the health care sector as hospitals started to kind of divest themselves of other-than-core services. So it now applies to most of the health care sector.", "In any event, what it really does is it pits unions against unions. I don’t know why the government, actually, is even introducing this bill. I haven’t heard from any employers—I haven’t heard from anyone who actually has been affected by this or thinks that this is a burning issue. In fact, there have only been two votes in the last two years in the health care sector—one in 2014 and one in 2015—where there were two or three different unions representing health care workers, and a vote took place. The process is not onerous. I’ve been at the labour board many times over the years on this issue.", "In some cases, the unions, when they only had a few members, voluntarily took their names out of the race. An example was the city of Toronto, which took in Toronto, Scarborough, East York, York, North York and Etobicoke. In that situation, CUPE had large bargaining units at the city of Toronto, like 10,000 inside workers and 10,000 outside workers. The Ontario Nurses’ Association had six, small registered-nurse bargaining units. There’s no way we were going to win that vote, and so, at the end of the day, we weren’t even on the ballot, right?", "I haven’t heard that there are employers complaining about this. I had never heard the minister or his parliamentary assistant even say which stakeholders brought this issue forward, but I can tell you that most of the major stakeholders have told me that they are certainly opposed to this issue.", "Under the PSLRTA—there used to be successor rights under the Labour Relations Act that don’t really exist any longer, except under this PSLRTA legislation. So for care partners, for example—I’ll use them again, those nurses that are still on strike eight months later, with the government not even intervening to assist them. In that situation, in the past, if nurses were in VON, for example, and VON closed down for some reason, you would have had successor rights when the new agency actually opened up. But that ended with this PSLRTA legislation, which is why we ended up with very few VON agencies across the province. The little bit of work that they do have today is more shift nursing than it is community care. But the merger, the time that it took at the labour board, was not that onerous.", "The government is proposing that if you don’t have 40% of the members, you don’t have the right to a vote. I can tell you that in many of the votes that I was involved in, it wasn’t always the 60% that won the vote. There were many situations where maybe people decided they wanted to make a change. They weren’t necessarily happy with their current representation, or they wanted to be in a nursing union, as opposed to being in a large, wall-to-wall bargaining unit that had everything from clerical and cleaners right up to IT people and health care professionals.", "There have been all kinds of different votes. There was a vote at one hospital in the province where the union that only had 100 workers won a 2,000-member bargaining unit. People actually had the right to express their freedom of choice in those situations and to pick the union they wanted.", "I think that at the end of the day, there will be a charter challenge on this piece of legislation. Recently, in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police case in the Supreme Court—that was where the Royal Canadian Mounted Police wanted to be unionized, and the employer didn’t want them to be unionized. The charter guarantees a meaningful process of collective bargaining, which includes a process that provides an employee with a degree of choice and independence—there’s the key, Speaker: a degree of choice and independence—sufficient to enable them to determine their collective interests and meaningfully pursue them.", "The court noted that the hallmarks of employee choice include the ability to form and join new associations, and to change representatives, which is exactly what this PSLRTA section in Bill 109 is about. If you’re going to take away 40% of people’s rights to choose, then I don’t think it would actually pass the test in a charter challenge.", "The decision of the court was also to set and change collective workplace goals, to dissolve existing associations, and accountability to the members of the association is an important element of choice.", "I’m of the view, and others—legal experts—are of the view that the proposed amendments to the PSLRTA would not stand a charter scrutiny. By depriving union members of the union of their choice on the basis that they fell below an arbitrary minimum percentage—in this case, 40%—of a newly integrated bargaining unit is an unnecessary infringement of their charter right to the union of their choice. Really, Speaker, it is totally unnecessary. There have been no problems for 19 years, I think it is, under the current provisions. Yes, sometimes the unions got a little ticked at each other through the process, but at the end of the day, it’s all about democracy and the right of an individual worker to choose who they want.", "When I looked at the legislation—I see that the government is still proposing that if you’re non-union and you make up 40%, you still have the right to vote, which is really strange, because you only have to have 50%-plus-one of workers in an organizing drive to unionize. Here, you’re saying that 40% of a non-union group of workers could get rid of a union, and that doesn’t make any sense in the process. But on the other hand, if workers have 40% in a union, and the other union has 60%, in that case, those 40% unionized workers don’t even get a vote. So it doesn’t fly, in the face of democracy, in my opinion." ],

I think it was somewhere here in Toronto; I think it was in York. There was a CUPE bargaining unit, a COPE bargaining unit and an ONA bargaining unit. I think CUPE and ONA had around 40%; it might have been 39%—whatever. COPE only had 20%, and they won the vote. At the end of the day, they won the vote in that region to represent all of those workers in York region in the CCAC. So small doesn’t necessarily mean that you can’t win at the end of the day." ],

  "text" : [ "Yes, it is very interesting.", "I’m going to spend the last bit of my time just speaking about the consultations. We talk about all the kinds of labour issues that are important to people. I have to tell you that there were consultations held this summer around the Employment Standards Act—and I think there are going to be some more held around the Labour Relations Act—but the problem with these consultations were that they were not open to the public. Here, we have people coming all the time making presentations to us around various bills in committee, and they’re open to the public. Anybody can come in there and sit and listen. But these consultations were not open to the public. If you weren’t making a presentation to this panel, you weren’t able to actually be there.", "The other part of it, Speaker, that is problematic is that the presentations went to this panel, so no one else has any access to this information unless we actually go and—we don’t even know who presented to the panel, at this point in time, unless somebody has brought it to our attention and provided us with a copy. I don’t think that that is good representation of our constituents when we, as elected officials, can’t even sit in on one of these summits. I guess it was a summit, a summit panel. It’s problematic. It’s certainly problematic for me. They were not all across the province. For example, there was nothing in Sudbury until the member from Nickel Belt actually requested it. I know that we put on record that we should have something in Niagara, because the closest, I think, was in Hamilton, but that didn’t happen.", "I did actually have a story to share about the ESA consultation that was held right here in Toronto last summer. This woman of Filipino descent recounted a profound and compelling deputation around her own struggles being an at-home caregiver. I’m told the presentation was so persuasive and gripping that she had most of the room in tears, Speaker. When she wrapped up her presentation, the two ministry officials, who were both male, both white, sitting at the front of the room, thanked her for her presentation, while one proceeded to recount that though her presentation was persuasive and while he “empathizes,” he was fairly certain it didn’t speak to the experience of all home caregivers, since being someone who “had a child care provider at home, has experienced his own share of problems with them.”", "This, Speaker, is not only a terrible kind of feedback but a prime example of what happens when class, race and gender intersect. If these were the kinds of people who were sitting at the front of this panel and that was the kind of response that the people making presentations got, it’s no wonder why people don’t come forward to continue to make these presentations. That was kind of an unsolicited recounting of how this woman felt when she left that panel.", "And so we’re still waiting to hear what the various presenters—whether they were individuals, unions or advocates for people living in poverty, people in precarious work or temporary agencies. We’re still waiting to see what those recommendations are that come out of there. I don’t know how long that will take, but if it’s anything like the Arthurs Report or the Dean Report, it may be years.", "The precarious employment piece continues to be big and continues to grow and grow in this province. Scheduling temporary work—it used to be that you couldn’t get a home office; it was very difficult. But employers today don’t even want to carry the expense of actually having people in an office, so people are at home using their own hydro and their own computers—part-time work, no benefits, no pension. Those are very important issues for the people in this province, and we see that every quarter, when the job stats come out through the federal government and provincially. Although more jobs are being created, the vast majority of those jobs are actually part-time work that doesn’t pay benefits, doesn’t have a pension, doesn’t have any job security and can’t support families and feed kids.", "I met with the Workers’ Action Centre earlier this year to highlight some of the issues of their report, which is Still Working on the Edge. Shortly thereafter, we also attended the launch of their report Poverty and Employment Precarity in Southern Ontario Project: The Precarity Penalty. The results were compelling, Speaker.", "These are important labour issues that need to be addressed. Our Employment Standards Act is severely outdated. We know that the act is not enforced as it should be, because there are not enough enforcement officers in place to make sure that that happens. We hear about people all the time who have not received their overtime pay or have not received their paid holiday pay, and then they’re terminated by the employer and they have to jump through hoops to try to go back and get those kinds of things in place.", "The hours-of-work standards allow for longer workdays and workweeks than most other jurisdictions: 60 hours. We say that we’re a progressive government here—and I know that the 60 hours was brought in, I think, under the Tory government. But if we’re so progressive, is 60 hours a quality life for anyone? I think not. I think there are many issues that need to be addressed that haven’t been addressed in many, many years.", "We know as well that there are huge social impacts from not having up-to-date legislation and from not having the appropriate legislation in place for workers in this province and for those living in poverty and those living on the margin. As the former critic for community and social services for a couple of years, I’ve seen first-hand what happens to people when they don’t have secure jobs. Even when they do have secure jobs that perhaps pay a decent wage, the work can often be precarious; it’s part-time.", "You’ll hear it all the time in the health care field, whether it’s in the community or in the hospital. People can’t get full-time jobs. Their spouses, perhaps, were employed in the manufacturing industry and they were the main breadwinner, and now their spouse is the main breadwinner, so they need full-time jobs so that they can have those benefits and protections in place. I’m sure it doesn’t come as a surprise to anybody here that there is a direct correlation between social outcomes and those with access to good-paying jobs here in the province of Ontario.", "I’m going to conclude by saying that although this bill provides some improvements under the Fire Protection and Prevention Act piece and under the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act—although they can be tweaked some as well—we’ve taken a massive step backwards with respect to democracy for workers in this province, for the ability for them to vote for the union of their choice when there is a merger or amalgamation.", "And it isn’t just a merger or amalgamation; we see the non-core programs of hospitals now moving out to the community. So you may have, for example, in the hospital sector, case managers who were social workers who worked in the hospital but now they’ve been transferred over to the CCAC, and wouldn’t have the right for a vote in this particular situation. And many of those are moving from a big hospital setting out to a smaller community setting.", "I think the government is not really serious about improvements to labour laws, and it’s not focused on helping the very workers in this province who need it the most. This bill simply pits one union against another by adding a progressive amendment to a bill that is being supported by firefighters, while ensuring that it’s entwined with a bill that is problematic for a number of major unions in this province and will take away the democratic rights of many workers in this province.", "Thank you for the opportunity." ],

We use the phrase “presumptive diagnosis,” and perhaps that deserves some explanation. Let’s take the case of firefighters who may have had difficulty in proving that it was job-related stress, job-related fumes or chemicals, particles or inhalants that might have caused COPD, chronic obstructive lung disease. “Presumptive” means that we should naturally assume that, with a given amount of time that a firefighter has exposed themselves potentially to these illness-causing materials, the COPD is, in fact, caused by this and therefore it should be a compensatable kind of illness.", "The problem, of course, is that these illnesses often take years, possibly even decades, to manifest, to show. For example, if you are interested in developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the ideal way is to smoke one pack a day—your choice of cigarettes—but it would take, on average, approximately 20 years to develop. So, between time of employment, time of exposure, when and where precisely the exposure happened, and then to essentially attribute that to 20 years hence or even longer is, of course, the issue. We want to make sure that this type of bill helps with these types of issues." ],

It’s designed not only to ensure that workers are protected, but to do it in a streamlined, efficient and more effective way. I think that that’s good.

Recently, I had the opportunity to meet some of the firefighters who serve in my community of Etobicoke Centre. I had a chance to get to know them a little bit and to speak with some of them about the wonderful work that they do. One of the details actually came out when they volunteered their time when I was holding one of my summer barbecues in the riding, and we invited people from across the community to come for the barbecue as an opportunity for me to meet them. The firefighters came out, and they just pulled up with a truck in the parking lot and kids from the neighbourhood came along and either those who were at the barbecue went to the truck or those who came to the truck then came to the barbecue—either way, they came and they helped out.", "We talked a little bit about the job and the risks that they take on in their work and some of the injuries that some of them have faced, and some of their colleagues have faced, I should say, over the years. In any event, that’s why I think it’s so important that we put in place the appropriate labour protections for our firefighters. These people, of course, work very, very hard, but they also put their lives on the line to save others, and we owe it to them to do that.", "I think the amendments that are being proposed here would bring the Fire Protection and Prevention Act into greater alignment with the Labour Relations Act and provide additional tools to resolve disputes, again, reducing remedies that are required through the courts. That’s what I meant when I said that it was pragmatic at the outset of my remarks. We need to resolve these concerns; we need to resolve disputes and provide remedies. But to the extent that we can minimize the burden on the courts and to the extent that we can still resolve those disputes in an effective way, I think that’s excellent.", "When I think about some of the things that are in the bill with regard to firefighters, there are a few that I’d like to highlight. Again, the proposed amendments would enhance the Fire Protection and Prevention Act by adding key legislative provisions that are already available to those covered by the Labour Relations Act—this is just aligning those two pieces of legislation—things like unfair labour practice protections, expedited grievance arbitration and religious exemptions.", "The Ontario Labour Relations Board: It would give it the authority to enforce all provisions under part IX of the FPPA. So, again, this is an example of being pragmatic; bringing the Ontario Labour Relations Board into this, again, will presumably allow these disputes to get resolved more quickly than they would be otherwise, potentially. It gives the power of an arbitrator to enforce a written settlement of a grievance etc.", "These are all things that align the FPPA, the Fire Protection and Prevention Act, with the Labour Relations Act, and afford firefighters the same protections that other folks enjoy, which is only fair and appropriate.", "I also wanted to briefly mention that there’s another element of the bill which I know some of my colleagues will undoubtedly speak to, which is the safeguards that are put in place to protect workers across the province; first of all, that workers know what their rights are with respect to filing a WSIB claim and that these rights will be protected. That’s really, really important. It would prohibit employers from taking any actions against a worker with the intent of discouraging that worker from filing a claim. The worker has the right to file a claim. That has to be protected, and this bill helps to do that.", "This bill would also provide greater fairness to survivors in the case of work-related death. It would enable the WSIB to calculate survivor benefits based on the average earnings of the worker engaged in the same profession out of which that deceased worker’s injury arose. This is important because—and, Speaker, I’ve had constituents come to me on this—you don’t want to calculate the WSIB benefits at the time of the diagnosis because, at that point, their incomes are often lower, or they’re even retired. Of course, as a result, the benefits paid out are a lot smaller than they probably should be.", "I think that this is a bill that ensures fairness for our firefighters. It protects workers and ensures that the concerns that workers have, whether they be firefighters or workers in other fields across the province, are protected, but it’s done in a pragmatic and effective way to serve those people even more." ],

These acts are the Fire Protection and Prevention Act, 1997; the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act, 1997; and the Public Sector Labour Relations Transition Act, 1997. As we all know, the workplace has changed significantly since 1997; that’s almost 20 years ago.", "Changes under this bill would, if they become law, provide increased fairness to all workers across Ontario.

Bill 109 is one more example of our commitment to the people of this province.", "Our government is committed to protecting Ontario’s firefighters, the brave men and women who selflessly put their lives in danger each and every day to ensure that the rest of us are safe. In my riding of Barrie, a few years ago, unfortunately, there was an accident; a roof caved in and we had a firefighter lose his life. His name was Bill Wilkins. The community still grieves the passing of Bill. We want to put things in place so that when those kinds of things happen, there is fairness involved.", "The amendments we are proposing, if passed, would bring the Fire Protection and Prevention Act into greater alignment with the Labour Relations Act and provide additional tools to resolve disputes, reducing the need to seek remedies through the courts. As we all know, anything that goes through the courts takes a lot of time and a lot of money. We would like to cut down on the time and the expenses.", "Specifically, the amendments would enhance the FPPA by adding very similar, key legislative provisions already covered and provided for in the Labour Relations Act, 1995.", "A few examples of this are things like unfair labour practice protections; expedited grievance arbitration; union security and related provisions; religious objections; Ontario Labour Relations Board authority to enforce all provisions under part 9 of the FPPA; the power of an arbitrator to enforce a written statement of a grievance—this is very important; the ability of the parties to file an arbitration decision in the Superior Court of Justice and have it enforced as an order of that court; and, finally, the power of the Ontario Labour Relations Board to grant interim orders.", "Our firefighters sacrifice so much to help keep Ontarians safe, and we are grateful for all the work that they do. In return, it is up to us to ensure that they, too, are protected. Firefighters deserve and should have these rights and protections afforded by the Labour Relations Act.", "Bill 109 would provide greater safeguards to all workers in the province. Through making changes to the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act, these amendments, if passed, would do four main things. The first is to ensure that workers know that it is their right to file a WSIB claim and that this right will be protected. If passed, this bill will prohibit employers from taking any actions against a worker with the intent of discouraging the worker from filing a claim or influencing a worker to withdraw or abandon a claim for benefits for work-related injuries or illnesses with the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board. This would allow the WSIB to prosecute and impose administrative penalties when employers try to impede or suppress claims. This would strengthen the WSIB’s efforts by legislating stronger deterrents against employers attempting to impede the reporting of a work-related injury or illness to the WSIB by a worker.", "Secondly, we must do all that we can to make sure workers are protected. That’s why we are proposing an increase in the maximum corporate penalties for conviction of an offence under the WSIA.", "I urge you to support this bill. I think it’s a good thing for all the workers in the province." ],

In my riding of Davenport, people come into my constituency office every day with questions about workplace safety and what our government has been doing to make Ontario a better place to live and to work. As you know, our government is committed to protecting all those who work in the province, and it is our duty as a government to ensure that all Ontarians work in a safe environment.", "Bill 109 aims to accomplish three critical measures: to provide more tools to resolve disputes in the fire sector; to provide fair, just and efficient workers’ compensation systems; and to ensure that broader public sector transitions go as smoothly as possible through greater efficiency and stability. If passed, Bill 109 would amend three separate acts affecting workers to increase fairness and efficiency to all workers across Ontario. These acts are the Fire Protection and Prevention Act, the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act and the Public Sector Labour Relations Transition Act.", "Under the Fire Protection and Prevention Act, Bill 109 would provide improvements to the provisions already covered by the Labour Relations Act. Most importantly, the bill would provide more tools to resolve disputes regarding unfair labour practices, expedited grievance arbitration, union security and related provisions. As well, the proposed bill will give parties the ability to file an arbitration decision and have it enforced by the courts, and give the Ontario Labour Relations Board the ability to grant interim orders.", "Mr. Speaker, our firefighters sacrifice so much to keep Ontarians safe and we are grateful for all the work that they do. In return, it is our obligation to ensure that they, too, are protected. Bill 109 is part of this commitment.", "Under the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act, Bill 109 would have positive effects for workers in Ontario in the following ways: First, it will ensure that workers know that it is their right to file a WSIB claim and that this right will be protected from manipulation, impediments or suppression of a claim by their employer. This is very important for the constituents I represent in Davenport. Many of them are new to this country. They do not have English as a second language, and some of them are fearful of what will happen to them should they put forth a claim. This will protect them and ensure that their claim is not suppressed by an employer.", "Secondly, the proposed bill will increase the maximum corporate penalty for conviction of an offence under the WSIA from $100,000 to $500,000. This increase is consistent with the maximum fines for corporations under the Occupational Health and Safety Act.", "Thirdly, Bill 109 would provide greater fairness for survivors in case of work-related death.", "Finally, the amendments proposed to the WSIA through Bill 109 would enshrine the Fair Practices Commission in legislation. The Fair Practices Commission is an important independent and confidential resource that looks into individual complaints, tracks complaint trends, identifies system-wide issues and recommends improvements to the WSIB.", "With stronger protection for workers that also supports businesses, this bill will assist with our government’s plan to build Ontario up.", "The final element of Bill 109 contains legislative amendments to the Public Sector Labour Relations Transition Act. This amendment will clarify the relationship between unions in places where there is an amalgamation of hospital, school or municipal workers. If passed, this legislation will remove a redundant vote in situations where one union has no less than 60% of the workers. The exact percentage will be set by further regulation. These amendments would greatly reduce the potential delay and disruption associated with a vote, remove the large associated cost and contribute to more harmonious labour relations in the workplace.", "As I stated above, strengthening protection for workers while supporting businesses is part of this government’s plan to build Ontario up. Once passed, I will be pleased to bring Bill 109, the Employment and Labour Statute Law Amendment Act, to Davenport, as it will have positive effects on the talented and hard-working men and women in my riding." ],

I’d also like to compliment those who have previously spoken to this bill.", "I am looking forward to speaking to this legislation today, as I’ve had years of experience working with WSIA and I’ve also worked with the Office of the Worker Adviser representing injured workers. I know many people who will benefit from this legislation, as well as many instances of abuse of the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act.", "I am glad that the Fire Protection and Prevention Act is being reviewed to ensure the safety of all firefighters, and that the Public Sector Labour Relations Transition Act is being streamlined to help union amalgamation—only when that amalgamation is absolutely necessary, I must add.", "However, my primary experience and enthusiasm is for the addition of subsection 22(1) of the WSIA. My primary concern for the operation of the WSIA is the phenomenon of claim suppression, which this bill addresses. The idea that employers are incentivizing or threatening employees for the purpose of discouraging them from filing a claim with the WSIB is rather unfortunate and goes against the safety and well-being of Ontario workers.", "An example of this practice is an employer offering an employee paid leave in lieu of the employee filing a WSIB claim. In addition, the employer offered the employee team members end-of-year bonuses if they collectively refrained from filing claims with the WSIB. Accordingly, not only had this employer put the well-being of this man or woman in jeopardy, but also created a workplace culture that was hostile toward anyone who may be injured and wished to pursue a WSIB claim, which is their legal right and they’re entitled to do so.", "If we put ourselves in these employees’ shoes, it is difficult to stand in the way of their colleagues’ bonuses. Which employee doesn’t want to receive a bonus at the end of the year? This practice completely ignored the ethics of safe employment and ignored the long-term impact of workplace injuries on employees. If the employee in this instance were to suffer chronic pain or illness that may arise from his injury that perhaps presented itself years down the road, what recourse would he have without a WSIB claim as evidence, or any record of the incident of that matter? What protection would be available to him in a case where an employer is at fault, suppressing claims in this duplicitous way of preventing short-term impact on its WSIB record, which in turn put the lives of their employees at risk? And this happens. It’s not only putting this employee at risk, working with an injury, but it also puts co-workers at risk because the worker cannot work to his or her full potential because of the injury that was sustained.", "Employees who refrain from filing WSIB claims under these circumstances are unknowingly putting themselves at risk for any potential injuries that may not be attributed to the work environment that led to such injuries. Claim suppression is an unfortunate practice through which employers have the ability to avoid the responsibility of the safety of their employees, a practice which I am wholly against." ],

It was also very interesting, as I heard the parliamentary assistant wrap up her debate, her comments, that she referred to herself as a union thug in her past life. It’s not too often we’ve heard members in this House refer to themselves as union thugs, but that one will be memorable and one that I’m sure many of us will use on a multitude of occasions down the road.", "I mentioned in my comments during the earlier speaker that there were four Liberal speakers who all said the same thing. After the first speaker, they shared their time and they all said the same thing. Why I brought that to the House’s attention—of course, we know in this House that the standing orders prohibit and prevent anyone speaking to a bill more than once. The purpose of that standing order is to prevent repetitive, redundant and frivolous comments in the House. I think what the Liberals just did was in breach of the standing orders because they all said the exact, repetitive, redundant—" ],

  "text" : [ "Thank you, Speaker. You’re always a fair and impartial judge of the activities within the House.", "There are three sections to this bill. I’m going to start on section 3, the WSIB schedule of this bill, because there’s little disagreement, little argument, about schedule 1. Schedule 1 brings the firefighters’ labour legislation pretty much in line with all other labour legislation in the province. So I’ll start with schedule 3, with the WSIB.", "It surely is known by all members in this House that the WSIB is a problematic, troublesome and some would often say—with justification—a dysfunctional agency of this government. We have all heard and seen, observed and advocated for constituents who have found their dealings with the WSIB very, very troublesome. And not just employees, but also employers. It doesn’t serve either very well very frequently.", "What I want to bring to the attention of the House is section 3, 22.1(3). This is a new concept that’s included in this schedule. It’s the creation of an administrative penalty. It reads, “An employer who contravenes subsection (1) shall pay the prescribed amount to the board. This payment is in addition to any penalty imposed by a court for an offence under section 155.1.”", "If you go to section 155.1, “An employer who contravenes section 22.1 is guilty of an offence,” and that’s where we get the increase from a $100,000 fine to a $500,000 fine under section 155.1, a fivefold increase. It’s a pretty substantial increase.", "Then, on top of that, we have this administrative penalty. What the administrative penalty doesn’t state is how much. It’s vacant. It’s absent. But we also know that the difference between an offence and an administrative monetary penalty is that there is no defence against an administrative monetary penalty, whereas under the provincial offences you can defend yourself. You can defend yourself on that offence that has up to a $500,000 fine attached to it, but you cannot defend yourself under section 3, against an unknown monetary penalty. I think it’s incumbent upon the government to give some clarification, both to this House and, indeed, when the bill passes, what sort of penalty would be applied under 22.1(3). Is it a $100 penalty? Is it a $5,000 penalty? Is it a $5-million penalty? Just what is 22.1(3) going to do?", "I also want to raise to the attention of the members here that under 48.1(2) in schedule 3—I’ve had some personal experience with this, on WSIB determining earnings. I’ll read from the bill on 48.1(2): “taking into account the average earnings at the time of the worker’s injury,” to determine benefits. What it doesn’t say is, what is the duration that this panel is going to look at? Is it is going to look at the average earnings for a week prior to the injury? Is it going to be looking at it for a month prior? A month after? A year? What is the duration that the arbitrator and the adjudicator are going to look at to determine the average earnings?", "I had a case of that this summer, where a gentleman who was a contractor had an injury. He filed his claim under the provisions of Bill 119, and initially his average earnings were determined to be $150 a week, because he didn’t work for the two weeks prior to his injury. He had just come back to work. WSIB looks at this and says, “Well, you didn’t make any money in that two weeks, or very little, so we’re going to define your earnings at $150 and that’s your reimbursable benefits.”", "Speaker, the way this bill is written is faulty. We need to attach a time frame on it, so that the adjudicators looking at these claims down the road will have some guidance from this House. I think looking at those average earnings is a good way, but I don’t think they should be looking at the average earnings when there’s an absence of definitive information for that person specifically—looking at those things that are maybe holidays, maybe other elements that we’re not quite aware of or don’t know what is going to happen.", "Those are a couple of things under schedule 3 that I would like to hear—it’s unfortunate, I guess, that the parliamentary assistant has already used up her talking points and she won’t be able to respond to my questions on schedule 3. But maybe somebody else who hasn’t got their talking points at the present time yet could formulate a response.", "So that’s WSIB. We also then look at schedule 2. Schedule 2 is a pretty brief section of the bill; it’s one page. I know it’s a page that has garnered the interest of the third party substantially, and they are opposed to this. I can understand them being opposed to it. I’m opposed to that provision as well. I find it difficult to believe their rationale and their justification, but I will say this: Under schedule 2, if two or more unions and the membership of those two or more bargaining units are looking for an amalgamation, it becomes deemed that the largest one, if it has 60% or more of the workplace, will be deemed to be the bargaining unit, and employees and union members will not have a choice in the matter. I think that is wrong.", "I always believe that we get better decisions in life and a better society when people have the ability to exercise a choice, exercise their judgment and determine what they want to do—not unlike an election. Sometimes we don’t even like the results of elections, but the process is good, it’s solid and it’s legitimate. We can respect it, right? People made a choice. The government, under schedule 2, is taking away the choice. That’s significant.", "Where I have difficulty with the third party on this—and I listened to the member from Welland intently in her hour-long leadoff. In her speech, she was talking about the need for greater card-based certification. Of course, card-based certification doesn’t allow for a vote. It doesn’t allow for a secret ballot. It’s just done. If you can prove cards were signed, then you can have a bargaining unit imposed. So, they’re desirous of voting for amalgamations but not desirous of voting for the formulation or the creation of a bargaining unit.", "Voting is important. We need to remain steadfast in our advocacy of that essential principle, in a fair and just democracy, that people have a choice, that they can exercise it freely, that they can exercise it when it comes with respect to a ballot, and that they can exercise it in secret, free from any reprisal or any retribution or intimidation or coercion.", "In the five-minute talking points that we heard from the four different Liberal members, I did not hear them once address the need or the rationale of why they should take away the rights of choice for union members when there’s an amalgamation of multiple bargaining units. Maybe somebody up in the corner office who has that creative writing style and imagination could develop some talking points in that regard, and the next four members who share a 20-minute rotation could explain that to us, as well.", "Then we come to schedule 1. Schedule 1 is a very simple and appropriate schedule. It really does—and I’ll have to agree with the Liberal members—align the firefighters with the other labour provisions of the labour legislation. There’s not much to be critical of, I don’t believe, in large part. Firefighters ought to have the same protection of the law as other employees; I don’t think anything unduly more and certainly not less. They should have the same equal provisions and protection of the law.", "However—there’s always a “however” with a Liberal schedule—in schedule 1 of the bill, page 10, subsection 5: “With respect to the board”—this is the board which is going to adjudicate and determine disputes—“the power to make interim orders under this section applies instead of the power under subsection 16.1(1) of the Statutory Powers Procedure Act.”", "Just for some context: The Statutory Powers Procedure Act is the general framework that all our administrative tribunals and all our adjudicative panels work under. That’s the statute that gives the authority to and places the responsibility on the tribunals to act somewhat like a court, so that there can be due process of law and a recognition that, when we abide by due process of law, we get better remedies. We get a better probability of justice in the outcome. But for some reason, this board is not going to have to play by the same rules as all other boards. It doesn’t have to abide by the Statutory Powers Procedure Act.", "So those are some of my criticisms of the bill. Schedule 1: pretty good—one little question in there on the boards that somebody may or may not respond to.", "I do have to make one more comment. When I heard the earlier debate, the member for Northumberland–Quinte West as well as a number of others mentioned about getting this bill to committee: “We’ll examine it and we’ll make amendments.” Well, what a fairy tale that is. The member from Northumberland–Quinte West has been here—even though he had a little bit of an intermission in his tenure—for a while, so he is experienced and he’s knowledgeable about how things work here. In my eight years here—and I’ve attended many, many committee hearings—I have seen two amendments get passed. The idea that amendments are going to be adopted by the Liberal majority government? What? Any moment now, a unicorn’s going to start trotting in here. I absolutely believe that there will be unicorns and pixie dust the day that amendments are going to be accepted by the Liberal majority government and voted on in a rational, intelligent, informed fashion. It doesn’t happen.", "But we see what’s going to happen with this bill. It’s the same play that we’ve seen on just about all bills this session. The really non-substantive bills—well, they’re all non-substantive, generally, from the Liberal Party. However, they will divide on every 20-minute rotation and they will all say the same thing. They will then seek closure on the bill as soon as six hours is up and say, “All our speakers, all our members had their voice. It’s time to close off debate. There’s no further need for any discussion.” We’ve seen this play time and time again. And then they’ll get to the committee and they will restrict and prevent the public from making deputations, as we’ve seen—five minutes.", "Speaker, I could go on, but I’m not going to. I’ll wait for the committee. I’ll bring some amendments forward and wait for the unicorns." ],

He is a man who has done his job and done it well. He is a man who has earned our respect.” These words were spoken 15 years ago by a member when George announced his retirement from the Legislature, and I think they’re very true.", "I never had the privilege of meeting Mr. McCague, but on doing the research for this tribute I learned that there were many aspects of his life that I could relate to. George McCague grew up on a dairy farm, and not just any dairy farm. He grew up on Glenafton Holsteins. His father, J.J. McCague, founded one of the most prominent herds not only in Ontario but in Canada. It’s internationally known. Even years later, dairy farmers, like I used to be, when we see the name Glenafton in the history of a cow family, we take notice.", "George graduated from the Ontario Agricultural College and worked on the family farm. He also had a keen personal understanding of the dangers of farming because he fell from a hay mound and broke his back, and he was in a body cast for six months. I think that’s also a testament.", "In a newspaper article, George related how he enjoyed field work and fondly remembered driving the first Cockshutt tractor that came to replace the horses on the farm. That brought a smile to my face. Although I never worked with horses, I fondly remember the day our Massey-Harris 44 with a trip plow was replaced with a 414 that had a three-point hitch. It was a great day. Progress is kind of a rite of passage on a farm. I think that impacts your whole life, and I think it impacted George’s whole life, to our betterment.", "George built up a real estate business in Alliston and later returned to active agricultural work with the purchase of a sod farm.", "At first glance, it may not seem that farmers and politicians have much in common, but a closer look reveals some striking similarities. In both cases, it’s not just a job, it’s a calling. The hours can be long and the success of your harvest often depends on forces beyond your control, and in both, countless hours are spent tending crops in what others feel could just be a barren field. People outside farming, outside public service, in many cases, don’t have a clue of what people actually do.", "Citing his father’s inspiration for public life, George’s public service career began as an Alliston councillor in 1960 with stints as reeve, warden and mayor before taking his seat as MPP for Dufferin–Simcoe in 1975. He served five terms before his resignation in 1990, after which his career went full circle as he finished his service in electoral politics as the first mayor of the town of New Tecumseth.", "Today, we welcome a number of George’s family and friends who have made the trip for this tribute. Those of us who have been blessed with the privilege of serving our communities know that it is often the sacrifices of loved ones that make our work here possible. As we acknowledge George’s service to the people of our great province, we also take this opportunity to thank you for the role you have played in establishing his legacy.", "I would like to close with an excerpt from Hansard from the Standing Committee on Social Development on October 28, 1991, after Mr. McCague’s retirement. The Chair had called the meeting to order with the following:", "“I will follow the McCague rule. Apparently former member George McCague, at the appointed hour for starting many meetings, used to look around the room, and even if there was no one there used to say, ‘I see a quorum,’ and begin the meeting.”", "Being a man of faith, I am sure he knew the verse, “There is a time to sow and a time to reap,” but coming from a farm I am sure he knew that you have to make hay when the sun shines and the rain waits for no man. For that, we are very thankful for his contribution. It’s been a privilege to take part on behalf of Ontario New Democrats in a tribute to Mr. George McCague." ],

I’m pleased to rise today to pay tribute to George McCague.", "In preparing for this, I reached out to many of George’s friends and former colleagues. During my conversations, one thing became clear: George was deeply loved and admired by his friends and his family. He was a pragmatic person and someone who knew his strengths and helped others realize theirs.", "One of those close friends I spoke to was Dan Needles. Dan worked for George as his executive assistant for five years until 1981. During our conversation, Dan described George as a man of few words, who thought extremely carefully before saying anything. When solving issues, George would listen to all sides and synthesize complex issues to their simplest elements. That was his gift, bringing people together through consensus and solving those difficult problems.", "George was born in Essa township, not far from my home in Barrie. Even from a young age, he was dedicated to his community. He joined the Junior Farmers and, as one friend told me, “He joined every group he could find.”", "After returning from school in Guelph, he entered public service as a councillor in Alliston in 1960. By 1969, he had served as deputy reeve, reeve, a public school board member, Simcoe county warden, and then as mayor of Alliston. In 1967, he was also appointed as the first chairman of Georgian College in Barrie, and we thank him for that. In 1975, he was elected as the member for Dufferin–Simcoe. He served 15 years here at Queen’s Park, holding portfolios in government services, the environment, transportation and communications, and chair of Management Board of Cabinet.", "George brought his judiciousness to Queen’s Park as he consistently was a consensus-builder. Linda Collins, former mayor of Springwater, told me that George McCague represented his riding well, mindful of all people. He visited farmers at the farm and was very responsive to any questions from his constituents. He served with great distinction and credibility. His long-standing record speaks to the trust bestowed upon him.", "He had many friends from all political parties, with one of his closest being Liberal member and agriculture critic Murray Gaunt. In the Legislature, they passionately debated the issues of the day, but once the House rose, they often went on fishing trips. Dan Needles told me that George once described public service to him as “a long meeting with the odd fishing trip.”", "George retired from Queen’s Park in 1990, but he wasn’t done yet. He returned to municipal politics and became the first elected mayor of the newly amalgamated town of New Tecumseth in 1992. I spoke to former New Tecumseth mayor Mike MacEachern about George’s local contributions. He described George as a “community builder” and a “champion of the community.”", "George had a quiet way of commanding a meeting. He would immediately display leadership and was an expert at steering past distractions and diving right into the heart of a matter. Mike also told me that George would also tell him to “never ask a question you don’t already know the answer to.” I think he said this because he understood the importance of truly understanding all the issues.", "After retiring from public service, he continued to chair the New Tecumseth Improvement Society. He also loved to give back. He was a driver for cancer patients and continued volunteering into his retirement.", "At his funeral last year, the leaflets contained a passage from 1 Peter 4:10-19. It read, “Like good stewards of the manifold grace of God, serve one another with whatever gift each of you has received.” George knew that his gift was the ability to build consensus and solve difficult issues. But he went further than that. He helped others see their gifts, and would consistently remind friends and colleagues of their strengths.", "George was a remarkable man, who truly made his community, province and country a better place. Thank you, George." ],

I followed the great playwright and author Dan Needles, as the honourable member for Barrie has just mentioned. A couple of weeks before George passed away, he asked me to be an honorary pallbearer. I thought I better ask him if he wants me to say anything at the funeral. He said, “No, I want somebody to do it right. I’ve already asked that Needles guy.” So George Raymond McCague, here goes.", "Mr. Speaker, I am reminded of the proverb, “Say not in grief: ‘He is no more,’ but live in thankfulness that he was.” I will be eternally grateful to George for the lasting memories he has given me and for the lessons I learned from him.", "No matter what issues George was involved with over the course of 40 years of public service, he always knew the heart of the matter was addressing problems and people with respect. He knew that respect for all people is at the heart of politics.", "Although our families have been lifelong friends, I first got to know George when I was a grade 8 student. He was running for re-election in the 1977 provincial campaign and came to my classroom, along with the other candidates, to speak with us. He stood out from the other two candidates because he treated us like young adults. He didn’t deliver talking points or carefully crafted campaign slogans. Of course, that was part of George’s charm. He never spoke from a prepared text.", "My friend Dan Needles, whom George nicknamed McNutt, wrote speeches for him over a seven-year period, as his executive assistant here at Queen’s Park. George never delivered a single one of those speeches. But he valued Dan’s work and would spend hours going back and forth with him and studying those speeches. Then he would put them back in his pocket and speak from the heart. Dan joked when he gave the eulogy for George that the funeral was the first time anything he wrote for George was actually delivered in whole.", "Dan no doubt also wrote the speech George never delivered when he showed up at my grade 8 class. George spoke to us with sincerity and treated us with respect. He showed us he was interested in our thoughts even though we were too young to vote.", "Of course, two or three days later George showed up at my parents’ house. The next thing I knew, I was volunteering on his campaign. George was always pretty crafty, Mr. Speaker, in his own humble way.", "He also never forgot the people who helped him and always looked for a chance to help them as well. He gave me my first opportunity to work in a political office when he needed to hire a driver. Actually, George didn’t give me any choice. He once again called my mom up and asked what I was doing. She told him, “Well, he’s working while trying to finish his degree at St. Michael’s College.” George then corrected her and said, “No, Theresa. Jim is going to drive for me and work on my correspondence part-time.” Later, he encouraged me and supported me in going to work for the Honourable Perrin Beatty in Ottawa.", "I credit George with setting me on my career path. Some days, I also blame him for that. But he always had the best of intentions.", "George’s respect and gratitude for everyone who worked with him inspired loyalty and deep friendship. George always referred to Henry Davis, who couldn’t be with us today—Henry was his campaign manager for five campaigns—as a peach of a man. I’m a bit envious of Henry for the glowing praise George always heaped on him when he wasn’t in the room.", "After George swept all the polls in Alliston that were located near the Catholic church and school in the 1985 election, he went around telling everyone that it was the token dogan on his staff who made it possible. He was referring, of course, I learned many years later, to me, who was studying Catholic theology at St. Mike’s.", "George’s own nickname here at Queen’s Park was appropriate to his nature. He was called Quiet George because he never wanted to be, as he put it, a headline hunter, nor did he like to pick fights. He often said that one should never get into a spraying match with a skunk.", "George’s deep faith in democracy, coupled with his humble ego, made him a perfect fit when he served in the roles of Chairman of the Management Board of Cabinet and chair of cabinet concurrently for many, many years in the Bill Davis government. He enjoyed these jobs immensely.", "I remember him telling me with a wink that he appreciated that, as chairman, he was the person who got to interpret consensus at each meeting. Of course, I was to find out many years later from Premier Davis that he and George had already decided what that consensus was going to be before the meeting had even started.", "George’s wit was dry and often unexpected. After my nomination meeting to run as MPP for Simcoe West, after George retired from Queen’s Park, his first words to me when I got off the stage at Creemore were, “Don’t screw it up, kid.” I thought that was rather strange. I thought he would congratulate me for being acclaimed, actually.", "It was a few days later before it dawned on me, after a conversation with my father when he reminded me that the riding had been Conservative since Confederation and he didn’t want me to be the first one to lose it. In doing so, George gave me the shove I needed rather than the pat on the back I expected, and I’m grateful for that.", "Since I was elected, George never once played the armchair quarterback. He was always available for advice anytime I called, but he said I had to do my job the way I thought I should.", "George Raymond McCague, I will always be grateful for your friendship, mentorship and leading example of integrity. Your memory will always burn brightly and warmly. We miss you very, very much." ],

The government’s review of the funding formula for universities must not be motivated solely by the desire to slash funding; it must aim to improve the accessibility and quality of post-secondary education.", "The Ontario Confederation of University Faculty Associations recently met with me to express their concerns. They have asked that the review of the funding formula protect and promote the two core activities of a university: excellent teaching and learning, and world-class research. Funding must be responsive to the number of students in the system and the programs in which those students are enrolled. Universities should receive adequate funding to support good jobs on their campuses. This means ensuring fair terms and conditions of employment for contract faculty and hiring enough tenure-stream professors to maintain high academic standards and fair workloads.", "Funding should be stable and predictable to facilitate long-term planning and to avoid extreme fluctuations in institutional revenue. Funding should be allocated across institutions on a fair and equitable basis to protect against wide variations in quality across the system and to support student success in all universities.", "This review must be an open-ended, public and inclusive process where outcomes have not been predetermined or artificially constrained at the outset. Above all, university funding must not be subject to short-term political objectives." ],

This year, more than 9,000 volunteers are being recognized for their outstanding community service.", "With the Pan/Parapan Am Games coming this summer, it is important we recognize the tremendous role volunteers will play.

Corey is an exceptional golfer and has been a member of Team Canada for five years. He won his way into this year’s Masters by placing second in last year’s US Amateur Championship. In 2013, Corey was a semi-finalist in the same tournament and, along with Team Canada, finished second in last year’s World Amateur Team Championships. I would like to congratulate Corey on his fine work at the Masters and all of his golfing accomplishments.", "Another local athlete who earned great praise last week was Joey Hishon. On Tuesday, Joey scored his first NHL goal, breaking a tie between the Colorado Avalanche and the Nashville Predators. Joey grew up in Stratford, and has played hockey with the Stratford Minor Hockey Association, the Ontario Minor Hockey Association, the Ontario Hockey League and the American Hockey League, and now the NHL. He was a first-round pick of the Avalanche in the 2010 entry draft. I’m confident that this is the first goal of what will be a remarkable NHL career for Joey.", "Again, congratulations to both Corey Conners and Joey Hishon for their outstanding athletic accomplishments." ],

First of all, let me say thank you to Dr. David Rosen, a respected marine biologist at the University of British Columbia who led the team of experts to prepare a report.", "The reason why this provision is in the bill is because orcas are very unique animals. Orcas are the largest of the marine mammals in captivity in Ontario and anywhere else. They are over twice the length and four times the mass of the beluga, the next-largest marine mammal in captivity. They are very social animals and normally live in pods of five to 30 whales in the wild. Some pods combine to form a group of 100 whales or more.", "Orcas typically dive 500 feet or more and can swim up to 100 miles per day. So the unique features and the extraordinary magnitude of orcas leads us to determine that their well-being in captivity would be especially difficult to ensure, and so we would end the practice of keeping captive orcas in Ontario." ],

We need a licence for a dog, but we don’t, in some areas, need a licence to have a lion or a tiger. So that brings up the question of how well they’re being taken care of. There just needs to be more strength in legislation to make sure that all animals, regardless of size, whether they’re a toad, a fish or a whale, are taken care of to the best possible being as long as they’re in captivity." ],

Affordability of electricity seems to be something that people are really, really very concerned about and interested in, and there’s a bunch of other issues—the debt and deficit of the province, of course.", "However, we are debating Bill 80, Speaker, so I will take some time to talk about Bill 80, An Act to amend the Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act and the Animals for Research Act with respect to the possession and breeding of orcas and administrative requirements for animal care.", "“The Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act is amended to prohibit possessing or breeding an orca in Ontario. There are two exceptions. First, a person who possesses an orca on the day before the bill is introduced may continue to possess the orca. Second, a person who first possesses an orca on or after the day the bill is introduced, but before the bill receives royal assent, may continue to possess the orca for six months after the day of royal assent....", "“In addition to the power the minister already has to make regulations prescribing standards of care, the minister is given the power to make regulations prescribing administrative requirements with which a person who owns or has custody or care of an animal is required to comply”—just to give you a general outline of what the bill does.", "I think I’ll use some time to talk about how this bill came to be. It seems to me that it originated probably as much from media stories on Marineland in Niagara Falls, and I believe there was a Toronto Star article that probably was the impetus of how this bill came to be.", "From that, there have been a few things that have happened. There’s an organization called the Canadian Association of Zoos and Aquariums. They did an accreditation on Marineland after that incident, after the media series. I just want to note what they said because I think it’s—you know, this bill is really about the one orca in Ontario. That one orca is at Marineland in Niagara Falls. I think it’s worth noting that Marineland is a very significant employer in the Niagara area. There are some 700 jobs there and they spend $4.5 million on marketing alone each year. It is very important to that area. I think we have to certainly balance having care for marine mammals but at the same time try not to drive jobs out of the province, because it’s certainly obvious that we need those jobs in this province.", "CAZA, the Canadian Association of Zoos and Aquariums, actually did—I took a look—a Marineland investigation. I’ll just read a bit of that to give you an idea of what they found:", "“The Accreditation Commission of Canada’s Accredited Zoos and Aquariums (CAZA) has conducted a special investigation into allegations that the welfare of animals at Marineland Canada has been negatively affected by water quality problems and inadequate staffing levels and that these problems were not appropriately addressed over a period of time. A three-person inspection team including two veterinary experts conducted a site inspection on August 23, and subsequently interviewed relevant witnesses and examined internal water logs and medical records.", "“The commission has concluded that at the time of the site inspection the animals in question in the Marineland collection, including the marine mammals, were in overall good health and there was no evidence of animal abuse, that water quality in all the pools was very good, and it appeared that staffing levels were adequate.", "“Detailed examination of water quality logs and animal health records as well as interviews with some ex-employees, however, indicate that there were problems with maintaining water quality levels within accepted industry standards, and that these problems did impact the health of some animals in the collection.", "“The commission found that Marineland’s veterinary program is comprehensive and includes regular veterinary inspections and treatment of animals where appropriate. The veterinarians are experienced, competent and assisted by specialists as needed.", "“The commission and Marineland have agreed that Marineland will undertake an independent, external inspection of its water quality management systems for the pools in question. The engineering evaluation will be based partially on a thorough updating by Marineland of its water quality management protocols and is to be completed as soon as reasonably possible. CAZA is to be consulted regularly regarding the qualifications of the evaluators and is to be provided with a copy of the resulting report. Marineland has stated that they welcome this study and will use the results to ensure that the systems are entirely capable of providing an appropriate environment for the marine collection.”", "That seems like a rational response to the criticism that was directed at Marineland. They did actually go on and have Stantec Consulting Ltd. come in and look at the water management systems for marine mammals at Marineland.", "“The purpose of the study is to confirm whether the water management systems”—this is from Stantec—“at Marineland are capable of providing an appropriate aquatic environment for the marine mammals, currently and in the long term. The opinions and findings expressed in this study refer to all water systems for marine mammals at Marineland unless specifically stated otherwise.", "“No allegations have been made or concerns expressed regarding the balance of the water system at Marineland. No request was made by CAZA or a third party to expand the scope of the study. No information received from Marineland or reviewed by Stantec, or investigations conducted by Stantec indicated that an expansion of the study is necessary or appropriate.", "“Marineland, however, requested and Stantec agreed to expand the scope of the study to include a review of the entire water system at Marineland in order that the results of the study be used to assist in maintaining the ‘best practice’ standards for the aquatic environment for the marine mammals. The study was expanded at Marineland’s request to include the Friendship Cove ... and Arctic Cove ... pools and all ancillary water system components.", "“Given the public interest in the condition of the water systems at Marineland we have issued this study in a format intended to convey the technical results of our investigation in a manner that is clear and addresses the expressed concerns regarding the water systems at Marineland.", "“Marineland has requested, and Stantec has agreed to provide, further explanation or clarification of its opinions or findings to the CAZA Accreditation Commission, as it may request.", "“Marineland has also requested and Stantec has agreed to provide further explanation or clarification of its opinions or findings to the Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (the ‘OSPCA’).”", "These were their findings:", "“Summary of findings and opinions", "“1. The water management system at Marineland has been developed over many years. The water management system has been upgraded over time to provide comprehensive treatment to meet modern standards and performance requirements associated with best practices, and ongoing research and development in the industry. Overall, the investment in the water management system has been significant from a capital cost perspective. The Marineland water management systems share similarities with modern water treatment systems designed and operated for production of potable water for human consumption.", "“2. Based on our assessment of the life support system design in place at Marineland, and a review of the relevant literature, it was found that these systems are suitable for maintaining water quality parameters for the species and number of marine mammals under human care and are capable of providing an appropriate environment.", "“3. The treatment systems, pumping systems, piping systems, and electrical systems generally are all in good condition and maintained.", "“4. Redundancy for power and water supply is built into each system by providing parallel equipment that can be used while certain components of the system are offline for repair or for maintenance.", "“5. The system design, redundancy, and operations and maintenance is capable of promptly correcting isolated fluctuations in water parameters if they should occur.", "“6. Staffing is sufficient to ensure the proper functioning and maintenance of the water systems.", "“7. Procedures are in place for operation of the water management systems and these procedures, at the request of Marineland, will be documented through standard operating procedures ... for all systems and processes.”", "Mr. Speaker, you can see that the reaction to the accusations—there was a CAZA accreditation study and then there was a Stantec study on the quality of water, and that seems to paint a good picture of what is currently being done at Marineland.", "But this bill, really, originated because I think the government has reacted to what has happened in the media, and they commissioned their own study. They asked Dr. David Rosen to do a review. The purpose of the committee was:", "“This committee was convened by the government of Ontario’s Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services in October 2013 to (1) evaluate Ontario’s current regulations pertaining to the care of marine mammals in captivity for public display, (2) consider whether current regulations are sufficient to ensure the care of these marine mammals, and ... (3) suggest how existing regulations could be improved.”", "Additionally, the committee was asked to give special consideration to the welfare of cetaceans in public display facilities.", "As I mentioned, it was Dr. David Rosen from British Columbia who was asked to do this study. In his executive summary on this report he states: “A review of the current scientific literature on the well-being of captive cetaceans highlighted several areas of concern. There are several aspects specific to the aquarium environment that can potentially cause stress in captive cetaceans, although none are unique to this group, and most can be mitigated through proper husbandry and habitat design. The most critical issues identified are the need for adequate pool space and design, appropriate social groups, and environmental enrichment. Additional concerns relate to suitable light and sound exposure in the habitat.”", "Now, I think it was the Attorney General, in her comments, who talked for a couple of minutes about the social nature of orcas, and that in the wild, they like to be in pods of five to 30. I note that that is also one of the concerns here. So I’m a little surprised that the bill that is before us would actually, really, sentence the one orca at Marineland to a solitary life for the rest of the life of that particular whale.", "I do have a little bit of information on that whale; Kiska the whale. Kiska the orca whale lives in the largest pool housing a killer whale in the world. The pool is larger than the entire Toronto aquarium by volume—just her pool alone. All the water in her pool is filtered through a modern, computerized filtration system that costs tens of millions of dollars. All of the water in her pool is filtered every three hours. A thorough technological review of the entire water system was conducted by an independent expert company, Stantec—that’s the review I referred to—which found that the system was fully capable of providing an appropriate aquatic environment for Kiska.", "Kiska already has several times the available space SeaWorld’s whales will have when SeaWorld has completed its expansion and full renovations in four years’ time. Based on what SeaWorld actually builds, Kiska’s space could be five and a half times as large.", "Kiska does not participate in any shows and has not done so for over a decade. Kiska is cared for by experienced professional marine mammal veterinarians who examine her every single day. Her teeth are examined and rinsed every day. Kiska participates in a complex enrichment program that has been reviewed and approved by leading marine mammal scientists, and reviewed and accepted by the OSPCA.", "Kiska is fed a healthy diet of fish fit for human consumption. Everything she eats is recorded. All her activities and behaviour are recorded hourly. Her health is monitored on a continuous basis. A team of veterinarians and staff determine all issues related to her health and make constant adjustments to ensure the ongoing health and care of Kiska.", "Kiska is now quite elderly and prefers particular routines. Everyone knows that it would be a benefit to her to provide her with an age-appropriate companion, if one could be found. Currently, a companion for Kiska is not available. Prohibiting any possibility of providing Kiska with an age-appropriate companion is not necessary to give effect to the legislative intent and is not in the best interests of Kiska. That seems to be confirmed by the comment in the executive summary by Dr. Rosen, talking about “appropriate social groups.”", "Marineland is one of the few unique facilities that can provide a temporary home to injured marine mammals and a permanent home to those animals that cannot be returned to the wild. A ban consigns an injured orca to death unnecessarily and contrary to all sensible conservation efforts.", "Something to think about is that this bill actually has some consequences for the one orca that is within the boundaries of the province of Ontario, which the legislation seems to be geared toward. It’s interesting that we’re debating this bill, with all the other challenges going on. I can’t say it has come up much in my riding of Parry Sound–Muskoka.", "An issue that has come up recently that is not marine-mammal-related—it is fish-related—has been the Almaguin Fish Improvement Association, a group of volunteers who have been stocking Ahmic and Cecebe lakes in my riding for the past 35 years. It really is, I think, a great group that is very dedicated to trying to improve the fishery, particularly in Ahmic and Cecebe lakes, but is also interested in stocking surrounding lakes as well. I’ve brought that issue up in the Legislature before: the fact that the Ministry of Natural Resources had, until recently, told the Almaguin Fish Improvement Association that they weren’t going to issue them the permits to be able to do the stocking they had planned for this year.", "I’m pleased to say—and I want to give credit to the Minister of Natural Resources, the member from Thunder Bay–Atikokan—that on Friday I attended a meeting with the Ministry of Natural Resources, and the Almaguin Fish Improvement Association has been given the green light and will be getting the permits to do their stocking in Ahmic and Cecebe lakes this year. I’m very pleased about that.", "I know they’re a very dedicated group and are trying to do good work. I would say that the Ministry of Natural Resources should take advantage of this group of volunteers, because they have stated that they’re willing to join the council for zone 15. They’re willing to stock other lakes as well, and assist with rehabilitating spawning beds and doing other work that will improve the fisheries in Parry Sound–Muskoka. I’m very pleased that that has come to be.", "Back to Bill 80, Mr. Speaker: Whatever new rules come out of this bill—obviously, we want to provide the best environment for marine mammals that are in captivity—I think it’s important that we also realize that in probably one of the biggest businesses that deals with marine mammals, Marineland at Niagara Falls, there are 700 people who rely on their jobs to put food on the table and help pay their ever-increasing hydro bills. I think that’s something the government should be taking into consideration as it brings forward Bill 80 for debate. That’s something we can’t lose sight of.", "I do note that the majority of the public feel—I see that a poll was conducted in the Toronto Sun, March 23, 2015, and 89% of respondents agreed that Ontario should ban the importation of killer whales. I think that’s probably generally supported, as it seems to be in the general public.", "With that, Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to have a chance to speak to Bill 80 this afternoon." ],

Clearly, there needs to be good regulation in place to ensure that animals that are in the care of these establishments are being taken care of in as humane a way as possible, and make sure that the animal, or mammal in this particular case, is not particularly distressed.", "I want to talk about the aquarium that has the most seals and the most whales in Ontario, and that’s James and Hudson bays.

All along James and Hudson bays, you have beluga whales that are quite something to see.", "At a particular time in the year, later on in July, you will see belugas that will gather at the mouths of rivers by the hundreds and the thousands eating up the fish as they come down the rivers and eating whatever feed they can get off the rivers as the water runs into James Bay or Hudson Bay.", "You’re talking about pretty big rivers.

If you’ve ever seen an orca or a killer whale out there in the wild, you will understand what I mean.", "I have spent much time on the west coast of British Columbia and have spent many hours in boats actually at times being surrounded by orcas or killer whales, and I can tell you that there is nothing more amazing than to be surrounded by a pod, to see how they are matrilineal in their behaviour, and to watch them as they take care of each other and interact with each other socially and sensitively to those of us who are in the boat—and in some ways, feel like they are looking after us when you’re out there on the ocean.", "I feel that this bill really drives home the idea that we also have a responsibility of our own towards these magnificent mammals.", "If Bill 80 would be passed, it would prohibit the breeding and acquisition of orca whales or killer whales in Ontario, and I really do think this is the right thing to do.", "We’ve also introduced the Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Amendment Act, Bill 80, because we want to make sure that we are putting the right kinds of programs in place to ensure that we are creating a framework to establish the right protections for marine mammals that are out there.", "We would create a framework to establish animal welfare committees, for example, because this is going to be key in ensuring that we have in place rules that will look forward in terms of how, when these animals may be in captivity, they are treated fairly, kindly and sensitively.", "I feel very strongly about this bill, and I’m very pleased to support it." ],

I don’t pretend to understand what is appropriate animal welfare. However, I do have some vets in the family. Most veterinarians who practise in the province of Ontario end up specializing. I actually have a member of my family, who does not practise in Ontario, who does fish pathology. He trained an additional two years to do that, and all he does is related to fish health, fish habitat.", "I’m concerned: When we are talking about one animal, where are we going to find the necessary skills for someone to actually assess whether, in this case, Kiska at Marineland is being properly cared for? I don’t think we can just leave it in the capable hands of the OSPCA because they’re not looking at any other orcas. They will not have the necessary aptitude to be able to look at it and make the assessment and say yes or no. That’s my concern with Bill 80." ],

Our thinking has evolved to the point where we recognize the harm that smoking causes and we have taken measures as a society, as legislators. As a result, rates of smoking have gone down.", "For me, this bill represents a similar evolution of our awareness of the pain and suffering that we are causing to orcas when we hold them in captivity simply for the purpose of entertaining us. Bill 80 is a bill that will increase the size of enclosures that orcas are held in, and it would also limit sound exposure for the animals. It would prohibit the possession and breeding of orcas in Ontario except for any orca already in captivity in March 2015, which, as we know, is a single orca, Kiska, who is being held at Marineland.", "I really appreciated the comments from the member for Timmins–James Bay, who talked about the ways that we can see these animals in the wild and what a transformative experience it can be for us to see the majesty of these animals in their natural habitat.

He did a good job of talking about how you can fly into Moosonee or, I guess, take the train into Moosonee, and go across to Moose Factory where the Eco Lodge is located. I have stayed there one or two nights on committee business once. It’s a great spot. It sounds like you can make arrangements to actually go out on the water of James Bay to get an opportunity to see whales in the wild, so that sounds like a great tourism opportunity for northern Ontario.

  "text" : [ "I’m pleased to have the chance to speak to this bill brought forward by the government, the Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Amendment Act. This bill deals with issues of animals in captivity, with a particular and specific reference to orcas, or, as they’re often called, killer whales.", "Speaker, in Ontario we have many facilities where wild animals are kept captive. Many families have enjoyed a day out with them. We and our kids can get a chance to see and learn about animals that we are likely never to see in their natural habitat. By seeing and meeting these animals in the flesh and learning more about them, many people, we believe, generally become more understanding of the part a species plays in making our world tick, and this, as a result, raises a broader concern for the well-being of all animals.", "They point to the research that is done and breeding programs to protect and enhance endangered species, but unfortunately that is not always the case. There are around 50 or 60 zoos and aquariums in Ontario, but less than 10 of them are accredited by the Canadian Association of Zoos and Aquariums. For the rest, there is little of them to be governed.", "While seeing these exotic animals can be fun and interesting, it cannot compare to seeing them in the wild. Speaker, while I visit Florida, I always take a deep-sea-fishing trip. Probably one of the best parts of that trip is watching the dolphins as they swim and play in the waves that our boat is making. Now, of course, dolphins aren’t good for fishing, because we know you’re not catching a fish when there’s a dolphin around, but watching them as they are out in their own natural habitat, swimming and jumping just as if you were watching them in Marineland or wherever—the experience is completely different. Knowing that they’re doing all of these fun, playful acts out in their own habitat is absolutely amazing.", "The fact is that when animals or marine mammals are confined to a space in a zoo or an aquarium, they are captive. They aren’t free to be themselves, to roam, to find their own food and to engage in social relationships.", "As I mentioned, this bill makes specific reference to killer whales. Passing this bill will make it illegal to possess or breed an orca in Ontario, with two exceptions. In the case of an orca that was in captivity before the bill was introduced, the orca will be allowed to remain where it is. In the case of a person who possesses an orca after the introduction of this bill but before it is passed into law, the person can keep the orca for another six months after the bill receives royal assent.", "Let’s think for a second what the natural life of a killer whale is like. They live in pods of two to 30 whales, sometimes as many as 50, and they swim up to 100 miles in a day. They prefer deep water, dive to depths of 500 feet, and usually spend 10% to 20% of their time at the surface. Some killer whales stay with their families for their lives as they travel in pods and sometimes join other pods for hunting or socializing. Each pod has its own dialect for communicating.", "If we think about that, we’re saying here that they live in pods of two to 30 whales, sometimes as many as 50, and they swim up to 100 miles a day. How could that possibly happen when we’re keeping them out of their natural habitat and we’re keeping them hostage for our own fun and entertainment? I’m sorry. I’m sorry that we, as a people, have decided that it’s okay to do that to animals. I’ll be happy for the day when that doesn’t happen any longer.", "They are complicated creatures who need a huge amount of space. As much as we like to see them, we have a responsibility to consider whether we can justify keeping them captive and in an enclosed space such as an aquarium.", "The member from Timmins–James Bay talked about the beluga whales that you can see if you go to James Bay. This summer, I was actually planning a trip that would take me to Tadoussac, which is just on the other side of Quebec and the St. Lawrence. You can go there and you can see the whales in their own nature and their own space. I’m so looking forward to that day when I can watch the whales being in their own environment. I just think it will be quite magnificent to watch those amazing creatures.", "The University of Guelph Animal Interest Network has this to say about the pros and cons of zoos, and I think this can be extended to aquariums:", "“Zoos have the benefit of educating the public about species and the problems they face in their native environments. They also serve as a source of revenue to fund conservation effects. They serve as an emotional bridge for people to feel connected with animals and to better appreciate them. Zoos also serve as havens of protection for species who face insecurity in their homelands. They also allow people to study given animals in an environment where they can be easily observed.", "“However, zoos also have their drawbacks. Zoos will never be able to completely replicate a given species’ natural environment (especially in terms of space for larger animals). The degree to which some zoos contribute to education or conservation is debatable. Captive animals become acclimatized to living among humans and are dependent on them for survival, making it difficult to return to the wild. With endangered species, it is difficult managing breeding programs in zoos. Capturing wild animals to live in zoos also depletes the wild population, disrupting social structures in native animal collectives and possibly contributing to their insecurity.”", "This bill has taken quite some time to get to this Legislature. In the summer of 2012, the Toronto Star ran a series of articles about the treatment of marine mammals at Marineland in Niagara Falls, and a petition of 77,000 signatures had been presented to the Premier. In response, in October 2012, the then Minister of Community Safety and Correctional Services said that the government would be introducing legislation in the spring. I assumed at the time that she meant the following spring, as most people did. I suppose she should have checked in with the Premier at the time because, within five days, he undemocratically shut down the Legislature and announced that he’d be running away from the mess that he created under his watch.", "With the Legislature shutting down and the Liberals preoccupied with their internal shifting around of the deck chairs, I can understand why she didn’t manage to introduce the legislation the following spring, but she could have at least got things moving. That October of 2012, she seemed to have an idea of where the government was headed. At the time, an article in the media said, “The Ontario government vowed Wednesday to strengthen its animal welfare laws following allegations of mistreatment of animals at one of the province’s amusement parks.", "“Community Safety Minister Madeleine Meilleur said the province plans to introduce legislation by the spring that will beef up regulations to ensure the safety and health of animals kept in zoos and aquariums, including Marineland.”", "A year later, in October 2013, the same minister did get around to appointing a committee headed up by David Rosen, a marine mammal expert at the University of British Columbia. According to their report—this is a quote: “This committee was convened by the government of Ontario’s Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services in October 2013 to (1) evaluate Ontario’s current regulations pertaining to the care of marine mammals in captivity for public display, (2) consider whether current regulations are sufficient to ensure the care of these marine mammals, and, if not, to (3) suggest how existing regulations could be improved. Additionally, the committee was asked to (4) give special consideration to the welfare of cetaceans in public display facilities.”", "The committee submitted its final report in May of last year and has apparently provided the basis for some of the changes to come. The purpose talks about regulation rather than legislation, and a lot of the meat of any changes will be covered in regulation. So when this bill passes, the people of Ontario will be watching to see what those regulations are and whether or not they are sufficient.", "The committee left no doubt that changes were certainly needed. To quote them again: “While we have given special consideration to the welfare of captive cetaceans according to the objectives set forth for the committee, we have considered all marine mammals in our review of existing regulations. It is our opinion that the present standards of care that apply to marine mammals in public display facilities are insufficient under the current Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act. It is our opinion, based upon our review of the regulations and the available scientific evidence, that adequate care in captivity requires the adoption of an additional set of standards of care to address needs specific to this group of animals.”", "The regulations to follow will provide rules regarding the keeping and caring of other marine mammals, such as walruses and dolphins, but only orcas will be banned. Other whales such as belugas will be able to be held captive in Ontario aquariums.", "Many people in Ontario enjoy the experience of going to an aquarium. The delight on the faces of adults and children alike is unmistakable, but there is also a significant number of our population who are deeply concerned about the treatment experienced by those marine mammals. We, in the NDP, believe those attractions can thrive if the viewing public feels assured that effective rules and good governance are in place, rules that are grounded in science and animal welfare.", "The committee recommends that each facility must have an animal welfare committee that is responsible for all aspects of animal care and how they are used. They point out that it is important that the committee includes an external expert on marine mammals.", "While the committee would report to the administrator of the facility, it must be fully independent of the administrator. That, I would say, is absolutely essential. Any animal welfare committee must have animal welfare as its number one priority and must be free to investigate and report without any fear of repercussion.", "Dr. Rosen’s report suggested that a whistleblower policy written and posted at the facility would be helpful to the animal welfare committee’s work so that any concerns raised by staff about animal care are addressed and recorded properly.", "The report offered other recommendations, including:", "—an up-to-date provincial inventory of all animals, that includes lineage, acquisitions, births and deaths with causes when known, should be kept;", "—a written veterinary care program should be developed in collaboration with veterinary experts and including a protocol for preventative medicine;", "—water supply should, at all times, be reliable, with chlorine levels and bacterial counts that meet provincial standards;", "—proper noise restrictions and appropriate light levels should be enforced; and", "—there should be regulations on the handling and display of marine mammals and provisions for social and environmental enrichment.", "Speaker, I want to talk for a minute about the idea of the provincial inventory in the broader context of exotic animals. Earlier I mentioned that a few of Ontario’s zoos are accredited by the Canadian Association of Zoos and Aquariums. In addition to those accredited facilities, we have many more that are often called “roadside zoos.” These are smaller facilities that can house lions, tigers, monkeys and other assorted animals that are aren’t native to Ontario or Canada, but, for some reason, they have no laws to govern how they operate or how animals are controlled. We don’t even require owners to have a licence. We require dog owners to have a licence, but not a lion owner. That seems unbelievable, and I think it’s completely unacceptable.", "This isn’t a new matter by any stretch of the imagination. The member from Brant raised concerns about this a few years back and introduced a private member’s bill to address it. Unfortunately, that bill didn’t make it past first reading.", "It is illegal in Ontario to keep native species as pets: foxes, squirrels, wolves—those types of animals. But when it comes to exotic animals, there is nothing unless a municipality has passed a bylaw that outlaws the keeping of those non-native species. Like I said, Speaker, lions and tigers and bears, oh my. There is nothing that stops people, unless the particular municipality has something to prohibit the keeping of them. So I think that’s something that needs to be looked at.", "A couple of years ago, it was reported that of Ontario’s 444 municipalities, less than 70 had a bylaw relating to the ownership of exotic animals. Even in those that do have a bylaw, the public is often very unaware of it.", "In 2012, there was a media report from Muskoka of a cougar on the loose. One resident heard her dog yelping, and when she went to investigate, she saw a cougar with its teeth sunk into her pet husky. The police were called, who shot the cougar dead, but it was too late to save her dog, which had to be put down that night.", "The dead cougar was taken to the University of Guelph for an autopsy. What they discovered was that this animal had most certainly been in captivity. It was well-fed and had been de-clawed. But there was no way to tell where it came from. There was a roadside zoo near where the attack had happened—a small facility with six lions, one jaguar and two cougars—but the owner strongly denied that the cougar that was on the loose was his.", "Just across the road from the zoo, another resident had a small dog-breeding operation. Every year, that facility had to be inspected. All the dogs are microchipped, so that if one does wander off, the owner always knows where it is and how to get it back. Why would we have stronger restrictions on dogs than we do on tigers?", "There have been other reports of totally inadequate fencing at some of those roadside zoos, and indeed, some humans have died as a result. Between 1985 and 2010, there were media reports of 11 separate tiger escapes and four lion incidents. That is the strange, uncontrolled world of animals in captivity that we have, living here in Ontario today. In this, Ontario is the outlier in Canada. We are the only province that lacks legislation regarding the ownership of exotic animals.", "Across Canada, the laws vary from province to province. In Alberta and PEI, it is illegal to own a pet that is considered to be dangerous. In British Columbia, they maintain a list of controlled alien species that includes the types of animals I have discussed. If you want to own an animal that’s on that list, you have to apply for a permit. But only in Ontario is there nothing in place to record and control the ownership of exotic animals. It’s time that we did something here in Ontario to bring some common sense to our laws regarding exotic animals.", "In closing, we see this bill before us, we know that it’s an important bill and we know that we need to do something regarding our orcas, captivity, how we go about that, how we do that and how we maintain jobs at Marineland, because it is a wonderful place to bring your family, right? We all know that. Like I said earlier in my speech, when I was a child, I skipped to Marineland. I was so excited to see the whales, the dolphins and all the wonderful animals that are there. Going to the Toronto zoo, of course, I tiptoed through that a little bit more, because there are snakes and stuff like that throughout that wonderful place.", "But we have to have something in place to ensure that all these wonderful creatures we have in captivity that are there for our enjoyment, unless they’re there as a rescue or they’re being treated because they can’t be sent back into the wild—it’s our responsibility to make sure that people are getting it right, that they’re making sure that their levels are adequate and their habitats are appropriate. It’s our responsibility as legislators to make sure we get it right.", "We know this has been going on for a long time in Ontario, and it’s time to make sure that we put things in place to ensure the safety of all animals, whether it be a rare species of toad or frog that we can see at the Ontario Science Centre, or a large orca that we travel to Marineland to see. I think the member from James Bay said it best: Take a ride up to the north and see the belugas in their own space and enjoy them there." ],

The minister of the day was implementing stronger animal protection and stiffer penalties, including jail terms, fines and potential lifetime ownership bans, for those animals that were abused at the time. It enabled the OSPCA to inspect places where animals were kept for entertainment, exhibition, boarding, sale or hire.", "I would say to you that this is the next step in protecting animals in our province, and especially, in this case, mammals. As we know, animal welfare is a key priority of the government. Marine mammals are very complex. They are diverse, and they are magnificent creatures, as was described both by the member from Hamilton Mountain and the member for Timmins–James Bay, inviting us up to his area so we could view it first-hand. This is why the recently introduced OSPCA Act was amended, and we’re amending it again, this time to try and improve the controls that we have out there.", "This particular act will probably create some of the strongest standards in Canada.

I’d like to go up there—not in the winter, obviously. But when the weather is a little nicer, I’d certainly like to go up and see these animals at play.

For the end-of-year school trip, we visited a roadside zoo, which was the saddest, most disturbing experience that I have had as a parent: to see those poor, tattered, sad-looking animals confined in dirty cages—no oversight, no educational value to the experience. I really worried about what kind of message we were conveying to the children who were on this class trip.", "The member for Hamilton Mountain talked about the widespread concern that exists within Ontario about the humane treatment of animals, and marine animals in particular. One of the cautions I have about this amended act is that it provides for some care standards around the use of marine animals such as walruses and dolphins, but it continues to allow other animals, such as belugas, to be held captive in marine parks and aquariums.", "I would hope that marine parks and aquariums in this province take some lessons from what we have done in London with Storybook Gardens, which has been a well-known attraction within our city for years. Some of you may be familiar with the iconic story of Slippery the Seal from the 1950s. Storybook Gardens has eliminated any animals in captivity in that attraction, and that is a lesson that I hope other marine parks and animal parks will follow." ],

I’m very pleased to hear all of the support for this bill in this Legislature. I know that, if passed, Bill 80 would prohibit the breeding and acquisition of orca whales in Ontario. Additionally, the bill will create a framework to establish an animal welfare committee, as recommended in the UBC report.", "I must share with this House that not too long ago I watched a documentary that talked about orca whales, actually, in comparison to great white sharks. Scientists observed a rare scene of an orca whale holding a great white shark upside down and hunting it as its prey. Later on, the scientists found out that if you place sharks upside down you put them in tonic immobility. Basically, they pass out. Somehow the orca whale found out about that and used it as a very effective technique to hunt down these great white sharks.", "What is even more fascinating is that they develop this hunting culture and pass it on to the next generation. So the hunting culture of one pod could be very different from the hunting culture of another.", "We’ve all heard about the orca rushing the seals onto the beach in order to capture them. That hunting culture is very, very different. That proves to us, again, that orcas are highly social and smart, and they are truly beautiful animals.", "We can learn so much about them in the wild. I fully appreciate the fact that we are given this opportunity to see them when they are in captivity, but what we get out of it is very superficial: their appearance, their movement, the fact that they can learn from us, they can move, they can respond to their trainers. But we lose the opportunity to learn how they talk to each other, how they pass on their knowledge and how they hunt as group. All these wonderful things could be observed in nature.", "I must confess that I, too, was fascinated by orcas and was paying to be entertained. Now I think back, and it was somewhat superficial, because under the surface of this lovely scene of everyone enjoying with their kids, with their families, the performance by an orca, there is a cruel fact. The cruel fact is that they’re in captivity, whether it’s the stress, the chemicals in the water, the noise from the audience, it is, in fact, shortening their lifespan. I think that cruelty is something we don’t want to promote and pass on to our next generation.", "I’m extremely proud of the government and the Minister of Community Safety and Correctional Services for introducing this bill, and I’m very happy to hear all the support in the House. I think that we’re elected to pursue a just, fair and sustainable society, and this is our opportunity to show our kids, and many generations to come, our respect for a way of life and for life itself." ],

If it is passed, these amendments are going to ban the possession or breeding of additional orcas in Ontario. That would be effective immediately. It would introduce penalties of up to $60,000 and/or two years in jail for breaching this law, and it would allow the government to recommend administrative rules for animal care and record-keeping for businesses that do have marine mammals.", "It should be noted that Ontario currently does have the strongest animal protection laws in Canada, and we would be the first jurisdiction in our country to set standards of care for marine mammals when these amendments are introduced this summer.", "So what exactly are we talking about? These amendments target the size of the tanks that are used to house marine mammals. They also look at the environmental conditions, like the water quality, the noise and the lighting, that these creatures must live with. It considers social groupings, and the way they are handled and displayed to the public.", "We have heard some of the special features of orcas, and I’d like to stress them again. They are the largest of all marine mammals that are kept in captivity. They range from six to nine metres in length and four to seven tonnes in size. They can dive as deep as 500 feet or more. They can swim up to 100 miles per day. In the wild, orcas travel in pods of five to 30 whales, although some pods do combine to form larger groups of 100 whales or even larger.", "But, Mr. Speaker, the practice of keeping killer whales in captivity is considered controversial by many. At aquariums and amusement parks around the world, there are currently 57 orcas in captivity, and here in Canada we have one at Marineland.", "These exhibitions first started in the early 1960s when killer whales were captured in their natural habitat. Live captures peaked in the early 1970s, but many theme parks now maintain their population with captive breeding and artificial insemination.", "These mammals are highly intelligent. They’re easily trained and they appear to have no natural predators, as they are at the top of the food chain in their natural habitat. They’re very social animals with sophisticated behaviour, vocal abilities and hunting skills.", "But in captivity we’ve seen many issues with their health and their behaviour. Orcas in captivity can experience dorsal fin collapse. We see this in 100% of all captive males and also with female whales. The dorsal fin—this is the fin that protrudes on the back—is held erect by collagen. Scientists with the National Marine Fisheries Service have reported that the possible reasons for the fin collapse include changes in the water bacteria caused by the dietary changes when they’re in captivity; they’re getting less activity in a confined space and this is lowering blood pressure; and overheating of the collagen when the dorsal fin is exposed to air.", "We have heard of attacks on humans by orcas housed in aquatic theme parks. Since the 1970s, nearly two dozen people and trainers have been attacked by killer whales. Some of these attacks have resulted in deaths. This aggressive behaviour includes ramming in the water, biting during feeding or holding a person under water. Studies of killer whales reveal that this aggressive behaviour is tied to confinement. When a highly intelligent creature which lives in a complex social group is separated from its family and then faces a lifetime confined to a concrete tank which does not resemble its natural order, should we be surprised by this aggressive behaviour?", "The new standards of care that we’re talking about are based on recommendations made in a University of British Columbia report. It was prepared by a team of scientists led by Dr. David Rosen, who is a well-known marine biologist. We also have a technical advisory group, which includes experts in science, industry, advocacy and enforcement.", "Mr. Speaker, there are questions surrounding Canada’s Marineland, which houses marine mammals. We recognize the importance of this attraction in the Niagara Falls area as a tourist draw, and it contributes greatly to the local economy, so it’s very encouraging to see Marineland’s willingness to work with us as we move forward to ensuring best standards for care of these magnificent creatures.", "I want to conclude with a quote from Mahatma Gandhi, who said, “The greatness of a nation ... can be judged by the way its animals are treated.” Our government is committed to protecting orcas that are currently in captivity; again, you heard that it’s just one, Kiska, at Marineland. We also want to show leadership concerning these great creatures as we move forward with Bill 80." ],

But going back to 2009, our government has been implementing stronger animal protection legislation and stiffer penalties, including jail time, fines and potential lifetime ownership bans for those who abuse animals.", "We have put additional oversight and rules in place for roadside zoos.", "We also required veterinarians to report suspected abuse and neglect and introduced measures to protect them from liability for doing so. We’ve heard that from time to time veterinarians have to report suspected abuse—because we know there’s a relationship between animal abuse and abuse of women as well as children.", "We also enabled the OSPCA to inspect places where animals are kept for entertainment, exhibition, boarding, sale or hire. We have heard those nightmarish stories on the front pages of newspapers from time to time. Giving extra authority to the OSPCA for inspections and furthering their ability to do their job is the right thing to do.", "We also introduced additional penalties for those harming law enforcement service animals, such as dogs and horses; again, protecting animal welfare.", "In 2012, the then Minister of Community Safety and Correctional Services, who is now the Attorney General, set out a framework to further strengthen animal welfare enforcement with a three-point plan: to improve province-wide enforcement of animal protection measures in the OSPCA Act, as well as strengthen the governance of the OSPCA; we also considered options for tougher inspections and registration of zoos and aquariums, because we have heard, although it’s just one orca out there, there are other animals we are talking about every day—because most of us in this chamber have animals in our own families, right? They’re part of the family. So at the end of the day, yes, there’s conversation about one orca—animal welfare across the province, Mr. Speaker. And we have also created new regulations to further protect marine mammals in captivity.", "Since that time, our government has been busy in terms of consulting but more importantly creating legislation to protect animal welfare. The proposed legislation, if passed, will strengthen animal protection across the entire province. Furthermore, there’s also a big portion of this particular bill that talks about enforcement, because at the end of the day, you can have all kinds of legislation but without the teeth of enforcement it’s going to be problematic for those officers of the court.", "I’m going to encourage all members of this Legislature not just to support the bill but to bring this bill to a committee so we can have further consultation and bring this bill back for third reading before we recess for the summer." ],

It would also create a framework to establish animal welfare committees, as recommended in one of the research reports that we received.", "The committees would ensure the planning, protection and oversight for the marine mammals’ care, and that would include animal care plans, access to veterinarians with expertise in marine mammals which, as the member from Dufferin–Caledon mentioned, is nontrivial—trying to find people who specialize in marine mammals—and finally enhanced record-keeping.", "We’ve already actually established a technical advisory group of scientific experts, industry enforcement and advocacy experts to give advice on what these standards of care should look like. If Bill 80 passes, the plan would be that the proposed standards would be publicly posted for comment. Again, if the legislation is passed, then we would hope that we would have the regulatory support for that, the detailed standards of care, for the summer of 2015. Then facilities in Ontario which do hold marine mammals would need to come into line with the new standards, with enforcement going to the OSPCA under the OSPCA Act.", "So let me tell you a little bit about what we are thinking about with the new standards for marine mammals. Of course, marine mammals come in a variety of sizes. So we’re dealing with quite a range of animals that show up in various sorts of aquariums around the province.", "In October 2003, the Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services, which has responsibility for the OSPCA, asked David Rosen, a marine biologist from the University of British Columbia, to lead a team of experts to prepare a report on the care and maintenance of marine mammals in captivity. Anybody who is interested can go to the ministry website and have a look at the report for themselves, but some of the highlights: first of all, the observation that “Facilities that hold marine mammals must meet their physical and psychological environmental needs.” When we’re thinking about animal care standards, we usually put an emphasis on physical standards, but we understand when we’re dealing with marine mammals that we’re dealing with very intelligent, sophisticated, social creatures, so we need to think about their behavioural requirements, not just their physical requirements. For example, in the environment in which marine mammals live, they need to have sufficient space for species-appropriate behaviour such as swimming and playing and interacting with each other. I think one of my colleagues talked earlier about the issues around quality of water supply, because if you live in water, obviously the water quality is integral to good health. But if you’re going to hold these animals in captivity, you really do need to think about what they are going to do. They aren’t just going to swim around in a circle all day. They actually do need to have the ability, as much as possible, to interact as they would in the wild.", "For those of us who have had the pleasure of going whale watching on either the Pacific coast or the Atlantic coast—and one I hadn’t thought of, the Hudson Bay and James Bay coasts, so we’ll add that to where we should go whale watching—what you often see when you go whale watching isn’t just one whale, but a pod of whales, and how they interact, mother and baby or just a group of whales. So how do you arrange for that sort of treatment in some sort of an aquarium?", "We also need to think about the safety of the general public, particularly if these are large marine mammals, because these are large animals and they can do harm to other creatures. We just heard about how orcas can outsmart sharks, but they’re also smart enough to outsmart people. So we need to figure out how you handle the safety requirements for the audience.", "But the UBC report gave us some direction around how we would have new standards for marine mammals such as dolphins, beluga whales, walruses, those sorts of marine mammals. I think generally you could summarize those as standards for the size of pools, which would be very species-specific, environmental considerations such as water bacterial content, noise and lighting, regulations for the feeding, care, handling and display of the mammals, and, as I said before, sufficiently large facilities so that you can have social interactions taking place among the animals.", "Those are the things that we would be looking at coming out of this act with respect to the animals that would be allowed to be held in captivity in future, which is the marine mammal species other than the orca, the killer whale, which comes into a different category where we would be banning captivity in the future." ],

You’d work out how much room a pig needs or a cow needs, or whatever, to be successful. I’m certain that this could be done for these creatures we have in Marineland, or such places. We could study their habitats and certainly know what they would require to be healthy and content. I’m afraid those figures would scare the daylights out of you, because these animals want to be in the sea. They want wide open spaces.", "I did listen with interest to those who have been lucky enough to go to the coasts and watch whales in their natural habitat. I got to thinking: When you’re watching whales, you’re searching around in the ocean, and you come across the pod. Some of them are going to take off on you. I have seen pictures of people watching whales, chasing these whales, who are trying to get away, because they don’t want to be watched; they want to live in their own private world. Sometimes I’ve seen pictures where there are baby whales with them and mothers are trying to protect them, and yet the whale-watchers are still chasing them and trying to get pictures of them. Maybe that’s something we should consider that should be curbed—doing those types of things—when we talk about the welfare of animals." ],

Most of the members—the members from Kitchener Centre, Scarborough–Agincourt and the Minister of Education—brought up a similar theme, and it struck me as poignant in another area: Orcas are highly intelligent, potentially aggressive and need enough room to be socially active. They need to have interaction with other animals of their own species. That’s how they live best.", "I agree. I’m not opposing this bill. If you really think that through, it perhaps answers the question why we have trouble when our prisons are overcrowded. We also are fairly aggressive and highly intelligent, and sometimes we wonder why, when people come out of our penal system, they aren’t rehabilitated. Well, I think, on the other side, they’re answering the question. As we look at orcas, we should also—this is a different issue; I’m very much aware of that. But as we look at orcas, we should also look at people and see what we could be doing better to make sure that people interact better among each other, and that is one of the cases that many people face. Also, a lot of people in lower-income brackets get very frustrated because there is no way out.", "We can talk about orcas in the abstract, because, for many of us, it is in the abstract—it’s a very important issue.

We’ll look forward to seeing if that is the case, and we would look forward to hopefully seeing this legislation passed, because I think it has struck a chord, not just here, but in the broader public sector.", "Speaker, one of the things you first learn, at least I certainly did, when you are first elected to public office—1997 for me, to city council in Thunder Bay—is that when it comes to issues related to animals, people tend to be more passionate. They tend to be more vocal. They tend to better attend public sessions, I would say, than on a host of other issues that you might think might garner that kind of attention.

I know members opposite are playing to the audience out there, but much of the impact of this bill goes beyond one killer whale down in the Niagara Falls area. Much of the impact will be found in the regulation. The regulation is not explained to us. It obviously will expand the powers of the minister considerably.", "Over a number of decades now—we debate legislation in here. We don’t debate regulation, by and large. By and large, elected members don’t travel the province explaining to people what is in the regulation. We have an awful lot of regulation. It seems to vary from 365,000 up to 500,000 different regulatory powers in the province of Ontario, and the concern is that regulation is brought in to take decision-making power away from people who probably should be taking the responsibility on themselves." ],

  "text" : [ "Thank you to the members from Perth–Wellington and Haldimand–Norfolk, the Minister of Natural Resources and the member from Timiskaming–Cochrane for their remarks. I was struck by the member from Timiskaming–Cochrane speaking about the effects of captivity on all sorts of mammals, including humans. I suppose maybe that’s why we focus particularly on the negative effects of solitary confinement on individuals. When we look at prisons, hopefully they’re designed so that there actually is at least part or all of the day when people can socialize and have opportunities to exercise, learn a trade or something. If we’re really going to rehabilitate people, it isn’t by locking them in one little cell.", "Certainly with land mammals, when you look at the larger land mammals in zoos, there are issues around: Can they have access to behaving like they would normally behave? Polar bears or the large apes: Do they get to socialize in ways that are normal? That is the logic particularly for pulling out the orcas from most of the legislation, where generally what we’re talking about is regulating the standards for captivity for marine mammals. Just to put it in perspective, orcas, or killer whales, are twice the length and four times the mass of a beluga whale, and could easily swim from Toronto to Belleville in the course of a day. The natural habitat of this huge creature is something that’s very difficult to duplicate in captivity, and that’s why, if Bill 80 is passed, we would prohibit the future breeding and acquisition of orcas in Ontario." ],

  "text" : [ "It’s a pleasure to rise today to speak to Bill 80, the Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Amendment Act, 2015. I’ve had the opportunity to look over Bill 80, which is relatively short in length compared to many government bills that we have here from time to time. It appears to be fairly straightforward in what it is trying to achieve, which is not always the case with government and the legislation that it puts forward.", "I do have some concerns with the way this bill has been drafted by the government in that it seems to leave out some important details, leaving those particular matters to be sorted out later in the regulation-setting process. As we always say, the devil is in the details. This is not an uncommon practice for legislation and not a major concern of mine if this bill only impacted the prohibition of orca whales. But the way this legislation is being amended, it leaves open the possibility that other individuals with care or custody of animals could find themselves impacted by these changes down the road.", "That raises some concern for me, as although the main intent of the bill is obviously to end the captivity of orca whales in Ontario, I always wonder what the unintended consequence of creating all sorts of new regulations, enforcement mechanisms and powers will be, especially for a group like the OSPCA which, at times, has generated much criticism from the public in Ontario for its actions.", "I would also like to point out that while this bill does address an issue that is always sure to garner a lot of media attention, in my opinion it may not be the best use of time in this House.", "In my time as the MPP for the riding of Sarnia–Lambton, I have received thousands of phone calls and emails about many issues that are significantly impacting the lives of those in my riding, issues like the ongoing problems with family law and the Family Responsibility Office; the hoops they are forced to jump through for support programs like ODSP and Ontario Works; the ever-increasing cost of electricity; a stagnant provincial economy; and a sense that the quality of government services, like health care and education, continues to erode, especially in communities outside of the GTA like Sarnia–Lambton. They’re concerned that this government just doesn’t care about what happens in our corner of the province.", "I could be wrong, but I don’t recall a single phone call or email from one of my constituents asking for an immediate prohibition on the possession of orca whales.", "Anyone who has ever seen one of these majestic whales would agree that a man-made enclosure is no place for this type of beast to live. The debate on the actual benefits of having any species in captivity at a zoo or in an aquarium could certainly fill many hours in this Legislature, but I don’t know how many people would see this matter as the most pressing issue for debate.", "Speaking on behalf of my constituents, I would ask that this bill be moved through the House as quickly as possible so that government could then use what time is left in this session to get back to focusing on the tough issues that will have the greatest benefit on this province and its future. As such, I will be supporting this bill at second reading.", "However, back to the specifics of Bill 80, I would like to touch on two major ideas in this bill, orca prohibition and standards of care, and some of the basic points that I feel are important to this debate and for the decision-making of this House when considering this bill.", "On the matter of orca prohibitions, Bill 80 amends the OSPCA Act to include the definition of the term “orca” in its interpretation. For those who don’t know, orcas are also referred to as killer whales. They are the largest member of the dolphin family and one of the world’s most powerful predators. With the passing of Bill 80, the breeding and possession of orcas, or killer whales, would be prohibited in the province of Ontario. This prohibition does not apply to orcas possessed on the day prior to the bill’s introduction.", "One must assume that this clause was included to address the issue of Marineland as they possess the only captive orca, in my information, in Ontario. Nonetheless, if a person chose to acquire an orca after the introduction date but before royal assent, they would be granted six months after the assent to cease to possess this whale. If a person acquired one after royal assent, they would be immediately subject to charges. Further, a person found to possess an orca acquired after the introduction of the bill would be liable, on conviction, to a fine of not more than $60,000 and imprisonment up to two years.", "Given the size of these whales, I don’t think anybody is just going to drop one off on your doorstep. I don’t think anybody is going to be acquiring any whales after this bill comes into effect. It wouldn’t be like a stray dog or something coming by the house.", "Bill 80 will also amend the Animals for Research Act so that the orca prohibitions would apply to registered research and research supply facilities. Our caucus research tells us that there are zero orcas being held in research facilities in Ontario. However, it is important to include this clause to ensure that this does not become a loophole in the legislation.", "I would also like to take this opportunity, when we’re talking about research, to say that Lambton College in my riding of Sarnia–Lambton is consistently recognized as one of the top institutions for applied research in Canada. While they are not involved in the study of orca whales or marine biology, they are doing a lot of great work in many other advanced technology fields and in the area of health sciences. To that end, the leadership of Lambton College has been working very hard to qualify for funding through the Ministry of Economic Development and the Small Communities Fund in order to build their new Health Education and Sustainable Care Centre. I certainly hope this government will show that same level of interest in the development and funding of this project as they are showing here today in the prohibition of orca whales.", "Bill 80, the Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Amendment Act, 2015, also includes a number of amendments to the existing OSPCA Act that stem from the report by the very esteemed Dr. David Rosen. That report was titled Developing Standards of Care for Marine Mammals in Captivity and Recommendations Regarding How Best to Ensure the Most Humane Treatment of Captive Cetaceans.", "Dr. Rosen is a marine biologist at the University of British Columbia who chaired the committee looking into the care of marine animals for the government last year. Dr. Rosen concluded that the current general animal welfare standards of care are insufficient to protect marine mammals in captivity. The recommendations that Dr. Rosen and the committee included in this report were:", "“(1) We recommend additional regulation(s) to supplement the OSPCA Act that are specifically tailored to meet the needs of marine mammals that are not currently covered by other relevant sections of the act....", "“i. Facilities must demonstrate responsibility to the long-term well-being of marine mammals in their care.", "“a. Each facility must have an established animal welfare committee.", "“b. Each facility must have a written animal management plan that provides justification for all marine mammals housed in the facility.", "“c. Each facility is required to help maintain a provincial inventory of marine mammals housed in display facilities.", "“d. Each facility must have access to a qualified veterinarian with expertise in marine mammal medicine, who oversees a program of preventive veterinary medicine and clinical care for all marine mammals held in the facility, in accordance with professional standards of practice in Ontario.”", "They have quite a few recommendations, Mr. Speaker.", "“e. Each facility must have a written veterinary care program. This should be developed by a veterinarian in collaboration with other experts (biologists, trainers, curators, etc.) and should include an annual physical examination of each marine mammal”—on a yearly basis.", "“ii. Facilities that hold marine mammals must meet their physical and psychological environmental needs.", "“f. Consideration must be given to the three-dimensional environment in which marine mammals live and the need to provide sufficient space for species-appropriate activities both in and out of the water. Therefore, it is recommended that each facility adopt a set of minimum space requirements that are based upon established, internationally recognized codes.", "“g. Marine mammals must be protected from exposure to noise that could cause auditory discomfort or distress and lead to injury.", "“h. The water supply must be reliable and contribute to the good health and well-being of the marine mammals.", "“i. Provisions must be made for appropriate light exposure, including consideration of the type, level, and cycle of exposure.", "“j. Each facility must provide suitable social and environmental enrichment programs.", "“iii. Facilities must ensure that marine mammals are not harmed in their contact with the general public.", "“k. Facilities with public contact programs must ensure the programs are adequately designed and outfitted to minimize potential risks to the health and safety of the marine mammals and humans” that could come in contact with them.", "“l. Facilities with a public contact program must have a written policy that clearly identifies and addresses the safety issues and concerns for all participants in the program, including the marine mammals, and specifies the qualifications of those conducting the public contact session.”", "The second major recommendation in the Rosen report goes on to say:", "“(2) We recommend additional regulation(s) through the OSPCA Act for facilities acquiring new wild-born animals. These regulations are designed to protect the welfare of cetaceans destined for public display, either through foreign or domestic acquisitions, with particular emphasis on safeguarding the health of wild populations.", "“(3) We recommend the timely adoption of the Guidelines On: The Care and Maintenance of Marine Mammals established by the Canadian Council on Animal Care (CCAC) as a specific standard of care for marine mammals under the OSPCA Act.”", "At about 124 pages with citations, this was a very thorough report by Dr. Rosen and the committee. I was just giving you guys the highlights, the overview. The pages were listening intently; I can tell.", "If you were listening, you will have noticed that this report stops short of calling for a prohibition on possessing orca whales in Ontario. The committee noted, “This report represents the scientific perspective of the committee and does not include other viewpoints such as those concerned with social, ethical, political, and economic factors.” This is a very interesting point, yet the main thrust of the bill that came from the report is a prohibition on orca whales in Ontario.", "Of course, everyone will remember that this report was initially called for following the news stories where Marineland trainers were alleging mistreatment of marine mammals at the facility in Niagara Falls. Personally, I believe that the vast majority of individuals who would choose to work with creatures in zoos and aquariums wold do so because they care passionately about these creatures. I believe they are doing what they believe to be in the best interests of those creatures. Nonetheless, these are the recommendations being put forward by this committee.", "Out of all the recommendations that the committee made that the government seems to have implemented into Bill 80, I believe the biggest impact may be felt from repealing subsection 11.1(1) of the act, which previously read, “Every person who owns or has custody or care of an animal shall comply with the prescribed standards of care with respect to every animal that the person owns or has custody or care of.” That section is amended by Bill 80 to read, “Every person who owns or has custody or care of an animal shall comply with the prescribed standards of care, and the prescribed administrative requirements, with respect to every animal that the person owns or has custody or care of”—the difference in those two statements being that with the passing of Bill 80, persons caring for or in custody of animals that fall under this legislation will be required to follow “prescribed administrative requirements.”", "To its credit, this government has done what all Liberal governments seem to do, and that is create more bureaucracy. Those individuals caring for these animals will now have the added requirement of completing and submitting records on everything they do. What all of those final requirements will be, we don’t know, and it will be some time before we will know. As I said, as always, the devil will be in the details.", "Mr. Speaker, what is laid out in Bill 80 suggests that there will be administrative requirements, also known as paperwork, relating to the keeping of animals, the establishment of animal welfare committees, animal care plans, veterinary care programs, record-keeping and disclosure; in other words, as one of my colleagues from Haldimand–Norfolk said, more red tape.", "A technical advisory group will report in six months with suggestions for the final standards and a timeline for their implementation. This group will be comprised of experts from science, industry, advocacy and enforcement. The power to inspect would be amended to make it clear that all of the places, excluding owners’ private dwellings, where animals are kept, including off-season locations, may be inspected if the animals are kept for the purpose of exhibition, boarding, hire or sale.", "In the case of marine mammals, I am told that they are frequently moved to different parks’ holding tanks and inspectors have been unable to view these areas. This is believed to have been a problem for inspectors in the past. This change is meant to address that. That’s my understanding.", "OSPCA inspectors would be able to demand the production of records without physically inspecting the site. Hopefully, in reviewing this legislation at the committee stage, this government will seriously consider introducing some basic accountability measures to go along with the increased powers of the OSPCA.", "There are many constituents in my riding of Sarnia–Lambton and also across Ontario who question the behaviour, from time to time, of the OSPCA. We’ve heard many talks about that here in speeches in this Legislature since I first came here in 2007, and there have been many so-called abuses.", "Finally, as I mentioned before, the work of Dr. Rosen’s committee and the drafting of Bill 80 are the result of many media stories generated over the last few years about care at Marineland in Niagara Falls. In the interest of fairness, I would like to read into the record Marineland’s response to the tabling of Bill 80. This response was posted on their website on March 24, 2015:", "“Marineland supports the government’s commitment to seeking guidance and following the best advice from marine mammal experts regarding appropriate standards of care for marine mammals.", "“The technical advisory committee provides essential input from independent marine mammal veterinarians and scientists who have decades of experience rescuing marine mammals, and providing for their ongoing health and care.", "“Marineland trusts that the committee members can work co-operatively to provide the government with clear advice and direction towards meaningful standards that will ensure the continuing health of all marine mammals.", "“Marineland believes it is essential that the process remain focused on the health and welfare of marine mammals, the decades of scientific research and experience that should inform the setting of standards, and on achieving clear and enforceable standards. We support the government’s view that legal standards need to be based on science, not political ideologies or public relations, and the technical advisory committee and the government’s own expert panel report should provide the basis on which to proceed.", "“Marineland trusts the government will focus on the clear recommendations of its expert panel and its chairman, Dr. Rosen. Marineland supports the recommendation of Dr. Rosen that the recently released comprehensive, independent, and peer-reviewed Canadian Council on Animal Care guidelines be adopted. The guidelines are detailed, comprehensive in scope, and provide clear direction to any facility that houses marine mammals. The guidelines represent over 10 years of work by virtually the entire Canadian scientific community with expertise in the marine mammal field and represent the best practices of marine mammal care.", "“Marineland meets or exceeds those standards and is committed to maintaining and enhancing the health and care of all its marine mammals.”", "As I’m reaching the end of my time, I’d just like to reiterate that I will be supporting Bill 80 at second reading. I believe that the work that Dr. Rosen’s committee has done is very thorough and that their suggestions form the basis for sound decision-making in moving forward. I’m encouraged to see that Marineland also supports the work of Dr. Rosen. It is my hope that when this government does get around to filling in the details of the bill and setting the regulations, they will follow the recommendations of Dr. Rosen and not allow politics to influence their final decision-making." ],

Having said that, of course we support the legislation very strongly. Many of us have spoken about our experiences viewing animals in captivity and the discomfort that we feel from using animals for our own entertainment, from confining sentient creatures and using them for fun.", "I wanted to share with members something that’s happening in my riding of London West, something I’m quite proud of. Storybook Gardens is a historic London landmark, founded in the 1950s. There is an international story, actually, of Slippery the seal, who escaped from Storybook Gardens, where he was held in captivity, and managed to swim over to Sandusky, Ohio, where he was captured and later returned to Storybook Gardens.", "Storybook Gardens had four seals, a pair of lynx, beavers, otters and birds of prey, but they realized they could not care for these animals appropriately. They could not provide the appropriate habitat and, as a result, began a process of relocating those animals. Most recently, following last month, a decision was made that they’re not even going to be keeping domestic animals in captivity. There’s no reason for us to see animals in captivity for our own entertainment." ],

You see all these movies about sharks back in the 1960s, and there used to be movies about killer whales back in the 1960s. Then, working in Australia, you end up swimming with sharks, whether you want to or not, and you realize that some will bite you and some won’t. You find out where they go and you move with them.", "When you’re exposed to these animals, it’s like livestock on a farm: You better understand. The case in point would be the killer whale, which was feared by so many people. Pythons, for example, until you live with them—I’ve lived with them, believe it or not, in a house in Toronto, and boas.", "But until you’re exposed to them, until you see these kinds of animals in captivity, it changes your perception. In many ways, by having the killer whale in captivity, there is more understanding, less fear, less persecution of the species as children get to see them upfront and personal. We’ve seen a change in the public’s perception of the killer whale. Why is that? Because killer whales, here and there around the world, have been kept in captivity and it has transformed their image. So there are some pluses for having killer whales in captivity." ],

I think they belong in their natural surroundings where their friends and family play together, swim together, hunt together and eat together. I think that’s where they’re supposed to be. Having one orca completely in solitary on its own, I think, is quite sad.", "The other part that I focused on was the fact that we have 50 to 60 zoos and aquariums in Ontario, and yet only 10 of them are under the accreditation of the Canadian Association of Zoos and Aquariums. We talked about roadside zoos and the filth that I personally had seen them in. As well, my seatmate from London West had the exact same experience, and I’m sure it was probably not even at the same roadside zoo.", "There is no oversight making sure that when we’re keeping animals for our own pleasure that they’re being maintained properly.

  "text" : [ "I gave a bit of a primer a little while ago to what I’d like to talk about in this debate, and that is not just whales in captivity but actually whales in their natural environment.", "It was good to hear different members of the assembly talk to that to a degree in regard to their experiences and those of others when it came to looking at various mammals and animals in the wild. I think the point is that there are more ways of being able to see animals than just going to a zoo. Going into the wild, properly supervised, with people who know what they’re doing, is not a bad thing.", "I just want to start off by saying: Of course we support the bill. How can you not? We understand that you need to have regulation in order to deal with how you deal with the captivity of animals or mammals in a zoo. You know, Mr. Speaker; you’ve been here as long as I have: How many bills like this have we dealt with? Roadside zoos—I can think of a number of them where either they were private members’ bills or government bills that attempted to deal with the issue of how we make sure that those animals that are in captivity in fact are cared for safely and are not put in danger as a result of any of the activities that may be happening in that particular facility.", "I don’t pretend to know all of the ins and outs of the rules about how you take care of an orca whale. It seems to me it’s a pretty big whale in a small tank. I’m sure there are things that you have to be able to do adequately.", "I also want to say—and pardon the pun here—don’t throw the baby out with the bathwater. That’s not the first pun, but don’t throw the baby out with the bathwater.", "I, as have many people, have taken my children to Marineland when they were younger, in order to be able to actually see a whale, because that was the only place that I can afford to bring my kids to see a whale here in Ontario. At the same time, we saw a lot of other animals and we got to get on some rides. I strongly recommend people to go to Marineland. It’s quite the place to go to, as well as some of the other activities that the Niagara area has to offer. I think it is a great vacation for families to be able to go to, everything from the Niagara Falls to walking up—what do you call that? Clifton Hill, I think it’s called, where all those knock-off shops are and restaurants and all that. It’s just great experience. I think Marineland is one of those jewels in a crown of what makes tourism work in the Niagara area. So I don’t want this to be seen from our part as being an anti-Marineland tirade, because quite frankly, Marineland does do a lot of good stuff.", "I think what the government is trying to do, and I think this is what we have to flesh out in committee, is: Is this the proper way of dealing with the issue? It will be interesting to see what the public has to say as the public comes to committee in order to talk about what they think about this bill. Should it or should it not be in its present form? Is the objective the right objective? Does the objective have to change or is it just strictly a question of the rules changing about how we do this? It will be very interesting to see it when it gets to its life in committee. We’ll send it to a special committee of the Legislature big enough to be able to take such a mammal—I was talking about me—and we will have a chance to hear from the public when it comes to this.", "I want to also speak about—I talked about it earlier when I had a chance to speak in response to one of the other members, and that is that a lot of people don’t recognize that Ontario has whales that are native to Ontario. I was a little bit not taken aback but not completely unsurprised when I made the point that we actually have beluga whales in Ontario. A number of members, when I went to the back lobby to have a phone call with the Timmins and District Hospital over some stuff that we’re dealing with, said, “Jeez, I didn’t know that. I wasn’t aware that we have whales in Ontario.”", "Let me tell you the story: “There be whales in Ontario, Captain.” We all saw the Star Trek episode, right? I tried to do a good Scotty imitation there; it didn’t quite work. My Scotty imitation—God rest Scotty; he’s no longer with us—" ],

James and Hudson bays, as we all know, are saltwater bodies that are connected to the Atlantic Ocean through the Arctic Ocean, the Bering Sea—not the Bering Sea but the various straits north of Ontario and Quebec.", "It is an ocean, and in that ocean we have beluga whales. Beluga whales, as is natural to beluga whales, have to travel to feed. That’s what they do. Their whole existence, from the time they’re born to the time they die, is how they go around this ocean called James and Hudson bays and actually feed themselves with what is available. Their whole migration is based on where they can get food.", "In the summer, the belugas come to this part of the planet called Ontario. They come into James and Hudson bays to feed. Where they feed, by and large—not only, but by and large—is that they go in pods in front of the large rivers—the Winisk River or the Attawapiskat River or whatever river it might be—and align themselves just down from the rivers into the ocean. So they’re still in the ocean—in James Bay or Hudson Bay when they’re doing this—and they align themselves in pods. It’s something else to see, if you ever have an opportunity. Literally hundreds and hundreds of whales are lined up in pods just waiting for all the stuff that comes down the river to be able to feed—fish and various crustaceans and whatever the river has to offer by way of a menu for those whales on that particular day.", "I’ve had the great fortune of being able to fly over and see some of this a large number of times, both in my own aircraft—Foxtrot Zulu Yankee Victor; if you ever see me flying, that’s me—or sometimes, when I have to charter and bring staff and get into particular areas with charters. It’s quite something to see. It tells you something about our planet: just how lucky and fortunate we are to live on a planet that has so much biodiversity and so much to offer when it comes to the beauty of what is nature. When you see hundreds of whales feeding at the mouth of a river, it is quite something.", "The whales, at times, will come all the way down to the Moosonee/Moose Factory area. Now, they’re not there a lot. I want to warn people, if you’re going there and expect to see a whale every day, that you may have to wait a little bit to see one, because they, at times, come down. It really depends on what is going on in James and Hudson bays and what the feed is like. But we will see, from time to time, which is really kind of odd, whales that will come down the Moose River.", "There are people who have seen belugas out between Moosonee and Moose Factory. Just to draw a picture, on the west bank of the Moose River is Moosonee, and if you move to the east, there’s an island right in between, and the island itself is called Moose Factory. It’s quite large. Moose Cree is the First Nation that is there, a very large, prosperous First Nation, and also MoCreebec, which is the only non-registered reserve in my riding, in the sense that they operate as a traditional First Nation, but they’re not recognized under the Indian Act. We can have a discussion, one day, about the pros and cons of that, and also the federal and provincial lands that are there." ],

You don’t see them there a lot, but you do see them from time to time.", "The other thing you see is seals. I’ve got to tell you that the first time I saw one, I had no—I knew there were whales, because I had been told there were whales in James Bay and Hudson Bay, but I had not seen any at the time, as a newly elected member for James Bay. I was in one of these boats that we use; they’re freighters that we use to cross over from Moosonee to Moose Factory. They’re actually the taxi. The only way you can get there in the summer is to get in one of these freighter boats.", "I was in a freighter boat with Jimmy Kapashesit. His son was Randy Kapashesit, who some of you here know was the chief of MoCreebec and also the chair of the LHIN, the local health integration network, in our area. His dad had taken me out for a bit of a ride, looking around—actually, we were going fishing is what we were doing—and all of a sudden, I see a seal. There’s this huge, humungous seal in the river out in front of our boat, and I’m telling you, that seal was as big as the Clerks’ table. It’s not a small mammal.", "I’m looking over at it, and Jimmy, as Jimmy does, is running the motor in the boat, standing up and looking at all this as we’re going by. We go zooming by the seal, and I go, “Jimmy, Jimmy, stop! Stop!”", "“What?”", "“What is that?” And I meant, “What kind of seal is that?”", "And he goes, “What do you mean, ‘What is it?’ It’s a seal.”", "“I know it’s a seal, Jimmy, but you’ve got to tell me, what kind of seal is it? Is it a harp seal?”", "He looks at me. He says, “You know, you guys have got a word for everything. We just call them seals. They’re a seal. That’s all they are. Leave me alone. You saw it; let’s move on.”", "I thought it was funny. The humour there is that they didn’t have particular words for different kinds of seals because for millennia, the Mushkegowuk Cree who lived on the bay had only one kind of seal to look at, so they only had one word for seals: the type of seals that they lived with. So that was that.", "The interesting thing is, what Jimmy was telling me was that the seals—and you get to see this in the spring—will come down the river and beach themselves on sandbars in order to get sun. They do what seals do—sit there, digest and whatever—and they’re something to see. They’re—" ],

They’re nature in its thing.", "My point is, there is all kinds of beauty to be seen in places like the James Bay. If we, as a province, wanted to really be bold and outside of the box, to say, “How do we allow people in Ontario and across the world to see these natural beauties that we have in our nature?” We would be figuring out ways of being able to properly support entrepreneurs on the James Bay and some of the institutions to build the infrastructure to allow tourists to be able to travel more easily to the James Bay.", "I’m going to give some credit where credit is due. The province has done some stuff over the years. Right now, we’re investing some money in the Ontario Northland train, the only train running and Ontario-owned. Ontario Northland actually starts in John’s riding, the member from Timiskaming–Cochrane, and ends up in my riding in Moosonee. There’s some money being invested there, and that’s a good thing.", "We did a very interesting federal-provincial program on a private sector venture with the MoCreebec when we built the Eco Lodge. Some of you members have been there. You’ve had the opportunity. If you want to go somewhere where there’s a really nice facility and be able to experience the ecosystem on James Bay, contact the Eco Lodge: 658-6400. Again, the number is on the screen: 658-6400. You get to book not only a room, but they’ll also assist you with booking excursions out onto the bay and into the river to take a look at some of these natural wonders that we see.", "They can arrange for you to go out and see the northern lights. They can arrange for you to go out and look at the bay when the whales are down; hopefully you’ll be able to get to see the whales. But they’re another way that we can help people to see nature not in a tank, in captivity—and I’m going to get to this point that my colleague the member from Timiskaming–Cochrane had—but in the wild, where they’re really in their own habitat, and we get to see them and what they do in their natural habitat. It’s another way of being able to promote tourism, but at the same time help do some economic development in areas in which we have not naturally done that.", "I want to make a point, and it was done as a bit of a jest during one of the members’ speeches, but I thought it was a very interesting point.

Somebody made a comment—the member from Timiskaming–Cochrane—and I thought it was actually a very valid comment, which is: That’s how we house our prisoners. When you think about it, if it doesn’t work for whales, why do we think the confinement system we have today works any better for prisoners when it comes to rehabilitation? I thought that was actually an interesting link.", "I’m not arguing for a second that we shouldn’t have prisons. Obviously, we have to have prisons. You have to take people out of circulation who have broken the law and are a danger to society. I’m not advocating that for a second. I’m not saying we should make a Taj Mahal to house prisoners, but the point is, if you’re trying to rehabilitate somebody in the penal system, you have to have a system in place that is actually successful in rehabilitation.", "By overcrowding prisoners, as we’re seeing, especially in our federal system—the federal government has changed laws on the criminal side akin to what we saw in United States, where we’re warehousing prisoners in institutions that were never designed to take that capacity. What you’re going to end up with is a powder keg. It’s kind of like Marineland, to an extent; that was the point the member from Kitchener Centre was making. But in the case of prisons, what the federal government has done by changing the laws and making it that more people are being incarcerated for lesser and lesser crimes—we’re filling up our jails to overcapacity. That is not only not ethical; it doesn’t work.", "How do you do rehabilitation in that kind of system? It seems to me that you have to have laws that are straight and tough, and everybody understands what the rules are. But we have a responsibility, as federal and provincial governments, if we’re going to have jails, to at least get it right and do something with the time that the prisoners are there so they’re rehabilitated.", "Provincially, we’re two years less a day, so we have a little bit less effect than the feds have. They do longer sentences because they can put somebody away for 20 or 30 years. It seems to me that we have to have a real rehabilitation system that provides people with adequate shelter, considering it’s a jail; some way so that people are able to do something useful with their time while they’re there; and doing some rehabilitation so that, hopefully, when the person has served out their sentence, they actually have a chance to come back into society.", "I want to digress a bit.

What is frustrating for me in this House—and this is not the first time this has happened—is that we have pretty well unanimous consent on what we’re trying to do. I think the proponents, or the people who are experts on these issues, are on our side, because they too want to protect, in this case, a mammal.", "In the 12 years that I had the opportunity to serve on municipal government, when council decided on something—we jot down a motion, we move it and second it, we vote, and the job is done. So that’s the frustration in this place. We really agree. We want to get this done. There are an awful a lot of things that I think Ontarians want us to talk about that are just as important as this, but we do have 99.9% agreement, so I would say: Let’s get this done. Let’s stop regurgitating over and over and over again. Let’s make life better for mammals—especially whales like this one—that I think we need to do." ],

It would have been much better if you could take the train from Toronto to Cochrane, but unfortunately this government decided they had other things to do for northern Ontario, so they cut that. But while you’re in Cochrane—and Cochrane had the polar bear habitat. I think it’s better if you see polar bears in the wild, but not all of us will have that opportunity. In the polar bear habitat, they now have two bears, and they are studying the relationship with bears to try and see how to make a better wild habitat for bears.

You’ve got to imagine: You’re out on your snow machines, you’re out north of the Attawapiskat River, you’re in the middle of basically nowhere, and you’re setting up a hunt camp for him and his family to come do their spring hunt in a week or so. They’re getting everything ready, so he’s got a couple of tents set up, they’re gathering wood and getting everything to get ready.", "All of a sudden, they decide that they would like some tea, so they make some tea inside their tent. They’re sitting in the tent, getting to the point where they’re thinking about leaving, and lo and behold, a polar bear sticks its head in the tent flap.", "If any of you have ever been live in front of a polar bear, it’s enough to make you see Jesus in about two seconds. They are huge. A polar bear is a huge animal, and this thing stooped down, stuck its head into the tent and started sniffing around to see if there was anything to eat. The only thing there was two humans, and guess what? As some of you know, polar bears will eat humans. The guns that they had weren’t in the tent; they were on the snow machines.", "I said to Mike, “What the heck did you do, Mike?”—I had more colourful language. He says, “Well, I did what I could do. There was a log in the fire. I grabbed one end of it with one hand. The thing was on fire—you should’ve seen the burn on my hand—and I started whacking the thing on the forehead,” until finally the bear retreated out of the tent. Mike Carpenter is still here today to talk about that hunting experience because of his calmness and wisdom in being able to get rid of the polar bear without having to shoot it." ],

It says something about who we are.", "Speaking to Bill 80, the marine mammals act, we are doing something which actually recognizes that we weren’t taking care in the past and we’re prepared now to correct that for the future. This bill is essentially about balance: balance in how we care for mammals in our care, in our zoos, in our aquariums.", "We do some large mammals very, very well. I remember, for instance, in the Toronto zoo—I used to attend there on a regular basis with my children. My daughter Robin is five years old, who happened to be born on May 5, so she’s a fifth child of the fifth month. On her fifth birthday, we were up at the Toronto zoo and had a chance to go behind the scenes, and we were petting the tongue of an elephant. It was an extraordinary experience for both of us to be that up close and personal with an elephant. The tongue is very rough, with big bumps on it, which allows it to take grass off the ground. My five-year-old was up there with her hand inside an elephant’s mouth.", "Sadly, today that elephant is no longer at the Toronto zoo, because they also recognized how difficult it was for us in a zoo facility to care for an animal of that size, given our climate and our conditions. You probably read about Bob Barker of The Price Is Right coming out and helping the city of Toronto to move that animal to a sanctuary where it could be better looked after, considering the conditions it was facing up here.", "Speaker, we also seem to be very much doing well with aquariums. At the zoo, of course, there are sea lions, seals and otters. You see them there playing, and the kids are thrilled to be there. We also do aquariums well. I had the pleasure of taking my stepkids to the Ripley’s museum shortly after it opened. Being on those automatic pathways as you see sharks, barracudas and all sorts of marine life in that aquarium setting, where they’re not in an environment where by any stretch of the imagination we would say they were being ill-treated—they were happy within their environment. They’re protected, they’re well fed and it’s such an incredible learning experience for our children.", "It was the same thing, when I was growing up, with the Riverdale Zoo, where I got for the first time, as a downtown-Toronto person, a chance to see cows, horses and donkeys—as a young child, at the Riverdale Zoo. They were contained in fairly tight quarters. At the time there were also lions and others, but in time we recognized that those facilities were too small to properly manage. The African wildlife was moved out to the Toronto zoo, and it just became a farm. That was an important experience to me, in helping me better understand the mammals in the world that we share.", "I had the pleasure of being in Japan with a very good friend of mine years ago. We went up to the north in Japan, on one of the high-speed bullet railroads, to an onsen. An onsen, as you know, is like a hot spring. Think about what we get out in Alberta, in the mountains, and the sulphur hot springs. Except there, they’ve got 700 or 800 years of tradition behind their onsens, where it’s very competitive for people to come visit. In one particular onsen we visited, they had black bears contained in the smallest cages. It was so disheartening to see what they were doing in an attempt to draw people into that facility. In these close confines, they kept these bears. It was a delightful visit, but it was very disappointing to see the bears in that condition.", "I realize that what we have here is a bill about balance.", "I think we’ve recognized now that the orca is not an animal that it makes sense to contain, particularly on an individual basis, inside a tank. The orca is an extraordinarily social character. I’ve heard stories of orca mothers so fretful over the loss of their pup that has been picked up and trapped that they’ve beached themselves in agony. It’s terrible when we think about that. An orca tends to live in much larger pods. We’ve heard so many people here speak about that.", "I was delighted: I was here earlier in the debate when the member from Chatham–Kent–Essex talked at great length about the history, the biology, what the orcas eat, and it was an extraordinarily well-detailed speech. I learned a lot more about orcas than I otherwise would have ever known.", "We’ve also heard talk about Marineland. Marineland is a great, world-class organization. They do a lot of stuff really, really well. There are opportunities for people to go and visit that fantastic facility, to see all the other animals that are there: sea lions, dolphins, walruses, beluga whales. We know that they’re doing everything they have been doing within the laws that applied at the time. But now times are changing, and they’re looking to do things differently, and we accept the fact, because Kiska, we’ve heard, isn’t doing well as an individual orca in captivity. Her dorsal fin bent over like that was a sign of depression.", "So I’m very pleased that our government is moving forward to make Kiska the last orca in captivity in Ontario, that we won’t be out bringing more into Ontario, but we will allow and continue to encourage this great organization to flourish, for tourists to come to Ontario to enjoy all that Ontario has to offer.", "With that, I’ll leave it to my colleague the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing." ],

I know that how we relate to animals is a determinant, to a large extent, of how we relate to people. It’s important that we hold these things to be self-evident and true and do what we can to protect all of Mother Nature’s species.", "Orcas like to hunt in pods, I’m told. They can’t stand noise. They like to talk to each other. In fact, scientists tell us that they have their own language and, depending on the pod, even their own dialect. We don’t know yet—we probably will in a few years—what they’re saying. We just have to learn how to translate it into English, Mr. Speaker. But once we do that, I’m sure it’ll be a fascinating conversation.", "I want to just broaden it out a bit, though, because we can tend to romanticize these things—and it’s important that we do that. Free Willy was a great film. All the kids and their parents who sat down with them loved the film. Willy was going to get away.", "I’ve been reading an awful lot about climate change, lately, and particularly the impact on our oceans. We talk about Kiska and the water quality and being alone and all of that, in that place. But scientists are now telling us that we’ve so degraded the water, particularly in oceans, that they were estimating it could take 100 years to recover. Now they’re saying it could take 800 to 1,000 years. That’s just if we leave it alone: if we quit overfishing it, if we quit doing all the things we ought to intuit are not appropriate to do.", "When we have the broader debate about climate change, as I’m sure we will, we need to think not only globally and act locally, as with the orca we’ve been talking about today, but recognize that thinking globally and acting locally is probably no longer a phrase we should be repeating, because everything we do in life vis-à-vis nature is of global importance, and we need to acknowledge that. I think that in many ways our initiative with respect to climate change is a very specific global response to the kind of issue we’re talking about here." ],

Before I go forward, I’d like to outline some of the steps we have taken to support and protect animals in our province.", "In 2009, this government implemented stronger animal protection legislation and stiffer penalties, including jail, fines and a potential lifetime ownership ban, for those who abuse animals. We put additional oversight and rules in place for roadside zoos. We required veterinarians to report suspected abuse and neglect, and introduced measures to protect them from liability for doing so.", "We enabled the OSPCA to inspect places where animals are kept for entertainment, exhibition, boarding, sale or hire, and we introduced additional penalties for harming law enforcement service animals such as dogs and horses.", "In October 2012, the then Minister of Community Safety and Correctional Services, the Honourable Madeleine Meilleur, now the Attorney General, set out a framework to further strengthen animal welfare enforcement with a three-point plan to improve province-wide enforcement of animal protection measures in the OSPCA Act and strengthened governance of the OSPCA, consider options for tougher inspections and registration of zoos and aquariums, and create new regulations to further protect marine animals in captivity. We also improved the OSPCA’s ability and capacity to carry on their good and important work.", "This legislation, Bill 80, continues that good work and is the next logical step in this process to protect wildlife in our province. If passed, simply put, Bill 80 would prohibit the breeding and acquisition of orca whales in Ontario. The bill will establish the best standards of care for marine mammals in captivity. Additionally, the bill would create a framework to establish animal welfare committees, as recommended by Dr. Rosen’s report.", "I’d like to take a bit of time to discuss the report prepared by Dr. David Rosen, a respected marine biologist, on the care and maintenance of marine mammals in captivity. In his report, Dr. Rosen outlined what elements those standards should govern, in terms of light, sound, water quality and enclosure size.", "Facilities with marine mammals in Ontario would need to adhere to the new standards. These include that facilities that hold marine mammals must meet their physical and psychological environmental needs. Consideration would be given to the environment in which marine mammals live. The water supply must be reliable and contribute to the good health and well-being of the marine mammals and, most importantly, facilities must ensure that marine mammals are not harmed in their contact with the general public.", "These new standards, which will be brought forward this summer, will ensure both greater protection and improved treatment for marine mammals.", "With the framework in place, animal welfare committees would ensure planning, protection and oversight for the animals’ care. For example, this includes animal care plans, access to veterinarians with expertise in marine mammals, and enhanced record-keeping.", "This legislation, Bill 80, would put in place the strongest possible standards of care and protection for marine mammals in captivity in Canada.", "This bill puts important protections in place for orcas, marine mammals sometimes referred to as killer whales. The ministry has looked closely at the issue and determined that new standards of care are required for orcas.", "Orcas are the largest of the marine mammals in captivity, not just in Ontario but around the world. There are very large, mobile and social mammals. These unique features led our government to determine that their well-being in captivity would be especially difficult to ensure, and so we would end this practice in Ontario. Our government feels strongly that it is difficult to develop a suitable habitat for an animal of that magnitude.", "If this bill is passed, any facility that possesses an orca after the introduction of the bill would be responsible for the removal of that animal within six months after royal assent. This is about making sure all marine mammals in captivity have the best standards of care and protections possible. These enhanced standards will help give the public confidence that these magnificent creatures are being properly cared for and protected.", "Mr. Speaker, it was a pleasure to speak on this important bill and I look forward to further debate." ],

I remember on one Halloween my son came home with two goldfish. I said, “Where did you that goldfish? How could it be that you knocked on a door and somebody gave you goldfish?” He said, “No, Ma, we went to the pet store at the corner and this is what I got for trick-or-treat.” We were now the owners of two goldfish and we had to provide for a good-sized aquarium. It was difficult to take care of two goldfish. Imagine how difficult it can be for orcas kept in captivity.", "I can just imagine the difficulty that larger marine animals, and mammals in this case, can pose. As we know and we’ve heard this afternoon, orcas are extraordinarily complex and exceptionally large animals. I think that enacting a ban on the breeding and acquisition of orcas in Ontario is the right thing to do. Our government feels strongly that it is difficult to develop a suitable habitat for an animal of that size, and I think that all the members here are in agreement. That’s why we have moved forward with this decision to prohibit the future acquisition and breeding of orcas in Ontario. They are magnificent creatures, as we have heard.", "I want to point out that this bill, in addition, would create a framework to establish animal welfare committees, as recommended by the report. These committees would ensure that the planning, protection and oversight for the animals’ care would take place.", "Our government is trying to implement and put in place the strongest possible standards of care and protection for marine mammals in captivity here in Ontario and the strongest standards in all of Canada, and I agree with that.", "It has been a pleasure to speak to this bill. I hope that we will see it going forward as soon as possible. We’ll see it get to committee and then come back for third reading to have speedy approval." ],

It was basically a home and cottage show. Not one person mentioned Bill 80 to me or the fact that there shouldn’t be orcas at Marineland or any location in Ontario. What they did tell me about, though—I ran into a few people who were from the farming community, agricultural stakeholders—is that they’re very concerned about the coyotes. We’ve had a number of cases of coyote kills. There’s a growing population. In fact, the large coyotes are moving down from the north, about 120-pound coyotes. What they’re basically doing today to sheep and small cattle is they’re actually eating them alive. They take the back end off of the cow and they leave the cow still breathing with no rear end on it. We’ve asked over and over again at MNR, at the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, and you might as well talk to someone on Mars, because no one listens.", "The reality is, this is what this government is doing.

You could go down to the bay and you could see the beluga whales that had been harvested.

On a really foggy day, you’re out there trying to catch a cod and all of a sudden there’s the majesty of a whale breaching along the boat: small boat, big whale. It’s a lot of fun. Your heart sort of goes pitter-patter, pitter-patter. But you cannot believe the sense of wonder that one gets when you’re that close to a whale in the wild, and that is something special.", "I’ve also visited British Columbia, been out in a small fishing boat and seen the orcas jump that day. I also saw an eagle come down and try to take home a harbour seal. It had the seal in its claws about two feet out of the water before it was just too heavy and the eagle had to let it go. I said to my buddy, “Imagine going home tonight and the wife says, ‘How was your day, dear?’ and the seal says, ‘I don’t know, but I’ve got a splitting headache. I can’t understand it.’”", "It’s just one of those things. When you see an eagle pick up a seal in the wild, or you see a whale breach in the wild, it’s something special." ],

Marineland, I think, has been doing an absolutely fabulous job of educating youth for quite some time about marine mammals. But one thing that I want to talk about today is, if this is one of the primary justifications, and the goal is to study marine mammal behaviour—whether it’s breeding patterns or whether it’s their social skills—how normal are those skills, those little pieces of evidence, going to be if the mammals are kept in aquariums? It’s just not going to be their natural habitat, and they will not be behaving in a normal fashion.", "I would personally like to see that we use modern technology to bring the educational aspects of our marine mammals to our youth, and perhaps Marineland can think about doing something like that in the future, and still be a centre for education on marine life.", "I’m very, very pleased and proud that we are following through on our commitment to enhance animal welfare for all animals, especially marine animals.

And it must not go beyond that.”", "I just don’t think that we have the knowledge, the skills here in this Legislature to say that the OSPCA has an expert within their organization who can understand and appreciate and direct marine animals. We have one marine animal in the province of Ontario. How could we possibly have enough experts in the province of Ontario to give us the instruction and the direction that we need?", "So do I have the issues with Bill 80?

But let’s not forget how important a piece of legislation this is. Notwithstanding the comments of the member from Dufferin–Caledon, this is not about one whale; this is about a whole bunch of regulations around not just that animal for the rest of its natural life, but all the other animals in the care of marine facilities in Ontario that are currently existing or will in the future exist.

The purpose of the act, as stated in the Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act: “The object of the society”—meaning the OSPCA—“is to facilitate and provide for the prevention of cruelty to animals and their protection and relief therefrom.”", "The OSPCA is a charitable organization that provides sheltering services for animals and has enforcement powers under the OSPCA Act. These powers include entering onto private property without a warrant, demanding the production of records and things, issuing orders, seizing animals, charging owners for the boarding, treatment and care of seized animals, destroying animals, and laying charges for provincial offences or under the Criminal Code of Canada.", "The OSPCA and its affiliates have acquired these powers without being subject to any associated accountability or oversight. Given human nature, the combination of the lack of oversight and accountability of the OSPCA and the inherent conflict of interest of a private organization running both a private charity and a de facto private police force, it is not surprising that serious abuses of power and authority have developed at the OSPCA. The necessity to raise money to pay for enforcers’ salaries has resulted in orders being written and animals being seized for the purpose of fundraising.", "So serious, in fact, are the reported abuses that Carl Noble, a former OSPCA director and member of the inspection/enforcement committee and a former mayor of South Bruce Peninsula, was one of the 29 directors who resigned en masse in 2006 in protest over the change in attitude of the OSPCA toward very aggressive enforcement. Carl and his 28 colleagues wrote letters to the Minister of Correctional Services expressing their strong concern over the aggressive actions of OSPCA inspectors and calling for government to create oversight and accountability of OSPCA enforcement.", "Here is what he had to say in July 2008: “The reason I resigned from the OSPCA board was because of deficit budgeting and the fact that they took a 180-degree turn in training and appointment of investigators. The newly appointed chief investigator was of the opinion that if you were charged by the OSPCA, you were guilty until proven innocent, and this went directly against my grain.... What really upset me was the fact that they suggested bullet-proof vests, nightsticks and handcuffs.” Carl said, “I was of the opinion they should be taught some people skills.”", "Carl felt so strongly about this issue that he made a deputation on Bill 50 to the standing committee. From Hansard, I quote, “We need accountability for and to the people of Ontario.”" ],

The Ontario government should consider legislative amendments to provide for oversight of the OSPCA in order to remedy the current situation of having the OSPCA essentially policing itself.”", "Yet to date, nothing has been done.", "In Saskatchewan, the Saskatchewan provincial government withdrew all funding from the Saskatchewan Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in the fall of 2014, which resulted in the Saskatchewan Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals being disbanded. The reason that the Saskatchewan provincial government withdrew funding was the very aggressive abuse of enforcement powers to write unfounded orders, and the wrongful seizure of horses from a farmer.", "The farmer has charged the Saskatchewan Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals with theft.

The Lanark Animal Welfare Society was an affiliate of the OSPCA. They sent a young woman named Melanie Young for OSPCA training to be an inspector. The Lanark Animal Welfare Society was very proud of Melanie, because she had a strong sense of compassion for animals and also a healthy respect for the rights of people.

The conflict of interest inherent in the private funding/private policing model was one of the main issues facing Justice A. Zuraw of the Ontario Court of Justice in the case of the crown versus Pauliuk, decided in 2005. Pauliuk involved the alleged mistreatment of 10 horses seized from her small farm by the Hamilton/Burlington Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.", "At trial, the defence argued that the society’s investigation was publicity-driven, financially motivated and dependent on the evidence of witnesses with financial interests. Indeed, the evidence presented to the court revealed these points:", "The society had issued flowery press releases while the horses were in its custody. These included appeals for money, and stated that the society would be required to pay for all the expenses arising from the seizure and ongoing care of the animals.", "The society’s inspector delayed laying charges for almost six months after the horses had been seized.", "Dr. Mogavero, the veterinarian who signed the certificate authorizing the society to seize the horses, was also a member of the society’s board of directors. His duties as a board member included fundraising.", "Dr. Mogavero was on retainer with the society in his capacity as a veterinarian. His usual practice was to give the society a deep discount. In this case, however, he charged over $6,000 for his services, for which he was paid in full.", "In addressing the issue of the neutrality and fair-mindedness of the investigators, Judge Zuraw made the following observations about the society’s operations:", "“It hires its own agents and inspectors, determines the parameters of their employment, and using aforementioned police powers, enters property, seizes animals as in this case (without warrant or judicial intervention) and lays charges—all the while attending to its own need to fundraise. In order to do the latter, it relies heavily on the publicity it can glean from high-profile seizures and charges. Indeed, there is a communications branch tasked with this. It is a not-for-profit organization and a registered charity. Without publicity and high-profile charges, the funds the society for the prevention of cruelty to animals needs to operate would no doubt dry up.", "“It goes without saying that a strong and active enforcement of animal cruelty laws must be maintained. But I would be naïve to suggest that the current set-up could not foster the perception in reasonable, open-minded people, that bias may exist and that conflicts will result. However trite it may be, it is still true that ‘Justice must not only be done, it must be seen to be done.’ It is unfortunate, for example, that Dr. Mogavero, a highly qualified and well-respected professional, was placed in the position he was in this case. He directed the operation of the society, he earned money from the society, he helped fundraise for the society, he was concerned for the budgetary needs of the society, he took part in the investigation, made the decision to seize the horses, made the decision to board and care for the horses, and profited from so doing.”", "Judge Zuraw concluded that the perception of bias arising from these facts was fatal to the prosecution’s case and dismissed the charges against the farm owner, Mrs. Pauliuk, who suffered a great deal of worry, stress, and financial loss, not to mention her horses.", "Marineland is a responsible caretaker of their zoo. It is regularly inspected and is good to their animals. Animal rights activists infiltrated the staff and made unfounded reports about Kiska, the orca whale. The banning of the possession of orca whales in the future is an unfounded attack on Marineland. By extension, this is an attack against all zoos across Ontario.", "Marineland is a significant employer in the Niagara area. Kiska is the main attraction. This bill is the result of the infiltration of Marineland and the OSPCA by animal rights extremists and will create unnecessary hardship for Marineland.", "There are numerous other stories of abuse and maltreatment by the OSPCA, but I only have time to highlight three today to make the point that the OSPCA is out of control and needs to be reined in.", "John Nyenhuis is a farmer. One summer, John Nyenhuis of Sebringville, a hog farmer, had five pigs with belly button hernias, which is a common problem in pigs, pigs which were otherwise in excellent condition and safe to eat. He called Ontario Pork, his organization, to ask their advice on how to handle the hogs in the most humane way and was advised to put the pigs on a separate small truck and take them to a local small slaughterhouse.", "He loaded them up and took them to slaughter for his own family’s consumption. Upon arriving at the local slaughterhouse, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs inspectors had a look at the pigs. The CFIA inspector viewed the pigs to be in good condition, but the OMAFRA inspector felt the pigs were suffering, so he killed the pigs on the spot with a hammer and sent pictures of the bloody scene to the OSPCA and the OMAFRA veterinarian. The OSPCA charged Nyenhuis with animal abuse. He went to court. He pleaded guilty and paid a $750 fine, and he paid his lawyer.", "John transported his pigs in a proper and humane way and is one of the best hog farmers in Ontario. His veterinarian said that John runs a very well managed farm and had done everything he should to be humane to the pigs.", "Gianna Tramontin, a teacher, lived in Etobicoke with her 16-year-old husky dog named Rocky. Rocky had a bed, food and water in the backyard and had been treated for some 14 years for arthritis and various ailments by the same vet, Heather Hannah. One day, while Mrs. Tramontin was at work, the OSPCA seized her dog, Rocky, and left a notice on the door. Upon reading the note when she got home, Mrs. Tramontin phoned the OSPCA, who told her that Rocky was being treated, but that was not true. Without telling Mrs. Tramontin, Rocky had been euthanized the same day by the OSPCA.", "Sunny Reuter boarded her dog, Arko, in a kennel while she and her daughter went on vacation. Arco was a Turkish Akbash, a rare breed of dog that is fine-boned and slim-bodied. The OSPCA mistakenly thought Arko was a Great Pyrenees dog, a much heavier bodied breed, assumed he was emaciated, and had him euthanized mere hours before Sunny returned home. Even though they had her phone number, the OSPCA did not bother to call Sunny’s sister prior to killing the dog. Upon being informed of their mistake, the OSPCA responded and threatened Sunny with criminal charges. Only after Sunny was able to produce a veterinarian’s report verifying Arko’s good health prior to boarding him were the charges withdrawn.", "In conclusion, I would say I could go on for hours telling stories of the OSPCA misdeeds, so numerous are the accounts. The OSPCA cares not for the truth, nor for the people and the families that they terrorize—and yes, I mean terrorize. Often people decide to give up their livelihoods rather than fight the OSPCA and potentially lose everything. The people that do decide to fight, and even those that don’t, often suffer severe consequences to their health and well-being.", "The examples I have shared with you today are not isolated incidents, but highlight a pattern of totalitarian behaviour that has, sadly, become entrenched in the organization, as the bullies never suffer consequences for their abusive behaviour.", "When organizations are allowed to make up their own rules and are given expansive policing powers, it inevitably leads to abuse. This is not the only abusive organization empowered by this government, but it is one of the worst. Prior to giving the OSPCA further powers, the provincial government needs to clean up the mess it has created and restore sanity to the system, not reward the bullies." ],

Maybe that was before Kiska, or someone else was entertaining the troops.", "When I go to Florida, Fort Myers Beach, when you’re walking down the beach you look out and you hope to see a dolphin, just to watch the dolphins in their feeding run just off the beach. Sometimes you see three or four of them really close to shore, and it makes the day. Kids get a big kick out of it. Sometimes when you’re down there you go up to Manatee Park and look at the manatees—not as exciting, but still a wonderful creature.", "When you think about the orca, and I’m reminded of when I was a city councillor for seven years—orcas being black and white, and skunks being black and white. We had an issue one time dealing with whether we should kill skunks or not. I have never received more emails than kill-don’t kill skunks. PETA picked it up and put it around the world. I had more emails from California than I did from Windsor on the killing of skunks. I have not had one email or conversation about Bill 80, the OSPCA amendments.", "It just shows you the public’s imagination. You can latch on to something and it blossoms up into something really big and controversial, or you have this other piece of legislation that we get fixated on for a while here but I’m not sure, out in the general public, it’s really capturing their imagination. I bet you if you bring in a bill that says we’re going to kill skunks, you’ll get a lot more attention." ],

In fact, everyone who has spoken so far agrees. In fact, all his colleagues who have spoken agree. So I really had difficulty trying to follow his direction—where we’re going to go and what we’re going to do—but I hope that, through all of this, we will send this bill to committee, the bill will come back here, and hopefully we will adopt it, and these marine mammals will not be brought into what I would say is storage in the future. The one that we have today, I think all of us would agree, you don’t want to take it back and put it in the wild, because it’s been out of the wild for so long. It makes absolutely no sense." ],

In spite of comments from the government side, this legislation is all about the Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

I know people like to talk about killer whales and other marine mammals, but the legislation itself is designed to affect the original Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act. In fact, Bill 80 is titled the Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Amendment Act, 2015. It’s perhaps passing strange that the government is not talking about the OSPCA.", "We know that the minister will be given, in the future, undefined or unexplained regulatory powers. As the member for Carleton–Mississippi Mills has indicated, it’s obvious that we do need more powers in the hands of the minister to have more oversight over the OSPCA and to hold this organization more accountable.", "We do know that, for example, OSPCA inspectors would be able to demand production of records. They don’t need to go on-site to do an inspection—maybe that’s a good thing, maybe that’s a bad thing.

I have a really good relationship with our local OSPCA. My wife had an antiques store across the street from our dairy farm and she had a horse, and the horse was lying flat out in the field. The OSPCA inspector came to the store and saw the horse lying flat out in the field, and she right away wanted to know who owned the farm, because obviously this horse was distressed. It was a bright, sunny day; this horse was distressed. My wife walked out onto the porch, she yelled, “Hey, Velvet!”, and the horse got up. We came and fed the horse, and everything was fine.

So I would suggest in committee that we make that amendment to the bill, that we add a whale.", "It’s unfortunate that the real amendment that should happen to the OSPCA Act is—like a private member’s bill I had three years ago when I first got here to Queen’s Park, which would have provided oversight and accountability over this private police force. It is absolutely a wrongful thing that you would have in place within a private charity people with, effectively, police powers, yet they must do fundraising through their charity to pay their way. Clearly, that is a conflict. We would never have a policeman writing speeding tickets so he can pay his own wages.

Of course, we do believe in good governance, and that is part of this piece of legislation, which is good.

This legislation, obviously, would also amend the Animals for Research Act, which would allow the OSPCA greater oversight over the conditions for large marine animals used in research.", "I think, once again, that when we have debates in this place you can see how differently we see these issues. The previous member, who was really focused on the OSPCA and thinks that perhaps getting another whale and putting another whale in captivity is going to rectify the situation, is clearly not where we are, nor would it be, in my estimation, very ethical.", "The amended act also would provide for the setting of regulations around the keeping, care and use of other marine mammals such as walruses and dolphins. So this isn’t really just about one whale; this is about shifting a whole culture around mammals and animals in captivity and creating some better oversight around the research and the experimentation, which is becoming more and more political. It’s just not very open. There isn’t a big pool, and people don’t pay a lot of money to come in and watch the animals. The research piece is very, very key.", "The expected regulations governing the existing captivity of large marine mammals—specifically this one mammal, Kiska, the only killer orca in captivity in the province—will increase the size of enclosures and limit sound exposure for the animals. We’ve already heard several members discuss some of those issues.", "What I would really like to do, though, Mr. Speaker, is to focus more broadly on the context of this debate around the interactions of humans and whales, because there’s a reason why this piece of legislation is here, and it does intersect with the way that humans see whales and the way that humans crave knowledge about whales. I think, actually, it goes back in a very true sense to our own curiosity about nature and, obviously, points to our disconnection from nature. We are living, more and more, very isolated lives, very focused on technology. We crave those experiences, but we try to get them through technology. So there is this inherent curiosity that we have, as human beings, to better understand nature. The problem is that when we interject into the process of nature, often humans mess it up pretty good, and I think we have a lot of instances of that over history, not just in Ontario but of course the world.", "I think curiosity has drawn us to this issue, but the issue of whales in captivity, particularly orca whales, has been the subject of much public discussion and debate, actually, not just in Ontario but throughout North America, especially since the release of the documentary called Blackfish, which came out in 2013. Since then, as marine mammal theme parks increased in popularity throughout the world, there have been many examples that have demonstrated the controversy around orcas in captivity. Some members have already mentioned some of them, but you do have Wanda, the first orca in captivity, who died after one day. You have, of course, Keiko, who is the subject of Free Willy, who died after being returned to the wild. Ironically, just to make my point about how humans truly can mess up nature, in this instance humans were trying to teach a whale how to be a whale. It’s ridiculous; there’s no other word for it. Their intentions were good, but you can’t unlearn what you’ve already learned, and certainly humans haven’t gotten the point.", "I see that the minister of curmudgeonry is actually leaving the building, which is probably not a bad thing right now.", "Springer was the third whale and first orca returned to the wild successfully, so it can be done. Luna, another orca, returned to the wild and died.", "The issues and the popularity around these theme parks have existed almost since the day the first orca was captured and displayed in Newport Harbor in California in 1961. So this is a long-standing issue, right? The debate on whether that was a good idea for people or for whales began the next day but didn’t really heat up until the 1970s. This came from the opposition to whaling, the whaling industry that had been a key part of the formation, of course, of Greenpeace and the environmental social movement; it also drove people to think about whales in captivity. You saw the slaughter of millions of whales. In fact, a report just came out, March 11, 2015, that’s finally done a tally, and it’s a sad stat to read into Hansard, but I think it’s probably worth it.", "The commercial hunting wiped out almost three million animals last century—three million. Blue whales, in particular, have been depleted by 90%, and these populations are slow to recover. People are so curious about them and want the knowledge, but these industries have been able to carry on as if these populations are not at risk.", "Clearly, there’s cause for concern around whale populations, and then there is this counterpoint of whales in captivity, which of course has been generated and increased in popularity because of people’s curiosity. But the debate on whales in captivity raged mostly on the fringe for the next 25 years. It picked up steam in the mid-1990s with the release of the film Free Willy—it’s already been mentioned—and the attempt to rehabilitate the orca star. We can go through the story of Keiko, the story of Springer and the story of Luna.", "The story of Luna—actually I did watch this documentary. I caught it one day I was home. I watched the documentary; actually, my friend from Cape Breton was one of the film directors, documentarian Suzanne Chisholm. It was a heart-breaking documentary to watch because you want that happy ending, and yet there were so many forces at play in the story of Luna, the orphaned whale who was friendly with the Nootka Sound First Nations population. Then the government of Canada tried to capture Luna to reunite it with its pod, but the First Nations of course felt a stronger connection to the whale—it’s actually hard to imagine the government of Canada having a connection with almost anything right now, particularly—and the plan to gradually lead the whale back into the ocean to reunite with the pod came of course to a tragic ending. I think we all know how this ends. Once again, human intervention led to needless suffering and the death of that whale.", "It’s easy to look at marine mammal parks as either worthwhile attractions that can help educate people about whales or as man-made animal prisons that exist to use the animals until they die prematurely. People are usually very strongly in either camp. People aren’t usually in the middle, on the fence. They feel very strongly about that, and probably that’s one of the motivations as to how this piece of legislation, Bill 80, came to this floor.", "While we did hunt whales to near extinction in the 20th century, an international moratorium on whale hunting was agreed to in 1986. Actually, I remember this. This was part of the curriculum at the time because I was still in high school in 1986. Only a few remaining countries—Japan, Iceland and Norway—continue to have whaling industries, and even those face intense scrutiny for their use around legal loopholes to get around the moratorium.", "While we once trapped whales en masse for our marine mammal parks, whales are no longer trapped and the viability of keeping them in captivity continues to be debated, the outcome being the improvement of conditions for captive whales.", "As we collectively continue to grapple with humanity’s role, if you will, on this planet and place in the hierarchy of species, we must ask ourselves constantly: Is this action making the planet better? This leads usually to a fairly strong ethical debate.", "I was reading one paper on—this is why this job is so great: You just never know what you’re going to be reading in the course of a day. I was reading The Ethics of Keeping Whales and Dolphins Captive. It’s from chapter 13 of the Performing Orca–Why the Show Must Stop. The author is Erich Hoyt, and he had some really interesting things to say about the ethics of this issue. One of my former research positions was in ethics.

Adult females are easily distinguished from adult males by their dorsal fins....", "“‘Residents travel in matri-focal units called matrilineal groups.’” These groups usually consist of a reproductive female and her dependent calves and juveniles and adolescents. The boys don’t leave. They don’t leave until they get set up by the mum. That’s why they’re called momma’s boys. There’s actually a section here: “‘The outstanding feature’ of resident orca society is that neither sex wanders from the natal family and its home range.... The lifelong bonds between resident mothers and sons run deep.”", "When you think about these animals in that context, it’s hard to imagine them living in isolation in a tank and having people stare at them. Over the years we’ve seen animals in captivity, and I think instinctively we recognize that there’s something fundamentally wrong about it. So of course we’re supportive of a piece of legislation which brings in some stronger oversight. I think oversight always has to be—there have to be measures of control and quality in that oversight. Even Marineland has publicly accepted and welcomed the introduction of Bill 80, saying that they meet or exceed the Canadian Council on Animal Care guidelines. If that’s what they say, then there’s going to be some oversight. I think this can be done in a balanced and measured way.", "For myself, though, I’m one of those people who would prefer to be out in nature, even though I grew up in the inner city.

One of his jobs was to transport the animals from Springwater park to the sportsmen’s show and to the Royal Winter Fair. Well, I was very fortunate that I got to go with my dad when he did that. When I look back on it now, it was very exciting for me.", "Now, wolves at that time were not considered a positive animal. As you know, they were vilified. We know now how important they are and what magnificent creatures they are. I loved to go with my dad, but Jack the wolf was more like Jack the puppy dog. Basically, his spirit was broken. When I look back now and think about it, he was being fed lots, and he was being well cared for, but you could tell that his spirit was gone. He no longer was that beautiful beast that was able to roam free all over the woods.", "I think it’s very important that we make sure that the animals stay where they should in the environment where they are the healthiest and where there’s a circle of life, and that as much as possible we don’t interfere with that circle of life.", "I urge everyone to get this bill to the committee, and let’s get this passed and set in motion." ],

We have not yet had the opportunity, for example—and I know it has been discussed a lot this afternoon—to make the trek down to Marineland to see what that wonderful institution, that wonderful facility or theme park, has to offer.", "I know that whenever we have had the opportunity to visit the Toronto zoo and other venues like that, there’s a great deal of very genuine excitement, not surprisingly, not just on the part of my own kids but on the part of myself and my wife and others who travel to those venues.", "I believe it was the member from Ottawa South, earlier this afternoon, who referenced his own daughter, Kirsten, who he had made a commitment to a number of years ago in terms of getting out to Marineland, and he reiterated that commitment right here in the chamber this afternoon. It’s something that I definitely look forward to having the chance to do with my own daughters.", "A number of others who have spoken today have talked about some of the specifics of the bill. I’ve learned a lot today about not only the bill itself but about what we are talking about with respect to the orcas. It’s fascinating information. The member from Ottawa–Orléans just went through a series of fascinating facts and points about these particular mammals. It’s not something that I think a lot of people out there would understand. I don’t want to repeat the entire list that was provided. We certainly have heard about the abilities that orcas have to typically dive 500 feet or more, for example. They can swim up to 100 miles per day. I heard these facts and figures, and they actually are not just interesting; I think they really and truly are fascinating.", "When we have this opportunity to pass legislation in this House on a regular basis, sometimes we deal—certainly, in my own portfolio, we deal with a lot of what I’ll call hard infrastructure issues. This is a matter, this is an issue, this is legislation that has really and truly struck a fascinating chord amongst the public. We’ve heard this afternoon that there has already been extensive debate on this. I know there will continue to be debate today. My colleague the Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs will speak momentarily.", "I think it definitely is legislation that deserves continued support from all members of all three caucuses here in the Legislature. I look forward to this bill passing at second reading, getting to committee for additional hearings and analysis and research that may need to be done, coming back here for third reading, for more debate and for eventual support.", "Again, both the current and former ministers responsible for this particular issue, and the Premier herself, deserve a lot of credit for showing this kind of leadership.

They used to bring them from around the country to go to Florida for their annual meeting, which was great. They’d go to Orlando or Clearwater for their annual meeting.", "The late Ross Dobbin was down there for that meeting. The gift that he got from the North American water works association was an alligator. So Ross has this alligator delivered from Orlando back to the city of Peterborough. Ross and his colleagues at the Peterborough Utilities service said, “What are we going to do with an alligator?” You know, you’ve got to provide a habitat for it and look after it and all that kind of thing. So it was his brain child, after consulting with the community, that we establish a zoo. The very first animal in that zoo in Peterborough was this wonderful alligator that came from Orlando, Florida. That was the starting point of a zoo in Peterborough.", "Over the years, I know my friend from Kitchener–Waterloo, who knows Peterborough extremely well—the Riverview Park and Zoo is on a beautiful location: Water Street North, on your way to Trent University, right on the Otanabee River.

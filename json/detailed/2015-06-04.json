  "text" : [ "As always, it’s an honour to stand in this House and represent the views of the folks back home in Timiskaming–Cochrane and of my NDP caucus members. Today I’m going to focus on the role of agriculture with Bill 66, An Act to protect and restore the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin; en français, Loi visant la protection et le rétablissement du bassin des Grands Lacs et du fleuve Saint-Laurent.", "With the title of the act, the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence basin, people immediately think of the shoreline of the Great Lakes. As was mentioned yesterday by the member from Essex, we have the longest shoreline on the Great Lakes of all the jurisdictions around it. So we have a big responsibility. There’s no question about that: We have a big responsibility.", "The Great Lakes also hold 20% of the world’s fresh water. So, again, we have a great responsibility. I don’t think anyone is denying that we have a great responsibility, along with the other jurisdictions that surround the Great Lakes. There are millions of people who live around the Great Lakes who depend on the Great Lakes.", "It’s been a very interesting debate. I’ve heard other speakers say that we are doing better or we are doing worse than other jurisdictions, and while it’s valuable to look at what other jurisdictions are doing—it’s very valuable—we have to look at what we can do, not what others are doing.", "But where we have to be cognizant of what others are doing is when we look at the industries that surround the Great Lakes. One of those industries is agriculture. And one fact that’s come up over and over and over—and it’s a very interesting fact, and I think a lot of farmers in the province might not know this, but 95% of the agricultural land in Ontario is within the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence basin—95%, virtually all. So this act impacts virtually all the farmland in Ontario. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, but it’s a fact.", "I’d like to be very clear with this bill: We support the principle of this bill. This bill might be a very good piece of legislation, it might just be a press release, or it might be a very detrimental piece of legislation for the agriculture sector and it might not protect the environment. It all depends on how it’s interpreted by this government, when passed, and by future governments. Speaker, the devil is always in the details, and as with many bills, this bill is kind of lacking in the details.", "There seems to be a perceived conflict between the agricultural community and the environmental community, and I’d like to set the record straight. Farmers are environmentalists. Farmers are true environmentalists because we have to deal with the environment every day. We live with the environment because we make our living within the environment. The environment to us isn’t a talking point or a way to raise money or an abstract thing that we talk about. We deal with it every day. I think that perhaps gives farmers a different outlook than others. That’s why we look at this bill a bit more critically than others. We appreciate that we need to work together to protect the Great Lakes. And the agricultural community is a bit—I’m trying to find the right word—concerned that it’s to “restore the Great Lakes,” because farmers across this province have already made huge strides, as have other industries across the province.", "I’m very familiar, Speaker, with what has happened across this province over the years regarding agriculture. I remember when I started farming. It was very common to see manure runoff running off into gullies. That was common; it happened on my farm, Speaker, when I bought my farm. Over the years, we’ve changed that. We’ve changed that with the help of various levels of government and various governments. We’ve changed that.", "On our former farm—sold it two years ago—no runoff leaves that farm. They have 300-day storage, and that’s very important. It might not be a big deal for lay people, but you have to have enough storage, when you have livestock, so you can store the effluent—the manure from the livestock—so that you can spread it on your fields when it makes the most sense for the environment and when it makes the most sense for the farmer. Manure is a fertilizer, and it doesn’t make any sense for a farmer to waste it. That’s why we’ve made huge strides in controlling that. As with any substance, it’s a good thing, but if there’s too much of it, it’s a pollutant; that’s the way life works. We’ve made huge strides with that.", "Another area that I know from my dairy farming past: A lot of dairy farms in the past used a lot of soap. If there’s one thing about dairy farming, you have to clean your equipment if you milk two times a day—some milk three times a day, and now, with robot milkers, you milk all day. You have to wash all the time. That equipment has to be as clean as any equipment in any commercial kitchen, because we’re producing food. But a by-product of that is that you use a lot of soap. Soap has a lot of phosphorus. In years gone by, some of that phosphorus used to go right into the ditch. That doesn’t happen anymore. That’s been stopped.", "We’ve had lots of experiments on how to make that work. I know that on our own farm, we had a septic system. Standard septic systems do not work for milk house runoff. They don’t work. We tried that; it failed. Every farm has a different system. On our farm, it went into the same storage where the manure went, because phosphorus, if it’s not over-applied, is actually a benefit to us all. It’s when it’s over-applied or used incorrectly that it becomes a pollutant—a very serious pollutant.", "We’ve done a lot of those things over the years.", "Another one I did on my farm was grassed waterways, through the Environmental Farm Plan—a great program, actually, that’s been cut back severely. One way to stop pollutants from getting into surface water, and eventually into the Great Lakes basin, is to make sure, when you’re doing things on the field, that you stay far enough away not only from rivers and streams but creeks and ditches. One way we’ve done that is grassed waterways. Instead of plowing or chisel plowing right up to the ditch, you leave X number of feet or metres, and that, in normal conditions, stops soil that contains phosphorus and nitrogen from going into the river.", "We have made great strides. Farmers are environmentalists. But the difference is that farmers also have to make a living. We have to identify problems, but we also have to provide answers. It’s not enough to just say, “Well, we have to stop doing this and this and this, and if you don’t, we’re going to fine you.” That’s basically all we read in this bill. We don’t see solutions. Hopefully, those solutions are going to come later on when the guardians’ council and all these things get fired up.", "The more discussion we have, the better. I’m not sure that I would agree with some of the members of the Conservative Party who are worried about regulation on top of regulation. But, again, good regulation is a good thing. It’s a benefit to society. Regulation for the sake of regulation is a detriment to us all. Farmers are no strangers to regulation. As farms get bigger, we are subject to more and more regulation, which in itself isn’t necessarily a bad thing.", "Again, under the Nutrient Management Act, farmers are subject to a lot of regulation. Depending on how many animals you have, you have to have enough land to make sure you can use manure as a benefit to your crops but not a detriment to the environment. You have to have enough land. You have to have enough storage. Those are all regulations you have to comply with. I’ve had people in my riding who have built barns in the last little while and were shocked at the amount of regulation they had to go through to get planning for that barn, to get approval. That’s very frustrating for the individual farmer. We could maybe make it a bit less cumbersome; but the regulation itself isn’t a bad thing, because it protects society.", "What we’re worried about with Bill 66 is that all the regulations that currently exist—the Nutrient Management Act, the Conservation Authorities Act; I believe there are 20 other ones. When you read this bill, it looks like this bill would supersede all those regulations. That’s a problem. Because this act covers such a large area, geographically, the central planning idea, where it supersedes local planning, is a problem.", "An example of that is the Green Energy Act. How could you screw up green energy? How you screw up green energy is by having the Green Energy Act supersede everything else. It’s easier to build a solar farm on agricultural land in my riding than it is to build a farm building. That’s wrong. That’s where the Green Energy Act went wrong. This act has the danger—and I’m not saying it’s going to, but the danger is there." ],

This government says that northern Ontario is the future of agriculture. My riding has the best agricultural land in northern Ontario and there are solar farms going all over on the best land in northern Ontario. So to stay that this government is interested in agriculture in northern Ontario—based on that, it’s a farce. That’s the truth. And that’s an example.", "We are trying to make this act the best we can. We’re not trying to make political speak or anything on this. We’re trying to make this the best it can be, and there are problems. Again, we agree with the principle, but the fact that it could supersede everything is a problem. We see in this act there’s a whole schedule for the amount of fines that could be levied, but we don’t see anything in the act where, “Here is where society is going to help the various industries impacted and here’s how they’re going to help.” We don’t see anything in the act like that, and that’s a problem.", "Because all the advances we’ve made—we’ve made a lot of advances for ourselves, as all industry does. Farmers are out to make a living, but farmers are also out to protect the environment because every farmer wants—unfortunately, I didn’t have that chance—to turn their farm over to their kids. The only way the kids are going to be successful is if the farmer has protected the growing capacity of his or her farm. And the only way you can do that is to be a good environmental steward. But when society wants to provide a better level of protection—which is society’s choice; we agree—society, as a whole, also has to help provide the solutions.", "When we were looking at putting grass waterways, when we were looking at going to conservation tillage, through the Environmental Farm Plan, the government, society—was a partner. Now, would we have done the same things without? Yes, but it would have taken long. So society decided that we want to fix any problems that exist as quickly as possible. Great. Then society also has a responsibility not just to say, “You have to do this and you have to do this,” but also has a responsibility to say, “You know, as a whole, we want to protect the environment.” Quite frankly, farmland—we’re the last ones, because once you’ve built houses and cities, to talk about protecting the environment—I’m sorry; it’s just a moot point. That’s a moot point.", "To expect the 3% of the population who are still farming the land to do all the things to protect what society hasn’t paved over yet, to expect them to bear the full cost—that’s ridiculous.", "But we don’t see that in this act and we’re a bit worried, because our last experience—and this a very touchy subject—the neonic experience—society decided, through the government, that we were going to cut a certain usage of a pesticide. We’re not opposed to that, but when the Ministry of the Environment asked for their input, they posted on the EBR during planting season, the busiest time of the year; the Minister of the Environment knew that.", "That’s an example of why, based on our past experience, the agricultural community questions whether the MOE really understands that to solve an environmental issue, you have to work together with the stakeholders and not just tell them and hope it all fares well, because in the end, that probably won’t help the ministry, and it won’t help the environment either.", "Based on that experience, we’re worried. The farm community is worried about Bill 66 based on the fact that there are no hearings that are going to be held outside of the hallowed skyscrapers of Toronto—because you know what? This bill isn’t going to have much impact on the people who live in the condos that surround this place. It’s not. The people who live in the condos have as much right as anyone to have an opinion on the environment—no question. But, honestly, they’re not going to be impacted. It’s the people who live in the country who are going to be impacted by this bill, and it’s them who are going to have to take the steps to hopefully make this bill work. So they should be fully included in how to make this bill work. Will they always agree? No. But that’s how our democracy is supposed to work.", "It has already been decided we’re not going to have any hearings on this bill, on the passage of this bill, outside of Toronto, but I would deeply suggest to the government that they take the time to actually listen to the agriculture community and to other sectors, because you know what?

You have to look outside of interest groups. Interest groups have their place. They have changed our world for the better, but you have to go beyond them to the people who actually make the daily decisions on the land, in the forest and by the streams. Regulations, rules and laws have to be understood and have to make sense to those people, and if they don’t, ultimately, we have all failed.", "We support this legislation. We support the intent of this legislation, but we urge the government to actually take this legislation seriously. Take it to the people. Make sure that you consult and make sure that you actually come up with solutions, not just regs and then look the other way when they go wrong. Come up with solutions, because solutions can be found, as has been found in agriculture in the past. I’ve focused on agriculture, but there are all kinds of other industries impacted here. I’m ag critic, I’m a farmer; I like to talk about farming." ],

If I think of some of the things that I’ve seen happening in my own area—Guelph is in the Grand River watershed. Guelph is located on the Speed and Eramosa Rivers, which then feed into the Grand River. But one of the other rivers that feed into the Grand River is the Conestogo. The Conestogo River is one of those rivers that seems to meander, very flat, through a plain that’s very prone to erosion, and if you look at the agricultural practices, historically you would find that the cattle were watering in the river, and of course that broke down the banks and you got the runoff and the cattle in the river and the erosion. It was becoming quite a problem. But with the help of the Grand River Conservation Authority working with farmers all along the Conestogo River, they changed their livestock management practices, got the cattle out of the river, and got the banks built up again with natural vegetation along the banks to stop the erosion.", "It’s now a totally different river. It’s now restored to what it would have been more like historically, before people messed it up. It’s a totally different river, and that’s because the farmers all along the river, just as the member said, have changed their practices and have behaved like true environmentalists and restored that river to health.", "Thank you." ],

Over the last 40 years, you see a lot of changes in the way that they work the land. There are a lot of different technologies that have come in that weren’t known, but as soon as a better way comes to do it, you see farmers using it. The no-till methods they use—it’s all about water management and it’s all about tiling and making sure that the land is useful.", "Each summer you go through my riding of Stormont–Dundas–South Glengarry—and our major industry is farming. The vast majority of territory is under crops. It’s either under crops or under bush. It’s something that farmers have always had a lot of care for.", "I think we can look at the farms today and they’re really something to marvel at, because they are a picture of production. They feed a lot more people per acre than they used to. If there hadn’t been the changes that they’ve instituted over the years, a lot of people would be worse off in this world.", "Canada is a major player in feeding a good percentage of the world, and that comes from the farms in Ontario. They’re looking at ways of making even more land available in the North, and the beef farmers are hoping this government will work with them and actually turn over more crown land. As land becomes more and more important and more and more valuable, land is too expensive to graze cattle. So we have to move north, where the climate would work for them. Now it’s land that’s unproductive. It would be a great alternative for those properties." ],

It actually derailed on a bridge over top of a river, so you can imagine what the water looks like.

Three weeks prior to that, on February 14, they had derailed again but that time, away from people and away from the public eye. This time, it was in the village of Gogama, right on the edge. If you drive on Highway 144, you can’t miss it. It looks like a moon landscape. Everything has been taken off. There isn’t a blade of grass, a stem.

It doesn’t help the people of Gogama bring those people to court for what they’ve done to them. They do nothing but pass laws that will hinder our farmers." ],

I’d like to thank Jessica, obviously, for allowing me to speak to the Smart Growth for Our Communities Act for 20 minutes this morning.", "We’ve heard that the proposed legislation considers changes to the Planning Act and the Development Charges Act, to update those acts and reflect the need for improvements to keep up with the evolving needs and issues being faced by municipalities across the province.", "While we on this side of the House are supportive and understand the need for improvement, in many ways Bill 73 is a bit like putting the cart before the horse—if there are any horses left in Ontario, that is. By bringing forth a bill on needed improvements before hearing from all of those directly impacted, that, in effect, puts legislation before consultation. It’s like putting a cake in the oven before you have all the ingredients. In the end, you run the risk of ending up with a result that is only half-baked. Who likes a cake without the ingredients, Speaker?", "Last fall we saw the Premier, in an attempt to instill confidence in her election, boast of transparency and accountability—that she would soon leave at the curb—and publicly release a series of ministers’ mandate letters to direct their actions over the course of this government. The problem is, in many cases, as we’ve seen in the months since, these letters turned out to be little more than a public relations exercise not really worth the paper they’re written on.", "The Minister of Municipal Affairs received one of those mandate letters, Speaker. Do you know what it said? It called on the minister to conduct a full review of the Ontario Municipal Board, yet today we have a bill before us that tables a number of changes to the board before the review is even conducted—cart before the horse, Speaker; perhaps a few ingredients left out of the bowl.", "It begs the question: If you know that you are mandated to conduct a full review of the OMB and you know that the government had only just launched the land use planning review of the greenbelt, the Niagara Escarpment, the Oak Ridges moraine and the growth plan—a review that impacts the Planning Act—then why do you go forward, back in March, to bring this legislation forward before the results of those reviews are in?", "The answer, Speaker, is that in typical Wynne Liberal government fashion, they don’t feel they have to hear the public’s opinions that these reviews elicit because they feel they already know what’s in our best interests. So they speak first, listen later, and then pat us on the head and tell us everything is going to be okay. Well, it’s not all right. There is a need for improvements, and it would have done this government good to listen to what those impacted had to say before moving forward on their own.", "In the case of the planning review of the greenbelt, the Niagara Escarpment and the Oak Ridges moraine, the Wynne Liberals could have benefited from listening to the some 3,000 people who took time to attend those review meetings and air their concerns. Many organizations took the time and effort to put together comprehensive proposals for change to bring consistency to the three plans while protecting our natural heritage, and to ensure the long-term viability of agriculture in the protected areas.", "Now, I do recall the minister coming up to Kitchener–Waterloo and Guelph as well. I know that both were fairly well attended, especially the one in Kitchener–Waterloo. I think that they boasted of the fact that they had more than the folks over in Guelph, and that’s good. It seems, though, that all the time and effort goes for naught when this Wynne Liberal government introduces legislation to make changes to the Planning Act before the work and input is even reviewed. As our critic, who just arrived here moments ago, noted Tuesday, we’re disappointed that the government is making partial changes without taking the time to get it right and without waiting for the results of the review to develop a comprehensive plan.", "All that said, Speaker, the reality is that we do have these proposed partial changes in front of us that require our review today, changes that run the gamut from providing more stability for municipal planning documents and increased municipal accountability, and strengthening the protection of provincial interests, to encouraging more upfront planning and providing enhanced tools at the local level. The bill also proposes to:", "—enhance the Ontario Municipal Board’s obligation to consider citizen input when making decisions:", "—extend municipal official plan update cycles from five years to 10 years, after a new, comprehensive official plan;", "—provide the province with documents earlier to review municipal official plans and official plan amendments, when those documents are not exempt from provincial approval;", "—modify the maximum alternative parkland dedication rate when giving cash in lieu;", "—require municipalities to develop parks plans if they wish to establish the alternative parkland dedication rate and to work with school boards in developing such plans.", "Certainly it’s a whole list of changes, and a list that may have been more comprehensive and effective if only government had waited to listen first before they actually moved.", "But of course we know that the changes to the Planning Act are only half the picture here, as Bill 73 also proposes to bring significant change to the Development Charges Act, 1997. As part of the proposed Bill 73, the government is proposing reforms that would:", "—enhance funding for municipal transit systems;", "—enhance transparency and accountability regarding payment of development charges and additional fees;", "—identify any services which are ineligible for collection of development charges through regulation;", "—require municipalities to examine the application of varying development charges within different areas of a municipality; and", "—enhance municipal development charges reporting requirements.", "As we all know, development charges have always been a delicate balance between encouraging economic activity and ensuring that municipalities have the funds needed to provide services for the added growth. The fact is that while we support funding transit, we have a number of concerns that this act may allow development charges to be increased so much that it slows economic growth.", "We’ve got a very vibrant home-building industry in the region of Waterloo and a strong organization that represents those home builders, the Waterloo Region Home Builders’ Association. I’ve had the pleasure of attending many of their events. Many of the home-building stakeholder groups are very generous in our community, employing thousands of people and building high-quality, affordable homes for families to raise their family in the region of Waterloo.", "I remember hearing some stories on how, years ago, development charges were relatively affordable. Now they’re getting to the point that, as these costs continue to grow, it is a significant percentage of the overall cost of a home. That cost, of course, is passed along to the homeowner. Families are already stretched thin as it is, as prices continue to go up, to have an affordable option to raise their family in an area that they want. Not all families can live in condominiums in the downtown core. They want to raise their children, perhaps, in the suburbs where there’s a bit more space to have their kids play, go to some schools that they so choose.", "We have to realize that these DC charges are a significant concern that goes along with raising development charges—concerns surrounding the fact that a proportion of a home’s cost that goes towards government fees has risen from about 3% in the mid-1980s to almost 25%, or about $100,000 for a $400,000 home. Speaker, that is an awful, large increase.", "One would have to ask if those services that families are funding through DC charges are in fact being put back into the community. Of course, we need our roads, our water infrastructure, our waste water infrastructure. In the south end of Kitchener, where I’m from, we are a small city in essence. I know families are constantly asking for some sort of facility that would have a swimming pool, skating rinks, and they have to drive what they see is a bit far to have to access stuff, and it’s DC charges that assist the municipality in paying for these things.", "We talk about our fair share of those being reinvested back into the community. Speaker, almost all development charges get passed on to homebuyers in the end, jacking up the cost of homes and making it even more difficult for the young family looking for their first home to ever be able to make that purchase.", "This government often perpetuates the illusion that when governments increase fees, charges, taxes and levies, somehow the developer is going to absorb them. As we’ve seen in reality, that is just simply not the case, Speaker. Development charges become part of the cost of a home and are passed on to people purchasing new homes, condos or renting an apartment, and that cost is significant. In fact, in 2009, the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. found that government-imposed charges, including development charges, represented up to 19% of the median price of a single-family new home.", "The Greater Toronto Home Builders’ Association reported that, for a $440,000 home, over $25,000 goes to development charges.", "The Residential and Civil Construction Alliance of Ontario commissioned a report called Alternatives to Development Charges for Growth-Related Capital Costs. They found that development charges are now $30,000 to $50,000 per single-family home in high-growth municipalities surrounding Toronto. By comparison, it found that development fees in Calgary and Edmonton are less than $8,000 per unit. That is a significant difference: $30,000 to $50,000 per single-family home versus $8,000 in Calgary and Edmonton, Alberta.", "This bill, Bill 73, would increase development charges and, therefore, the cost of housing in a number of ways. First, it would remove the 10% discount on transit costs. It would allow development charges to be charged on planned future services instead of historical services. It would remove the list of items that are exempted from development charges from the act and allow the government to choose which to exempt. That means that new homeowners and businesses could now be paying development charges to pay for cultural or entertainment facilities, including museums, theatres and art galleries, or to fund a new city hall or a tourism facility such as a convention centre.", "One of the items that was previously exempt was the provision of waste management services. The government already indicated that under the new regulations, municipalities will now be allowed to have development charges cover the cost of that. In fact, there have already been municipal requests to expand it further and allow development charges on all of the previously exempt items, including cultural, tourism and entertainment facilities.", "Now, Speaker, I want to just go back slightly. We mentioned the fact that one of those items that was previously exempt was the provision of waste management services and that under the new regulations, municipalities will now be allowed to have those development charges cover the cost of that. In the region of Waterloo, there is a significant debate happening right now. In fact, our local councils are making a significant decision that would delay the pickup of garbage from every week to every other week, with a bag limit.", "Some will argue that’s a long time coming. Somebody who has a young family that generates a significant amount of waste from, say, babies’ diapers I think is going to find it difficult for it to happen biweekly. That’s not just me; I have heard from families in my area and seniors who are going to have a difficult time with this.", "Of course, there is a significant cost savings to that, which we all have to be conscious of. I had an email just recently this week that regional government has grown substantially, and one thing that homeowners expect out of services like waste management or picking up the garbage is that they should be looking elsewhere first instead of always reducing the front-line services while continuing to perhaps not always look within first to do so. So now, under this new piece of legislation, DC charges are going to be allowed to include the provision of waste management services." ],

They brought a bill here last session, the Waste Reduction Act. They couldn’t get it right. It was just a colossal failure. Industry groups, stakeholders, even municipalities felt it was extremely flawed. We’ll see what the new minister brings back shortly. It’s an extremely important situation here in the province. Our waste diversion rate is a dismal failure in terms of its percentages. I know I asked the former minister, if he was a teacher, if 40% would be a fail or a pass. Of course, we all know it’s a fail. We’ll see where they go with that.", "I understand why municipalities would want those additional development charges. Many of them are struggling to make ends meet and provide the infrastructure and services that residents want. Part of the problem is a provincial government that is more focused on blaming others than actually taking responsibility for the challenges that municipalities face. This year, spending in the provincial budget actually increased by $2.4 billion, but the Ontario municipal partnership grants that municipalities depend on were being cut again.", "Again, we do understand the needs of our municipalities to fund necessary transit improvements across their areas. Certainly, I can speak to the need in my area of Waterloo region.", "The region of Waterloo submitted their amendments to this bill on March 24, 2015, which I would like to read into the record. But before I do, the request stems from the fact that the province of Ontario gave the region the shaft when it came to light rail transit funding. You see, Speaker, cities like Hamilton, Mississauga and Brampton got 100% funding for their LRT projects, and Waterloo region’s ION got only one third, from the original commitment of two thirds.", "Just last Friday, the member from Kitchener–Waterloo and I, as well as our local colleagues the members from Kitchener Centre and Cambridge, called on the government to ask for transit fairness. The Liberal government continues their carrot-and-stick approach, promising yet never quite delivering on transit commitments to Waterloo region.", "From two-thirds funding for LRT to all-day, two-way GO, the truth has become more obvious with each subsequent transit announcement elsewhere in the province that when it comes to funding Kitchener-Waterloo’s transit pledge, the cupboard is bare. Again, while other municipalities get the gold mine, we get the shaft. With only one-third provincial support while other municipalities get full funding, the region’s submissions to amend Bill 73 stem from the province’s unfair treatment.", "On January 7, 2014, Waterloo region council recommended that the province make changes to the DCA to support the region’s transition to a higher-order light rail transit system, specifically by allowing the use of a 10-year, forward-looking level of service as the baseline for calculating development charges for transit and by eliminating the 10% mandatory discount on development charges to pay for transit infrastructure. Council did pass additional recommendations regarding changes to the DCA consistent with the principle that growth pays for growth. I’ll get into those to finish up my questions and comments." ],

You’ve also shown an interest in a particular piece of heritage in my riding, the Vineland schoolhouse.", "As you know, the original schoolhouse was built in 1895. It’s an extraordinary example of 19th-century architecture. It has been important in the community not just as a school, but a living, so to speak, example of Beamsville brickwork. There’s an awful lot of history packed into that tiny schoolhouse.", "Here’s the problem: 120 years of history is going to come to an end on June 19. That’s when the wrecking ball comes to town and knocks it down.", "Minister, will you use your authority under the Ontario Heritage Act to intervene and save that schoolhouse?" ],

Ontario is home to more than 1.3 million people of Italian heritage, including a few thousand in Kitchener Centre.", "These immigrants began arriving in significant numbers in the early 20th century to work on farms, in factories and mines. But it was after the Second World War that a huge wave swept in from regions with names such as Lazio, Abruzzo, Friuli and Calabria. These war-impoverished immigrants came looking for opportunities and a peaceful place to build a new life.", "Among the hundreds of thousands who poured in were my own parents back in 1957; I just introduced you to them. Newly married and just 23 and 25 years of age, they had about 50 bucks in their pocket, did not speak the language and had little education, but they were ready to work and to contribute.", "Their story is similar to Italian immigrants who worked hard in this country. They bought a house. They raised children. They grew an awesome garden in the backyard which still features a fig tree today. Food, wine and familiar songs are part of what connected them to their beloved Italia, but what distinguishes them as part of the narrative of Ontario’s story today is their unmistakable achievement of helping to build this province." ],

Now, since Bill Pr20 passed this morning—and I’m thankful for the support from all three parties here in the Legislature—they are going to name an airport after her.", "I’ll take you back to that day in 1948. She was 37 years old. On that first flight, the bug bit her. After she went up with her five-year-old son—the next day—without telling her son or her husband, she went back to the airport and took flying lessons. Before you knew it, she was the first woman in Canada to fly in international air races, one of the first Canadian women to hold a commercial air licence, the first Canadian woman to fly a helicopter solo, and the first to hold an airline transport licence. She won a national aviation reporting prize. She blazed trails for women in flight right across Canada and North America.", "That’s not it, by the way. She also was the first female councillor in the town of Pelham. She, with her husband, Charles, ran a car dealership in Welland. She was an equestrian, a musician and an artist. She has published four books.", "Here’s the happy news too: She turned 104 just a couple of weeks ago.", "Dorothy Rungeling, now 104, doesn’t fly quite as much as she used to. But because the bill passed with all-party support, I’m pleased to say that the Niagara Central Airport will now be the Niagara Central Dorothy Rungeling Airport.", "I thank members for their support.

  "text" : [ "It is a pleasure to rise and debate Bill 111, entitled the Ending Predatory Electricity Retailing Act, a bill I am proud to be reintroducing in this Parliament. When I first introduced this bill in November 2013, it passed first and second reading and was referred to committee, but we didn’t see any further action from this government on this particular file other than the Ontario Energy Board’s review of the Energy Consumer Protection Act, which was completed just this past Monday, and the government’s newly introduced Bill 112, which was also introduced this week and which seeks to further regulate electricity retailing across the province. It’s my hope that we can take Bill 111 all the way through to royal assent this year.", "I would like to start by welcoming my family, who has joined us here today at Queen’s Park this afternoon: my partner Scott and our beautiful baby girl, Paisley. They have had to make a quick exit to do that kind of baby thing that sometimes happens at not quite the most opportune times, so they’re watching from my office. Nevertheless, they’re here, and they made the trek from Kenora–Rainy River.", "Over the past several years in particular, we, as legislators in this House, have devoted a lot of time to the affordability of electricity across Ontario. It’s safe to say that it’s one of the greatest concerns facing Ontarians today, especially for those of us living in the north. Since 2003, when the Liberals took over, our hydro rates have climbed 300%. This has pushed many families and seniors to the brink of not being able to afford to live, as their Hydro One bills continue to gobble up increasingly more of their paycheques or pensions, leaving less and less money to put other essentials—like food—on the table.", "To add insult to injury, a few years ago the Liberals told us to brace ourselves and to expect our hydro bills to soar another 46%—46%. This year’s budget, which the Liberals so exuberantly passed yesterday, also guaranteed the elimination of the clean energy benefit, a modest yet much-relied-upon 10% reduction of the price of our hydro bills. And in doing so, the Liberals have effectively shut the door to any kind of hydro relief.", "It is this kind of situation—already unaffordable hydro bills coupled with a horrifying commitment to a huge rate hike and the loss of any kind of financial relief—that makes the prospect of “fixed rate” electricity contracts seem attractive, especially to people who are just barely keeping afloat as it is. But make no mistake: If you’re looking to save money on your hydro bills, staying public is your only option.", "Electricity retailers are a bizarre holdover from the PC government’s brief experiment with rate deregulation, an era that ended over 10 years ago. During the brief period of rate deregulation, electricity retailers were permitted to enter the market to offer consumers competition and choice. They marketed themselves as a means to bring stability to our hydro bills when ongoing prices were uncertain. The electricity retailer concept, legislated in part V.1 of the Ontario Energy Board Act, provided that in a competitive market, retailers would be allowed to serve consumers by allowing them to pay higher electricity rates in exchange for the price stability and predictability that a fixed contract provides.", "But shortly after the PC s embraced deregulation, the government turned away from the open market concept for electricity and the Ontario Energy Board instituted the Regulated Price Plan, which guarantees relatively stable rates and where consumers pay for electricity that better reflects the price paid to generators, without paying private companies the added padding of profits.", "With the introduction of a regulated price plan, there is no reason for the energy retailing industry to exist. Nevertheless, consumers and customers continued to sign on with private electricity retailers in the belief that future prices—future higher prices, I should say—can be avoided by signing a long-term contract with a retailer. But contracts with retailers are usually for the cost of power only, and they don’t protect against increases in delivery, regulatory, global adjustment or other non-energy charges, which leaves customers paying more—much more.", "In fact, the continued presence of electricity retailers affects the entire rate base, imposing regulatory and enforcement costs, distorting price signals and limiting the government’s efforts to encourage energy use during lower-peak hours.", "A brand new report by the Ontario Energy Board entitled Consumers Come First: A Report of the Ontario Energy Board on the Effectiveness of ... the Energy Consumer Protection Act, 2010, which was released this past Monday, found that consumers who had signed a five-year, fixed-rate contract between 2006 and 2009 were paying 82% more for electricity than they would have paid if they had stuck with their local utility. These customers were paying more even though the reason that they were signing these fixed-rate contracts was to save money. The report says, “There seems to be a disconnect between what consumers say they want and what they are actually getting.”", "The OEB’s new figures are even worse than the terrible numbers from the Ontario Auditor General’s 2011 annual report, which reported that approximately 15% of the province’s customers are currently signed up with a retailer and paying between 35% and 65% more than customers paying regular hydro rates to their local utilities.", "I’ve personally heard from and met with hundreds of people who have been negatively affected by a bad deal with an electricity retailer. I’ve heard from pensioners, families and single people who have signed up, desperate for some sort of reprieve from the gargantuan hydro bills they have been receiving. People with English as a second language, professionals, and even a well-meaning Ontario Works administrator, who signed up all of her clients: These people signed up, either thinking that they would finally receive a much-needed break on their hydro bills, or because they were, in one way or another, misled or coerced into signing a contract. But all of these people, rather unfortunately, only ended up locked into the opposite scenario, where they were stuck paying significantly more and making an already unaffordable situation worse. From the conversations that I’ve had with other members of this Legislature, I know my constituency isn’t alone in having these experiences.", "In an article in the Hamilton Spectator in April 2014, well-respected professional engineer and Ontario energy consultant Bruce Sharp advises people, “Learn to open and close the door in one smooth motion,” and reject energy retailers. He goes on to write, “On the surface, energy retailers’ message that contracting with them can provide protection has some appeal. This is false.”", "Energy retailers impose huge regulatory and enforcement costs on the whole system. Retailer practices such as door-to-door sales and the use of misleading information account for 70% to 90% of complaint calls to the OEB. The OEB has also found that 60% of all fixed-rate contracts do not survive the OEB’s verification process.", "The government’s newly introduced Bill 112 is just their latest attempt to rein in runaway electricity retailers. If passed, it would attempt to reform the electricity retailing industry by allowing the Lieutenant Governor in Council to make regulations establishing rules governing the manner, time and circumstances under which a supplier or salesperson may advertise or market the sale of electricity or gas to a consumer in person at the person’s home. This is, as I mentioned, just the latest attempt to try to level the playing field and create some fairness for the consumer.", "Shortly after the rate deregulation that gave rise to electricity retailers in 2002, the government made amendments to the 1998 OEB act to include an energy consumers’ bill of rights. But despite this change, complaints persisted and the volume of complaints soared. Then, in 2010, after hundreds of complaints every year of unethical business practices, the government revisited the issue of consumer protection and passed the Energy Consumer Protection Act. The ECPA, although designed to eliminate customer complaints and offer some protection, has failed to do its job. While complaints were reduced, the OEB is still receiving many complaints, including those around pitches, contracts, reaffirmation and verification of contracts, cancellations and renewals.", "Now, through Bill 112, introduced earlier this week, the government is proposing to make changes to the selling of these contracts on the doorstep and increasing the length of the cooling-off period, during which time people are free to change their minds and cancel the contract without penalty. But given all the complaints brought forward to the Ontario Energy Board and the various failed attempts made by the Ontario government over the years to curtail electricity retailers, it’s clear that electricity retailing needs to be phased out, not reformed. Not only would phasing out private fixed-price contracts for residential customers offer the ultimate protection to Ontarians, but the Electricity Distributors Association states that it will save the electricity system—meaning those of us who haven’t signed on with an electricity retailer—approximately $260 million per year.", "Let’s turn to the contents of this bill and see what it seeks to do. It essentially has four parts. It will disallow further new, private fixed-rate contracts for residential customers. The bill provides that contracts between retailers and consumers for the provision of electricity at a fixed rate that are entered into after a specified day are deemed to be void.", "It will phase out existing retailer contracts with residential customers by allowing them to expire. All standing contracts held between customers and electricity retailers would be allowed to expire. The retailer will not be allowed to seek renewals with customers, and the contracts will be void on the expiry date.", "It will allow private electricity retailing in circumstances where institutional, industrial and commercial customers decide that it is in their best financial interests.", "And it will offer consumer protection. The act further provides various protections to consumers who enter into contracts that are deemed to be void under the act. Such protections include the right to a refund of money paid under a void contract and the freedom from liability for obligations under such a contract.", "Considering the cost to consumers, the costs associated with increased regulatory burden, the fact that numerous government attempts at regulating electricity retailers have failed to adequately protect consumers and that the regulated price plan has effectively made private electricity retailers redundant and obsolete, I believe it’s incumbent upon all the members of this House to ban electricity retailers from selling to low-volume residential consumers in the province of Ontario.", "I sincerely hope that members will see the merits of this bill and vote to support it at second reading today." ],

Indeed, in the event it should ever be adopted, it will merely require electricity vendor charlatans to slightly change their marketing tactics. Banning fixed-rate electricity contracts would not only not do what the bill asserts it would do, but it would also end up wasting a lot of public money in futile legal fees until the measure would either be struck down in the courts or ruled unconstitutional, whichever comes first.", "Indeed, should the Legislature refer this bill to a committee, the various participants in the electricity sector, both legitimate and undesirable, will weigh in to demonstrate the unworkability of the proposal made by the member.", "As proposed, all a vendor needs to do is offer a contract that, for example, charges a slightly different rate for even a brief period of time. Technically and legally, such a vendor would not violate any law arising from this bill, and that’s just one easy way to circumvent it.", "The member, however, makes a valid point in stating that private energy vendors include some entities whose marketing practices are dishonest, deceitful and predatory. At my own home, I have answered the door to be greeted by smiling people with laminated ID cards with company names purposely similar to an established and reputable vendor. The so-called sales literature is laughable, and I actually wonder how they find people to go door to door with a business pitch so obviously greasy and manipulative.", "While I have the floor, let me remind my neighbours in Lisgar, Meadowvale, Streetsville and throughout western Mississauga that Enersource, which distributes our electricity—and which is a private company, by the way—does not go door to door. If someone rings your doorbell and asks you for a copy of your electricity bill, your gas bill, your water bill, your phone bill or any bill, for that matter, close the door and send them away. Reputable companies don’t do business that way.", "Rather than this fatally flawed proposal, what could Ontario do that would be constructive? As far back as 2010, our government brought in the Energy Consumer Protection Act, to ensure that consumers receive accurate information from energy retailers before signing a contract or renewal. It gives consumers much stronger measures to cancel a contract than this bill proposes.", "The Ministry of Energy is proposing amendments to the Energy Consumer Protection Act. Among the proposals in the amendments tabled by the ministry would be measures to ban door-to-door sales of electricity and gas contracts. It wouldn’t matter how you propose to charge for it; you couldn’t close a deal door to door should the proposals by the ministry receive approval.", "The proposal before this House is not an effective way to protect consumers.", "In closing, may I congratulate the member and her family on the birth of her new baby and wish her a pleasant summer." ],

This is very, very concerning. I just hope that the Kool-Aid line that runs into the Liberal caucus room hasn’t somehow leaked into the PC caucus room and I got some of it.", "There are definitely some challenges with regard to this bill, but let’s talk about why the member from Kenora–Rainy River, Ms. Campbell, has brought out this legislation. There’s no question that, over the years, we have seen horror stories about the practices of unscrupulous energy retailers. The issues were before this House prior to my arriving here almost 12 years ago. I remember the discussions. If I recall, if I’m not wrong—and Jim Bradley will nod or shake his head; one or the other—I believe that David Ramsay brought forth a private member’s bill to deal with energy retailers at one time. I think the House then probed, and I believe that was Gerry Phillips, as the minister, who brought forth a bill that actually dealt, in a more concrete way, with the challenges. You’ll all remember the Marketplace story about the abhorrent practices—of these energy retailers at the time. To be fair, a lot of that has changed and a lot of it has been cleaned up.", "Myself as an MPP, I can’t tell you how many people we have fought for successfully and gotten them out of electricity contracts. When I first came here, there were a lot of people that also signed gas contracts. They were happier than could be, because shortly after I got here, the price of gas escalated almost two and a half times. Those people who had gas contracts thought that, my God, they’d died and gone to listen. My brother in Owen Sound had a gas contract. He couldn’t believe it. He was just laughing all the way to the bank when the gas went up. However, today, gas has gone down again, other than spikes because of some weather issues last winter—not this past winter; the winter before.", "The risk goes both ways with a fixed-rate contract. That’s essentially what Ms. Campbell’s bill will do: end the practice of fixed-rate contracts. They won’t be allowed in the future. Even fixed-rate contracts that exist today: At the time of their expiration, the details would have to be rewritten and they could not re-up on it unless they could cancel with notice but without penalty on the part of the consumer.", "Some of those are some very good things, but Mr. Delaney raised some very good points with regard to the constitutionality because—" ],

This would essentially not allow people to enter into contracts. So I have some concerns about that. I’m not the legal expert here, but I’m sure that there will be some legal people concerned about that very part of it.", "As I was saying, I can’t count how many contracts we got people out of and were able to make the argument that they were coerced into it; that they were not done in a fair way. Probably the most famous one—I don’t say the most famous one, but the one I remember the most—was my own mother-in-law. At the time, my mother-in-law would have been in her late seventies. She came here from Germany—Lithuania prior to that—and was not well versed in English, and she signed one of these energy contracts. It went on for months. She didn’t want to say anything to me about it because I think she was embarrassed. But finally my wife’s sister said something to my wife, and I said, “Elma, why didn’t you call me?” “Oh, I just felt so stupid.” She just blamed it on herself. And, my God, she was just getting hosed. Anyway, we got my mother-in-law out of that contract. So it’s not maybe the most famous one, but it’s certainly the one that was most clear to me that the practice needed to be reformed.", "The government did bring in a bill in 2010 that essentially did bring a lot more reforms to this field and, with all due respect, the number of complaints did drop dramatically. The retailers got it and the people got it, and they knew that the legislation did have some teeth in it, that it was not going to be a free-for-all anymore.", "But some of the practices were absolutely heinous, the way they were able to get away with it. As I say, if you remember that Marketplace exposé back around 2005, or 2006 maybe—I can’t remember exactly when—it was pretty graphic about the practices that were going on. One of the challenges was these people would be hired as door-to-door representatives, and the only way they ever made a nickel was if they sold that contract. The incentive to sell that contract was stronger than the incentive to be honest, I guess. Unfortunately, that is part of the human condition sometimes, and they fell victim to that themselves; they could not handle the temptation to sign that contract and proceeded to do so in an unethical way.", "One of the differences is—I’m sure the member from Kenora–Rainy River has given this some consideration—there are still energy retailers out there. They certainly have cleaned up their act, but many of the contracts that they work with today are not fixed-rate contracts but flat-rate contracts. Your legislation says nothing about flat-rate contracts. A flat-rate contract, Mr. Speaker, is one in which you and I have a contract—I won’t speak to you by name because that would be against the rules of the House. The member from Scarborough–Rouge River, who is also the Speaker here today—if you and I enter into a flat-rate contract, then I’m agreeing to sell you electricity at, say, $40 a month, with no adjustment year-end. So $40 a month times 12: That’s the flat rate I’m selling you electricity at.", "People have this budget billing with hydro, where they pay the same amount every month so that they’re able to budget for it, but at the end of the year they have an adjustment. They may have to pay a little top-up or they may get a credit on their bill, but it’s done in a way that they use the past history of a person’s billing and they assess it and say, “Well, if everything goes according to Hoyle and things haven’t changed, then this should be about what you’re going to use per month.”", "In the case of the member from Kenora–Rainy River, or people like her—let’s say somebody has four kids all of a sudden in the house. You know what? Their electricity use is going to change dramatically. If they’re on a budget billing, they’re going to find that, “Whoa. I got a bill at the end of the year from Ontario Hydro,” or Hydro One now, “and it just blew me away.” Your usage has changed. That’s why you always have to be cognizant of that and watching your monthly usage to ensure that at the end of the year you don’t get hit with a big bill or a surprise.", "The flip side is that if you’ve got a family of four, and three of them all go away to university at the same time, you just got rid of three teenagers who use a lot of water, lots of showers and baths, lots of laundry. You know what? Your bill might go down. You might get a good surprise at the end of the year because you might be getting a credit.", "That’s the point I’m trying to make: that what we have today often is the case of a flat-rate contract. I don’t believe your bill will do anything where someone has signed a flat-rate contract with an energy retailer, because it only speaks—and one thing about laws: You can’t assume anything. It says “fixed-rate” contract. It doesn’t say “flat-rate” contract, so I think you may need to amend that when it gets to committee if you’re going to deal with all electricity retail contracts. Or that’s something the government may consider, should this get to committee.", "The reality is that the government has brought out their own bill. Ironically, this is Bill 111; the government brought out Bill 112. Bill 112, which was introduced the same day, right on the heels of the member from Kenora–Rainy River, whose name I cannot use but everybody knows it—right on the heels of Bill 111 was Bill 112.", "Now Bill 112, interestingly enough, is going to ban the practice of selling—not marketing a contract door to door, but selling a contract door to door, because that is indeed where the rub is, folks: where that person signs that contract at the door. That’s where the pressure is: “No, no, no. If you really want to take advantage of the special we’re offering you today, Mr. member from Scarborough–Rouge River who does not have a name, you must sign it today, and you’ll really prosper because you’re going to save a lot of money.” Well, the government’s bill won’t let you do that. You won’t be able to sign that contract at the door, and even any contract that you do sign will have a 20-day cooling-off period as opposed to a 10-day period. So it’ll be interesting when the government brings that bill forward for debate.", "I have so much more to talk about. I’m glad that none of my colleagues butted in on me and wanted to speak. They said, “Oh, Yak, we’re going to give you the whole 12 minutes if you will take it.” I shall thank you very much, because there’s so much to talk about this that I will use all the time.", "We’ll be waiting for that vote.

There is a problem in this province when it comes to people coming and knocking on your door and saying, “Hey, trust me. We’ve got this great deal. All you’ve got to do is sign up over here, and we’re going to save you lots and lots of money.”", "We all as members around here have had those same poor citizens who sign these contracts with either energy marketers for gas or electricity come to our constituency offices to do what? “I can’t afford to pay this bill. It’s gone through the roof.” We as members—all of us on all sides of the House—have contacted the company in question and have done the work that we have to do as members in order to get people out of these deals.

Because a lot of times, they’re very bad deals.", "We pay enough for electricity in this province since the Liberals privatized part of the generation side, which has raised electricity rates by 320% since they’ve come to office. Can you imagine that? Your record, since coming to office for some 12 years, is that you can boast that electricity rates in Ontario have gone up 320% as a result of your own government’s move to privatize, I would say, about 30% of the generation side of hydro. Now this government says, “Hey, we want to sell off 60% of the distribution and transmission side.” If it went up by 320%, oh my God, it’s going to go up even beyond that. I’ve got to say, if that’s the legacy and the record of this government, we can’t take no more, because we can let alone pay the regular hydro bills without having to deal with energy marketers who come to knock at our door and say, “We’re going to sell you electricity at a good price,” where it actually turns out to be a higher price than would be the high price that we pay today— under Ontario Hydro’s billing system that the Liberals have allowed rates to go up 320%.", "But the government has an answer. It says, “You know what? You want to save electricity? You can cook at 2 o’clock in the morning. You can get up. You can do your laundry at 2 o’clock in the morning. You can heat your house at 2 o’clock in the morning. But don’t do those kinds of things during the peak times”—which happens to be when? When you’re normally in your house having to do those things. Because you get home at 5 o’clock. It’s cold in the winter because it’s dark. The heat has to go on. You’ve got to wash the kids’ clothes, and you’ve got to cook the food. You’ve got to do it at peak times, because this government has got this silly system in place that has very little to do with conservation and has more to do with whacking you in the pocketbook when it comes to what it’s going to cost you to pay for electricity.", "So, yeah, the member from Kenora–Rainy River comes to this Legislature and says that we need to do at least this in order to try to protect consumers so that we don’t have energy rates going through the roof when it comes to what energy marketers can do to electricity bills or gas bills, when it comes to them signing at the door.", "I want to say something about the member from—I’m doing a Rosario now; you realize that.

Protecting them and ensuring that they are not forced to spend larger portions of their income on these types of fixed contracts will ensure that they are able to live comfortably and with dignity in their retirement.", "This bill would eliminate entirely any and all fixed rate electricity contracts between retailers and consumers in the future. It will also allow consumers to seek compensation if they are billed under an existing contract after it has been deemed void by the legislation.", "While protecting Ontario’s energy consumers is one of our government’s top priorities, an outright ban on all fixed-rate contracts may not be the best way of achieving the desired outcome. There will undoubtedly be a portion of consumers who want to enter into fixed-rate contracts, and denying them this choice because some contracts attempt to take advantage fails to address the underlying issue.", "The Minister of Energy has proposed legislation that would enhance consumer protection by banning door-to-door sales while still allowing consumers to engage in fixed-rate contracts should they so choose. Our government believes that making sure consumers have all the information required to make an educated decision on their energy purchases is the way to go.", "Since the Energy Consumer Protection Act was implemented in 2011, consumer complaints registered with the Ontario Energy Board against energy retailers have dropped dramatically, from 6,013 in 2008 to 797 in 2014. This demonstrates that the protections put in place by our government are having the intended positive effect, protecting consumers from contracts that seek to take advantage. It also serves to protect them against unscrupulous door-to-door salespeople.", "This does not mean that our work is done. In fact, the Minister of Energy has proposed amendments to the ECPA that would provide further protection to consumers in Ontario. These changes would allow Ontarians to make more informed choices about where they get their energy.", "That being said, I agree with the spirit of this bill, Speaker. Any legislation that would grant further protections to the vulnerable in Ontario, including seniors, is something that we must seriously consider. I do feel, however, that some changes need to be made to this particular proposal to ensure that it does not, in its pursuit to provide consumer protections, have the added effect of removing choice from the marketplace.", "To say that all fixed-rate energy contracts are bad is to oversimplify the problem. It is true that there are many energy retailers that have overcharged users or coerced consumers into unfair contracts with confusing language and a lack of useful information, but there are others who offer legitimate contracts to consumers who are able to make informed choices.", "By delving further into this complex issue, there may be a solution that will help to address all aspects of this problem. I look forward to exploring those possibilities.", "I will be supporting this bill and encourage all of my colleagues here in the House to do the same.

These things are being sold to people who are 80 years old, with a 15- or 20-year contract—an $11,000 furnace and air conditioner, for example, that they could have gone down to Sears and bought and had installed for about $7,000. Immediately, they’re paying $4,000 more because they got it sold to them at the door, and then they are finding out a month, sometimes two months, later that in fact their contract then got sold to the finance company, and in addition to the $11,000 they’re now paying for this furnace, they are paying another $13,000 in interest.

My response to that is that retailers will find a way.", "I remember when I worked in a constituency office; I had a steady stream of folks who, through one way or another, found themselves enrolled in some of these really awful contracts.

  "text" : [ "Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker.", "I’m honoured to be able to rise today to speak on behalf of the Ontario NDP caucus in favour of our bill to call for a referendum on the sale of Hydro One.", "I’m also proud that we’ve had some people joining us here in the galleries, because not only am I speaking on behalf of the NDP caucus in regard to a referendum for Hydro One’s sell-off; I’m also talking and speaking on behalf of not only the scores and scores of people who have joined us this afternoon but literally tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Ontarians who think this is absolutely the wrong direction for the province of Ontario.", "Speaker, it’s not just New Democrats who feel this way. You may know that I have been travelling this province, working with a number of other interested parties. In fact, we have a number of leaders in our communities who are here today. We have some city councillors. We have some school board trustees. I see Gord Perks is here. Janet Davis is here from the city of Toronto. Alex Felsky is here from the city of Brantford. She’s a school board trustee there. We’ve got union leaders here. We have Smokey Thomas here—the president of the Ontario Public Service Employees Union. We have Fred Hahn here—the president of CUPE Ontario. There are many other labour leaders, many other community leaders and many other elected people. In fact, you’ll know that municipalities across this province are sending correspondence, first of all, through resolutions through their council tables and then correspondence to this Premier and her government to stop this wrong-headed sale of Hydro One.", "The problem we have, of course, is that the Premier is ignoring the voices of these Ontarians. The Premier has shut down any discussion whatsoever of this very important issue, and it’s not just a very important issue. I believe fundamentally that this is one of the biggest, most monumental shifts in public policy that this province has seen in a generation, and yet not a single Ontarian has had their voice heard in regard to whether or not they agree with this Liberal government’s behaviour, with this Liberal government’s actions, and that is unacceptable.", "We were just at the polls a year ago, and not one, single Liberal, including the Premier herself, was up front with Ontarians, Not one, single Liberal backbencher, cabinet minister or the Premier herself was up front with the people of Ontario about their intention to sell off Hydro One. In fact, you may recall that the leader of that party, the Liberal Party, the woman who is the Premier of this province, stood in that seat right over there in October of last year, months after the last election—and it’s in Hansard; it’s on the public record—and she looked me in the eye, she looked every single MPP on all sides of the House in the eye, and said she was not going to be selling off the assets of Ontario. What a disgrace, because here we are, a couple of months later, and lo and behold, one of the most important assets is on the auction block. It’s a disgrace.", "I said that I’ve been talking to a lot of people all around this province, and I certainly have. And I have to tell you, not a single person has told me that they think this is a good idea. Thousands upon thousands upon thousands have told me they think it is a very bad idea. The response that I get from people ranges from absolute distrust of the Liberals, absolute anger on the one hand—they’re distrustful because they weren’t told the truth by the government; they are angry because they feel frustrated that the government has shut them down and not listened to them—and then, on the other side of the spectrum, people have a deep, deep, deep sense of disappointment in Kathleen Wynne, the Premier of Ontario, who said she was going to do things differently in Ontario; she was going to govern differently. She’s not doing anything differently." ],

When it comes to listening to the people of Ontario, well, the ears are closed; the mind is closed. It’s all about the small group of insiders, of close friends, of people who are going to benefit and profit from this kind of action.", "I’m saying that because we know what will happen with the sell-off of Hydro One. We’ve seen this movie many, many times before. We saw it right here in Ontario when the Harris and Eves government decided they were going to start selling off some of our hydro generation. That was in the early 2000s. What happened? Almost overnight, electricity rates in this province went up by 25%—almost overnight.", "Every single family that I’ve talked to for years now—not just on this issue, but for years now—has been rueing the fact that they are falling behind. They can’t pay the bills. They can’t afford the pressures of day-to-day life. They’re already struggling to pay their electricity bills.", "I was in Brantford recently. There was a woman who literally broke down in tears because she firmly believes that any further increase in her electricity bill is going to literally have her and her husband out on the streets, without being able to afford a roof over their heads anymore.", "I was in Kingston recently and I heard from a family in a co-op who said that one of their neighbours literally lived the entire winter in one room of their house, because they are heated by electricity and they could not afford to heat the other rooms of their house. An entire family in Kingston lived in one room in their townhouse in the co-op because they couldn’t afford their electricity. What are they going to do next year or the year after, when the Liberals have privatized our electricity system? How are they going to be able to afford the bills then?", "That’s what we’re facing here. We’re facing a crisis already in the cost of electricity. Now we’re going to see it go even further. The rates are one issue. But it’s more than just that. It’s more than just the rates. If this sell-off of Hydro One goes forward, we are going to have a situation where the interest of this corporation is not going to be the public interest. Every decision being made by that corporation is going to be made in the interests of the shareholders, not of the public.", "That is why another historic thing happened here in the province of Ontario when virtually every single watchdog the people of Ontario have—the Ombudsman, the Auditor General, the Financial Accountability Officer, the French Language Services Commissioner, the child advocate, the Information and Privacy Commissioner, all of these watchdogs—jointly signed a letter to say that this is the wrong thing for Ontario because all of the oversight and all of the accountability will be gone. In fact, it is gone, because the Liberals passed their budget yesterday. Now, today, none of the watchdogs that look after the public interest are able to ever again look into what’s happening at Hydro, and we know that those watchdogs have done a great job.", "So there’s a complete lack of oversight, a complete lack of accountability. We have rates going through the roof. We have a system that we cannot confirm will continue to be reliable for the people of Ontario, because who knows what the interest is of the companies and of the shareholders when it comes to the running of our hydro system? It might be better off for them to allow for electricity, for example, to not be as reliable. We saw that in California. We saw rolling brownouts in California when they privatized their electricity system. Why? Because it was in the corporate interest to allow that to happen. It wasn’t in the public interest, though.", "So we’re really concerned about reliability and we’re concerned about safety. That’s one of the things we’re concerned about.", "But we also know that our electricity system, our transmission system, our Hydro One, can be utilized for other goals as well. It can be utilized to help us with conservation. It can be utilized to help us with other goals around the green economy. It can help us with economic development goals. But that’s only if it’s operated in the public interest, because those other activities are things that we want to incur and we want to embark on on behalf of the people of Ontario, on behalf of making our province a better place for everyone.", "So the rates are going to skyrocket. We don’t know what’s happening with the reliability. We’re losing an asset that helps us a great deal in terms of other economic opportunities. There is no reason for us to go down this road. The Premier likes to put a false choice in front of people—a false choice, I say. She keeps telling people that the only way that we can actually invest in things like infrastructure and transit is by selling off our biggest asset, one of our most important assets.", "That’s the other thing. This asset generates for us right now hundreds upon hundreds upon hundreds of millions of dollars each and every year into our revenue stream. That goes to pay for education. That’s used to pay for health care and for infrastructure. But guess what? We are not going to be getting that money anymore, because that money is going to be used as a payoff to the shareholders that are investing. It’s all about return on investment for shareholders once it’s a private corporation. It’s not about revenue for the people of Ontario.", "But you know what? In this province, this is the first time in our history, since Sir Adam Beck plugged in Niagara Falls, that there has been a Premier who has not been able to figure out how to maintain a public electricity system that’s in the best interests of the people while at the same time investing in infrastructure and in transit—the first time ever. How shameful. What a lovely legacy for the Premier of Ontario.", "She’s putting a false choice in front of Ontarians. There are lots of other ways to find revenues. This government has wasted billions and billions. I know my colleagues are going to talk about that. We have in this province a corporate tax rate that is lower than that of Alabama. So let’s start talking about the real choices and not put false choices in front of the people of Ontario.", "Interruption." ],

It’s worth a read. I recommend it to the Liberals, especially the minister and the Premier.", "Previous Premiers nurtured and grew our public power system in Ontario. They fought long and hard to keep it out of private hands. Premier James Whitney, back at the turn of the century—that’s when we were just beginning to harness the hydroelectric power at Niagara Falls. When he took office in February 1905, he stated, “I say on behalf of the government, that the water power all over the country should not in the future be made the sport and prey of capitalists and shall not be treated as anything else but a valuable asset of the people of Ontario, whose trustees this government of the people are.”", "Whitney was such a great visionary and Premier, future generations named an entire legislative block in his honour. As a matter of fact, that’s where the Premier and cabinet do a lot of their business. Imagine what the former Premier would be saying to this group had he the occasion to say so today, Speaker. It was Whitney who established the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario, the forerunner to today’s Hydro One.", "A former mayor of London, Sir Adam Beck, was named as the first chair of that body. Together they fought some hard battles against those who felt privatization was better than public power. But they believed in democracy, Speaker. They ran a referendum. They asked the voters of Ontario who would be using hydro power from Niagara Falls what they wanted: public or private power. That was on January 1, 1907. It was the most significant referendum in Ontario’s history by a huge majority. Public power was chosen over private interest. Voters in Toronto, Hamilton, Brantford, Guelph, London, St. Thomas, Stratford, Waterloo and Woodstock, as well as in 10 other communities, made it really clear. They wanted public power then, just like the people of Ontario want public power now.", "By 1913, in Ontario, more than three dozen municipalities, including Windsor, had voted to join the public hydro family. In 1917, Premier William Hearst ran another referendum and, again, another huge majority for public power. Hearst is another Premier who was so revered they named an entire block after him, and it’s home today to the Ministry of Energy. How ironic is that?", "To this day, Hydro One is still the only transmission network anywhere that was created by a direct vote of the people it was meant to serve. Sir Adam Beck, Hydro’s first chairman: Among his last recorded words were, “I had hoped to live” long enough “to forge a band of iron around the Hydro to prevent its destruction by the politicians.”", "There are political consequences to selling public utilities: Cleveland, 1977, the mayor and seven councillors were defeated after they tried to sell the city’s municipally owned utilities; Calgary, 2001, the mayoral candidate and, again, seven councillors were defeated when they ran on a campaign of selling Calgary Electric—at least they were up front about what they were going to do, unlike what has happened here in Ontario, Speaker.", "Hydro One belongs to the people of Ontario. It doesn’t belong to the Liberal Party. It’s an asset to be treasured and not leveraged. It’s an asset that returns close to $800 million a year to the province, money that can be used for infrastructure as well as education, health care and the protection of the environment.", "It’s never too late to admit to a mistake; there’s no shame in admitting to a mistake. Selling Hydro One is a major mistake. It’s a short-term solution with long-term negative results to the taxpayers of Ontario. Premier, if you won’t admit to making a colossal blunder, will you at least commit to holding a referendum to gauge public opinion and live by whatever voters decide?" ],

When I ran in Beaches–East York, the number one reason that the previous member said he did not support this budget was the “hidden” plan, as he called it, to sell the LCBO, Hydro One and Ontario Power Generation. He made that very clear. We had a public debate on that exact issue in the riding—on the Rogers debates, you can go there and see it. This was his number one concern.", "This is our mandate. We ran on it, and guess what? After Ed Clark released his findings, the people of Ontario knew this was the direction. We had a by-election.

We had sort of a conference call with Tony Clement in the campaign office. Basically, that’s all Tony Clement spoke about: that every single vote counts. He only won by 40 votes, I believe he said, in his first time running. When you’re dealing with thousands of votes—I think in June it was a total of 51,000-plus votes in Thornhill. The unofficial number was 86 for my opponent. Then it was flipped: 86 in my favour. Then, after the recount, it went up to 106 in my favour. All of those numbers—whether it’s 86 or 106, it works out to basically a statistical tie.", "In terms of Elections Ontario, I can’t speak on whether or not people were voting who shouldn’t have voted, but that’s always a concern. It certainly is a concern when people call and they say, “I saw my neighbour voting, and I know they’re not a Canadian citizen. They’re a US citizen,” or, “They’ve emigrated from another country.” They were told by whatever campaign they were supporting, “Go ahead. Nobody asks. You can vote.” People ask me, “What should I do? Should I call the police?” While I have never recommended that anybody contact the police on their neighbour, I’m often left wondering: What is the correct protocol? What would Elections Ontario want people to do? All I have done is direct people to Elections Ontario and hope that these concerns are taken seriously.", "I am very concerned not just about who is voting, but also who is working at elections, even though Elections Ontario did do their job. They audited the day after election day, and they found mistakes—several mistakes, in fact—where the numbers on the ballot envelopes were reversed so that my higher number was given to my opponent, and her lower number was given to me. It happened several times, always in my opponent’s favour, that the numbers were reversed on the tally sheets. Elections Ontario did their job because they did five audits, and each time they caught every single one of those mistakes and reversed it. So I cannot criticize Elections Ontario for the audit.", "I can question who’s working at those desks. Are they keeping track of where those mistakes were? Either the people working at those desks or those stations were committing some kind of fraud, in which case they shouldn’t be rehired next election; or they were making mistakes, in which case they shouldn’t be rehired the next election. Even if the other people at that station weren’t involved in any of these “mistakes,” they were supposed to be supervising each other, to the best of my knowledge, so maybe they dropped the ball in terms of supervising.", "I would ask Elections Ontario to focus on ensuring that the people working at elections are up to the calibre that we need, and also to look at the concerns bought forward by this motion to ensure that the people who are voting in our elections and are registered to vote are the ones who should indeed be voting." ],

For those of us who have stood for a few elections, I think we can all agree that the permanent electors list is rife with duplicates, deceased persons not removed and many other errors. In that way, I am eager to support this motion.", "The member further asks the committee to investigate the quality and integrity of voter identification documents and verification of citizenship and residency. I would absolutely like to see changes to the current voting identification requirements and their enforcement.", "There are two key voter groups that I want to see included in the work of the committee: seniors and immigrants. Anecdotal evidence obtained by Elections Canada suggests that ID requirements may present significant barriers to seniors. In particular, those residing in long-term-care facilities may not hold original copies of their identification, or addresses on the documents may be inconsistent.", "In the case of immigrants, there are hundreds of thousands of Ontario residents who pay taxes and use services but have no say in who represents them because they are permanent residents and not Canadian citizens. Permanent residents must live in Canada for a minimum of three years before they can apply to become a Canadian citizen. While this may not sound like a long time, recent reports have indicated that the processing time for citizenship applications is growing, so it is taking years longer for immigrants to become citizens and therefore exercise their democratic right to vote. In addition, because elections only take place every few years, someone might have the opportunity to vote only after they have lived in Canada for eight or nine years.", "Most importantly, I want a commitment from this government that the committee will conduct open and accessible meetings while pursuing their work. An open and transparent process is the only way to put forward true democratic reform. The last time this government made changes, they did so exclusively, by invitation only. That is not the way I would hope this committee operates. My party understands the keen link between voting and the health of the democratic process, and I hope for that to be shown throughout the work of the committee.", "We also have concerns about the appointment of a new third-party review system. This task currently falls to the Chief Electoral Officer, and I am wondering why the government feels that the CEO is unable to carry out that portion of his job. While it certainly took him some time to respond to the allegations of bribery in the Sudbury by-election, he did return a verdict that stated that the actions of Gerry Lougheed Jr. and Patricia Sorbara constituted an apparent contravention of the Election Act.", "This brings me to my final concern. I absolutely want to see electoral reform in Ontario, but I don’t want the focus of that reform to be narrowed by a government that balks at the opportunity to listen to Ontarians, as they are doing with the wrong-headed plan of selling off Ontario." ],

I will be sharing my time with the member for York South–Weston and the Minister of Community and Social Services.", "Let me begin my remarks by thanking the member from Scarborough–Rouge River for bringing this motion forward to the House today. He has been very passionate about the issue of the integrity and the quality of the electoral process. He has been talking to all the members of the House for years about this issue. It’s very important that we have a clean, transparent, but most importantly, integral process of election.", "As a member of the Legislature elected for the first time in 2011, I can tell you about a number of concerns that I have raised about the whole election process. Just to give you an example, Mr. Speaker, last year in my riding of Scarborough–Agincourt, we had a provincial election and also a federal by-election. In the federal by-election, one polling station—I know because I was there—didn’t open until 10:30, when every advertisement for the federal election said 8 o’clock. For over an hour, the residents, frail seniors, had been standing there with their identification. Nobody was present until I started tweeting and asking, “Who is the DRO? Who is the official responsible for this polling station?” Nobody showed up until almost 10:30, when the polling station opened at 8. That’s a federal by-election; that could easily happen in Ontario.", "In the last provincial election, I raised concerns about numerous developments across the city of Toronto, particularly in my riding of Scarborough–Agincourt. There’s a huge development at Kennedy and the 401; there are four condominium towers as well as townhouses. They did not have a polling station, and when I filed a complaint, the response from the electoral office to my staff was that there weren’t too many Canadians in this polling station. My God—four towers with over 20 floors and about 30 townhouses. It’s very clear that not only did those residents not have a polling station at this new development, they had to travel to an elementary school to have 10 polling stations. If there were no voters out there, why would Elections Ontario put 10 polling stations in one little elementary school? Clearly, there must be voters out there. When I filed a complaint, there was no follow-up. So it’s very clear that the motion put forth by the member from Scarborough–Rouge River clearly asks us to establish some kind of review and deal with the complaints process and issues identified by members as well as by Joe Public.", "The other piece—I know there has been ongoing concern in Scarborough—is the integrity of identification. Not only did the member speak about fraudulent identification cards; I know that people bring all kinds of identification cards that are not considered legitimate by Elections Ontario. It’s very, very clear that we need a review, and the motion that the member has brought forward today is very timely.", "Just today, both the Premier and the Attorney General are bringing in legislation about electoral reform in Ontario. I believe that the motion put forward today is very timely and very appropriate for us to consider. I would definitely encourage every member of the House to consider voting in support of the motion by the member from Scarborough–Rouge River." ],

I know this is an issue that the member from Scarborough–Rouge River feels strongly about and has some very personal examples that he believes we can study further in a select committee.", "I have to say, as a member who has now served on two separate select committees—one with the member from Scarborough–Rouge River—that they have a lot of value, because we, as members, don’t go in with the preconceived notion of knowing all the answers.", "It’s interesting to note that Norm Sterling is here today, because in 2009, there was actually a select committee on election financing and elections. Norm Sterling, Peter Kormos and Greg Sorbara all served on that select committee. I would suggest to you that those were pretty strong parliamentarians to look at an issue in a way that was about finding solutions. They didn’t come with their partisan hats on. They came with, “This is what we are seeing out in our communities.” Peter Kormos, of course, served primarily a smaller, less-urban riding; Greg Sorbara, very urban; and Norm, up in Ottawa, a little bit of both. That we had those three very experienced, very seasoned parliamentarians willing to serve on that select committee in 2009 speaks to the fact that we have an opportunity, when we have these select committees, to delve much deeper into issues.", "The NDP member for London–Fanshawe who spoke—I’m sorry; she left the chamber—raised concerns about: Does this not actually impede or raise issues that we think the Chief Electoral Officer is not doing his job? I would respectfully disagree. I think what this is about is that the CEO, the Chief Electoral Officer, must follow the rules as they are set out by us as legislators. If we can make those rules better, if we can clarify them, if we can, quite frankly, through the suggestion of a select committee, find out where the real problems exist, I’m all for it.", "A very quick example: In the rural part of my riding of Dufferin–Caledon, Canada Post changed the postal codes a number of years ago. You’d think that would be fairly benign. Three years later, when you went into that lovely little website that said, “Enter your postal code, and we’ll tell you what riding you live in and where you are to vote,” they weren’t even sending them to the wrong voting location; they were sending them to the wrong riding. In Dufferin–Caledon, it’s not unusual that it takes a number of hours to go from one end of the riding to the other. When you’re suggesting to someone that they are told to go to an entirely different riding, we are clearly doing something wrong. I’m happy to support the recommendation to form a select committee. I would lobby strongly to have some additions included in it.", "As we all know, Greg Essensa, as the current Chief Electoral Officer, does a report post every general election—and by-election, actually—and he has many, many recommendations. Some are touched on in the points raised by the member from Scarborough–Rouge River, but others I’d like to see included.", "Let’s look at some other jurisdictions that seem to be increasing their voter turnout, not seeing it shrink. Let’s look at some other jurisdictions that seem to have gotten a handle on third-party advertising and the controls that they have been able to impose, so that outside influence is not unduly impacting the outcome of elections. I would love to have those types of things discussed and hopefully come up with some recommendations through the formation of a select committee.", "We all have our own personal examples. I have now run as a candidate in three general elections, and I don’t even want to tell you how many elections I participated in as a volunteer. We need a better process. We need a process that absolutely ensures that everyone who wants to vote has the right and ability to vote, but we also need to ensure the integrity of the process.", "It is very special and something that we should hold very dear that we have the ability here in Ontario and in Canada to participate in democratic processes like elections. But the converse is that we don’t give it to everybody. You have to earn it. You have to earn it through your Canadian citizenship, and if we have those parameters in place, then quite frankly we also need a process in place to ensure that only the individuals who have the right to vote in a particular riding are given that vote. It shouldn’t be taken lightly. I think that we can do a better job, and I think that a select committee would be a very good place to start to ensure that we cover off some of these.", "I’m happy to support this resolution, and I hope that we can get past the small concerns that you may have about treading on the Chief Electoral Officer’s mandate. Quite frankly, while I’ve not spoken to him directly on this resolution, I know that he is looking for action on some of these problems, and he would like to see improvements. So let’s just get ’er done." ],

Certainly I think we all agree and we all recognize that a healthy democracy depends absolutely on having a fair and impartial and transparent electoral process, with safeguards in place to make sure that the integrity of the ballot box is protected.", "As my colleague the member for London–Fanshawe said, New Democrats certainly support the intent of this motion. But at the same time, we are concerned about the fact that whenever the spectre of voter fraud is raised, it can be used—and has been used in a number of US states and also at the federal level—to really introduce new restrictive measures that can lead to voter suppression. So we raise that caution as we look at this motion.", "The other requirement of a healthy democracy is that we do everything possible, everything we can, to remove barriers to participation, to make sure that everyone in this province who is eligible to cast a ballot is able to do so. When we look at voting turnout in both provincial and federal elections, we see that we’re at about 60%, so we have a long way to go to make sure that everyone is able to get out to vote.", "Within that 60%, there are certain groups who are less likely to vote. Voter turnout is much lower among 18-to-24-year-olds. It’s much lower among single parents who have young children, who, as we know, are overwhelmingly women. It’s much lower among renters compared to homeowners; renters tend to be low-income. It’s much lower among those who are unemployed or not in the labour force. In addition to ensuring the integrity of the electoral process, we also need to take action to reduce the barriers that these groups face when they go to cast their ballot.", "When we look at voter ID requirements in particular, we know that they can present some significant barriers to voting participation. As the member for London–Fanshawe said, this is particularly the case for seniors and immigrants. It’s also the case for students. Students often have difficulty obtaining the necessary documentation to establish their eligibility to vote, and we would definitely want to ensure, when this committee is proposing changes to voter ID requirements, that there is no disenfranchisement of people who are actually eligible to vote.", "One of the recommendations that I would bring forward is that this select committee look at ensuring the right to vote for all eligible voters. The research that is referenced in this motion could look at some of the strategies that have been used in other jurisdictions to increase voter turnout to make it easier for people to participate in the electoral process. We know some jurisdictions have looked at electronic voting machines, photograph ballots and some other modifications to polling places, in addition to increased accessibility and transportation to polling places. These are all strategies that I would encourage the select committee to look at.", "In closing, I want to say that we support the motion and look forward to participating in this select committee." ],

We in this chamber have all gone through elections and therefore go through the electoral process, and we have our own comments.", "He is bringing forward five key points to be examined by the select committee. One of the points that he is bringing forward is the quality and integrity of the permanent voters’ list. That’s the first thing I would like to talk about, because I think that identification documents and verification of Canadian citizenship and residency are very important. In Canada, in Ontario, you have to be a Canadian citizen to be able to vote.", "However, that’s not always required. I want to share one example that personally involved me in one of my elections. During a campaign, I knocked at a door and the constituent showed me a voter’s card. He was very honest with me. He said, “I’m not a citizen, but I received a card. Can I vote?” I said, “Well, if you’re not a citizen, you can’t.”", "A few days later, I ran into the same constituent, and he was quite upset. He said, “Another candidate came to my door and told me that if I have a card, I can vote. Did you think I wasn’t going to vote for you, and that’s why you said that I shouldn’t go and vote?” That obviously wasn’t the case, but now I had lost his confidence because I had given him not a positive answer. In any case, I think we need to strengthen the process.", "To what the members from London–Fanshawe and London West were saying: Yes, it is difficult for immgrants to get Canadian citizenship, but we have to encourage that, because if more people have citizenship, they will teach their kids. They see their parents going to vote, they see their grandparents going to vote and that will encourage even young voters to vote at election time. I think that’s very important.", "Another point that I wanted to make is that Elections Ontario—and I do have the report here, the Elections Ontario 2013-14 annual report: Ready Now, Ready Next. On page 5, for example, it says, “Ensuring the highest possible degree of accuracy with PREO”—the permanent register of electors for Ontario—“ is key to meeting our legislated obligations”—“our legislated obligations.”", "So we can help—through better legislation—Elections Ontario do a better job. That is our duty here in the chamber. So if we improve the electoral process through legislation, we can also assist the Chief Electoral Officer to do his job and Elections Ontario to do their job.", "I want to end by commending my colleague from Scarborough–Rouge River for putting forward this motion. As he had mentioned, if he was a candidate who had lost, everyone would have thought that these were just sour grapes, but he has consistently won his elections. He’s really passionate about this. We can all make a difference. I think a select committee is a great way to bring good ideas from all sides of this House forward." ],

The concept of striking a select committee is one that I’m very much in favour of. There are many individuals here in the House who have served on select committees, and I think we have all found them a great opportunity to put any partisan ideas aside and come together to solve a problem.", "And this is a problem for all of us. We all know that, essentially, the legitimacy of our electoral process is the bedrock of our democratic system. So many new Canadians do come to Canada and Ontario as a refuge, in many cases, from oppressive regimes. Some of those claim to be democracies, but they’re democracies in name only. Many of my constituents tell me that they view Canada as a place that has fair rules that apply to everyone, and when they discover—and we’ve heard many examples today—about individuals receiving two cards and so on, they’re really very, very shocked that this could happen. There are too many loopholes.", "I’m going to focus a little bit on the case of individuals being added to the list of eligible voters on election day. The type of statutory declaration at the poll without any appropriate verification is completely insufficient. Many members will remember the case of the federal member of Parliament for Etobicoke Centre who, a few years ago, lost his seat by some 26 votes. One of the many pieces of evidence that was presented to demonstrate the procedural errors on election day was that two individuals had listed their addressed as 20 Blue Jays Way, and they were allowed to vote in the riding of Etobicoke Centre. You would have thought that any one of the polling clerks would have picked this up immediately as clearly being an error.", "I had a recent example of people claiming to live in my riding who clearly don’t. We all know there’s been considerable controversy over the health and physical education curriculum. My office in my great riding of Oak Ridges–Markham, with the highest number of people in it—some 250,000—has been inundated with concerns over that curriculum. My staff follows up on emails asking for addresses to ensure they are my constituents. We’ve had the astonishing finding of, apparently, more than 20 people are living in the same household, and even in my very populous riding, this is not actually happening.", "So we know that these sorts of loopholes do exist.

Only this past election did we see an increase which bucked the trend of more than two decades. We actually saw a bit of an increase, which was a positive sign, but to put that into numbers: In 1990, we saw 64.4% voter turnout. Contrast that with 2011, which was the lowest in the history of Ontario: We saw that a dismal less than half of the people who were eligible to vote voted—48.2% of people voted in Ontario.", "This is a serious problem. It’s a serious erosion of our democracy. When people don’t vote in a democracy, it raises some serious concerns. So some of the things that I submit we should be doing in the select committee is looking at ways to encourage people to vote, to make it easier to vote, to make it more accessible to vote, and looking at strategies—like the member from London West mentioned, looking at other jurisdictions for best practices. Where are jurisdictions that people vote more often, and how are they able to encourage them to vote? What are the strategies? And to look at those and see if we can implement some of those strategies here in Ontario.", "It’s truly troubling. If we look at it and just think for a moment that the people who are making the decisions in this province—whether it’s municipally, whether it’s federally, if we look at the voter turnout, we are only representing a small number of people who actually care enough or who are actually able to have their voices heard. It’s incumbent on us as legislators to reverse this trend.", "We look at some of the problems people face. Some of the issues have been raised. One of the issues is the system of voting that requires people to go to polling stations. One of the members mentioned that a polling station wasn’t even open. That is an extreme travesty, that such an important thing like voting would be impeded because a polling station wasn’t open on time, at the right time.", "Other issues we see far too often: Polling stations are not accessible. They’re located in areas of our community that are hard to get to and it’s not convenient for people to go out and vote. We need to make sure it’s convenient. We need to make sure it’s accessible.", "The other area that we’ve seen serious concerns with is the timing of voting. The majority of folks who go to work aren’t able to vote until after the working day, which, for a lot of folks, is after 5 o’clock. We see a rush at 5 p.m. or 6 p.m. to closing time, which is at 9. It’s really that three-hour window that’s the most popular time to vote. We need to make sure we do more to make sure that at that time period there aren’t lineups and it isn’t difficult. If people walk up to a voting station or a polling station and see that there’s a huge lineup and it will take hours to vote, and that discourages them from voting, we’ve done a disservice.", "I think our focus with this select committee needs to be on how to encourage voting, how to encourage democracy. It should be a key issue in the minds of any legislator. We’re here because we represent the voices of the people in our ridings, and if we are not encouraging those people to actually have their voices heard on voting day, if we’re not encouraging them to come out and actually exercise their right, then we’ve done a disservice.", "With respect to the issue of voter fraud or the idea that there might be people who have received two voter cards—and I applaud the member for bringing an example here today, to bring a face to that issue. Certainly we need to make sure that the voting system has integrity, that the election process has integrity and that there are legitimate people who are voting. That’s, of course, an important issue, so we support that as well.", "Really, the focus needs to be on how we can encourage more people to vote and exercise that right." ],

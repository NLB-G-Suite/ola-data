  "text" : [ "I’m pleased to bring forward second reading of Bill 66, the new proposed Great Lakes Protection Act. I will be sharing my time with my parliamentary assistant, the member from Mississauga–Brampton South, and I want to start by thanking her for her leadership and her hard work on this file. Mr. Speaker, you may know that the member is also a teacher and an educator—quite well respected in that profession—and a big part of this piece of legislation is education and engagement. So we have benefited greatly by her expertise in that area and by her particular concern for young people, because this is really a legacy project for our children.", "This has been a work of some considerable effort. It is a rather unique piece of legislation, because this is not a piece of legislation focused just on enabling the government of Ontario, on behalf of the people of Ontario, to protect the Great Lakes and their watershed. It is actually a piece of legislation that will enable a whole array of civil society and community organizations.", "This is something that municipal governments on the Great Lakes have been wanting for a long time. It enables their efforts to develop tourism and protect water quality. It works with both our source water protection committees and our conservation authorities, which play critical roles in protecting the watershed and our source water supply. We are very aware of that, after events like Gogama. Whether it’s tanker cars that are leaking or catching on fire, whether it’s the problems we saw with blue-green algae in Lake Erie last summer that actually shut down the water system in the city of Toledo, Ohio, for several days—even boiling water does not get that out—we know that for municipal governments and for municipal utilities, and for our source water protection groups and our conservation authorities, this is a critically important issue.", "It’s also important to farmers. I know the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing, the Minister of Agriculture, the Minister of Education, and the members for Newmarket–Aurora and Durham and I were with the Ontario Federation of Agriculture, listening, just moments ago, enjoying a great breakfast with them and getting back in touch with a very important community of folks and a very important part of our economy, Mr. Speaker.", "The OFA raised four issues with us. I’m happy to say two of them were environmental issues, but one of the issues that they raised was the Great Lakes Protection Act. Mr. McCabe, the president of the OFA, talked quite eloquently about the incredible responsibilities that farmers feel towards protecting the lake, and the decisions and complexity that adds to farm managers to both be good stewards of their land, to provide a secure, nutritious, healthful supply of food to all of us—which we often, sadly, take for granted these days, many of us who are city folk—and also the importance of exports. But he spent a long time talking about the importance of our water, our water supply, the quality of lake water, how interdependent farmers are for clean drinking water, why they need clean water and their role in protecting it. So this will bring our farmers, our farm communities, and agricultural and producer organizations into the discussion about it.", "One of the things we’re also very proud of is that this was worked on very well with First Nations communities. We are in the traditional lands of many First Nations. The council of Ontario chiefs and others have recently put out a series of papers on the role of First Nations and water stewardship. We worked very closely with them to ensure that, in our bilateral agreements with the federal government around the Great Lakes and in this legislation, we well recognize the millennia of great leadership and stewardship by First Nations and we build that role of traditional knowledge about our lakes—folks who have been observing our lakes and using our lakes and protecting our lakes for generations, Mr. Speaker.", "I want to take a moment—because I know my parliamentary assistant is going to talk a lot about what’s in the act, I’m not going to go into that at great length. This is really her role, and the member will be stewarding this, thankfully, through the committee process. And we look forward to her engagement with her colleagues in the House as this goes through committee. I’m going to ask all members to please work very closely with the member from Brampton-Springdale-Mississauga South in that effort. We have—", "Interjection." ],

The turbidity that was in our waters, the cloudiness, is gone, which, if you’re a diver like me, might be an exciting thing, but it’s not a great thing for the lake and it has changed the character of the waters. Asian carp are at the gate of our lakes, and that’s a critical, critical issue. We have grasses growing on our beaches that are destroying the biodiversity and natural habitats of our beaches, which are critical to our pollinators, and diminishing the enjoyment that Ontarians have of the Great Lakes waterfront.

This is one of those non-partisan issues that I think—I hope—we can work on, because invasive species, whether they’re fauna or flora, are very, very challenging for us. We, as Ontarians, share—hopefully, we can be Ontarians before we’re partisans more often than not. This is something that I think all members of this House would like to see as a legacy, and this is a good vehicle, after it’s passed, for MPPs, local mayors, community leaders and businesses. This is important to our outfitters, to tourism, to fishing guides, to hunting, to our anglers. This is important to a whole bunch of urban, rural and suburban folk who have the great privilege of living on the most beautiful and largest freshwater supply in the world.", "We’re also affected by carbon dioxide emissions. We often talk about them in terms of climate change, but there is a less talked about but, I think many people would say, equally challenging problem with the high level of carbon dioxide emissions that this government—we hope with the co-operation of the parties opposite—is trying to bring down. We’re very proud, as a government, that we are 6% under our 1990 greenhouse gas emission levels. We just met, and hopefully will exceed, our 2014 targets and are now working very hard with new initiatives to get to our 2015 targets.", "One of the reasons that we’re bringing carbon dioxide down, and why that links to the Great Lakes Protection Act, and why this act is so important in that family of legislation—our Invasive Species Act, the Great Lakes Protection Act and the work we’ve done on climate change and green energy—is because carbon dioxide is being absorbed into our lakes and oceans, and it’s causing acidification.", "There’s something that we don’t see but will certainly notice when they’re gone—they’re little creatures called daphnia. They’re a phytoplankton. You don’t often think of creatures that small as crustaceans—as having shells—but they do. Daphnia are the very foundation—if you’re an angler or a fisher or an outfitter, you’ll know a lot about these things, because these creatures are the very basis of the food chain for all of our fish populations in all of our Great Lakes. We know that we have a crisis there—a rather invisible one unless you have a microscope—because these little crustaceans can no longer form their shells. We’re already at a point where the level of acidification in the Great Lakes is interfering with—is reducing—the ability of the very base of the food supply for all the higher-order species. They’re also being impacted by microscopic invasive species of different types that do not provide the nutrition or the stable food supply.", "This act requires us to better measure and record water conditions. I’ll be working very closely with our parliamentary assistants and with the Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry, our sister ministry which is responsible for the creatures in the lake. I am responsible for water, soil and air. Bad weather: You can blame that on me, I guess." ],

The Minister of Natural Resources is working very closely with us, and we will soon have a much clearer picture of the conditions of these micro-organisms, and we will be able to work much more effectively at intervening in the acidification of our lakes.", "Then we have climate change—we talked a little bit about blue-green algae and about the horrible experiences we’ve had in Burlington. Burlington, we all know, is a pretty modern suburban community, right next door to the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. He would be one of the first people, as would Minister Duguid, the Minister of Infrastructure, who would tell you that we have some problems with our stormwater sewer system. We listened to engineers, and for the last 200 years, we have built our stormwater sewer systems to hundred-year flood events. Well, we’ve had two hundred-year flood events in Burlington in the last two years. They’re now annual events. They’ve done everything from overwhelming our stormwater system to causing mass flooding in people’s basements, causing huge costs to working Ontario families who live in those communities. We’ve now lost our operating rooms twice at the Burlington hospital, a brand new hospital. That’s not the kind of place that people want to see their tax dollars going: replacing operating rooms, having to pay exorbitant insurance rates and risking not being able to be insured.", "We know that part of what we’ll do with Great Lakes protection is to start working with municipalities; we’ll be working with my colleague and dear friend Ted McMeekin, the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing, and my friend Brad Duguid, the Minister of Infrastructure, and members opposite who represent those communities, as well. This has to be a Team Ontario approach to our lakes, because no one ministry and none of us on our own can solve these problems.", "We need to figure out ways to start dealing with infrastructure that is climate-change-resilient, that’s flood-resilient. We need to look at the issues of stormwater, whether it’s the water running off our streets that is causing nutrients and pollution in our lake or whether it’s these very abrupt rain events that are now happening to farmers, whose farm practices for 100 or 200 years have been more than sufficient to keep those nutrients out of our lakes, where the change in rain patterns is now meaning even previously very, very viable farm practices that kept nutrients out of lakes are no longer working; we need to work with our farm community and municipalities, whether it’s an urban system or a rural system, to keep those nutrients out.", "Most of Canada’s industry, I think about 70% of our industrial production, is along the Great Lakes right now, Mr. Speaker, so working with the industrial producers, making sure that they have economically viable businesses—but that they’re ones that live in harmony with our lakes and contribute to the net health.", "We’re also losing a lot of our farmland in this area. We have all kinds of compounding problems that make lake management so difficult.", "We have more substances out there than we ever had before going into our lakes—pharmaceuticals. I remember when I was chairing the National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy, a woman well known to our friends in the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario, a former federal member, Pauline Browes, who many of you will remember was a federal MP from Scarborough, a dear friend of mine—a little politically misguided, but still a dear friend. I say that only humorously. Pauline and I worked very closely together in Ottawa on trying to keep pharmaceuticals out of our lakes and out of our toilets; the kinds of things that we do with hamsters, goldfish, and pharmaceuticals are not good things to do. Please don’t flush them down the toilet, because we now have levels of pharmaceuticals that were never intended and are having some very severe consequences on fish populations and amphibians and on the health of many species which we eat. We don’t need to be taking medication when we have fish from our lakes as a by-product of that.", "All of these issues are being addressed in the Great Lakes Protection Act. We are measuring, we are identifying, a host of problems—we’re doing that.", "Mr. Speaker, as you know, Premier Wynne and Premier Couillard have worked very closely. I worked with my colleague the Minister of the Environment from Quebec. We spent two days together during the March break. We spent a lot of time talking about the St. Lawrence River. I’m very happy to report to the House that the government of Quebec will be working with us with complementary legislation. So Quebec is now—", "Interjection." ],

What’s happening is that the saltwater/freshwater line is moving back inland, which is compromising Quebec’s water supply. They have a big challenge now with the changing climate and the changing nature of where fresh water begins and ends. So flows on the St. Lawrence River are very, very important to our sister province in the federation, and we’re very happy to have Quebec as an ally and a collaborator on looking at the entire ecosystem of the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River watersheds. I think it’s a great step forward for the protection of biodiversity that we are able to work as two federalists governments committed to seeing the benefits to the environment and to our quality of life on that issue.", "I want to take a little time and just thank people. In the aftermath of Walkerton, one of the initiatives that came out was source water protection. If you’re a member just about anywhere in this province—there’s only a few parts in the north—I would highly recommend that whatever party you’re in, you meet with your source water protection folks. I think we’re now at about 14 of 21 source water protection plans approved. This is an amazing process. These are farmers, businesspeople, community activists, there are local mayors. These have been much more complex plans than we expected them to be.", "It’s interesting—we were talking about Gogama the other day, and I know many members in all parties who represent that area. Do you know that we did not have anything for oil spills or rails in the source water protection plan? And when we started doing that, we went down the road and—you know, you trust local knowledge here and you think all of us know our communities really well. I think one of the things I like about the source water protection—but we’re now going back to some of those plans in partnership with those communities and now assessing rail risk to water supplies. Because when that ice melts, we’re going to have to be out there quite aggressively looking at the fresh water and the freshwater supplies.", "The member for Huron–Bruce points out, as I said earlier, when we talked about invasive species, many of these things can have significant impacts on our water supply. I think it’s good when we downplay the partisanship in here on these things that we share a passion on and tap the local knowledge of members of Parliament who bring forward ideas.", "I’m looking forward to working both with the member from Huron–Bruce and the member for Toronto–Danforth, who is my critic in the third party and who I also want to compliment as well, because Mr. Tabuns, the member from Toronto–Danforth, has a long and very well-respected record as an environmental activist. I know the member for Huron–Bruce has deep roots in the farm community and in the concerns of rural communities, and she has already been outspoken, and very credibly so, on these issues.", "I’m hoping that the three of us can work with my parliamentary assistant, again, the member from Mississauga–Brampton South—I don’t want to mess that up—on this issue. I’m actually very blessed, Mr. Speaker: I only have one grandchild but have I two parliamentary assistants, who are like my family. They seem to like me a lot better than my kids and my grandkid.", "The member from Sudbury, as well, is particularly interested in this. Sudbury has had issues with their water supply, with blue-green algae. Fortunately, it didn’t go toxic. I know, from having the benefit of having a team of the three of us at the ministry, I get some pretty interesting perspectives from both suburban and northern and rural Ontario on that, and I think you’ll see, as this bill goes forward, that thoughtfulness brought to bear.", "I’m going to try and leave—are you okay if you have 40 minutes?

Fortunately, this government has made water protection and the protection of our aquatic ecosystems a top priority.", "As we heard from our minister, the proposed act, if passed, would help to ensure our Great Lakes are restored, protected and made more resilient to the effects of climate change here in Ontario.", "Mr. Speaker, the memories of the December 2013 ice storm are still fresh in our minds, when thick ice knocked down trees and electricity cables and made our roads impassable. People were without electricity and without food for days and days. This is how climate change is impacting our lives.", "We have seen it this past winter. I have heard people saying in the greater Toronto area that they have never seen that cold a winter, with minus 30, minus 37, minus 40 degrees consecutively for two months. This is all as a result of climate change.", "We can see the impact of climate change in Ontario even today, as severe weather phenomena become more common, such as heavy downpours, which are now twice as common as they were a century ago. Rainfall and snowfall events are more extreme. Flooding and droughts are more common.", "The proposed act also builds on actions we are taking to reduce harmful algal blooms, promote environmental stewardship and help local communities and partners to take action.", "Ontario, as an ecosystem—a system that includes its people—is dominated by the Great Lakes and the rivers and water systems that feed them. The proposed Great Lakes Protection Act is an important piece of legislation that will focus solely on our largest source of fresh water and home to thousands of fish and wildlife species.", "The Minister of the Environment outlined the challenges and pressures facing the Great Lakes and the types of problems we need to address. We work with many dedicated partners across the province who have told us how important this proposed act would be for the health of our Great Lakes. These partners have important environmental concerns, such as protecting valuable wetlands around the lakes and restoring natural shorelines.", "But they also recognize that a healthy economy requires a healthy environment. Without the Great Lakes, Ontario simply would not be the great province that it is today. Almost 75% of Canada’s manufacturing, along with 80% of Ontario’s power generation and 95% of our agricultural lands, depends on the Great Lakes. Throughout Ontario, and in my own community of Mississauga–Brampton South, a centre of manufacturing and population growth, the importance of this essential relationship may not be widely enough understood.", "This government intends to work with all of our Great Lakes partners when it comes to doing what needs to be done. One important feature of the proposed act is the formation of the Great Lakes Guardians’ Council. It would be a forum for collaboration and co-operation, and a place for sharing knowledge and resources. The council’s members would include provincial ministers that have responsibilities related to the Great Lakes. It would also include, as our minister said, municipal representatives and partners from First Nations and Métis communities. Other invited contributors would include partners from environmental groups, industry, farmers, recreation and tourism, and the science community.", "This sort of collaboration would allow the Ontario government or other public bodies, such as municipalities or conservation authorities, to develop and implement a plan to address priority issues in a specific location.", "The council is also empowered by the proposed legislation to discuss targets and developing local and/or regional initiatives to support the people who want to restore and protect their corner of the Great Lakes.", "The council could have input into implementing inter-jurisdictional agreements seeking to protect the lakes, such as the recently signed Canada-Ontario Agreement on Great Lakes Water Quality and Ecosystem Health and the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement that was strengthened in 2012 by the governments of Canada and the US. In amending the agreement, Canada and the US addressed the spread of invasive species and the loss of habitat and indigenous species within the Great Lakes.", "Both of these new agreements outline commitments for considering climate change impacts on the Great Lakes, which is also a very real and important aspect of Bill 66. Commitments that Ontario made under the new Canada-Ontario Agreement on Great Lakes Water Quality and Ecosystem Health will support provincial Great Lakes goals and targets, and Ontario’s Great Lakes Strategy.", "The proposed act would advance the implementation of existing agreements, enable the province to take action quickly in acute situations, and focus on preventing conditions in the Great Lakes from deteriorating.", "In addition, the proposed act requires the regular review, reporting on and maintenance of Ontario’s Great Lakes Strategy. The strategy is the road map that sets out our vision, goals and priorities to help restore, protect and conserve the Great Lakes. The strategy focuses government resources across ministries, and benefits from the ideas and advice of other government and non-government partners.", "Regular reviews of the strategy, as this act would require, would allow us to respond to emerging issues and new science and establish new milestones on our way to restoring and protecting the Great Lakes.", "Good science, research and monitoring partnerships will also help support the Great Lakes work by providing the knowledge and data to help identify issues, set priorities, establish Great Lakes targets, and guide effective restoration and protection initiatives.", "Mr. Speaker, as the Minister of the Environment said, First Nations and Métis communities that have a historic relationship with the Great Lakes may wish to contribute traditional ecological knowledge for the purposes of assisting in actions done under this proposed act. It’s very, very important that we must take action—if we don’t take action now, then when?", "We want all Ontarians to renew their own connection to our Great Lakes. Together, we can help to ensure clean, healthy and resilient Great Lakes.", "In closing, I would encourage all members of this House to support the vision of healthy Great Lakes for a stronger Ontario." ],

Thank you, Minister, for your comments, and to the PA; I appreciate it.", "One thing that stuck with me, that I feel I have to reflect upon, is how the minister talked of the importance of trying to work together and downplay partisanship. He may not even know this happened, but I feel I need this opportunity to demonstrate it—and I really hope he encourages his partners, in terms of his PAs, as well as his staff, to walk that talk as well—because on March 11 there was a Minister’s Award for Environmental Excellence given in my riding, in the town where my constituency office is. The award was given to Murray and Wilma Scott. Their farm, literally, is two concessions south of where I grew up. I grew up knowing the Scott family very well; I hung out with their twin daughters; Murray served on the council my mom was clerk-treasurer-administrator for, for 35 years. I was really, really disappointed that I did not know about the award, nor did I receive an invitation to be there when it was somebody from home. Murray was my 4-H Calf Club leader for the entire time I was involved in 4-H. I found it very, very disappointing.", "I would just like to use this moment to share with the minister that I do want to work together on this, but I need to see it going both ways. The environment is very, very important. I would be remiss if I didn’t give a shout-out to what Wilma and Murray were recognized for. It’s an amazing initiative—a farmer initiative—whereby they built berms, they developed a new channel, a new wetlands, on their farm. It’s just indicative of how Ontario farmers across this province are good environmental stewards, and they want to do right.", "I thank you for this opportunity to share this message." ],

I listened intently to the minister; I hope he could tell that I was interested in what he was saying and appreciated some of his comments. He hit on the more pressing, poignant issues that I think our communities around the Great Lakes basin face, particularly around invasive species.", "Minister, Bythotrephes longimanus, the spiny water flea, is invading, certainly, our Great Lakes, but it is a real problem for commercial and sport fishing in Lake Erie. It’s something we definitely have to do.", "We support the intent of the bill; it is an incarnation of a previous bill. We see it as setting some—it’s enabling legislation, but it sets targets. It’s a plan to set a plan, which is not necessarily a plan, but not something we can necessarily disagree with, but we would like to see some hard targets. We’d like to see some initiatives that, I think, the state of Ohio has even recently taken to address algal blooms. We know that they’ve suffered—and the minister referenced Toledo, Ohio, where my brother lives, where there was a period of time where they couldn’t drink their water in the municipal system in Toledo, last year, I believe. The Republican-led chamber, the Ohio Senate, and I believe the House has just passed a bill, Bill 1, from the Senate, which will prohibit farms from fertilizing fields when fields are frozen or saturated or if weather calls for rain. This is something that’s really proactive, something that they’re addressing head-on.", "My hope is that this legislation gives the ministry and the minister the ability to set those types of regulations into force and to address those issues head-on.

With that said and parked—and it was an important message to say—we cannot have industrial wind turbines in our water. The Minister of Economic Development, Trade and Innovation certainly would echo that, as he did ahead of the 2011 election.

As Bill 66 has the power to supersede nutrient management and other legislation pertaining to agriculture, we need to proceed carefully and work with stakeholders to balance environmental concerns with economic ones.", "One nutrient that has a significant impact on the health of the Great Lakes is phosphorus. We all know that. Some areas of the Great Lakes have more phosphorus than they should, and intervention is indeed required to reduce phosphorus to more appropriate levels. Excessive levels of phosphorus contribute, as you may guess, to algal growth and certain types of blue-green algae, and other species may produce toxins that are harmful to both humans and wildlife. We all want to do our part in correcting this, and ongoing efforts to upgrade municipal waste water treatment plants and limit phosphorus levels have been successful in reducing phosphorus levels, particularly in Lakes Ontario and Huron.", "The Nutrient Management Act has done a good job of dealing with phosphorus coming from farms, but we also need to recognize that a considerable portion of the pollution originates in the United States. I ask the minister this: Can the Liberal government realistically set targets for transboundary pollution issues? We know where the greatest source of phosphorus is coming from in Lake Erie. So I repeat that question: Can the Liberal government realistically set targets for transboundary pollution issues?", "A retired forester and MNR employee recently contacted my office with some excellent suggestions on environmental stewardship, and I feel it would be worthwhile to share them with you today. He advised that the government should continue to work with the agricultural sector to address erosion and runoff by encouraging practices like Murray and Wilma Scott have embraced, like grassed waterways, buffer strips of grass and trees, plowdown crops, contour plowing, restricting livestock access to water and reduced tillage.", "Speaker, again I suggest to you that we are very, very fortunate that a lot of these initiatives have been voluntarily embraced because farmers above all else want to be good stewards of our land.", "This former employee of MNR also recommended protecting wetlands, which filter water and contribute to improved water quality. He pointed out that forests are only protected if they are provincially significant areas of natural and scientific interest, although the province allows municipalities to designate forest as significant for planning purposes. He identified toxic sewage sludge, which is removed from waste water and spread on agricultural lands, as a source of Great Lakes pollution that should be addressed as well.", "Here in this House, as legislators, we have discussed the threat aquatic invasive species pose to biodiversity in the Great Lakes. My colleague from Haldimand–Norfolk has warned us of the damage that Asian carp could do if allowed to enter the waterways. We’ve also described, on both sides of the House and including the third party, how phragmites are spreading along the shoreline and choking out wetlands.", "He also pointed out—my colleague from Haldimand, that is—that these invasive species have not only posed an ecological threat, they also have an estimated $7.5-billion impact on forestry and farming, and that impact is in the negative sense.", "In Huron–Bruce, a group of concerned citizens approached authorities for assistance with phragmites, which are growing out of control along our shoreline. Where cottages and homeowners once had a lovely beach, there are only phragmites, and the remaining beach was unable and unsafe to be walked on due to phragmite roots. Everybody is doing their part. I’ve talked to people who, when phragmites come in to seed, they painstakingly cut off the heads of the phragmite and very carefully drop them into little baggies so the seeds do not hit the ground.", "Everyone in my riding is cognizant of the negative impact of phragmites. In my riding, residents have approached local municipal councils and officials, and together they began the long and difficult task of having the problem assessed. Through filling out of the paperwork, they hope that they can work toward a treatment that will address this issue. But unfortunately, this is a time-consuming and trying procedure that it should not have been. Phragmites are a recognized threat and spread quickly, so it should not be a convoluted procedure to report and control them.", "In terms of improving Bill 66, that is an area in terms of amendments that our party is going to be addressing. I would also like to suggest that this is one area in which the government should increase engagement with municipal officials and local conservation authorities and streamline the remediation process.", "Another ongoing threat to the Great Lakes has been the invasion of zebra mussels. My colleague and friend from Thornhill very adeptly addressed the issue in the lake that she calls home with her father, and I thank her for that. Zebra mussels have led to water quality concerns and they too encourage the growth of algae.", "In saying that, I want to get into more detail about some of the problems with Bill 66 in areas that we hope we can work together on to improve.", "A number one issue in this bill is the duplication of governance. While recognizing the importance of a healthy and prosperous Great Lakes region, there are still elements of Bill 66 which warrant sober second thought. The PC Party has certainly been supportive of the existing framework to protect water quality and to establish meaningful partnerships with the private sector to develop new technologies to remediate areas of concern.", "There have been Great Lakes governance agreements between Canada and the United States, and between the federal and provincial governments, for more than 40 years. If there was a pressing need for more legislation, I question why the Liberal government has waited so long to act. We also need to examine if the areas of concern and challenges facing the Great Lakes should be addressed under Bill 66, or could they not be better dealt with under existing agreements?", "Is more legislation really needed to protect the Great Lakes? We need to be mindful of this. To my mind, the Liberals have not provided a clear explanation as to why Bill 66 is necessary when we have extensive regulatory frameworks already in place. If they cannot demonstrate areas of concern that are not being adequately addressed, then why are they proposing a comprehensive piece of legislation that may well create conflicts and confusion, burden municipalities and development with increased costs and red tape, and reduce local planning authority? Speaker, I have to remind you again that we saw a documentary on TVO last night that saw the results of the loss of local municipal autonomy. Do we want to create another burden and another threat that further reduces local decision-making? I so hope not. Stewardship programs do not need another layer of bureaucracy; they need adequate funding, which Bill 66 does not appear to provide.", "Unfortunately, the introduction of Bill 66 reminds me, as I mentioned earlier, of the Green Energy and Green Economy Act. I have to ask once more if this government is again proposing far-reaching legislation simply to appease special interest groups and to create the illusion of protecting the environment. Ontario cannot afford another ill-advised policy which does nothing but download costs to municipal governments and complicate and confuse the environmental processes that we already have in place.", "Given the province’s skyrocketing debt and deficit situation, one also has to consider that Bill 66 may just be another revenue tool to satisfy the finance minister and an opportunity to further download costs and to raise money through the levy of fees and penalties. Again, Ontario has a huge burden because of the last decade of Liberal mismanagement. We cannot afford another ill-advised and misplaced piece of legislation.", "To continue, I would now like to outline some of the existing agreements which provide protection to the Great Lakes.", "Canada and the United States have established the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement to restore and maintain the chemical, physical and biological integrity of the Great Lakes basin ecosystem. Under this agreement, the US and Canadian governments have identified—I’m going to go through the whole list, because we do not want Bill 66 to provide unnecessary, redundant pieces of legislation. The US and Canadian governments, under the Great Lakes water agreement, have identified the need to:", "—develop water quality and ecosystem health objectives and report progress to the public regularly;", "—clean up areas of concern in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River basin;", "—develop a comprehensive lake-wide management plan to protect and remediate near-shore waters;", "—reduce toxic chemicals in the Great Lakes, like mercury and PCBs;", "—reduce nutrients like phosphorus that lead to the growth of algal blooms that degrade drinking water quality, impair fish spawning and adversely impact commercial and recreational fishing, swimming, tourism and the overall enjoyment of the Great Lakes;", "—prevent discharges from shipping vessels, such as garbage, sewage, invasive species and other pollutants;", "—stop the spread of invasive species by developing and implementing early detection and rapid response programs;", "—complete the development of and begin implementing lake-wide habitat and species protection, restoration and conservation strategies within two years;", "—identify contaminants in groundwater discharged into the Great Lakes;", "—develop plans to protect and restore near-shore areas, the primary source of drinking water for Great Lakes communities;", "—reaffirm actions necessary to restore and delist areas of concern;", "—identify new toxic substances and implement pollution prevention and control strategies; and, lastly,", "—develop conservation strategies to protect native species and restore habitat.", "This comprehensive agreement also requires Canada and the United States to address the use of toxic substances in the basin and to develop action plans for areas of concern, which are regions that have significant environmental challenges.", "The Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement has an oversight body called the International Joint Commission to oversee the development and implementation of these goals. So again, I caution: Is Bill 66 going to set up a redundant layer of bureaucracy and Liberal-friendly appointments that Ontario can’t afford at this time?", "Speaker, to go back to the International Joint Commission, I would like to share with you that this particular commission oversees the remediation of 15 areas of concern by ensuring that parties have action plans in place. Ontario is responsible for addressing challenges in seven of Canada’s 10 areas of concern, including Nipigon Bay, Jackfish Bay, Peninsula Harbour, Spanish Harbour, Wheatley Harbour, the Niagara River and the Bay of Quinte.", "Over and above the International Joint Commission, Ontario is also a member of the Great Lakes Charter, an agreement signed by Ontario, Quebec and eight of the Great Lakes states in 1985 to address concerns related to water diversion in the Great Lakes basin.", "The governments of Canada and Ontario also signed a draft Canada-Ontario Agreement on Great Lakes Water Quality and Ecosystem Health—COA—in 2014. Are we seeing a pattern here? There are already a lot of initiatives taking place. Again, I caution: Does Bill 66 just introduce another layer of redundancy that this province can’t afford?", "Going back to the Canada-Ontario Agreement on Great Lakes Water Quality and Ecosystem Health, which was founded in 2014, I want to share that the COA, as it’s known, establishes a domestic action plan to guide co-operation and the coordination of efforts to restore, protect and conserve Great Lakes water quality and ecosystem health over five years.", "I’d like to point out to you, as we wind down to the break, what the COA deals with: nutrients; harmful pollutants; discharges from vessels; areas of concern; lake-wide management; aquatic invasive species; habitat and species; groundwater quality; climate change impacts; science; promoting innovation; engaging communities; engaging First Nations; and engaging Métis.", "Speaker, I worry, and again I caution, that Ontario cannot afford another layer of redundant legislation that does nothing more than download more costs to Ontarians throughout this province.", "At that, I think you may want me to take a break.", "Interjection." ],

As well, the government has the Toxics Reduction Act and the Environmental Protection Act to deal with harmful pollutants.", "As you can see, numerous pieces of legislation offer a framework for the protection of the Great Lakes ecosystem. Again, I question why Ontario does not simply fulfill its commitments under these existing agreements. There is no need to overlap and duplicate governance. Where is this particular gap that necessitates Bill 66? Speaker, I ask: What steps will the government take to prevent overlap and to ensure all new regulations will be coordinated with Ontario’s existing water legislation?", "Bill 66 could potentially affect a number of acts; for example, the Planning Act; the Condominium Act, 1998; the Greenbelt Act, 2005; the Niagara Escarpment Planning and Development Act; and the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act, 2001.

It is an honour to rise in the House today to speak on second reading of my private member’s bill, Bill 61, An Act to proclaim Terry Fox Day.", "If passed, this bill would proclaim the second Sunday after Labour Day of each year as Terry Fox Day.", "To begin our discussion on this bill, I think it is only fitting to start with the story of Terry Fox and his Marathon of Hope, a journey that has inspired millions of people to take action in the fight against cancer.", "Born in Manitoba and raised in British Columbia, Terry was an active teenager who loved sports. A star athlete in high school, Terry is often remembered as competitive and determined never to let anything hold him back.", "Tragically, at the age of 18, he was diagnosed with bone cancer in his right leg. Due to the lack of treatment options available at the time, doctors were forced to amputate his leg six inches above the knee.", "Overcome by the suffering he saw in the hospital of other cancer patients, many of whom were young children, Terry decided to take action. He decided that he would run across Canada to raise money for cancer research and awareness. Terry would call his journey the Marathon of Hope. Pledging to raise $1 million, he began his journey on April 12, 1980, setting out from St. John’s, Newfoundland.", "Ontario was the tipping point where Terry’s dedication to find a cure caught on. While he was running through Ontario, word of his journey and enthusiasm spread across the country. He was greeted at every stop by crowds of well-wishers and supporters. It was in this province that Terry’s dream became a national dream. It was here that led to his new goal: to raise $1 for every Canadian for cancer research.", "When Terry reached Toronto, he was greeted by over 10,000 supporters. I remember back then being part of the crowd—I was in my last year of high school; I took a day off, I think—greeting him at city hall. Thousands of supporters across the city came to join him on University Avenue as well as at city hall, as I said.", "On July 10, 1980, Terry arrived in Scarborough, where he was greeted in a welcoming ceremony at Scarborough Civic Centre, just outside my riding of Scarborough–Agincourt.", "Initially, organizers of the ceremony were worried that no one would be there to welcome him. Well, were they ever wrong. Thousands of Scarborough residents greeted him as he arrived at Albert Campbell Square. People filled the rotunda to hear him speak. When he arrived, Terry was appointed the honorary mayor of Scarborough for the day, and the city made a $5,000 contribution towards the Marathon of Hope.", "As Terry’s brother Fred Fox shared with me, it was in Scarborough that Terry gave one of the most passionate speeches of his journey. Terry told thousands of people who came to Scarborough that he did not want to be famous for the run. He said he was just a guy running across the country to collect money for cancer research. He then urged the crowd that if he didn’t finish, others needed to continue. “It’s got to keep going without me,” Terry said.", "Terry Fox’s journey lasted a total of 143 days and 5,373 kilometres. Unfortunately, Terry’s journey came to an end outside of Thunder Bay. Even though Terry’s time running was over, he succeeded in creating a lasting legacy that has continued to live on through the annual Terry Fox Run. The first Terry Fox Run was held in his memory in September 1981, one year after his journey ended, on a day chosen by Terry himself before he passed away.", "Named one of the greatest Canadians, Terry Fox was not just a guy. Since his journey began in 1980, Terry Fox has been a vital symbol of hope for Canadians. His dedication to devoting his life to finding a cure for cancer through the Marathon of Hope has inspired us all. That is why, every year, on the second Sunday after Labour Day, thousands of Ontarians do their part to ensure that his memory lives on by running or walking in one of the many Terry Fox Runs—or National School Run Days —across this province. In fact, last year, every member in this House had at least one Terry Fox Run take place in their riding. I know that some of you, including our Premier, take part in this annual run each year.", "It is clear that Terry Fox’s visit to Scarborough has had a lasting impression on my riding of Scarborough–Agincourt, and I’m honoured to bring this bill forward on behalf of my constituents.", "We are joined in the House today by current and former staff at Terry Fox Public School, an elementary school in my riding. Named in honour of Terry, the school opened in 1981, the same year as the first Terry Fox Run. Since 1984, the school has honoured the memory of Terry and his Marathon of Hope by organizing the annual Terry Fox Run, with all proceeds going to the Terry Fox Foundation. To date, the school has raised $83,000.", "I’d like to thank teacher Alisa Van Der Toorn, who’s here with us today, for organizing the annual run and keeping Terry’s legacy alive at the school. Thank you, Alisa." ],

In doing so, she’s raising awareness and reducing the stigma associated with this disease.", "I also want to take this time, Mr. Speaker, to recognize the talented teachers and staff who work at Terry Fox Public School—truly living and teaching with courage. One dynamic teacher and vice-principal I would like to recognize is Scott Gardner—and I know he’s watching right now—who has influenced the lives of many Terry Fox students academically, athletically and emotionally. In 2009, Scott was diagnosed with a cancerous brain tumour. Despite this, he continues to impart his courage, strength of character, perseverance and determination as he battles his illness.", "Speaker, I share these stories today because they motivate us to carry on Terry’s dream: to find an end to cancer.", "Today, Terry Fox’s dream to raise money for cancer research and awareness has had a profound effect on millions of lives around the world. When Terry lost his leg to cancer in 1977, he was told that he only had a 50% chance of survival. Now Ontarians with the same cancer have survival rates of nearly 80%, and a similar diagnosis no longer risks the loss of limbs. Such scientific and medical advancements have been made possible by money raised in Terry Fox’s name each year.", "This September, millions of people around the world will take part in their own Marathons of Hope. The Terry Fox Run has become the world’s largest one-day cancer fundraiser. These runs have now contributed to raising over $650 million for cancer research through the Terry Fox Foundation.", "In 2013, the Terry Fox Foundation directed $23.5 million to cancer research programs. Such funds support hospitals in Toronto like SickKids and Sunnybrook, as well as universities and research institutes across this country, who are working towards early diagnoses, advances in treatment and the eventual cure for cancer.", "Some of the achievements as a result of the Terry Fox Run include: early lung cancer diagnosis and detection, better understanding of the genetics behind childhood brain cancer and better management of prostate cancer through the use of biomarkers. It is clear that we have made amazing advancements in cancer detection and treatments since Terry Fox began his Marathon of Hope. But the journey is not over, and I’m sure that everyone here, and those who are watching today, knows somebody whose life has been affected by cancer. We still have many hurdles to face, and we must continue to support the researchers, medical staff, front-line workers, patients and families to beat cancer.", "Proclaiming the second Sunday after Labour Day as Terry Fox Day in Ontario not only contributes to the preservation of Terry’s dream to find a cure for cancer, but it will also serve as a yearly reminder that we must spread his message of courage, hope and determination. Proclaiming Terry Fox Day also gives us the opportunity to recognize the important work being done by the Terry Fox Foundation and the hard work and dedication of many of the volunteers who organize and participate in the run each year.", "Last year, Terry Fox’s home province of British Columbia proclaimed the same day as Terry Fox Day. It is only appropriate that Ontario join BC in recognizing the significance of what Terry Fox tried to accomplish. At each stop he made, his words of courage and hope captured the hearts of so many Ontarians, inspiring them to keep his dream alive.", "I would like to thank all our guests who are here today at Queen’s Park to hear us speak to the bill and my colleagues in the House for being here to take part in the debate on second reading of Bill 61. I hope I can count on your support, so that we can pass this bill before the House rises for the summer. In doing so, we will honour the 35th anniversary of the Terry Fox Run this September by proclaiming the second Sunday after Labour Day as Terry Fox Day in Ontario." ],

Terry Fox is my hero. To me, proclaiming Terry Fox Day is important in two ways: so we can keep going with our efforts in outrunning cancer, and so we can keep exemplifying Terry and his role in shaping our Canadian identity. The Marathon of Hope ingrained in me the most sincere respect for Terry and everything this young man from Port Coquitlam, B.C., stood for: strength through adversity, being the best person you can be, and never giving up.", "To that end, I offer this quote by Terry: “I don’t feel that this is unfair. That’s the thing about cancer. I’m not the only one, it happens all the time to people. I’m not special. This just intensifies what I did. It gives it more meaning. It’ll inspire more people. I just wish people would realize that anything’s possible if you try; dreams are made possible if you try.”", "I am proud that we continue to carry Terry’s torch with the Terry Fox Run, and I am proud to say that I started and organized the Wiarton Terry Fox Run for 10 years with colleagues Marcy McGill, Suzy Richardson, Susan Given, and Cris and Richard Bouillon, and that run still continues today due to the efforts of a lot of those volunteers.", "Today almost every community and a majority of schools celebrate this great Canadian hero by hitting the streets or schoolyards to raise money for cancer research and to keep Terry’s hope alive. In fact, it pleases me to know that people across the world, from students in the United Arab Emirates and Morocco to Singapore and China continue to be inspired by Terry and hold their own Terry Fox Runs in support of cancer research.", "I myself am a runner and have always been a strong proponent of engaging people to lead healthier and more active lives. That is why you often hear me advocating in this House for more mandatory daily activities for our children and adults alike. I’m concerned with our obesity numbers and the fact that despite the advice we are getting, some of our kids continue to go without the daily needed physical activity.", "As cancer continues to claim the lives of 7.6 million people every year, four million of whom die prematurely, aged between 30 and 69 years, I think it is absolutely important that we do more.", "On a personal note, I lost my sister Marj and my late mother, Jean; and my sister Bonnie and sister-in-law Joanne are breast cancer survivors. It’s definitely very personal to a lot of us, and something we always have to be cognizant of.", "I think that we, as legislators, can facilitate getting more of our young people—all people, in fact—to embrace wellness and fitness, and I think we can be giving them the tools to lead a healthy lifestyle.", "Thank you to all of those who have supported Terry’s cause. Without you there would be no run, no resources for cancer research and, most importantly, no recognition of people and their families who battle this terrible disease.", "Courage, hope and determination are the epitome of Terry Fox. Thank you, Terry Fox. One day we will find a cure." ],

I don’t think I need to explain to anyone in this House who Terry Fox was. His compassion, his courage and his inspirational life story have made Terry Fox a household name right across Canada.", "Terry was born in Winnipeg on July 28, 1958. It was at the age of 18, as a first-year university student and a very good athlete, when Terry was first diagnosed with bone cancer. That cancer would result in the amputation of his right leg, six inches above the knee. While many others would have seen defeat, Terry saw hope. Inspired by those he witnessed suffering from cancer, children in particular, Terry began his Marathon of Hope in 1980, beginning in St. John’s, Newfoundland. Think about this: He ran 26 miles per day, seven days a week with a goal of running across Canada to raise money to fight cancer.", "As many of you know, Terry didn’t get to see that goal. He was forced to stop his incredible marathon in Thunder Bay, after running 5,373 kilometres in 143 days. He was forced to stop because of a recurrence of cancer that took his life in 1981.", "Inspired by his determination and his incredible journey to bring hope to those fighting against cancer, millions of people from across 25 countries run in Terry Fox’s name every year and carry on his legacy.", "Named as one of the greatest Canadians, his story continues to inspire the world. Every year, I participate in the Terry Fox Run in Niagara Falls. I’m happy to say that there are Terry Fox Runs in almost every community in Niagara.", "I’m also proud to say that Terry Fox ran through Niagara Falls during his Marathon of Hope in 1980. At that time, he was greeted by the mayor, Wayne Thomson. It was incredible that there were only 30 to 40 people to greet Terry that day and to see the Falls and go down the parkway. The former mayor, Wayne Thomson, actually continues to represent Niagara Falls as a city councillor today.", "As you can imagine, our city is incredibly supportive of the Terry Fox Run. Every year, local MPs, the mayor, his family, city councillors and local high schools all support the run. My daughter, who goes to St. Mike’s, is a cheerleader, and they’re there, cheering on the runners.", "Our city has a proud history of supporting the run. The chair of the first Terry Fox Run committee in 1985 was Dan D’Addio, a man with a big heart who himself has also been recognized by the city of Niagara Falls.", "I’d also like to take a moment and recognize Les—I’m going to try to get this name right—Potapczyk, for being the chair of the Terry Fox Run committee in Niagara Falls. Because of his incredible hard work, and the volunteers, the event is an amazing success every year.", "It’s so great to see our community come together and support such a worthy cause.", "Thanks to Terry’s work and his incredible life, millions of dollars have been raised to fight cancer. Every year, treatments are advancing, and people who Terry never met get to live full and wonderful lives because of the work he started. Terry Fox makes us all proud to be Canadian.", "Mr. Speaker, as we celebrate 35 years of the Marathon of Hope, I encourage everyone to consider participating in this year’s Terry Fox Run in their own community. By continuing on Terry’s Marathon of Hope, we become an example of all the great things this country stands for: compassion and the ability to work together.", "Working together, we can recognize Terry’s dream of curing cancer. I think that’s all our dream because we’ve all been touched by cancer in some way or another with our family members. Working together—I like using those words, “working together”—we can make sure that Terry Fox lives on in all of us. We can commemorate a true hero and pay homage to his incredible spirit.", "I’m happy to support any motion that gives recognition to Terry Fox. There are very few people who are more deserving. I’d like to commend the member for taking the time to make sure that Terry receives the recognition he deserves. It may not be much, but it is the least we can do for such a great man.", "Mr. Speaker, I’m happy to stand in this House today and pay tribute to one of this country’s greatest heroes, a man whose story inspires not only us here in Ontario but people from around the world.", "I want to finish this by pointing out one fact: When Terry began his Marathon of Hope, he was running to raise one dollar for every Canadian in the name of fighting cancer. At that time, we had 23 million people living in Canada. Though people admired Terry, they thought it couldn’t be done. They thought he’d never be able to raise that amount of money in 1980. As this story illustrates, Terry was never afraid of hope. To this day—now think about this—over $650 million has been raised in Terry’s name to fight cancer. That’s why I talked about the Niagara Falls story earlier in this: because people didn’t realize the courage that had happened in 1980. They didn’t realize what was going on but they certainly do today.", "I want to finish by saying that although Terry is no longer with us, make no mistake about it, his marathon and his life continue to give us hope." ],

  "text" : [ "I want to begin by thanking the member from Scarborough–Agincourt, Soo Wong, for bringing this forward. It’s such an incredibly simple, obvious and good idea that I’m a little disappointed I didn’t think about it myself, actually, to tell you the truth, Soo. It’s obviously a great idea, and I have no doubt this will be roundly supported by all in the House.", "Speaker, the word “hero” is a word perhaps that gets used a little bit too loosely in our society today; at least that’s something that I’ve always felt. I try not to assign the term too easily. I have two in my life who I have always thought of and who have inspired me. The first one: I can remember growing up as a young man, being inspired by Martin Luther King and listening to him speak and seeing what he was doing, understanding probably that he was putting his life at risk and on the line for what he was doing. The other hero for me, without a doubt, was Terry Fox. I have two pictures hanging on the wall of my constituency office. One is of Martin Luther King, and the other one is of Terry Fox.", "Clearly what this young man at the time has managed to accomplish is quite remarkable, and I think there’s nobody who would dispute that in the chamber here today.", "I’ve had the pleasure of being a political representative for going on 19 years now, six on Thunder Bay city council and into my 13th year here in the provincial Legislature. In all of that time, I’ve had the good fortune to meet a lot of interesting people, like all of us do, but I can tell you, in my going on 19 years, I’ve asked for the opportunity to have my picture taken only once with somebody. I felt like I was intruding in their space. It was when Terry Fox’s parents were in Thunder Bay for the dedication of the monument to mark the end of Terry’s run. Rolly and Betty Fox were in Thunder Bay to mark the moving of the monument from one side of the highway to the other—a really incredible monument and a great testament to what Terry did. I would encourage you, if you’re driving through Thunder Bay, to stop and take a look and visit that site.", "They were there for the re-dedication. I can remember going up to them and saying, “Listen, would you mind if I had a photograph taken with you?”—such was the impact of their son on me and many others. It’s a photograph that, to this day, I very much cherish.", "We think of him and what he has done, obviously, for cancer research—as we’ve heard, $650 million and counting—but I can’t help but focus at least just a little bit on the fact that this young man ran the equivalent of a marathon a day, for 142 consecutive days, on one leg.", "Now, if anybody else—and I heard my colleague across the way say he’s a runner, as am I. I’ve run a handful of marathons. I know what it feels like. I know the training that goes into running one. Terry Fox ran 142 of them, on consecutive days, on one leg. The athletic achievement of what he managed to accomplish just is hard to compare. It may be one of the greatest athletic achievements of all time. We tend not to think about it, necessarily, in that regard.", "I think that this idea is so obvious, so good, so strong and so powerful, to continue supporting this young man. We were all drawn in to his aura. I think when we saw him interviewed, he was so humble. He was so easily able to connect with all of us. He had an aura about him, I think, that to this day is perpetuated and is maintained, and it’s one of the reasons why his run every September is still so successful.", "I participate—not every year, but as many years as I can. I thank my good buddy Donny Morrison, in Thunder Bay, and the Rotarians and all the other volunteers who get together to continue to help to perpetuate Terry’s memory through fundraising events like that one—a truly remarkable story, a great Canadian hero, if I could close by saying that. He truly fits the bill. It was a great pleasure for me to meet with his family very briefly.", "Again, I want to close by thanking our member for bringing this forward. It’s long overdue and an absolutely fantastic idea." ],

I would be hard-pressed to think of a more deserving Canadian than Terry Fox—his unselfish determination to bring attention to the impact that cancer is having on our society today and the need to make the search for a cure such a public priority.", "Let’s, for a moment, think of what this young man accomplished. Through his determination, this young man organized a walk across this great country of ours, literally on one leg, getting halfway, to Thunder Bay, before he was stopped by the cancer that eventually took his life.", "I’m sure there were many days, especially at the start and through the province of Quebec, when he thought he was wasting the short time that he had left—days of bad weather, rain and snow, and through a great amount of pain; days where very few people bothered to show up or even acknowledge that the venture was under way. But he endured and never gave up.", "This single act of endurance acted like a lightning rod to bring Canadians together to make cancer fundraising and research the number one priority of Canadians over the last 35 years. This research has allowed great strides to be made in the development of the treatment and cures of many of the different types of cancer. In fact, if Terry was alive today, he would likely have survived the cancer that took his life.", "But we have so much more to do. Canadians have rallied to continue his fight. I am proud to say that although I haven’t participated in every one of the Marathon of Hope events, I have been able to walk, run or bike through most.", "Our community, like most communities in our country, continues to host this terrific annual event. Volunteers work hard, spending weeks and months planning and hosting this wonderful event. What results is the world’s largest one-day fundraiser for cancer research—raising more than $650 million to combat this terrible disease.", "Everyone knows so many people who have succumbed to cancer. Both my wife and I lost our dads to cancer, watching helplessly as they suffered through their final days. Back then, cancer took no prisoners. Over the years, many people have suffered the same fate with this terrible disease. So many people in our community—I can think of Joan P. MacDonald, Bev Schaefer, Sylvia Thomson, Ray “Gill” McDonell and many others who have left a mark in the community—all left us far too young because of this terrible disease.", "But there is good news. Because of the work Terry Fox started, and continued by so many others, many types of cancer are curable today, and many other people are living longer and more comfortably than those who suffered not so long ago.", "But there is much more to do. It is our duty to keep Terry’s memory alive by continuing the fight he started 35 years ago to find the cure for all these many different types of cancer. I trust this bill will pull all parties together to support this worthwhile endeavour to honour this young Canadian who, through great personal sacrifice, took up the fight against this terrible disease and whose initiative has brought us so far along in this terrible battle.", "I thank the member for Scarborough–Agincourt for bringing this bill up. I trust and hope it has more success than Ted Chudleigh did on this side, who twice put this bill through and never was able to actually see it finally put into law.", "I think all members of the House are supporting this bill and would like to see it not only pass today, but move through, so we can finally acknowledge this great Canadian. Thank you." ],

  "text" : [ "This bill honours Terry Fox, one of our true national heroes. Terry Fox may not have been from Ontario, but he was, without question, a great Canadian.", "He was born in Manitoba and grew up in British Columbia. He prepared for his Marathon of Hope by running a marathon in Prince George, BC. His run began in St. John’s, Newfoundland, and he ran through Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick and Quebec before reaching Ontario.", "Think about that achievement, Speaker. After battling cancer and losing a leg, Terry Fox had the energy and determination to run long distance in seven of our 10 provinces.", "Terry crossed into Ontario at the town of Hawkesbury on the last Saturday in June. He was met by hundreds of residents, a brass band playing and thousands of balloons. The OPP gave him an escort through the province.", "It was perfectly timed and fitting that Terry Fox, one of our greatest Canadians, entered Canada’s capital city on July 1, 1980. It is now called Canada Day, but back then it was still known as Dominion Day. In Ottawa, he met the Governor General and the Prime Minister. In front of 16,000 fans he performed the ceremonial kickoff at the CFL game between the Ottawa Rough Riders and the Saskatchewan Roughriders. There’s another historical fact: Back in the day, we had two CFL teams called the Roughriders.", "On July 11, Terry Fox reached Toronto, where he was greeted by a crowd of 10,000 people. On July 14, Terry reached my home city of Hamilton. He spoke in front of an enthralled crowd at the Royal Botanical Gardens. In Hamilton, 1960 Canadian marathon champion Gord Dickson gave Terry his gold medal. Gord Dickson’s words were that “the young fellow was running the greatest race of all” time.", "Over the next two months, Terry continued his run through our great province of Ontario. He made it just as far as Thunder Bay, where he was forced to halt his run on September 1.", "It’s fitting that Terry Fox was a sporting star before he became a national hero. When he was growing up, Terry played soccer, rugby and baseball. Initially, he only took up cross-country running to impress his junior high school basketball coach. Even though he wasn’t the tallest, his real passion for basketball and his sheer perseverance earned him a starting position on his high school team. In grade 12, he shared his high school athlete of the year award with his best friend.", "The ordeal of cancer treatment, chemotherapy and a leg amputation didn’t hold this young man back. It fired his determination to succeed, to live his life as he wished and to help others find courage to fight this terrible disease.", "He won three national titles in wheelchair basketball and he was named an all-star by the North American Wheelchair Basketball Association—quite a feat.", "The story of Terry Fox has been a source of inspiration to those battling cancer for 35 years now. It’s incredible to think how time has flown. Most Ontarians weren’t even born when Terry was making his monumental run, but the memory and inspiration of Terry Fox lives on among our young people. They don’t need to see him on live TV or read about him in the daily newspapers to be inspired by his story and his message. Each September, schools throughout Canada organize their own Terry Fox Runs in support of cancer research. This year, Terry Fox National School Run Day will be held on September 30. This bill before us proclaims the second Sunday after Labour Day in each year to be Terry Fox Day. I can think of no more perfect day, as that is the day each year on which tens of thousands of Ontarians and Canadians take part in the annual Terry Fox Run.", "The Terry Fox Run is the largest one-day fundraiser for cancer research, not only in Canada, but the world. Over $650 million has been raised worldwide for cancer research in Terry’s name. Speaker, that’s incredible: a solid, concrete achievement by this young man. We should recognize that it’s an achievement shared by all those who take part in the Terry Fox Run and help organize it. We can only estimate how many lives have been saved by this research and because of the flame that Terry lit. He shone light on the poor state of cancer research funding at the time, and he was an inspiration to millions.", "Terry Fox has been honoured in cities, towns and villages across Canada. There are 14 schools and 15 roads in Canada named after Terry. He was the youngest person ever named as a Companion of the Order of Canada. Back in 2004, the CBC produced a television series and held public votes to determine who were the greatest Canadians. At the top of that list, who did we find? Tommy Douglas and Terry Fox: two true heroes of Canada who, in very different ways, contributed so much to the health care of Canadians.", "Canadians truly value their health, and it shows. British Columbia has recently enacted a law proclaiming the second Sunday after Labour Day in each year to be Terry Fox Day. Their first Terry Fox Day will be held this September, and in fact, if we can quickly manage to get this bill through reading and royal assent, Ontario can match BC in having its first Terry Fox Day this September too.", "I support this bill, and I hope it has better sailing than the average private member’s bill does. Let’s get this bill passed so that Ontario will have a Terry Fox Day in September. Let’s not allow BC to have the only gold medal; we want a share in that gold medal.", "I also, in closing, would like to congratulate the member from Scarborough–Agincourt for this fine endeavour. We certainly are 100% behind you." ],

In my wholehearted support, I would like to share some of my experiences with this young man.", "When Terry Fox ended his Marathon of Hope outside Thunder Bay in 1980, I was working as a pediatric nurse just down the street here at SickKids in Toronto. Terry’s courageous journey touched us all. It was particularly meaningful to many of us working in pediatric oncology at SickKids at the time. We were surrounded each day by children and young adults engaged in their own difficult, and sometimes unsuccessful, battles with cancer.", "Children and their parents were glued to the television set, not only watching Terry run a marathon every day, but running a marathon on a right-leg prosthesis. It was incredible. They watched him struggle and persevere in order to raise awareness and to raise funds in support of cancer research. These patients and their parents told me about how inspired they were in their own struggles—their own journeys—by Terry’s Marathon of Hope. His run was about raising money, but for these folks it was also about the strength and the courage to fight, despite incredibly difficult circumstances. Terry helped patients all over Canada and all over the world to find the strength within themselves to fight on.", "Terry’s run brought to the forefront of people’s minds the terrible impacts of cancer. It caused all of us to stand up and take notice, and motivated us to work for change. We were inspired by the Marathon of Hope, not only as Canadians, but people all over the world as well.", "I was speaking to my intern Clare about Terry’s legacy the other day and she told me about her experiences moving from British Columbia, Terry’s home, to Hong Kong as a young child. She was nervous to move to an unfamiliar city, but arriving in the fall, she was surprised to find she could participate in a Terry Fox Run in her new city. This demonstrates how universal the story and spirit of Terry Fox is. We can participate here in Canada or halfway around the world, but the message remains the same: We must work to support the research that continues to find cures and treatments for cancer.", "Many of the children who I met in the pediatric oncology unit at SickKids were suffering from leukemia. Leukemia disproportionately affects children and accounts for one third of childhood cancers. Most of the children had ALL, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, which makes up about 80% of all cases of leukemia.", "In the 35 years since Terry’s run, the survival rate for ALL has risen steadily and is now around 85%. Children with ALL are now much more likely to live long and happy lives, and the $650 million raised by Terry Fox Runs across the world has been instrumental in funding the research that has gotten us to this point.", "There are two annual runs in my riding, one in Ayr and one in Cambridge. Members of our community come together to walk, jog and run with their families and friends to remember Terry and to raise money. I’m proud to participate each year, and to contribute to a global movement that has meant so much to so many.", "Again, I am honoured to rise today to speak in support of this bill to institute a day to officially honour Terry Fox. We Ontarians can take this day each year to look back on what Terry Fox has meant to us.", "Congratulations to the member for Scarborough–Agincourt for bringing this worthy bill forward." ],

Terry, who lost his leg in 1977 as a result of bone cancer, wanted to run across Canada and raise money for cancer research and awareness. After a fairly quiet beginning in St. John’s, Newfoundland, the Marathon of Hope quickly gained momentum, and Terry Fox became a household hero and star as he worked his way across our country over the next four and a half months.", "His fierce determination and remarkable personal courage captured the hearts of Canadians and raised awareness of the need to find a cure for cancer. As has been said here in the Legislature today, he ran 40 kilometres every day for 143 days before his disease forced him to stop halfway across the country. It came to an end on September 1 of that year in Thunder Bay, when they discovered that the cancer had returned to his body, and he died the following June 28.", "But since that day, a remarkable $650 million has been raised in his name worldwide through the Terry Fox Foundation, and he truly inspired many Canadians to carry on where he left off. Now, over 800 communities across Canada have Terry Fox Runs one Sunday each year in September, when participants walk, jog and bike in memory of Terry Fox, and run his historic Marathon of Hope. I believe it is the world’s largest one-day fundraiser for cancer research.", "Certainly in my riding, the Terry Fox Run is held in communities including Beaverton, Bobcaygeon, Haliburton, Lindsay and Minden, and I usually participate in one of them. There are thousands of volunteers, like Diane Peacock, the chair of the Minden Terry Fox Run, who emailed me right away to say, “Terry Fox Day: We need it.” I knew that the member for Scarborough–Agincourt was already on it, and I said, “We are going to be debating it.” I asked Diane to come down today—she couldn’t make it—but I’m sure she’s already planning next year’s Terry Fox Run.", "I just want to say to the member for Scarborough–Agincourt: Well done.

He has been something we all aspire to as individuals, and certainly, for those who are suffering with the challenges of cancer, he has done something that simply nobody else in the world has been able to do.", "He’s impacted other people in a variety of ways. I want to tell you about somebody who lives in Oakville. Her name is Lisa Moody. She was 13 years old when she drew inspiration from Terry Fox. She joined her first run in a wheelchair. She’s done every single run since, for the past 25 years, and now she participates with her own daughter in the annual walk we have in Coronation Park in Oakville.", "There was a gentleman named Darrell Atherley. He was a power walker. He participated in more than 25 races and events before bladder cancer took his life. Atherley founded Team Darrell, and his family has continued the tradition since then. They have raised about $130,000 over about a five-year period.", "Every year the Oakville community really comes out for the Terry Fox Run and two individuals have made that possible. I know that this takes place in a number of other communities across the country and throughout the world, but there are two individuals in particular who worked tirelessly to make this really the number one event in my community of Oakville.", "The first is Ralph Robinson, the ward 1 councillor in Oakville. He started the Terry Fox Run in Oakville and he organized the event himself for 25 years. There’s a quote from Darrell Fox about Ralph. He says, “I have had the opportunity and the pleasure to meet Ralph on numerous occasions over the 25 years he has been the Terry Fox Run organizer in Oakville. He has served Terry and his dream of eradicating cancer....”", "Today we’re joined in the members’ gallery by my friend and colleague, Pam Damoff, the Ward 2 councillor in Oakville. She took on the role of event organizer and she’s been breaking records with the participation and the funds that are raised every year. Last year’s run was a record in the relatively small community of Oakville. We, alone, raised $125,000 in one, single run. I’m really happy that Pam’s able to be here today to watch this debate because I know how much it means to her. She’s taken the run in Oakville and made it an even bigger event. She plans a kickoff breakfast every year; this year it’s April 17. She’s going to be seeking support from her own colleagues on Oakville council for a Terry Fox Day in her own community.", "Today we have been able to move ahead so far in cancer research. I think other people have spoken about the progress we’ve made.", "I would note also that the Thunder Bay monument that was spoken about so eloquently by the Minister of Natural Resources, the member for Thunder Bay—there’s an Oakville connection there as well. That monument was sculpted by Manfred, who is an artist in Oakville.", "I’m so pleased to see this before us today. The tone of the debate today has been spectacular.

At that moment he said that if his Marathon of Hope could raise $1 from every Canadian, he would be so pleased. That was his goal at 22 years old: $24 million. Of course now we talk about how annually that same Marathon of Hope is raising $30 million a year across the world. If that isn’t an example of passion and vision and someone who we should be honouring with the Terry Fox Day then I don’t know who else we would choose. The young man—he was a man but he was a young man—had already had so many obstacles put in his place and yet at 22 years old he said, “My goal is to raise $24 million for cancer research; $1 for every Canadian.” Has he not achieved that in spades?", "Well done to you, Soo—sorry, Scarborough–Agincourt, for bringing forward this great initiative. I hope we can see it come to fruition because he really has empowered and made people passionate that they really can deal with this dastardly thing that we call cancer.

It is the act that makes an agency FOI-able, so that you can file for freedom of access to information. It is the act that makes it the responsibility of an agency to report on their finances: their use of consultants and how they spend their money. They have to report to the government on this information yearly. This is the first part of the bill: The Broader Public Sector Accountability Act will now apply to a large amount of health agencies that presently are not covered.", "That act already applies to our hospitals, but as soon as you take a service or a program from our hospitals and put it into the community, then the act doesn’t apply anymore.", "With this bill, it doesn’t matter if programs and services are not offered by our hospitals anymore, and that they are offered in the community. We will be able to make sure that the same accountability and transparency will apply to them. Whether they’re called out-of-hospital premises, independent health facilities, private clinics, the LHINs, the CCACs, the long-term-care agencies, the home care agencies—you name it—if they get more than a million dollars, all put together, in health care money, they are covered.", "The second part of the bill is what is called the sunshine list. The sunshine list, here again, is a measure of transparency and accountability. The sunshine list: For anybody who makes more than $100,000 a year, their salary is reported for everybody to see.", "What will that mean? The sunshine list already applies to a big part of the health care system. You look right now, and everybody who works for a hospital or works for a community health centre—we already see who makes over $100,000 a year. With this new bill, all of the other health care agencies that are big enough to make over a million dollars a year will have to report.", "Here again, if you look at things like out-of-hospital premises—this is, I think, the Herzig Eye Institute, the Kensington institutes; the people who do the colonoscopies; some of the physiotherapy clinics that bill OHIP. Think of independent health facilities. Those are the labs, the technical aspects of health care, that sometimes happen outside of our hospitals. They will be covered. If they receive more than a million dollars, they will be covered. They will have to submit to the sunshine list, and we will see.", "The third part of the bill is to give the Auditor General the powers to audit those agencies. The Auditor General right now has the power to audit a lot of health care agencies. We call them transfer payment agencies. The Auditor General can go into our hospitals, our community health centres. She can go into our mental health agencies and children’s mental health agencies. But as soon as they become private, she’s not allowed to go in. Now the bill will extend the power of the Auditor General so that if there is something going on—and she has good ways of keeping an eye on things—she will be allowed to go and do an audit.", "This is taxpayers’ money. This is the Ministry of Health’s money. Out of the $52 billion that we spend on health care, a very small part right now is covered by the Auditor General. I want to make that part bigger.", "The fourth one, something that we have been working on for a long time, is Ombudsman oversight. For all of those private entities out there, all of those independent health facilities, out-of-hospital premises etc., if a person has a complaint about the care that they receive, they will be able to put their complaints to the Ombudsman.", "The fifth part of the bill is that we will have disclosure of the OHIP billings of everybody who bills over $100,000.", "I have here in front of me a Medical Services Commission financial statement for the year-end, ending March 31, 2004, from British Columbia. Many other provinces already do this. I can read to you all of the people in British Columbia who received money from their OHIP—it’s not called OHIP, because it’s British Columbia, but it’s the same thing—and how much they bill. They’ve been doing this for decades. It’s a good tool for transparency and accountability.", "Those are the five big steps of the bill.", "Why am I doing this? I’m doing this because, after having spent two years looking at Ornge, it became clear that between Dr. Mazza, the CEO of Ornge, his board chair, Mr. Rainer Beltzner, as well as their lawyer, Mr. Alfred Apps, they had decided to privatize pretty well every single action and program of Ornge, or air ambulance services. They had decided to privatize them. Their goal was that they were supposed to make money in the private system to invest back into the not-for-profit Ornge. The reality was completely different. The reality is that hundreds of millions of dollars that were supposed to provide care to people who needed air ambulance services got diverted.", "When the Auditor General went in, he had a very tough time because they were quick to show, “Oh, no, our HR is privatized; you cannot have a look. Oh, no, our airplane maintenance has been privatized; you are not allowed to look into those books.” The list went on and on, to the point where it seems like the only purpose of privatizing part of their operations was to be shielded from the oversight and shielded from the accountability that exist in other parts of our health care system.", "To this point, our Minister of Health is on record dozens of times saying that when she found out—it was a woman at the time, Minister Matthews—that the CEO of Ornge was making $1.4 million, that rang the alarm bell for her. She called the board into her office, and things changed quite quickly at Ornge.", "I’m telling you, Speaker, had we had the sunshine list apply to the private entity of Ornge, we would never have been in this mess to start out with. We would have known. Had we had Ombudsman oversight of Ornge, we would have known for a long time, because the Ombudsman had received many, many complaints against Ornge for the poor services they were providing. But all he could do was say, “I’m sorry; I don’t have oversight of Ornge.”", "Had we had those pieces in place, I am convinced that we would not have witnessed the demolition of our air ambulance services the way we did for so many years. We would not be in the situation we are now in where we see them basically trying to be reborn from their ashes, because Ornge was pretty much destroyed for those years when they went on with their private enterprise.", "A very telling part came when we received the review of Ornge air ambulance transport by the Office of the Chief Coroner of Ontario. The Office of the Chief Coroner of Ontario reviewed hundreds of deaths that had happened within the air ambulance system; 40 of them were worthy of investigation. Out of the 40, there are eight that are suspicious. One of my colleagues will go into further detail as to what had happened to those people. Needless to say, he found five cases where it was a possible impact, one case where there was a probable impact and two cases where it was a definite impact on the death of the person. For these eight people, their family, their friends and their loved ones, I think we owe it to them to pass this bill.", "That was only one part of the motivation. The second part of the motivation comes from the diluted chemo drugs. I and eight of my colleagues from all sides of the House reviewed what had happened. Again, one of my colleagues who was also on the committee with me will go into more detail as to what exactly went wrong. Needless to say, from all sides of the House, we all agree that we want the Broader Public Sector Accountability Act to be expanded to include people. We want the Public Sector Salary Disclosure Act—this is the sunshine list—to be more inclusive, to be extended. We also want extension to the role of the Office of the Auditor General. That was a report that all parties agreed to and all parties want to happen.", "What I brought forward in this bill is, I took the recommendations from Ornge and the recommendations from the diluted chemo drugs, I put them together, and I put them in a bill. This is Bill 78, which is in front of you right now.", "We have some oversight when it comes to the quality of the services that are offered in private clinics through the CPSO, but we have no oversight whatsoever as to what happens to the money. Bill 78 is really a way to create oversight, accountability and transparency so that the billions of dollars that are spent in health care—we have a way to look as to where they went and if they’re providing good care to us. Thank you, Speaker." ],

Last year, I put forward a private member’s bill that dealt with disclosure of expenses, which became part of government legislation. I’m very proud of that.", "I also know that the member has had success as well with putting forward ideas that have gone into bills that have gone forward in government. We have such a bill before the House right now, Bill 45.", "As I said, I support the bill and the principles of the bill. I do have some concerns.", "I want to touch on the diluted chemo, because I did have the opportunity last year to join the committee for a few sessions. I understand the concern that she expressed, specifically with corporations that are created with the public as a shareholder, that operate outside our oversight. I think there was a case of a purchasing organization that was actually totally a public shareholder. I not only have concerns about how the function of that company is, but how the money flows from those companies back and forth.", "When I look at the bill—and I think it’s important that we debate it—I do think there are challenges when we start to talk about oversight and accountability inside a private company. That could be problematic. I think there may be ways of doing that that may be as effective and a little bit more workable. I’d like to look a bit more at the bill in terms of what its interplay is with Bill 8, which was passed in December, because there are a number of measures in there, and also in Bill 10, that I believe are similar.", "I would like to speak to the oversight of the Auditor General, again for private companies. That’s something, I think, that is somewhat problematic, but there’s probably a way of achieving what you need to achieve, because we do want to know. Perhaps any company that is accepting public funds has to be an open and transparent company in terms of providing yearly statements.", "When we talk about the sunshine list, which is essentially a good thing—there was a perverse effect from it, because it became an uncapped salary grid. What happened was, because we didn’t have caps in place for salaries, it actually drove salaries up. That’s a concern that I’ve always had with that. I think it’s the right thing to do. I just don’t think that the consequences of it were fully thought out or that we prepared for what might happen, which would again be looking at salary caps.", "It’s the same kind of concern over the OHIP billing. Obviously, they do it in other jurisdictions. The member’s bill does express a concern about people comparing apples and oranges. My concern would be the same, of that happening inside that profession and creating some of the problems that we’ve had with the sunshine list.", "Again, I’m going to support this bill. I support it. I think it’s important that we debate this. I will look forward to, hopefully, getting it to committee and having further discussion about it." ],

But she told you of her long experience both in looking into Ornge and into the chemotherapy drug dilution problem. So she comes forward with a very—it’s a very complex bill probably for those listening at home to try to decipher. We just have a few minutes in debate, but I’ll hit on some of the topics.", "Basically, it extends aspects of the Broader Public Sector Accountability Act, Public Sector Salary Disclosure Act and the Ombudsman Act. I won’t be able to touch on all of them in the few minutes that I have—but she mentioned Ornge. It’s a huge issue. It dominated the news. It should never have happened. It could have had more Ministry of Health oversight, really. As the ministry, they could have watched Ornge, which provides our air ambulance service for the province of Ontario.", "There is a lot of accountability that does lie with the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, that they had to watch what was going on. I believe they would have and should have known that Dr. Chris Mazza’s salary was absolutely outrageous, out of control. It was an organization that had grown beyond what it was supposed to do but, again, did not have the oversight from the Ministry of Health to keep it in check, which is what needs to happen with the ministries.", "The member from Nickel Belt has addressed aspects she’d like to see changed to watch that oversight and that that does not happen again. It was just a situation in Ornge that we will not want to see occur again.", "The diluted chemotherapy scandals that came forward: I know that the member who is my seatmate—the member from Elgin–Middlesex–London, just to make sure I’ve got his riding right—sat on that. He is a health care professional also, being a pharmacist. We certainly relied on his expertise. I just want to note that it was the Peterborough Regional Health Centre, which is a regional health centre for my riding, that was the first to pick up on the labelling—with the dilution problem with the chemotherapy drugs.", "When that was brought up, there was a group purchasing organization, which is GPO, which is really partly owned, if not fully owned, by hospitals. It is under the Medbuy group.", "There is some accountability in respect to that, in the fact that Medbuy, owned by the hospitals, receives rebates from drug companies—for bulk companies. That money is then to go back to hospitals. We don’t know where that money is spent once it goes back into the hospitals, how it’s put into the health care system.", "Again, this is part of what the member from Nickel Belt is trying to address in this bill, about accountability of where the monies all go—who makes what, whose property, especially when it’s the taxpayers’ OHIP paying a lot of the bills. I commend her for wanting that oversight.", "I just want to say that one more part from the committee that was looking into the diluted chemotherapy drug scandal was that hospital pharmacies now have to be licensed and basically regulated by the Ontario College of Pharmacists. I want to, again, commend the member from Elgin–Middlesex–London, who was on that, who brought that forward. That didn’t exist, and most of us would not know that did not exist.", "Those are a few parts that this bill will help address.", "I know other members of my caucus want to speak to this bill.", "I commend the member from Nickel Belt for bringing this through. She has had many years of trying to decipher what is wrong in this system. Thank you, again, for bringing it forward." ],

I believe that Bill 78 is a step in the right direction.

I didn’t sleep at all that night.", "“The next morning I called the hospital’s ‘info line’ and was told they could not confirm whether or not my chemo had been affected.", "“They told me I would be notified and eventually I was.", "“I wish I had not heard about the dilution through the media but then I also wondered if I ever would have known had the media not reported on it.", "“The journey with cancer is like a roller coaster ride, first you are up and then you are down, etc., etc.", "“It isn’t a journey for the faint of heart. None of us on this journey deserved this but I believe we all hope that a scandal like this never happens again.”", "Here’s a personal story that I’m reading from a constituent in London, Virginia Offen. As I read that, my hair is standing up on my forearms, because it’s a very emotional thing to talk about, somebody having a compromised health treatment in our health care system. Because we have 100% trust when we obtain some kind of treatment for cancer—we’re using that example—and for that trust to be broken shakes people to their core. So I commend the health critic in the NDP for making sure that there’s going to be a gap that’s closed. They’re going to close that loophole so that oversight is actually going to be actionable and this kind of thing hopefully never happens again. This is a preventative so that this won’t occur, so that people won’t be questioning their health care system and the treatment they get.", "So I just want to say thank you to the health critic and the member from Welland for doing all that hard work on the committee. It sounds like people believe in this bill, and I’m looking forward to it continuing through the House and going to committee and coming back for third reading." ],

This is a system that millions of people can rely on daily and that we’re very proud of. This government is proud of the way this system is able to respond to the health care needs of the residents living in this province.", "As great as our system is, we have to realize, of course, that there’s always room for improvement and we always have to work at being better. We realize that effectiveness and efficiency aren’t the only two requirements of a great health care system. Along with these two requirements we need a system that is transparent and that holds administrators accountable.", "We need to hold ourselves to an even higher standard. Our priority is to ensure that Ontarians feel that their health care system is not only working effectively for them but is also accountable to them.", "Being open and transparent about the way health care is administered in this province creates peace of mind for the people of Ontario and for all of us who are using the system. This is particularly important when considering the heightened stress and vulnerability that accompany many patients. As we evolve to become more accountable to patients and their families, we need to take the necessary steps to be transparent. This will help patients and their families to make well-informed decisions about their health and their health care needs.", "A focus on transparency in our health care system was outlined in our Patients First: Action Plan for Health Care. It was noted in the action plan that we recognize that Ontarians want their health care system to be transparent and accountable, and they want to know that it will deliver results for patients now and in the future.", "The action plan also noted that “Giving Ontarians more information about how health care works and opportunities to provide their perspectives on their care will help identify how the system can work better.”", "Our Patients First action plan will support Ontarians to make healthier choices, help prevent disease and illness, engage Ontarians on health care so we can fully understand their needs and concerns, focus on people and not just their illness, and, finally, help us be more transparent in health care so Ontarians can make more informed decisions.", "While our government’s commitment to openness and transparency is unwavering, we must also be mindful of the significant privacy concerns that exist for our patients.", "There are concerns that I have about Bill 78. Examples of such concerns are prevalent throughout the health care system, but when it comes to the Information and Privacy Commissioner, the commissioner has issued several orders on the issue of making doctors’ billings public. The Information and Privacy Commissioner has consistently held that the disclosure of an identified physician’s billings would invade a physician’s personal privacy under the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act. These are clearly delicate matters, and we need to remember that transparency needs to work hand in hand with Ontarians’ right to privacy. We need to continue to work on striking that balance.", "Another area of Bill 78 that I have concerns about, similar to my colleagues who spoke about this earlier, has to do with the parts referring to direct or indirect disclosure. On these items, being careful and moving forward sensitively are key, because we could be infringing on people’s personal rights.", "Mr. Speaker, I am proud that Minister Hoskins announced the first patient ombudsman. The patient ombudsman will be appointed to help people who have an unresolved complaint about their care at a hospital or long-term-care facility.", "I fully support increasing government’s accountability and transparency. We are dedicated to making our health care system more patient-focused, allowing people to work with their health care partners in making the best possible decisions about their health and health care. I support this bill." ],

  "text" : [ "I’m very happy to speak on Bill 78, the Transparent and Accountable Health Care Act, 2015.", "I want to start by mentioning the comment of the member from Halton. She said, “holds administrators accountable.” Well, I think that’s what it’s all about. It’s all about our health care system. The administrators are running the health care system right now, and running the hospitals. I’m not saying that’s a bad thing, but it wasn’t that long ago—when I was a kid—that it was more doctors who were the administrators making the tough decisions in the hospitals. I’m sure that doctors, being people, sometimes wanted to advance their own career, have more operating room time and things like that, but I really believe that the doctors put the patients first. I think that’s what it has to be all about.", "The reason for transparency and accountability: We have to realize that it’s not just about fairness, and it’s not just about making sure there is no corruption, such as the Ornge scandal and the electronic eHealth scandal; it’s also about how we put patients first, how we ensure that the tax dollars we collect, which are given in trust to us, are going for front-line health care where they are supposed to be going.", "The fact that at CCACs, where many of the front-line workers are earning fairly low salaries for home care, there are so many administrators on the sunshine list should cause some alarm. Maybe there should be a ratio between administrators’ salaries and front-line workers’ salaries. We shouldn’t see administrators earning salaries that much higher than front-line workers. Maybe there could be a system where front-line workers are doing a bit of the administrative work and it’s not so separate the way it is right now.", "In terms of physicians’ privacy, we all know that physicians sort of have the worst of both worlds: They’re government employees when it suits the government, and they’re self-employed business people the rest of the time. I think it behooves the members from the NDP and the Liberal party, and even some of the members from my own PC caucus, to make the tough decision in their minds: Which is it? We can’t expect doctors to pay rent, renovate offices, buy equipment, buy furnishings, pay staff salary, pay for staff training and pay for their own training—they have to do continuing education all the time—and then treat them as employees and say, “Well, we want to know what your billing is.”", "For the most part, they’re self-employed business people right now, in terms of their salaries and billing. Obviously, the doctors who do earn salaries—it’s fully disclosed when they are on salary. The reason we’re not putting more doctors on salaries is because we’re not finding it very cost-effective, or we would be doing more of it. The reality is that as soon as doctors are put on salaries, all of a sudden they’re not working to the same degree they now are.", "I would suggest that people here who are so anxious to have doctors’ salaries and billings disclosed should maybe spend some time in a specialist’s office and see how they take 10 minutes for lunch and maybe a five-minute break once in the morning and once in the afternoon, and most of them are there till way past when we’re all home.", "I think we’re getting our value out of our physicians in this province, and I think we have to ensure that health care dollars are going where they’re meant to go, and stop focusing on what the negative impacts are from that." ],

If you recall, on June 6, 2012, we gave a standing ovation to a man named Trevor Kidd. He was in the members’ gallery, and he made a deposition in front of the committee looking into air Ornge about the problems he had identified. He deserved that standing ovation—Trevor Kidd comes from my riding—because he quit his job as a paramedic at Ornge in disgust in 2009, after having knocked on so many doors and trying to find someone who would listen to him regarding the problems at air Ornge—the patient problems—and no one listened. He quit in disgust after no one listened, and eventually he ended up back at that committee as one of the witnesses who actually opened people’s eyes.", "So it’s not about dollars and cents. Some of the things that maybe could have been prevented if someone had listened to Trevor—and I’m going to read one of them from the Review of Ornge Air Ambulance Transport Related Deaths, from the coroner:", "“Case #1–Possible Impact", "“This 55-year-old man had a past medical history of heart disease. He presented to a community hospital in northern Ontario at 0620h with right-sided paralysis and severe weakness that he noted upon waking up that day. At 1500h he experienced a seizure lasting approximately 10 minutes. Medical imaging showed a blood clot in an artery in his brain. This was treated with appropriate medications, and arrangements were made for him to be transferred to a definitive care hospital in south-central Ontario.", "“The air ambulance was requested at 1752h. Ornge requested that the patient’s medication be changed prior to transport, which was done and confirmed with Ornge by 1840h. The air ambulance arrived at the patient at 2245h”—four hours—“and the patient arrived at the receiving hospital at 0315h. He died two days later.”", "That’s what this bill is about, because this didn’t happen 20 years ago; this happened a few years ago. There are all kinds of other organizations in the health care sector that need this oversight. There’s no guarantee right now that they’re getting it, just like there was no guarantee when this happened.", "That’s why this bill is so important today, and why I’m so happy that the member from Nickel Belt brought it forward." ],

We take tools that already exist and we make sure that the new way of providing health care is transparent and accountable.", "After spending two years looking at Ornge and six months looking at the diluted chemo drugs, I am certain that there are other Ornges out there.

I am convinced that what happened at Ornge, as we speak right now, could be happening in a number of other health care agencies.", "It is high time that we take the tools we have in this House, the bills that we have, and bring them up to speed as to how health care is delivered right now.

I’m honoured to rise in the House today to discuss Bill 76, An Act to encourage the purchase of vehicles that use natural gas as a fuel, or as I call it, the Natural Gas Superhighway Act, 2015.", "The reasoning behind the introduction of this bill is simple: natural gas, or LNG, as a transportation fuel is an opportunity to do what is right both for our natural environment and our business environment.", "In his 2012 report, A Question of Commitment: Review of the Ontario Government’s Climate Change Action Plan Results, the Ontario environmental commissioner reported that because of the sheer volume of cars and trucks on Ontario’s roads today, Ontario’s transportation sector continues to be the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the province. Over nine million vehicles on the road were registered in the province in 2010, and because of increased trade, the development of supply chain management systems and just-in-time delivery models, the number of large freight vehicles on the road has actually doubled in the last 25 years. Not surprisingly, this sector has witnessed a significant increase in its emissions.", "Today, of the nearly nine million vehicles on the road in Ontario, medium- and heavy-duty vehicles make up just 3% of the traffic, yet they contribute to 20% of greenhouse gas emissions.", "If the government of Ontario is really serious—and all of us should be—about reducing greenhouse gas emissions, then it’s time we look at offering a real alternative to those who operate medium- and heavy-duty vehicles in our province. One way to do that is by leveraging the ongoing development of Ontario’s vast gas deposits.", "Interest in natural gas as a transportation fuel isn’t new. Past support from federal, provincial and private-sector initiatives has led to over 35,000 light-duty natural gas vehicles, like buses, being put on the road in Canada. Unfortunately, because of previous market conditions, the critical market uptake needed to grow the NGV market did not occur, but as we are all well aware, in the last five years the access to a supply of readily available natural gas in North America has changed that story dramatically.", "New opportunities are being created across the continent. Canada and the United States have been given the opportunity to dramatically shift the current energy supply makeup and at the same time stimulate their slow-growth economies.", "In his 2012 State of the Union address, President Barack Obama stated just that: “We have a supply of natural gas that can last America” and North America over 100 years for sure. Experts believe this will support “more than 600,000 jobs by the end of the decade.”", "Don’t let this message be misconstrued. Natural gas is not the be-all and end-all of the energy supply; rather, it is a very significant piece of that puzzle, an extremely abundant, safe and affordable piece which is yet to be recognized for its full potential.", "Research and product development in the area of natural gas procurement and use is leading to innovative new technologies and product design that have the potential to reshape conventional thinking in many areas, most locally, as a reliable, heavy-duty transportation fuel. In fact, in its assessment of the resource, Natural Resources Canada identified medium- and heavy-duty on-road transportation as the greatest value proposition for natural gas transportation fuels moving forward.", "New, reliable truck engine technology that utilizes natural gas is giving America’s hard-hit cargo transportation sector a shot in the arm, reducing emissions, lowering transportation costs and delivering critical cost savings to industry’s bottom line. Heavy-duty truck manufacturers like Freightliner, Kenworth, Peterbilt and Volvo have all recently developed product lines to utilize liquefied natural gas.", "The Natural Gas Superhighway Act, 2015, aims to promote the use of liquefied natural gas, or LNG, as a freight transportation fuel in Ontario by accommodating its advanced engine technology and providing an incentive designed to stimulate private investment in its proven lower-carbon-emission medium- and heavy-duty vehicles.", "Specifically, the Natural Gas Superhighway Act, 2015, calls upon this Legislative Assembly of Ontario to enable a Lieutenant Governor in Council to make regulations prescribing higher weight limits for vehicles that use LNG as a transportation fuel. Just as a little example: Current road limits restrict vehicles to a gross weight of 63,500 kilograms. The equipment required to run the cleaner, cheaper liquefied natural gas can add as much as 1,500 kilograms to the weight of a truck tractor using the fuel versus trucks using more traditional fuel.", "In a day and age when transportation companies must maximize the use of their equipment to stay competitive, this small variance in weight allowance is enough to keep companies from taking advantage of the lower-greenhouse-gas-producing natural gas transportation fuels in Ontario.", "Moreover, the Natural Gas Superhighway Act requires the Ministry of Transportation to table a progress report to this Legislative Assembly annually until the regulations are made that support the use of liquefied natural gas.", "We ask for this because we understand that not everything can be done overnight, but what industry is asking for is that this government recognize the importance of natural gas as a transportation fuel. With that show of support from this government and all of the opposition parties, I have heard from many private operators who believe that heavy-duty LNG vehicles are the logical choice for their company. These same companies tell me that they are eager to make investments in Ontario by building infrastructure like refineries, refueling stations and maintenance facilities needed to support this next generation in transportation fuel.", "For an example, one needs to look no further than my riding of Sarnia–Lambton, where Royal Dutch Shell has plans in place to build one of Canada’s largest LNG plants to support the use of liquefied natural gas as a transportation fuel for Ontario’s hard-working Great Lakes freighters. Many companies are making those conversions to LNG as they buy new ships. Anyone looking at this should be able to recognize the incredible opportunity that exists for the on-the-road transportation fuel sector.", "My natural gas bill would also provide for a non-refundable tax credit—half of the Ontario portion of the HST, or 4%—for seven years to taxpayers who purchase these vehicles: trucks, ships and trains. I didn’t mention that this is also being looked at by the rail transportation companies that use LNG or natural gas or CNG as a fuel. This credit is intended as a small incentive to help truck owners and fleet operators transition their fuel over time from the traditional fuels to the new, cleaner-burning natural gas, building that critical mass in industry and speeding the reduction of greenhouse gases from traditional sources.", "Thanks to similar incentives and with an expected fuel cost savings of between 20% and 30%, many major American trucking companies are already taking the important first steps to transition to natural gas as a fuel source. Moreover, our neighbours, the province of Quebec, have taken early action by offering fiscal incentives to encourage commercial fleets to also make these adjustments—tax measures such as accelerated capital cost allowance on new trucks; instituting something called PEET, which is the program for improving energy efficiency in road, rail and marine, which funds up to $15,000 per truck for alternative fuels—this is in Quebec; and investing in infrastructure for what they call the “blue corridor,” which is essentially the Quebec portion of the MacDonald-Cartier or the Windsor-Quebec City transportation and manufacturing corridor.", "In addition, Alberta has also updated their highway regulations to allow for increased weight allowances for LNG trucks on their roads, and they’ve opened three heavy-duty natural gas refueling stations along the Calgary to Edmonton route.", "British Columbia has created a $104-million natural gas for transportation incentive program which reimburses up to 80% of the price differential between a natural gas vehicle and a diesel vehicle.", "All of this activity is driving investment in the private sector across Canada. Robert transport of Quebec has invested in over 180 LNG trucks over three years. Many of those trucks run into Toronto every day. Vedder Transport of Abbotsford has invested in 50 LNG trucks. Waste Management both here in Ontario and in BC have invested in over 40 CNG trucks. Gaz Métro, which is in Quebec, has invested in five private LNG stations along the “blue corridor.” Shell, Encana and Ferus Inc. are also investing in LNG facilities. All told, these private companies are representing a more than $350-million investment in the private sector.", "Yet the main artery of Ontario’s once-proud manufacturing economy, the Windsor-Quebec corridor, has virtually no share of that investment, despite having the largest marketplace and the greatest number of industry players ready to take advantage. The only LNG refueling station along the 401 corridor opened last year in Woodstock, Ontario.", "If Ontario doesn’t take steps soon to open its borders to the same type of innovation and investment, we risk being left behind and our businesses will fall further behind in their ability to get their products to market at competitive prices. The time is right for the province of Ontario to seriously look at the promotion of natural gas as a transportation fuel.", "I ask that all the members support the Natural Gas Superhighways Act 2015, today. By doing this, we can move this important piece of legislation to committee, where we can hear from many of the industry stakeholders about the importance of opening the Ontario Market to the investment opportunities that come with this clean, abundant and North American energy resource.", "To reiterate, the intent of the Natural Gas Superhighway Act is to enable the Lieutenant Governor in Council to make regulations prescribing those weight limits for vehicles that use LNG, as well as to require the Minister of Transportation to table that progress report on an annual basis, and also to provide for that non-refundable tax credit of the Ontario portion of the HST for up to seven years for those business owners and taxpayers who purchase these commercial vehicles, trucks, ships and trains that would use this new liquefied natural gas as fuel.", "Mr. Speaker, I want to thank you and all my colleagues in the House from all three parties for taking the time to be here today and to listen to this bill, which I think is of critical importance to the province of Ontario as we go forward and rebuild the great economy of Ontario. I look forward to the rest of the debate." ],

This is a bill that essentially enables regulations prescribing higher weight limits for vehicles that use liquefied natural gas as a transportation fuel. It would also require the Minister of Transportation to table a progress report to the Legislative Assembly annually until these regulations were made. And it would provide for a non-refundable tax credit in the amount of half of the Ontario portion of the HST, which is 4%, for seven years to taxpayers who purchase vehicles that use natural gas as fuel.", "Before getting into any other specifics about the bill, I’d like to raise the issue that typically, as we know, private members’ bills do not have financial incentives. This one in particular looks like it has a lot of revenue generation attached to it, so I don’t know where that goes. There are certainly other considerations that would need to be addressed as well.", "We know that in 2010, the transportation sector was responsible for the largest volume of greenhouse gas emissions province-wide, and the sector has also witnessed a significant increase in emissions since 1990 while other sectors—electricity and industry—have seen a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions.", "Medium- and heavy-duty vehicles make up only 3% of vehicles on the road today, but they contribute 27% of the greenhouse gas emissions from on-road sources. Providing an incentive for transport operators to convert to natural gas certainly makes sense on the surface from both an environmental and a cost-saving perspective. As a transportation fuel, however, natural gas certainly represents a cleaner alternative to traditional fuels, particularly diesel, for medium and heavy trucks, trains and ships. This would result in a decrease of greenhouse gas emissions from on-road sources.", "But there are certainly more considerations I’d like to see explored in committee, when this actually gets to committee. I’d like to see the environmental considerations explored much more extensively. Natural gas certainly produces lower greenhouse gas emissions than traditional sources like diesel fuel, but it still produces them. It’s a fact that can’t be ignored, Speaker, and it is worth noting.", "I see the Speakers have changed.", "Technology used to obtain natural gas is primarily responsible for the current low prices in natural gas, and there are some concerns about the use of this technology. Our caucus had the pleasure of meeting the Environmental Commissioner today, and we discussed this issue at some length. What arose from that meeting is that there’s still much to be defined, explored and researched.", "This issue has come up in my riding of Welland and in the Niagara region over the last few years. Concerns were raised by Great Lakes United and by the St. Catharines and District Council of Women. More concerns came up from the public when the Niagara Falls Water Board in New York was looking at possibly processing waste water from the fracking technology. Given the proximity of the Niagara River and the unconfirmed environmental and health impacts, residents certainly raised some concerns when that was talked about.", "A moratorium on technology has been passed by the region of Niagara until further environmental studies and proper assessment are done. The Council of Canadians and others who are campaigning for a moratorium across Canada have concerns about water, about increased greenhouse gas emissions and about dangers to wildlife, and there are some financial considerations, as well.", "In addition to these concerns, it’s not clear if the bill uses an appropriate financial mechanism. In BC, for example, they’ve taken another route. That government, in British Columbia, passed a regulation that allows utility companies to deliver natural gas transportation programs until March 2017. Quebec, too, has taken a different approach than this bill.", "Speaker, the non-refundable tax credit of half of the Ontario portion of the HST would require federal amendments to the tax act to make it operational. Given the level of co-operation between the current provincial Liberal government and the current federal PC government, there is no guarantee that in fact it would be possible without the federal government on board.", "Lastly, we’ve seen the price of diesel fuel skyrocket by 165% since 1990. This is basic supply-and-demand economics. The current supply of natural gas is much higher than it will be 20 years from now, and as that supply begins to decrease, it will mean that the price of natural gas may not stay at its present low price level forever. What impact will that actually have on home heating with natural gas down the road? We have many people in this province who are heating with electricity who would like to move to natural gas because they can’t afford the freight of electricity bills in this province, which have increased 325% since 2003.", "That said, I think it’s worth getting this private member’s bill to committee. We definitely want to hear from the experts and the delegations on how the details of this natural gas conversion financial incentive might work and should work. We also want to hear about the concerns of the public. Unfortunately, we have a Liberal government whose clean energy policies largely mirror those of our federal Conservative counterparts, so it will be interesting to hear what the Liberals have to say on this bill.", "There may be benefits to the environment and to our economy in converting from diesel to natural gas, and I look forward to having more discussion about this bill in committee in the upcoming future. Thanks for the opportunity to speak." ],

  "text" : [ "Speaker, I’m happy to stand today on behalf of the constituents in my riding of Cambridge to add to this discussion, and I’m happy to be able to discuss private member’s Bill 76, the Natural Gas Superhighway Act, introduced by my colleague across the aisle. I want to thank the member from Sarnia–Lambton for introducing the bill and drawing attention to a very important issue, the use of natural gas in vehicles across the province.", "As the parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Transportation, I’m happy that the member opposite is discussing the use of natural gas in this province. I also wanted to let the member know that at recent ROMA and AMO conferences I’ve met with several delegations from his riding of Sarnia–Lambton on transportation issues, and it’s always a pleasure to talk to those officials in his riding.", "Bill 76 seeks to promote the purchase of vehicles that run on natural gas through the amendment of both the Highway Traffic Act and the Taxation Act. It would amend these existing acts together to alter weight requirements such that tax credits or subsidies could be provided for people who move away from vehicles running on petroleum and towards vehicles that run on natural gas.", "Mr. Speaker, I thank the member opposite for helping to bring light to the benefits of natural-gas-operating vehicles. I don’t think that all members of the public are aware that that could be a possibility in the future. Natural gas, as we know, burns cleaner and safer than petroleum, and it’s an excellent alternative that we should certainly be encouraging.", "or carbon dioxide, emissions than petroleum, as well, and so the increased use of natural gas can help us in our efforts to reduce emissions and fight climate change in our province, our country and on this planet.", "Natural gas is also cheaper than petroleum and, as such, can help us to solve some of the issues relating to transportation costs in Ontario. As the PA for transportation, I know how important this is for Ontarians. In some ways, the use of natural gas can bring us closer to our goals, and it’s great that the member from Sarnia–Lambton has brought this forward.", "I’m also pleased to see that a member of the official opposition introduces a bill that seeks to address carbon emissions and combat climate change. This is especially wonderful, given the official opposition’s precarious record on climate change and their frequent hesitation to support this government’s initiatives to work towards environmental protection.", "For instance, the member from Carleton–Mississauga Mills and the member from Lanark–Frontenac–Lennox and Addington have made statements in the recent past indicating they don’t believe that climate change is a legitimate and important issue. Given how serious climate change is, it’s concerning that some members of the official opposition disagree. In light of it, I am again glad that the member opposite is bringing this bill forward. It’s encouraging to see him rise above partisan politics to help combat climate change. It shouldn’t be a partisan issue, and I thank the member opposite for agreeing.", "A few weeks ago, the member from Glengarry–Prescott–Russell introduced a motion urging MPPs to come together, recognize the science behind climate change and move towards solutions to this pressing problem. Discussion of climate change is really important, and I’m happy to engage in the discussion today.", "While Bill 76 does include some notable benefits in terms of encouraging drivers to switch from vehicles running on petroleum to those using natural gas, there are some issues with natural gas that warrant further discussion. More consultation is needed to ensure that all bases are covered.", "Again, thank you, and I look forward to more discussion into increased use of natural gas in vehicles. More consultation is needed, and I look forward to seeing that move forward." ],

It’s actually a bill that he introduced in the previous provincial Parliament. It was known as Bill 97. It had second reading debate at that time. I believe it was endorsed by the House and went to committee, but unfortunately, because of the untimely 2014 election, it wasn’t given the opportunity for extensive committee discussions and then, in turn, third reading.", "The member for Sarnia–Lambton has a great record of bringing forward sensible private member’s bills that have enjoyed the confidence of the House and been passed into law. I think of the One Call bill that he introduced a few years ago, to ensure that you’d only have to make one call to get all the locates for the underground utilities. It was something that he had pushed for some time. It was strongly endorsed by many groups in Ontario, and eventually the provincial government saw fit to support it as well.", "The tax credit for farmers who make donations of surplus produce to food banks is something that our caucus strongly supported and, as I said, eventually the government came onside as well.", "The member was first elected to the Ontario Legislature in 2007, so he has been here now for eight years and three elections. He has certainly enjoyed the confidence of his constituents through three elections, and he has done an outstanding job here.", "Prior to that, he was a councillor in Enniskillen township, which is around the Petrolia community. He served for many years on the hospital board and local council, as I said. He was actually the returning officer in a couple of provincial elections, where I’m sure he ensured that the ballots were properly counted." ],

Although she took a few shots at members of our caucus for statements they may have made—I’m not sure if they’ve made them or not. Certainly for my part, I would say, and acknowledge again, that the vast majority of climate scientists would say that the earth is warming. Global warming is a fact. In fact, the preponderance of scientific opinion would suggest that human activity is a significant contributing factor, and we all have to be concerned about that.", "I know that we’re debating a bill this afternoon—actually, a government bill will be called for debate after private members’ business, where we discuss the bill that the government has brought forward with respect to the closure of the coal plants. We’ll have a lot to say on that.", "Again, the member for Sarnia–Lambton deserves enormous credit for bringing this forward again. The bill is intended to support the greater use of liquefied natural gas as a transportation fuel.", "The bill would ensure that there are regulations prescribing higher weight limits for vehicles that use liquefied natural gas as a transportation fuel; that the Minister of Transportation would have to table a progress report to the Legislative Assembly annually until those regulations are made; and to provide for a non-refundable tax credit, which would be half of the Ontario portion of the HST, or 4%, for seven years to taxpayers who purchase vehicles, whether they be trucks, ships or trains, using natural gas as their fuel.", "This is a very sensible suggestion. I think it’s a very important economic initiative that the member is bringing forward—one of the most important bills that we’ll be discussing today.", "I would encourage all members to support this bill at second reading. Let’s get it to committee, let’s hear from the people and let’s get it passed into law." ],

There has been a history here in Ontario of exploring for oil and gas. There has been a history of oil and gas production. We’re also a province that manufactures. We still manufacture, so we need the ability to move goods from here to there.", "But I have to say that I do not support this bill. I think we have to recognize—and I’ve heard people here speaking about climate change—that if we’re actually going to take on climate change we have to substantially reduce our consumption of fossil fuels. In fact, we have to leave most of the fossil fuels we’ve discovered in the ground.", "The Environmental Commissioner of Ontario has reported on that realization. He says that two thirds of the fossil fuels that are recognized in oil and gas company reserves have to stay in the ground if we’re to avoid a rise in global temperature greater than two degrees.", "I was here for the debate—I guess it was two weeks ago—impassioned statements by Liberals and by Conservatives about the need to take on climate change, the need to avoid catastrophic rises in world temperature.", "If we’re going to do that, we have to recognize that as we transition out of fossil fuels, we need to literally transition out of them. If we’re going to make transportation more environmentally sustainable, we need to move to electrification of the rail system; we need to invest where it’s going to make the biggest difference and not simply perpetuate the burning of fossil fuels.", "That’s one argument that concerns me about this bill. The other is that there is not an infinite amount of gas at a price that people can afford. People in this province use gas for cooking; they use it for heating; they use it for making electricity; and they use it in industrial processes. Every time you add a new significant market for natural gas, you drive up the price of that gas.", "Everyone in this House can talk about the experience they’ve had talking to constituents, or personally when they’ve opened their own gas bill, of the cost of energy. Are we really saying that we want prices for home heating to be substantially higher? Are we saying that we want things to be more difficult for manufacturing in this province?", "I would say: If we have to make a choice in a finite world, it makes more sense to use natural gas where its use is critical. It is not critical in transportation.", "This bill will allow much heavier trucks on the road, leading to faster degradation of roadbeds and more expense in maintaining them. If we adopt this bill, we will lose revenue that could be used in other ways, that could be used to invest in sustainable and renewable forms of energy and in sustainable forms of transportation.", "If we are going to reduce our revenue, if we’re going to give incentives for transformation of transportation infrastructure, then we need to do it in ways that give us the greatest possible payback in terms of greenhouse gas emission reduction and in ways that don’t expand demand for fossil fuels—fossil fuels that we shouldn’t be burning, that we do not have the room to burn ecologically on this planet.", "Speaker, I also want to talk about the stability of price and availability. A few decades ago, we had a glut of electricity in Ontario and we had a vast program of electric heating that was sold to the people of Ontario. Tons of people in rural Ontario got electric baseboard heating and electric forced-air heating, and now they are paying through the nose for that.", "A number of years ago, propane was cheap. Propane suppliers were beating the bushes to get people to dump their oil and go to propane. Well, last winter, they paid a fortune to get that propane.", "We have an industry—the natural gas industry—that currently has a glut on its hands and wants to vastly expand its market.", "Bloomberg reported in the last few months that a lot of the shale gas revolution in the United States is financed by junk bonds. That easy credit has made this revolution in shale gas possible, but one can’t rely on that in the long term. Many of those firms don’t actually make money. Many of those firms live on those junk bonds and, given the glut in the market right now, many of them will have difficulty surviving. That will dramatically change the numbers on availability of gas.", "For a number of reasons, we need to keep gas in the ground, where we can. Let’s not drive up prices for homeowners. And because there is uncertainty about the availability of this gas, I don’t support this bill." ],

I know, from my previous life, prior to being elected, that the member opposite appreciates the contribution of alternative transportation modes. Cycling is an issue that I know he supports. Having been in his riding with him in a previous context, I know he appreciates that.", "It’s very encouraging to see a member of the party opposite bring forth legislation that attempts to deal with real problems associated with climate change. These are issues that we must address quickly, as they will only get worse the longer we wait—something we must all take seriously and work together to solve.", "As we all know, Ontario currently relies on fossil fuels for the overwhelming majority of its transportation needs. Burning fossil fuel, especially petroleum, puts a great amount of carbon into our atmosphere and damages our environment, something that so far has been an unavoidable result of our need to get around. Not only is petroleum harmful in some ways, but it is becoming increasingly expensive, as I know the member opposite appreciates—something that I think we all have seen at the pump in the recent past.", ", and it has lower carbon content and higher energy mass. These qualities make natural gas an appealing alternative to the current fuels we use, and a potential tool in our efforts to reduce carbon emissions in this province. Lowering the amount of carbon we release into the environment while simultaneously lowering the cost of transportation seems at first glance like a win-win situation.", "Interest in the use of natural gas as a transportation fuel stems largely from the fact that there is an abundance of supply here in North America. There have been major developments of shale gas deposits in the northeastern United States recently that have led to a boost in available natural gas at a lower cost. We cannot, however, take this at face value. We must take every precaution to ensure that there are no unintended negative impacts on our environment. Our government is fully committed to the protection of Ontario’s natural heritage, and currently more information must be gathered before we can say for sure that natural gas will be an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional fuel sources.", "There is also an infrastructure component to the discussion around natural gas. Fueling stations that allow for the use of natural gas will need to be built across major transportation routes for commercial use, and more broadly if the citizens of Ontario, and the citizens in my riding of Burlington, in point of fact, are to be able to take advantage. There will also need to be storage and distribution facilities created, and access to the vehicles and technology that use natural gas as a fuel source.", "All of this will come with an associated monetary cost, which at this point has not been determined. This is not to say that the infrastructure cannot, or should not, be invested in. It is simply something that must be included in the broader conversation surrounding the use of natural gas as a transportation fuel. We cannot simply say that natural gas should become a relied-upon fuel source because it has worked elsewhere; we need to look at how this will impact the unique landscape of Ontario.", "Ultimately, I’ll be supporting this bill, Mr. Speaker, and I encourage all my colleagues in the House to do the same. This is an important step in the right direction, although I feel that much more must be done if we are to ensure that Ontario’s environment is protected to the best of our abilities. Natural gas definitely has the potential to be a more environmentally friendly alternative to other fossil fuels, but we must make sure that this is in fact the case. I look forward to discussing the matter further with the member in committee and to working together to find solutions to the many environmental issues we face here in Ontario." ],

Bob deserves much recognition for his efforts in championing the expansion of natural gas in the transportation sector. As I mentioned earlier, this is the second time he has brought this; before, it was Bill 97. Sadly, it died on the order paper.", "This bill aims to do two things: one, lower economic barriers to market entry and encourage the purchase of vehicles that use natural gas as a fuel through a tax credit; two, reduce regulatory barriers and amend regulations to prescribe higher weight limits for natural-gas-powered vehicles.", "Using this fuel system is a good choice, not only because it would reduce our reliance on crude-oil-based fuels, but also because, first, it’s domestically available. Recent growth in our natural gas supply gives us confidence that our deposits in North America could meet our demand for another century. It’s also cheap, safe and cleaner than other fuel systems. Ontario’s Environmental Commissioner warns that cars continue to be the biggest producer of greenhouse gas emissions, and this factor will continue to rise as energy demand for transportation rises.", "Imagine if we powered all medium- and heavy-duty vehicles with liquefied natural gas. That’s about 3% of the vehicles on the road today, not a significant share of road users; however, if we did, we would potentially reduce as much as one quarter, 25%, of greenhouse gas emissions from on-road sources.", "A poll by Nanos from a few years ago found that Canadians were highly motivated about surpassing the United States in green transportation. Today, natural gas powers about 150,000 vehicles in the US and roughly 12 million vehicles worldwide. It’s clearly a viable option for a lot of different countries.", "Moreover, liquefied natural gas fueling stations are growing across the US, linking manufacturing regions and transportation corridors. In Canada, we only have about 12,000 vehicles, a mix of urban transit buses, some school buses, light-duty cars and trucks, and forklifts and ice resurfacers. I believe Bob also mentioned that there is an opportunity for rail to be involved in this as well, Mr. Speaker, so a huge opportunity if we just grab the opportunity.", "I believe we can’t afford to be left behind much longer. I encourage everyone to support this bill so we can overcome regulatory barriers and expand the use of natural gas across our transportation sector and reduce greenhouse gases.", "There was a public opinion poll taken, and the question asked, “Which one of the following benefits from natural gas powered trucks and buses is the most important to you?” The key finding was that “more than half of Canadians (54.2%) thought that lowering emissions of trucks and buses by 25% by using natural gas instead of diesel powered vehicles was the most important benefit to them.”", "So, Mr. Speaker, we have the opportunity here in front of us. I think we just want to ensure that we move forward. A key message I want to leave with the people listening at home, and certainly here in the House today, is that natural gas is an affordable and safe fuel.", "New engine technology is allowing North America’s cargo transportation sector—medium- and heavy-duty trucks, trains, and ships—to use natural gas as a cheaper fuel. Lower transportation costs have the potential for Ontario’s manufacturing sector to get their products to market at more competitive prices.", "Estimates of the North American gas fields suggest accessible deposits of low-cost natural gas that could meet North American demand for the next 100 years. This would ease reliance on foreign fuel and certainly help our economy and our environment at the same time.", "As a transportation fuel, natural gas represents a cleaner alternative to traditional fuels, especially diesel, for medium- and heavy-duty trucks, trains, and ships.", "It’s approximately 20% to 30% cheaper and 20% to 30% cleaner in regard to greenhouse gases.", "British Columbia and Quebec have already adopted legislation to promote natural gas as a transportation fuel, as well as American jurisdictions such as New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Colorado, California, Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana.", "According to the Environmental Commissioner of Ontario, the transportation sector in 2010 was responsible for the largest volume of greenhouse gas emissions province-wide. Also, the sector has witnessed a significant increase in emissions since 1990, while some sectors, such as the electricity industry, have seen a decrease.", "As I mentioned earlier, medium- and heavy-duty vehicles make up 3% of vehicles on the road today but contribute 25% of the greenhouse gas emissions. It is my hope that if we adopt this bill—a three-peat for Bob Bailey, my great colleague. He has already been successful in introducing the One Call act along with Paul Miller, the member from Hamilton East–Stoney Creek, and his farm tax credit in the Local Food Act.", "Mr. Speaker, I hope everyone in the House will endorse it, get it to second reading, to committee and get this bill approved." ],

We’re still pumping oil and still pumping gas. They’re storing gas that’s used here in Toronto and eastern Ontario at the Dawn hub. I know a number of people have had the opportunity to visit the Dawn gas plant; we call that the hub. We pump gas in there all summer long, and then it goes out to Toronto and all over the eastern parts of Ontario to heat during the winter, and we’ve had some cold winters.", "Because of the environmental reasons and the cost for our manufacturers to get goods to market, there’s all the right reasons to vote for this bill, to make this fuel available.", "I was thinking: At the oil museum in Oil Springs, there’s a quote on the wall from the Bible.

As you have said, he was only able to get five minutes into his speech, so there’s a little time left for me on the clock. I hope to be able to finish this commentary this afternoon.", "The bill itself is pretty simple. As I said to the Sergeant-at-Arms the other day, when you hold it up to the light, you can see through it. It is not one of those great thick, complex bills, but it does carry out a particular task. It effectively bans the use of coal at four facilities in Ontario. It exempts the use of coal where it’s not used to make electricity for the grid, or primarily for the grid. If you’re burning coal at a car plant to make electricity and steam, then you carry on tomorrow as you carried on the day before.", "I support this bill, Speaker. As my predecessor said, the plants in question are already closed, and this bill will make it more difficult for a future government to burn coal. No government will be able to start burning coal in those plants at the simple whim of cabinet. They won’t be able to make a decision late at night in a boardroom somewhere here at Queen’s Park, or simply at the end of an excellently catered meal around the cabinet table. They’ll have to come down into this chamber and they will have to fight for it if they want to resume burning coal to make electricity. They will have to fight for the right to start choking people again, to start sending children with asthma to emergency and to make our whole landscape hazy again. Memories of smog: Let’s put them behind us.", "I see this bill as a firebreak against the return of coal. It’s not a steel wall. If you want something far more permanent, you actually have to dramatically reshape the energy system. But it is a firebreak, one that would slow down any government that decided it wanted to use coal in this province, which is why it’s intriguing to me that, both yesterday and today, the Minister of Natural Resources made it clear that he didn’t support my bill to ban fracking.", "I had said yesterday that, “There’s no need for Ontario to risk environmental damage and lawsuits by leaving the door open to this controversial practice,” and that we have the opportunity to learn from the hard experience of others—in Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and New York state—and we could act now. But the Minister of Natural Resources said, “‘We’re internally reviewing what our plans will be and we’ll go forward on that basis,’ Mr. Mauro told reporters.”", "Speaker, I had a chance to talk to the Environmental Commissioner today, and that internal review has been going on since 2012. Somebody’s talking to somebody, hopefully. I would say that it is time for the minister to move that internal review forward and decide that, in Ontario, our future is not with fossil fuels. It is not with fracked gas. It is with conservation and renewables.", "I’m very curious to know if the minister is having conversations with the gas industry. He said in a comment to reporters that there are no fracking applications to the ministry, no one is seeking a licence and there’s no exploration going on for fracking in Ontario right now. He didn’t say if they’d been going on two or three days ago or if a meeting was scheduled for next week. He didn’t say whether they were having general discussions in bars around town. He was fairly categorical in the items that were excluded. It intrigues me that, given the experience in other jurisdictions, given the concern that the governing party has expressed about climate change, he hasn’t come forward and been very direct that this is not a road we’re going down—not at all.", "I’ve said that, here in Ontario, we need to be clear we’re not going to allow fracking to go forward, because the experience in the United States is that the companies that drill for this shale gas that fracture the rock go through those gas deposits very rapidly—an 80% decline in productivity in the first year. So they’re constantly having to drill for new sites and constantly having to look for new ground to explore. There’s no reason for us to be part of that new ground. As you may well be aware, Speaker, the Marcellus Shale, one of the most prolific gas formations for fracking, based in Pennsylvania, continues under Lake Erie and up to the North Shore of Lake Erie.", "We need to act now, act proactively, so that we don’t have to deal with the lawsuits, the local fights, the local water contamination and the local noise problems years from now.", "Mr. Mauro referred to my suggestion of natural gas deposits in Ontario as something that was “hypothetical.” Speaker, if it’s hypothetical, if there’s no skin off anyone’s nose, if we can avoid the sorts of lawsuits that Quebec is having to deal with now because they acted after the industry got involved, then it would make sense for the minister to support this bill.", "The Minister of Natural Resources says that we don’t need a bill to ban fracking because fracking isn’t happening. By that same logic, the Minister of Natural Resources should vote against this bill because, in fact, we’re not burning coal in our electricity generation plants today. It’s not going on.", "I have to ask: Will the Minister of Natural Resources speak for or vote in favour of this bill as we go forward? If he applies the same criteria that he has in dealing with the fracking of shale gas, then by rights he shouldn’t be supporting the government on this bill.", "We need to go to the bigger picture, the context within which all three parties in this Legislature said they would stop burning coal in electricity plants in Ontario.", "Two weeks ago, when we were debating the climate change resolution brought forward by the member from Glengarry–Prescott–Russell, I read a quote from Lord Stern, a former head economist at the World Bank, directed by the British government to write a report on the financial impacts of climate change. In 2006, Lord Stern reported back and talked about the necessity for action. He said this in 2006: “The investment that takes place in the next 10-20 years will have a profound effect on the climate in the second half of this century and in the next. Our actions now and over the coming decades could create risks of major disruption to economic and social activity, on a scale similar to those associated with the great wars and the economic depression of the first half of the 20th century.”", "We’re talking about disruption of human society on an extraordinary scale, and those among us who may have lived through those events or talked to their parents or grandparents about those events know that in human terms that means we are engaged in a very high-stakes adventure, a very risky adventure.", "Sometimes, Speaker, when you talk about that scale, it’s outside of many people’s experience, and it’s hard for them to envision. So I want to talk briefly about some of the day-to-day impacts I have seen from climate change from global warming in this city. Last week, I was going door to door on Gerrard Street in my riding. I talked to a woman, a grandmother, whose hydro bill had come in at over $1,200. That was about equal to her pension cheque." ],

People felt that chill slam through them every time they went outside, and they felt that chill slam through their pocketbooks when they got their hydro bill.", "I won’t underplay the impact of privatization on the cost of electricity in Ontario or talk about the impact of bad Liberal policies on our prices. But we’re going to have to recognize that more and more extreme weather is going to drive up our energy bills—because when it’s very cold we’re going to need more energy—and it’s going to make the cost of running the system higher.", "As world weather patterns change, we will see extreme weather in ways that we haven’t seen before. While we were going through minus 20 degree days here in Toronto, in Fairbanks, Alaska, it was plus 5 degrees. It was one of the warmest Februarys they had ever seen. Weather patterns are changing. It isn’t just that the world gets warmer like a bath slowly getting warmer as you put more hot water in. No. You get very disruptive, very chaotic events that people notice when hurricanes go through places like Goderich, and when you have Superstorm Sandy going through New York City or Hurricane Katrina going through New Orleans—more and more disruptive events that have a huge impact in human terms and a huge impact financially.", "In the summer of 2013, Toronto was hit with some of the worst flooding ever. I want to just read a bit about what the Toronto Star reported: “The storm and flash flooding that hit the GTA on July 8 has set a record for the province’s most expensive natural disaster, according to the Insurance Bureau of Canada.”", "We’re all going to be stuck with those bills, either through higher insurance bills or by incidental costs that aren’t covered by insurance. I’ve already had constituents in my riding say that insurance companies have declined to renew insurance because they felt that their homes were vulnerable to flooding, that the sewer lines in their neighbourhoods weren’t adequate to protect them, and so parts of their coverage would be cancelled.", "In that Star article, the Insurance Bureau of Canada Ontario vice-president, Ralph Palumbo, made a statement about the storm, saying that, “While these preliminary estimates are staggering, we do expect them to go even higher.”", "He’s right. We do see very high costs.", "I have to tell you, there’s more to global warming than just the costs; there’s also a smell. That smell is sewage in your basement. In Ontario, our sewer systems, our waste water systems, are built for a climate that no longer exists. Rainfall patterns are not the ones we had last century. They’re not the ones that engineers based the sewer and water systems on. They’re becoming more and more different. Storms that used to happen once a century now happen twice a decade. That speaks to significant property damage and significant insurance costs. People are going to spend more time shovelling sewage out of their basements, and they’re going to be spending more money. Global warming is hard on the nose, and it’s hard on the pocketbook.", "We can understand those particular risks, of extreme weather causing physical difficulty and of extreme weather causing expense—expense for energy and expense for repairs. But there’s another level of concern that we need to start thinking about in this chamber and in this province, and that relates to financial stability.", "I want to go back to talk about another event of financial instability that we need to take recognition of and incorporate into our thinking. That’s the 2008 financial collapse related to subprime mortgages.", "If you ever have the chance, Speaker, there was a fabulous book called The Big Short, by a writer called Michael Lewis. He followed the growth of understanding amongst a number of investors that the international financial system had a very big chunk of rotten, dangerous assets that were rated as highly creditworthy: subprime mortgages.", "A number of analysts followed the records, looked at subdivisions in Phoenix, in Orange County, in San Diego and all over the United States where mortgages had been given to people so that mortgage companies could make a profit—given to people who couldn’t afford to pay those mortgages. Then those mortgages were bundled together and sold to institutional investors, pension funds, banks and people who felt that they were investing in a grade A creditworthy asset. Unfortunately, all that came apart in 2008. There were staggering losses globally. Governments spent fortunes and went into deficit to shore up the financial system so we wouldn’t have another Great Depression.", "I wanted to give you that background because we are facing a similar investment risk with oil and gas and coal. For those who have not followed the literature on this, I’ll just note a report provided by the Environmental Commissioner of Ontario a few months ago.", "He talked about the need for a planetary carbon diet, or call it a carbon budget. In 2009 the global community through the United Nations adopted a ceiling that we would not go past in terms of global warming: two degrees centigrade. When you go past that, you start getting very dangerous, very unpredictable climatic events—possibly irreparable—so there’s an awful lot of concern globally, in government circles and in scientific circles, that action needs to be taken to stay within that two-degree boundary.", "for future use.", "release, this global budget will be exhausted in about 28 years. That’s a very short time frame in the life of a society; 28 years is a very short time. I’ll give you an example: The Wright brothers flew their first powered flight in the early 1900s—1903 is roughly my recollection—and 30 years later in 1933 or 1935, you had airline companies that were providing service across oceans. It’s not a long time, Speaker, 30 years.", "There is a big disparity between that budget—what we can emit while staying within that two-degree-centigrade ceiling—and the amount of greenhouse-gas-emitting fossil fuels that are on the books with global coal, oil and gas companies.", "if burned.", "So if the threshold is 1,000 and what people have on the books is 2,900, then about two thirds of what’s in the ground has to stay in the ground if you’re going to stabilize the world’s climate, if things are going to be safe or, if not safe, at least relatively stable in the future. But that raises huge questions, Speaker, because, as you may well imagine, if an oil company says, “The value of all my reserves has to be cut by two thirds,” then their stock value plummets. Anyone who has issued bonds to them realizes that those bonds may not be paid back.", "Within Canada, the S&P/TSX composite index is one of the most carbon-intensive stock indices in the world. In 2013, the TSX had over 400 companies listed in the oil and gas sector, representing a market capitalization of their total value or worth—and here I’m quoting the Environmental Commissioner—of around $400 billion to $500 billion. The Environmental Commissioner stressed in his report that investors, pension plans and insurance companies had to start looking at these areas of investment through a climate lens, because they were putting their funds at risk by investing in these companies.", "Several authoritative international organizations, including the International Energy Agency, Carbon Tracker, the United Nations and HSBC—a bank you may be familiar with, one that operates in this country and in this town—are warning investors to focus this lens quickly and act accordingly to avoid another kind of catastrophe, an economic one.", "We saw in 2008 that investors sank billions—hundreds of billions—into assets that weren’t worth what the vendors said they were.", "We’re in a situation now where oil, gas and coal companies are making a bet that the world will never act on climate change. If they’re right on that bet, that’s disastrous for us. If they’re wrong on that bet, it’s disastrous for their bottom lines, for their financial statements and for everyone whose investment portfolio is built on that edifice.", "So this is not a minor or tangential issue. This is a huge risk area for us. The Bank of England is now seriously turning to the question of stranded assets and unburnable carbon given the major role that London financial markets have in financing fossil fuel investment around the world.", "Last October, the British paper the Guardian reported: “The governor of the Bank of England has reiterated his warning that fossil fuel companies cannot burn all of their reserves if the world is to avoid catastrophic climate ... impacts of their decisions.", "“According to reports, Carney told a World Bank seminar on integrated reporting on Friday that the ‘vast majority of reserves are unburnable’ if global temperature rises are to be limited to ... 2” degrees centigrade.", "The governor of the Bank of England understands the kinds of risks that oil, gas and coal companies pose to the international financial system, just as subprime mortgages posed less than a decade ago. A decade ago, a number of people very smartly understood the risk and they got out of that market. There are a whole bunch of banks and investors—Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers—who got hit profoundly, and many countries took a profound hit from those unstable and risky assets.", "So, Speaker, we have to understand and protect ourselves against risk in terms of our physical experience of the world. We have to understand it in terms of controlling our cost of living and cost of energy, and we have to understand it in terms of risk, financially. At this point, I don’t believe that this government understands those risks, and I am confident they are not preparing for those risks.", "This bill, the one before us, is a small firewall against a bad practice, but if we’re actually going to take on the challenges before us, we need continuous, substantial steps towards changing our energy system. We have to move beyond oil, gas and coal.", "The good thing for us is that already the cost of conservation is far less than the cost of electricity, for example. You can effectively reduce your need for electricity services at a cost of three to six cents a kilowatt hour.", "You’re well aware of what it costs now when you pay your hydro bill. I got mine the other day. I did some simple arithmetic and figured out that although I had only been charged about $40 for the actual electricity, with service delivery etc., my average price per kilowatt hour was 21 cents. To the extent that I drive down my electricity use by making my house more energy-efficient, I can spend six cents a kilowatt hour or 21 or 22 cents a kilowatt hour. It’s far cheaper to invest in conservation.", "But at the same time that that is true, the market for energy is changing in a profound way. In the United States, renewable energy prices are dropping dramatically. In the United States, the cost of solar power is competitive with or lower than electrical power from the grid in Hawaii and on track to be competitive in Arizona and California within the next few years.", "Within five years, solar power is projected to be cheaper than grid power in about 20 American states, and banks are noticing. Banks are noticing the potential for disruption—technological disruption, economic disruption—of the existing energy systems.", "Speaker, my bet is that at one point in your life you rented a video from Blockbuster Video. Maybe I’m wrong, but I think there’s a very good chance that you and a lot of people in this room at one time went to Blockbuster Video and rented a movie for an evening. My bet is that you can’t find one of them anywhere now because they’re gone. They met Netflix—game over.", "We’ve seen disruptive technologies before. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, when there was talk about bringing mobile phones to Ontario, I remember articles in the business press with people writing, “Is there really a market for this? Will people actually buy these things? Will they haul them around?” That was a valid question because I remember a guy in the early 1980s coming to a meeting that I was in, bringing his mobile phone and he was sort of tipped over because the battery on the phone was about the same size as a car battery, and it had this Bell rotary-phone-sized phone attached to it. But time moves on, and the mobile phone is clearly in command and landlines have lost out. Big telephone and communication companies lost out.", "We have to understand that that is happening in the energy area as well with regard to renewable energy, with new technologies and with micro-grids that are going to change the way people use energy in North America.", "Earlier in 2014, Barclays bank downgraded the whole electricity sector in the United States. They looked at that sector and said, “Hmm, Blockbuster Video, we’ve been there. We’re not going to put as much money in it as we have before.”", "John Spears wrote a very good article in the Toronto Star business section. He quoted Barclays, saying, “‘In the 100-plus-year history of the electric utility industry, there has never before been a truly cost-competitive substitute available for grid power,’ Barclays wrote.", "“‘We believe that solar plus storage could reconfigure the organization and regulation of the electric power business over the coming decade.’", "“A combination of solar and storage is already competitive with grid power in Hawaii, Barclays said, and the trend will only grow.", "“‘California could follow in 2017, New York and Arizona in 2018, and many other states soon after.’", "“Barclays sees near-term credit risk for utilities where solar power is gaining traction. And it sees long-term risks ‘from a comprehensive reimagining of the role utilities play in providing electric power.’”", "Barclays bank understands the potential scale of disruption of the electricity industry, understands the potential for solar power and other renewable technologies to make nuclear, coal, oil and gas electricity production uncompetitive.", "Already in Germany, a country where there is not a lot of sunshine, solar power is producing power on houses at a cost of between nine euro cents and 12 euro cents per kilowatt hour. Remember, on our bills, we pay between seven cents and 13 cents a kilowatt hour.", "Already in Abu Dhabi, which is looking at vast investment in solar power to provide electricity and to provide power for desalinization, they are signing contracts for electricity provided by solar panels at less than six cents a kilowatt hour. That was in a recent report from the National Bank of Abu Dhabi done by PricewaterhouseCoopers and Cambridge University.", "The reality of electricity production globally, of electricity technologies, is changing dramatically. We here in Ontario need to take advantage of that Netflix versus Blockbuster shift to redo our energy system. We need to be thinking on those terms.", "It’s a good thing to stop burning coal. It’s a good thing to have a law prohibiting that. But, Speaker, we need to go substantially farther down the road not only to stop climate change but also to ensure that our energy system in Ontario is stable, that it is not a financial drag on the province but a financial asset, an asset that will give us an opportunity to get into global markets reckoned in the trillions, in the years to come.", "One last point there: Lazard Brothers, the investment firm, did a report last year showing that the price of power from solar generation had dropped 78% over the last five years and that the levellized costs, the average costs, from new installations in North America was seven to nine cents a kilowatt hour. There is a radical change coming in the provision of electricity, in the provision of energy, and we have to be part of that change. We have to think further and we have to think bigger if we’re going to deal with climate change and if we’re going to deal with economic development in this province.", "I want to look for a moment at some historical parallels. I think it was roughly 1928 when Herbert Hoover was elected President of the United States. The year following, 1929, was the great stock market crash. That crash was followed by years of unemployment in the 20%-plus range across the United States. Hoover’s approach was that the fundamentals were sound. He was going to tinker here or there and really just leave things the way they are and hope that it would turn out all right, which I think largely is the approach that the Canadian government is taking to climate change. I would say, with a few exceptions, it’s largely the approach that the Liberal government has taken to climate change.", "If my memory is correct, in roughly 1932, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was elected in the United States on a program of addressing substantial market failures. I just note that Lord Stern, whom I referenced earlier in my speech, refers to climate change as one of the greatest market failures in history. Well, we are faced with another market failure.", "FDR looked at that market failure and mobilized the power of the American government to do a number of things. He realized that the deregulation, the conversion of the financial system in the United States to effectively a casino, where buying stocks was like playing roulette—he recognized that that had destabilized the American financial system. He recognized that not having a framework of rules to protect savers and investors was poisonous for the economy. So he brought forward legislation that changed the whole framework of finance in the United States.", "He was resisted mightily. He was vilified. He was popular because he was stabilizing the economy. People could see the potential for their savings to be protected and for people to be put back to work. But he acted in a way that revamped that whole regulatory system. He invested across the United States in job creation; he invested in infrastructure. He didn’t take the standstill approach of the Republicans before him.", "When you have a profound failure of the market to address the issues that we face, when there is great peril to society and its structures, then you have to think much more like Roosevelt than Hoover. You have to start thinking about how systems need to be repaired so that the great issues of the day can be addressed.", "I think that this government needs that with its climate thinking. I’ve heard the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change talk about the economic development, the business potential of developing renewable energy, and he’s entirely correct. There is a huge opportunity there. But it is going to take more than closing the coal plants to realize that opportunity. It’s going to need investment in technology, in structures that go beyond oil, gas and coal.", "We’ve had this debate in the Legislature before—frankly, since climate change was a big issue in this Legislature—back in 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009. I will apologize to any who had to sit through this little bit of speech before.", "But if you’re going to have a strategy that works, if you’re going to have a strategy that brings people onboard, the first thing you have to do is invest in those things that help contain or reduce the cost of living and put people to work. That says to me that this province needs to invest in the conservation of energy in a very substantial way. We need to be looking at cutting our use of gas, oil and coal by about 30% a decade. So 10 years from now, we should have reduced the use of those energy inputs by a third, and a third in the decade thereafter, and a third in the decade after that.", "We should be assisting people to insulate their homes so they can dramatically cut their need for heating and cooling. We need to help people who are now on electric heating to move electric heating out of their lives.", "You can insulate a building to the point where it needs very little energy input. Increasingly, that’s a goal in Japan, where they are looking at bringing in regulations so that within the next 12 to 15 years, all new homes have to be so highly insulated, and equipped with solar panels, that they are net zero energy, that they create as much energy from their solar panels as they take from the grid, that they use very little for heating and cooling. Germany has gone a fair distance down that road, requiring net zero energy as well.", "People across Ontario would benefit from a program to retrofit homes to dramatically reduce their energy consumption. Mayor David Miller, a number of years ago, put forward his tower renewal project to refurbish apartment buildings across Toronto to dramatically cut their energy use and contain costs—contain costs so that people have the money they need for food, for transportation, for clothing, for education.", "We import our energy. One per cent of Ontario’s oil and gas is produced in Ontario and 99% comes from outside the province. We spend somewhere, depending on the price of oil, between $35 billion and $50 billion a year on energy. We spend a huge amount on energy. To the extent that we replace those imports with investments we make here in Ontario, we create work in Ontario and we keep money in Ontario.", "Renewable energy and conservation are capital-intensive, and we are the banking capital of Canada. We have the people who know how to do the financing. We have to stop putting all our eggs into gas, oil and coal, and put them into our construction companies here in Ontario. We need to put them into our tradespeople, we need to put them into our manufacturers, so that we here in Ontario displace the need for getting energy from Pennsylvania or Alberta or Algeria or the North Sea—it doesn’t matter. We need to make the investments in Ontario that will contain costs, that will drive costs down and that will put people to work.", "A climate strategy that’s based around those principles is one that can mobilize people.

You may or may not know this, Speaker, but we here in Ontario at the beginning of the 20th century benefited from the huge investment that Germany had made in engineering and innovation, because it was their work on long-distance transmission of power that made the transmission of power from Niagara to Toronto possible. German engineers were brought in to Ontario at the beginning of the 20th century to help make Ontario Hydro a reality.", "Now today, again, globally they are the innovators. Their two largest companies, E.ON and RWE, suffered very substantial financial losses over the last few years because the market for the nuclear and coal power that they provided has been profoundly undermined. The spread of solar technology in Germany has allowed, in the middle of the day, a drop in power demand instead of the situation we have in Ontario, where we have a peak. That’s been a tremendous boon to German consumers. It’s been great in terms of their economic prospects but it’s really changed the picture—the world—for German utilities.", "What they’ve had to do is recognize that the world is changing around them and those two very large companies recognize that they have to become solar providers, they have to become wind power providers, so they are moving big chunks of their business into leasing solar on people’s roofs. That’s comparable to what SolarCity is doing in Arizona, where they are leasing solar systems and competing head to head with utilities by putting those solar panels on people’s roofs. It’s a big shift in the business model; it’s a big shift in the energy model but it makes a huge difference in terms of your economic and ecological prospects.", "I think that I’ve said most of what I want to say today; I know that I still have a bit of time on the clock. My hope is the government will bring this bill forward to committee relatively soon. I think that most of us agree that burning coal to make electricity has had its day and is gone.", "What I hope as well is that we will soon see legislation in this chamber that not simply puts a firewall against the return of past practices but actually puts on the table initiatives that will substantially reshape our economy both for economic opportunity and for environmental opportunity." ],

The incidence rates in Ontario were increasing and were directly related to the type of pollution that was present here in Ontario due to coal-fired electricity generation. Of course, when our government did decide to eliminate these particular generating plants, we saw the rates come down. Fewer children, in fact, are suffering from asthma; we’re seeing less lung disease than we did. Clearly, this is something that we want to preserve.", "We want to ensure, should there ever be a change in government, a change in policy—heaven forbid—around this, that we have this type of legislation that ensures that we will never see coal used to generate electricity again in Ontario.

I think that the focus really should be on what resonates with people: clean air and clean water. I think that’s why it’s so important that we’ve been talking about clean air and clean water for the last couple of weeks, in a lot of different bills. Maybe some of these bills should even be combined, because there seem to be a lot of similar discussions of an environmental nature on saving our air and water.", "I just came back from visiting and learning about Taiwan. You realize just how serious the problem is when you’re in Taiwan and you can’t see the ocean until your feet are practically in it, because of the smog. The smog is in part because of things going on in Taiwan, but a big part of it is because of the coal plants in China, where one coal plant is being built pretty much every week. We’re here talking about ensuring that no coal plants get built here in Ontario, and hopefully in the near future we can stop coal plants in North America, but in the meantime we’re purchasing goods from China, where they’re being created cheaply using energy from coal plants.

It flushed out the underground economy, which has been a Groundhog Day theme in this place for a long time. But if we had such a policy in place, a citizen who knew that they were going to get a tax credit for using the certified services of an electrician to retrofit their home—that creates a good job locally. It’s good for the economy. It’s good for the environment, because there’s conservation. It’s also around consumer protection, because that’s a certified worker in that home, therefore protecting the consumer. Of course, there’s also the issue of safety and making sure that people know what they’re doing when they are retrofitting homes.", "There are progressive ideas out there.

I would like to now find a way that we can go and maybe get compensation from the other coal plants on the other side of the border that continue to send smog over this way. The benefit in asthma case reduction to people who suffer, by having fewer smog days, has been tremendous.", "But also it reinforces what a great decision it was as a greenhouse gas elimination measure. Closing these plants, as was said—it’s one of the largest sources of greenhouse gas reduction in Ontario. Another large one was, of course, the flaring of landfill gas out of Keele Valley which went a long way to reducing greenhouse gas in Ontario, and it’s very important.", "But this bill, in its current form, stands as a pre-emptive strike against others maybe later down the road—a new government coming in—reopening these plants for coal purposes. Now it’s a little odd for us to be doing a pre-emptive strike. It sort of suggests that we feel some insecurity, that maybe we won’t be here next government—because this government clearly would never put coal back in these facilities—but it does not allow any future government to, and we think that’s very important.", "More to the point, it stops others from thinking they can come into our province to maybe refurbish these old plants with coal. It just gives them a very strong signal that we are a no-coal-electricity-generation jurisdiction, so stay away. Other investors won’t be coming here and trying to—and it won’t even be different technologies like clean coal. We hear a lot about clean coal technologies. We didn’t run on the premise of getting on to clean coal; we said no coal. That was the direction to go because you can maybe burn coal cleaner, but you’re still going to have these very, very atrocious GHG impacts, and that’s just not appropriate.", "What we also have done is, we’ve opened up these four facilities as an opportunity to do different biomass electrical generation in these facilities. I believe at the Thunder Bay Generating Station, in 2015, they will start up with biomass, with wood waste from the northern communities and with straw from agricultural production. They’ll be able to generate electricity, which is much needed up in that community, with very low GHGs, very low health impacts, and that’s very, very important.", ". But what we do encourage and continue to allow is to use coal in manufacturing purposes and to take the spill-off heat from manufacturing, to repurpose it in electricity, steam or some other process.", "So we recognize, unlike maybe the member from Toronto–Danforth, that as important as solar power and wind power are, you cannot fire cement using solar power and you cannot make steel using solar power. We still have a need in Ontario for these very important industries—the cement and the foundry industries—to have coal as a source of energy in order to produce these products. I wish we didn’t, but there is no other significant alternative available. As a result, we will continue to allow coal use. We allow coal use in those facilities in a very productive way if you can actually get waste heat from them. We have two very specific exceptions in this bill—first, if you are the primary manufacturer of a product other than electricity to use waste heat in order to produce electricity both for your own use and for the grid use as a waste product. Secondly, as a different facility, if you are taking that off-heat, that off-waste steam and such, from a primary facility that uses coal, you will be able to put that into production use as well.", "So this is a pre-emptive strike. It’s a very important one which sends signals on how important this issue is to Ontario and to this government. I’m delighted to have a chance to speak to it today.

The gist of it for me is that less coal days, now that coal is gone actually, means less smog days. I remember years ago, we’d have a lot of smog days in the summertime, in Toronto especially. They would say, “Okay, today’s a smog day. If you have asthma or if you’re a senior citizen, stay indoors.” Those are gone now; very few happen during the summertime. It’s obvious that coal has that effect. I had a lot of people who have asthma telling me that they don’t have to worry about staying indoors during the summertime.", "I also want to touch on something else that coal-firing does. It really damages our atmosphere. As the previous member spoke, he touched on this issue. I think it’s really important to see that climate change is a big issue.", "What’s interesting is, we’re taking it seriously in this government. We have a minister who deals with that, and the federal government, at some point, hopefully will become more attuned to it. But in the United States, the Republicans say there’s no climate change. I read an article today in the Washington Post. There’s a senator running for president. His name is Ted Cruz. He was born in Calgary, actually, and he’s running for President. He came out today and basically said, “I rely on the science, and the science says there’s no climate change.” I guess he doesn’t read articles about what’s happening at the North Pole with the ice melting, and also in Antarctica, where there’s a lot of ice melting. Around the world, most countries realize that there is climate change and we had better do something about it now or our children and our grandchildren are going to be suffering the consequences of what we in this generation do in our lifetime.", "I also listened carefully to the member from Toronto–Danforth. In part of his speech, he spoke about how our infrastructure nowadays cannot handle all the changes that have occurred in the last 50 years, the last 20 years.", "I know that I personally experienced that myself. In 2012, I was home in my basement and it started to rain. It came down really strong in Scarborough Southwest. It was almost as if the clouds decided to go into my riding and just flood my riding. In a matter of half an hour, so much rain fell that my basement was knee-high in rainwater. It wasn’t very clean, either. To make a long story short, we had to redo our basement. There were several people in the area who got hit by this same effect, and all it took was a freak rainstorm.", "The year after that, we had a windstorm that knocked out a lot of trees. We also had the ice storm, which caused electricity to go out all over Toronto. I can’t remember in my childhood that ever happening. A lot of people were left in the dark. On Christmas Eve, I drove through the riding with my wife, and almost all the neighbourhoods were totally black, blacked out. It was the strangest thing of all.", "I think we have to do something. As has been said earlier, unfortunately, our American friends don’t see it that way. They’d better see it. I mean, the President, Mr. Obama, is aware of it and he takes it seriously, but it’s unfortunate that the Republicans there don’t take it seriously. God forbid they elect a Republican. I won’t think who will get elected—Jeb Bush—but whoever it is, they’re not going to deal with this problem. It’s going to get worse and worse.", "I’d like to talk a lot more, but I’ve only got 30 seconds to wrap up here. I also wanted to say that, around the world, some countries, some islands, are starting to disappear. Some small islands in the Pacific Ocean and other places are disappearing because we have more water and it’s covering them up. So I don’t know what kind of science the Republicans are looking at in the United States, but the truth is that there’s a lot of climate change.", "This government is acting responsibly with what we’re doing right now, and hopefully this will help a little bit to prevent worse climate change, which is probably going to happen in the years to come." ],

Bill 9 is an important bit of legislation.", "I was asked, “Why is there a need for Bill 9, since coal-fired generators have been eliminated, or coal-fired plants?” And I said, “This is in place to protect future generations, to protect our young people and to make sure that this never happens and we never revert back to times as they were prior to 2003.”", "The purpose of this act, Mr. Speaker, reinforces the commitment to end the use of coal at existing generating facilities and to ensure that any new stand-alone generation stations will not use coal. Coal-fired electricity generation facilities are major sources of air pollution. These harmful emissions are associated with major health impacts like premature death and increased hospital admissions for patients with asthma and chronic lung disease, as well as environmental damage to buildings, crops and our ecosystem.", "I come from a workers’ compensation background and I have seen what COPD can do to patients, to people and families that are exposed to emissions of coal and other chemicals in the workplace that affect our environment. I am speaking from some first-hand knowledge, seeing the detriment, devastation and associated costs that this adds to our economy. I wonder sometimes how our friends on the right, especially Republicans—how do you put a cost on the health of humans and on human life? That baffles me. I’m always at a loss to see how anybody could support that.", "This government has taken steps to eliminate coal from our economy and from our province. In 2012, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from coal electricity were 93% and 88% lower, respectively, than they were in 2003, so I commend our government for taking steps to eliminate coal in this province. In 2003, coal accounted for 25% of our generation; in 2012, coal-fired generation made up less than 3% of Ontario’s total electricity generation.", "The last of Ontario’s coal plants, the Thunder Bay Generating Station, stopped burning coal ahead of schedule in 2014. This station is being converted to use advanced biomass as a fuel for electricity generation.", "This government is concerned about the potential health, environmental and financial costs associated with the use of coal at a stand-alone generating station. Under the Environmental Protection Act, the maximum fine for a corporation for a specified offence is $6 million, and $250,000 for an additional offence.", "Clean coal technology research has been under way in the US, Canada and Europe for many years. However, these technologies do not eliminate the harmful pollutants of coal, and they are not commercially viable. You may hear, “Oh yes, technology has advanced and we can use that.” No, Mr. Speaker. It eliminates some, but there is still potential harm to our society as a whole.", "Again, our government has taken steps to ban this, and we are one of the only jurisdictions that has done so. I am so proud to stand here and be a part of a government that put the health of Ontarians first, ahead of profits.", "Again, Mr. Speaker, thank you very much for this opportunity to speak to this bill." ],

First of all, each political party has taken pretty well the same position over a number of years when it comes to coal. All of us had a goal to get rid of coal by 2017, I think was the original date, or 2014. I can’t remember the exact date. So when I hear members across the way saying, “I’m so glad that my government did it”—well, excuse me, I was here before you guys were government, and I remember some coal plants being closed down by the nasty Mike Harris government, and certainly it was a direction that the nasty NDP government was doing before that.", "Everybody in this House, on all sides, understood that coal was an issue and that we had to have as a goal the reduction of coal. The real question was, when we do that, how are we going to replace the power that coal generates, which is pretty inexpensive compared to a whole bunch of other forms of energy out there? I just want to say that this is something that we’ve all done.", "The other thing is, it’s interesting that we’re bringing legislation now. After we’ve closed down all the coal plants, we’re passing legislation in this House preventing the use of coal, which seems to be kind of backwards in the sense that I’m sure the government’s got a whole bunch of stuff on the order paper that they’d like to talk about, that they could be talking about. Instead, we’re debating a bill that, quite frankly, is a bit moot. We got rid of the coal plants. I think we can all take a bow on that. We found new means of energy to replace it, although be it more expensive; there’s no question about that. But we’re doing legislation that, quite frankly, is not going to change the outcome of anything other than make us feel good, that we ban coal after we got rid of coal.", "I just say to the government across the way, I would hope that we would be able to use our time in debate on something a little bit more pressing." ],

I would just remind everybody that in 2003 he was part of the Liberal team during that election campaign that promised to close coal plants in 2007, while the PCs said they would close them in 2014 and that it couldn’t be done so quickly. Here we are in 2015, and we all know that the plants were closed in 2014, so we know who has the crystal ball: It’s on this side of the House.", "As a fairly new member—I guess I’m still one of the rookies here—I’ve done quite a bit of research. Everybody keeps giving me more research, piling it on my desk. I’ve looked at some pretty big portfolios and projects—Ornge, eHealth, MaRS, gas plants—and everything doesn’t seem to be managed very well. I feel that there are much more important things that we could be discussing, since the coal plants are already closed. I don’t know that we really need a separate bill—maybe an addendum to an existing bill—to say that we shouldn’t open new coal plants, which we know we wouldn’t open anyhow. Maybe this is considered kind of a distraction. Maybe this is a feel-good bill.", "But of course we in the PC caucus support not reopening coal plants, and we support initiatives to help people lower their energy bills, because the green energy policy was another big mismanaged portfolio. Mr. Speaker, I can recall working up in Keswick, where people were living in trailers that they thought were homes because they were fixed up. We all know how fast our car gets cold when we turn off the engine, and these people—what their energy bills must be for tiny little houses that are really trailers. So we have a lot more to do in this province." ],

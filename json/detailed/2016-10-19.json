  "text" : [ "Thank you very much, Speaker, for recognizing me to speak on Bill 41. I will be sharing my time with the member from Ottawa South.", "I feel very privileged on this extremely important piece of legislation because it sets up the future direction of our publicly funded health care system. As an Ontarian and as a Canadian, I am extremely proud of the fact that we have a publicly funded, universally accessible health care system that really ensures that all of us have the most important tenet of ensuring that we have good-quality lives in terms of a health care system available to us all.", "Speaker, as you know, I have the great honour and privilege of serving the great community of Ottawa Centre. In my community, I have amazing examples of incredible health care institutions that provide very important care in my community. I will highlight a few: places like the Centretown Community Health Centre, where I had the great honour of serving as a member of the board; or the Somerset West Community Health Centre, which serves the areas of Hintonburg, Mechanicsville, Westboro and Wellington Village; not to mention the Carlington Community Health Centre, serving the neighbourhood of Carlington and other surrounding areas. These three community health centres provide incredible, community-centred, locally focused health care. Through this important legislation, their role will be further enhanced as a strong front-line deliverer of health care.", "Other important institutions in my community in the great riding of Ottawa Centre are places like the Ottawa Hospital Civic Campus, which is almost 100 years old and has been serving the entire city of Ottawa—in fact, the entire region—for some time. It is the hub, the key trauma centre in our city, serving many, many people. In fact, my daughter, Elliana, was born at the civic hospital right in the riding, so I know the amazing health care professionals—the doctors, the nurses, the other medical staff—who do just an incredible job in serving our community.", "The other great institution in my community that is going to benefit tremendously through this legislation is the University of Ottawa Heart Institute, perhaps one of the best cardiac centres in the world, with world-class research taking place and care being provided. The heart institute, in fact, at this time, is going through a tremendous expansion. We’re investing almost $200 million in expanding the heart institute with new, state-of-the-art surgery rooms that are going to ensure better care.", "What Bill 41 does is it ensures the coordination of care in our communities, be it our community health centres or our hospitals or our family health teams, so that it all takes place in a manner that puts patients in the middle of it all. So instead of our patients, residents in my community, going from one health care service or facility to the other, they actually get health care built around them, making sure that the services they need are really focused on their needs as opposed to them trying to figure out what those services are.", "The last point I will make before I pass it on to the member from Ottawa South, and I’m sure that the Minister of Health will be speaking on this bill as well, is the focus on our seniors, making sure that our seniors have the important home care available to them.", "One of the biggest things I hear in my community when I’m going door to door to door every weekend is that seniors want to continue to live in their homes. They don’t want to live in a retirement home or long-term residence, and they want to get those important services delivered to them at home. I think this bill takes a very important step by making sure that that care coordination for seniors and the care they receive all gets coordinated at a local level through the local health integration network.", "Lastly, I just want to give a big shout-out and a thank you to the Champlain LHIN, the CEO at Champlain LHIN, Chantale LeClerc, and her entire team and staff who do an amazing job in our region in providing quality delivery of care. I’m very fortunate to come from Ottawa and represent the community of Ottawa Centre, which is a beneficiary of a very, very good, publicly funded, universally accessible health care system. I look forward to working along with the Minister of Health and our government and all members in this House in making sure that those types of health care services are available." ],

It was absolutely clear throughout the discussion how we all share the perspective that we need to ensure, as those responsible and accountable for providing health services in our provinces and territories, that we keep patients at the centre of all of our activities and the objectives, the goals that we set, the outcomes that we’re looking to achieve. It was gratifying to hear that strong consensus emerging from that gathering. It reinforces the object of this bill, which, by the title itself, but certainly through its contents, has as its core the patient-centred, patient-focused effort.", "I have already acknowledged the member for Ottawa South.

And it is hard; you would think after eight years I would have my bearings in this Legislature.", "But regardless of where they sit, Mr. Speaker, I have to say that both members from Ottawa, Ottawa South and Ottawa Centre, have done an extraordinary job in supporting this piece of legislation, providing strong advice and good advice to make sure that it delivers on its promise of delivering better patient-centred health care, better coordinated and collaborative health care in this province. I want to thank them and I want to thank, indeed, all of our government’s partners in health care that have participated in this process.", "Mr. Speaker, it’s true that every day across this province, in countless different ways, dedicated health care professionals are making a difference in the lives of Ontario patients, whether that’s in our hospitals, in our health care centres, our long-term-care homes or in our communities. These are the people responding to the needs of our families and our friends in their times of need. Together I believe we share one common goal, and that’s to do our very best for the people of Ontario.", "That’s why I want to thank all of our health care partners for all of their help in moving forward with our government’s plan to transform our health care system into one that puts patients first. I want to thank them for working with us on our proposal to help improve its structure.", "Mr. Speaker, if we are to move effectively ahead with our government’s proposal to improve the structure of our health care system, we must continue to be able to work together as true partners, with a shared interest in providing the best possible care for patients. Our history is proof that when we work together there is much that we can accomplish. Together, we’ve already made great strides in strengthening our health care system. Thanks to our ability to work together, we can say that 94% of Ontarians now have a regular family health care provider. More patients have access to care closer to home. We’re seeing shorter wait times for most surgical procedures, improved emergency department wait times, and more support for people to stay healthy through a greater focus on disease prevention and health promotion.", "It’s taken a lot of planning and a lot of hard work, but together we have made a difference in the lives of patients across this province. Consider the case of Linda, a patient with complex needs who has been benefiting from the services of the North Simcoe Community Health Link. Since connecting with her care coordinator, Linda says she now has access to so many agencies that she didn’t even know were available to her. That gives her a lot of comfort. She says some people just want someone who will listen, and through meeting with her care coordinator, Linda has said that she has built a relationship of trust. As a result, she has become more trusting and honest with her doctor as well. Today, Linda is leading a better quality of life because she’s better informed and our health care system is better integrated.", "But we have more work to do. Despite our successes, we know that, too often, the services that we deliver are, and remain, fragmented. Our system could be better coordinated, and the services that people rely on can be better distributed across this province.", "While the work we’ve done to date has made a tremendous difference for patients in Ontario, we need to ensure that our health care system is benefiting all patients equally right across the province. So my ministry and I are actively working, for example, with indigenous leadership and organizations to look at how we can improve health outcomes for indigenous peoples and their families and their communities. Many, as we know, are located in remote areas of this province.", "We know that newcomers to our country and our province are dealing with a health care system that doesn’t always fully recognize their challenges or perhaps doesn’t deliver culturally appropriate care. We also know that some Franco-Ontarians find it challenging to access the services that they need, and that we have a responsibility to provide, in French. We need to look at how we provide services to those faced with mental health and addictions issues to ensure that they have the care they need when and where they need it.", "Ontarians deserve to have a health care system that provides them with seamless, consistent and compassionate care. In order to strengthen our health care system, we must address the challenges that are preventing us from delivering fully integrated, patient-centred care. We know that, at their root, these challenges stem from the differences in how our health services are both planned and managed. Currently, the way our health care system is structured, our LHINs—our local health integration networks—are responsible for our hospitals, our long-term-care homes, community services and our mental health and addiction services. Yet, surprisingly, primary care, home and community care, and population and public health services are all being planned and managed in a distinctly different way. While CCACs—community care access centres—are accountable to LHINs for their performance and look to our LHINs for funding, they have their own boards that operate and function independently. Similarly, the work of our public health system in local communities operates separately from other health sectors—our primary care system.", "We have all the pieces of the puzzle, yet those individual pieces are not yet forming a cohesive picture, so we need to better integrate our health care system. That’s the structure I was talking about earlier. We need to get everyone working toward the same goal of providing easily accessible, fully integrated services, working in coordination for the benefit of all Ontarians.", "For all of these reasons, our government is proposing the legislation that’s before us today. This legislation builds on the commitments that we made through the Patients First action plan. That plan aims to improve the patients’ experience, make our system more transparent and even more accountable, and ensure that our universal health care system will be there when we need it for generations to come. These aren’t simply lofty ideals but principles worth striving for and worth defending—always. If we believe that everybody has a right to good health and good health care services, then we need to be asking ourselves how we can ensure universality, how we can improve access and how we can deliver the highest quality of care. The choices we make must be rooted in evidence and in the patient experience.", "To improve the health care experience for Ontarians, we need to move away from the status quo. We need to understand what our patients need in order to support the models that serve them best. In fact, every decision I make as Ontario’s Minister of Health and Long-Term Care is fully centred on these principles. I’m committed to providing Ontarians with faster access to the right care and to delivering better-coordinated and better-integrated care in their communities. I want to make sure that people and patients are getting the education, the information and the transparency they need to make the right decisions about their health.", "Just as important, I am committed to doing all of this while protecting our universal health care system. I’m committed to making decisions based on value and based on quality. This will help to ensure that the health care system that we enjoy today will continue to be there tomorrow for our children, our grandchildren and the generations beyond them.", "In order to deliver on that promise, that promise of equitable access to health care for all, we have to reorganize our system in a bold and transformational way. The Patients First Act proposes to do just that.", "If passed, the legislation before us today would help us to build a system that best meets the needs of Ontarians, a system that closes the gaps that exist and one that would help bring health care services to the people who truly need them most. A system that best meets the needs of patients in an equitable way is one that is truly population-focused and deeply integrated at the local level. To do that, we need strong local health system planning and strong management.", "About a decade ago, in April 2006, our government created the LHINs with the goal of improving local health care system planning, integration and service delivery to better meet the needs of patients. We did that because we understood that the best way to meet a local population’s needs was not by managing everything from an office here in Toronto, but by allowing local experts to control and implement care, care that best reflects the needs of the community.", "Mr. Speaker, as I have travelled across the province in my role as minister, I have had the opportunity to meet with all of our LHINs and their boards. Those opportunities demonstrated to me the depth of local knowledge and the capacity that each of our LHINs has to be true local managers of our health care system. Not only do they know the needs of the local population, but they also know the partners and the service providers who care for that population.", "I want to see the LHINs continue to evolve. I believe that they should play a more central role in our health care system, one that better acknowledges the true importance of local decision-making and local management. Part of that evolution includes primary care.", "Working alongside our partners in health care, our government is constantly engaging in discussions about the future of our health care system. Throughout that process, we’ve been fortunate to have benefited immeasurably from the work of a number of highly skilled experts, not the least of which were recommendations put forward by Dr. David Price, Elizabeth Baker and the panel members of the Primary Health Care Expert Advisory Committee. In their report on reforming primary care, a report that came from the experts, the front-line clinicians in primary care across this province itself, the panel called for primary care providers to be better integrated not just among themselves, but also within the health care system at the local level.", "The recommendations of the panel, a panel that emerged from those front-line expert and experienced clinicians in primary care themselves, have only served to reinforce what we already know about primary care: that it is an absolutely essential and important part of the bedrock of our health care system.", "Yet it needs to be better organized around the needs of patients and around the needs of the local population that it serves. That’s why we’re working to establish sub-regions within LHINs to serve as that focal point for population-based planning, for service alignment, integration and performance improvement—precisely the recommendation, the strongest recommendation, that came from that Primary Health Care Expert Advisory Committee.", "It’s important that we all understand that sub-regions aren’t boundaries. They will be geographic units that will enable planners and providers to better identify and respond to the health care needs of local communities in Ontario.", "Now, transforming our health care system into one that is focused on population health and equitable access requires greater and better local governance. We need our LHINs and local clinicians to play a much greater role in championing key activities at the community level, including population-based health care planning, health care services integration, clinical change management, and performance and quality improvement.", "But perhaps the single most important quality of a truly patient-centred health care system is that quality of being integrated. That includes further integrating our home and community care sector as well.", "For some time now, we have been working hard to transform our home and community care system so that it delivers better and more consistent care for the patients who rely on it. We followed explicitly the advice of Dr. Gail Donner and her expert group on home and community care, who told us that we needed to focus first on consistent services that meet the needs of local populations before we considered making changes to the structure and to the governance of that aspect of our health care system. We have done that.", "Last year, we launched our home and community care road map that outlined 10 concrete steps that we’re taking to improve the home care experience for both patients and caregivers. We are now taking steps to provide more consistent services across the province.", "What the Baker-Price report, and the report of Dr. Donner and her panel, and so many other expert reports have in common goes back to what I was speaking about earlier. It goes back to the belief that each and every Ontarian deserves to have a health care system that provides them with integrated, consistent and high-quality care. But it’s also about providing equity.", "We know that LHINs are uniquely positioned to help us deliver greater equity in health care. They have already demonstrated what they can do in terms of improving regional planning and the integration of services. Yet as the Auditor General has pointed out, LHINs have neither the mandate nor the tools to integrate all of the health services being offered.", "That is where the proposed Patients First Act would come in. What our government is proposing with this legislation is to give LHINs the tools they need to better integrate our health care system. It’s in their name—local health integration network—yet they need to have the tools and the resources to fully integrate what often can be a fractured health care system.", "We’re proposing to give LHINs the responsibility for the management and service delivery of home and community care, for primary care, planning and performance management, and, importantly, for building stronger links with public health.", "Mr. Speaker, I’m a public health physician myself. By forging those stronger links between our public health units, our medical offices of health and our LHINs, that is to the benefit of all of us. The experts—not the only experts, but truly experts—in population health, in health equity, in the social determinants of health are our public health workers, our medical officers of health, our RNs, our managers, those who work in that public health system. What we need is the benefit of their expertise, of their experience throughout our health care system as we continue to push further towards a wellness approach to the delivery of health services. We need to know that we’re doing that in an equitable way, in a way which reflects population health needs and impacts social determinants of health.", "We also intend to make our LHINs more accountable to the public. By focusing on a local approach, we expect to reduce bureaucracy and administration in home and community care to remove overlap and duplication and to make it easier for patients to find a doctor or to find home care when they need it.", "With the support and oversight of the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, LHINs would be able to build new connections between primary care providers, hospitals, home and community care, and public health to improve health care for Ontarians across the province, no matter where they live.", "Those are those missing pieces. Our LHINs are already responsible for long-term-care homes, for community services, for our hospitals, for mental health services; we are bringing those other elements, those remaining elements of our health care system, into the fold. That coordination is most important to the patient and the patient experience. They’re not interested in the structure or the governance. Patients and Ontarians are interested in receiving the highest quality of care in a timely fashion and in a way that is as seamless and coordinated as possible. It all comes back to the patient.", "One thing we need to keep in mind about this proposed legislation is that a patient’s primary concern, as I mentioned, is not the structure of our health care system; they rely on us for that. The patient’s principal concern is whether they get the care they need and whether it’s going to be there when they need it.", "What we’re proposing to do with this legislation is to create an easier way to access the health care system that respects a patient’s right to choice. What we’re proposing to do will provide patients with one point of contact to access primary care and the other services that they need, with better access to same-day, next-day, after-hours and weekend care.", "For our doctors, our nurses, our care providers, this proposed legislation would provide them with a structure that supports greater integration, while still maintaining their clinical autonomy.", "If passed, this bill would enable our specialists to benefit from stronger local planning that would enhance their access to services and promote the use of technology and telemedicine to provide better service to complex patients, regardless of where they live. For hospitals, this new structure would help with high rates of hospital readmission, alternate level of care days and the inappropriate use of emergency services. The essential work that our CCAC employees are doing would continue under the proposed legislation, but under this new vision, the CCACs would be working directly within our LHINs. Public health practitioners would continue the important work that they’re doing, but they would be more connected to the rest of our health care system. For those in the long-term-care sector, it would mean better support in managing transitions for clients between acute and home and community care, with better service planning in the home and community care sector.", "The proposed legislation before us today would make for a more efficient health care system, reducing the duplication of services and resulting in a better sharing of information. It would help us build connections across the health care system, across that full continuum of care.", "Now, it’s important to point out that the proposed legislation was built through the hard work of our government in consultation with all of our health care partners, all of our stakeholders and, most importantly, Ontario patients.", "That consultation began last December when I put forward a discussion paper for all to consider. We heard from all of our stakeholders. We heard from and interacted with more than 6,000 individuals. We consulted numerous times with the Ontario Medical Association. We received direct consultative feedback from our doctors from the OMA. We consulted with our nurses. We consulted with virtually every one of our stakeholders; those that represent them were made aware and invited to participate.", "We took many, many months to ensure that we were able to benefit from their expertise and their perspective and incorporate that into this act. In fact, by introducing it just before the summer and then reintroducing it recently, we had the benefit of that entire summer period to go back, with this specific proposed legislation, to our partners, to go back to the OMA, to go back to the nurses, to go back to other health care providers and stakeholders—those that provide home and community care, those in our long-term-care homes, those in our hospitals—to benefit from their experience through a consultative process and incorporate their good ideas to make this legislation even stronger.", "I mentioned the thorough consultation with our stakeholders and our health care providers, but we also consulted across the province with Ontarians—with patients, with clients, with individual Ontarians, with caregivers—that have the greatest stake in this. We consulted and engaged extensively, in English and in French, with more than 6,000 individuals and organizations across the province to help inform the proposed improvements to the health care system—and, I should point out, Mr. Speaker, improvements that were based on expert panels from within the health system realm to begin with: from those experts, those front-line workers, those with experience in primary care and home and community care that provided us with the substrate for this act that you see before you today.", "We spoke with patients, with caregivers, with francophones, with indigenous peoples, health care partners, staff, clinicians, municipal and other community and government partners to gather feedback on our proposal.", "When the ministry first released the Patients First discussion document back in December, I made a commitment at that time to meaningfully engage with indigenous partners. We’re following through on that commitment through a parallel process that will collaboratively identify specifically what is needed for responsive and transformational change, especially with respect to equitable access to services that meet their unique needs. Of course, we will also continue to work with First Nations, Métis, Inuit and urban indigenous partners to foster positive relationships and ensure that any changes in the proposed legislation will not negatively impact their current or future access to care.", "I was gratified on my initiative yesterday. We had a two-hour meeting as part of the federal-provincial-territorial ministers of health meeting, a two-hour meeting specifically with indigenous leadership from across this country: First Nations, Métis and Inuit. We spent more than two hours listening to them, hearing from them about the challenges that they face, about the bold and concrete proposals they have to move forward to reduce and eventually eliminate those negative health outcomes that we know are so pervasive through those communities across this nation.", "We’ve also taken steps to ensure that one of the key planning objectives of the LHINs is to encourage access and better integrate the health needs of the francophone community at the local level. This was a key objective that the French Language Health Services Advisory Council asked us to consider, and I fully supported this objective.", "We have gathered feedback from across the province. Most of those consulted agreed that there is a need to focus on achieving better system integration, improved performance, needs-based planning and delivery, greater health equity, and continuity in home and community care as well as in primary care. The vast majority of the feedback we received was supportive of the strategies proposed, so we knew we were headed in the right direction with the legislation that we were developing.", "We also received feedback that suggested additional priorities needed to be addressed, including the need for strong collaboration between the LHINs and primary care providers, and removing the LHIN directive over hospitals so that directive powers—for operations and new policies—and supervisory powers are only at the minister’s direction. You will see from the proposed legislation that we’ve taken steps to respond effectively to that feedback.", "Further, Mr. Speaker, you may note that the proposed legislation here today has, in fact, continued to evolve from the earlier Bill 210 which, as I mentioned, was first introduced back in June. This bill is the result of ongoing conversations, conversations with our health care partners, conversations that continued throughout the summer, have continued into the fall and continue as we move forward with this bill.", "Speaker, I can say with confidence that we have left no stone unturned in our effort to create the best possible legislation and, if passed, our government will continue to rely on our partners in health care for their input and additional feedback. It’s important that if we undertake any changes to our health care system, we must do so carefully and in partnership with all of our health care partners to make sure that patients have ongoing, smooth, coordinated access to the health services that they depend on, that they need to rely on and that we have the responsibility to provide. The goal here is to make changes to the structure and governance of our health care system as seamlessly as possible, so that Ontarians can continue to enjoy the high-quality care that they have come to expect. Our government remains as committed as ever to the goal of putting patients at the centre of all we do in health care. The proposed Patients First Act is the next step in ensuring a system that is best able to deliver on that commitment.", "Before I wrap up and hand things over to the MPP for Ottawa South—I got it right that time—I just want to take a moment to, once again, thank all of our partners in health care, to thank them for their continuing contribution to the legislation we are considering here today. This truly is their legislation. It emerged and has grown from the advice that we have received through expert panels, through task forces, through consultation and through regular engagement of our health partners. They will be able to see themselves in the evolution of this important piece of legislation, so I want to thank them for that contribution and the continuing contribution that they make every day to serving the people of Ontario.", "Mr. Speaker, in closing, we want to ensure that patients in Ontario have equitable access to care, that their needs are being met and that their choices are being respected. We look forward to continuing to build on those relationships with our partners as we move forward, and not just with our health care partners but with patients, with clients, with Ontarians, with caregivers who are critically important participants. Thank you all. I know I have spoken at length about why our government would like to see the proposed Patients First Act enacted into law and why it’s necessary for the future of our health care system. I would now like to turn things over to my colleague the member from Ottawa South, who will walk us through some details of the proposed legislation." ],

The proposed Patients First Act is, of course, the next step forward made in Patients First: Action Plan for Health Care, which Minister Hoskins released last year. I would like to thank the minister for his leadership on this file and congratulate him on the action plan and this piece of legislation. I’m proud to be associated with both.", "We’ve just heard from the minister about why this legislation is so critical and about why it is so important to move ahead and plan to transform our health care system into one that puts the needs of patients at its centre. What I would like to do now is demonstrate to all of my colleagues in this House how we are going to achieve this.", "Bill 41, if passed by the Ontario Legislature, would help us fulfill our action plan to provide patients with faster access to the right care, to better home and community care, to the information they need to live healthy lives, and a health care system that’s sustainable for generations to come.", "It starts with a clear objective. Our government is committed to improving the patient experience in Ontario and to provide better care for Ontarians no matter where they live. What does this mean? It means improving the communication and connections between primary health care providers such as family doctors, nurse practitioners, interprofessional health care teams, hospitals, and home and community care for a smoother patient experience. It means making it easier for patients to try to find a family doctor or nurse practitioner when they need one, to see the provider quickly when they are sick, and to find the care they need closer to home. It means making it easier for doctors, nurses and other primary care providers to connect their patients to the health care that they need. It means ensuring that there’s local planning so that health care providers are available to patients where and when they are needed. It means strengthening indigenous and francophone involvement in the planning, design and delivery of health programs and services being provided to their communities.", "What’s key is that all of this depends on expanding the mandates of the local health integration networks. Fundamentally, this is all about better integration of services across our health care system. That is what LHINs were created to do, and with this bill, if passed, LHINs will be able to plan, fund and integrate health services at the local and sub-regional levels.", "I’d like to point out to my colleagues that this legislation is comprehensive; it touches on so many different pieces of existing legislation but is built upon some very basic principles. The first is a more effective integration of services and greater equity. When you look at the heart of what we’re doing with this proposed legislation, this is all about better integration of health care services across the system. If your key goal is patient-centred care that puts patients first, then, by definition, all other components of the system need to be working towards that together.", "Mr. Hoskins believes and I believe that what patients need and what Ontarians need and deserve is a health care system that is seamless. What does this mean? It means more consistent care for the patients who rely on it. It means good, compassionate care whoever you are, whatever your ethnicity, wherever you live and however much you earn. Nobody disagrees with that; in fact, it is what everybody strives for.", "Even though we’ve built a health care system we can be proud of, there still exist some challenges to the full delivery of integrated, patient-centred care. These challenges, more often than not, boil down to the separation of our various health care services—separation not in what these health services want to accomplish, which is better patient outcomes, but separation in how our health care services are planned and managed.", "Right now, LHINs have responsibility for hospitals, long-term-care homes, community services and our mental health and addiction services. They manage all of these locally across their regions, but primary care services are planned and managed in a distinctly different way, and home and community care services and public health services as well—again, planned and managed in different ways. We can’t get to where we want to go with everyone trying to move forward at times in a disconnected way. We need to have somebody lead the integration of services. You have to have somebody who takes responsibility for ensuring that the partners are working together and collaborating. If we have this, we can make sure that we’re moving together in the right direction. We can ensure that the various health services we offer are working in coordination with one another, for the specific benefit of Ontario patients.", "We all know the disconnect that we hear in our communities between different health services and people being able to access services in another area, transferring and transitioning between different types of care. What we’re proposing is to expand the mandate of our 14 LHINs so that they can be the ones who help to coordinate and foster the collaboration that’s needed to make sure those services are connected together, that people have access, and that there’s a focus on outcomes.", "This bill, if passed, would give LHINs responsibility for overseeing primary care planning. It would put them in charge of home and community care delivery and would give them responsibility for developing formal linkages with public health to improve population health planning.", "This bill, if passed, would make LHINs the central hubs of our local health care systems, responsible for planning, managing and improving the performance of virtually every aspect of health care in their respective regions. LHINs would be responsible for working with providers across the care continuum to improve access to high-quality and consistent care and to make the system easier to navigate for all Ontarians.", "Ontario LHINs have been moving in this direction for years now. They have a mandate to make health care more integrated and responsive to local needs, and they have made some tremendous progress.", "I know that in the Champlain region of Ottawa, we’ve made tremendous progress on wait times in terms of our hips and knees. We’ve made tremendous progress on youth mental health and addiction and suicide prevention for our young people. This is all a result of local planning, local collaboration and local leadership that has made that very effective and helped to serve the patients of the Champlain region very well.", "LHINs have a mandate to make health care more integrated and responsive to local needs. They have run up against the fact that they neither have the official mandate nor tools to integrate all the local health services Ontario offers. If you can’t integrate all of your health care services, you can’t fully integrate your health care system. We’re proposing to give them the mandate and the tools that they need.", "If passed, the Patients First Act would give Ontario LHINs responsibility for local health care and make them more accountable to the Minister of Health and Long-Term Care for their performance.", "As part of this process, the LHINs are working to fully establish sub-regions, which would become the focal point for local planning, service management and delivery. These sub-regions would be places where primary care would be better integrated with home and community care and other local, community-based health services to ensure—" ],

That means, across the province, that patients are going to get equitable access to services.", "Another principle of this bill is focused on our goal of providing timely access to primary care and seamless links to other services. This is an area where a great deal of work remains to be done in this province. We must work to deliver even more effective primary care, and, because this is integral to the notion of primary care being the gateway to the entire system, that includes delivering primary care that in turn links patients to the other services that they need.", "If this bill is passed, LHINs would, in partnership with local clinical leaders, take responsibility for primary care planning and performance management. The ministry would continue to negotiate physician compensation and primary care contracts, but the LHINs would work closely with primary care providers to plan services, undertake human health resources planning, improve access to interprofessional teams for those who need it most and link patients with primary care services.", "Mr. Speaker, I think this measure in the proposed legislation will be able to enhance things like advance care planning. We have a challenge in our communities in terms of how people access palliative and end-of-life care, and a lot of that has to do with how our primary care is approaching advance care planning. From my perspective, I think that this measure in the bill will be a very effective tool in working in collaboration with primary care to make sure that people are prepared and understand how to access the system—that the system understand what’s important to them. I think this is a really critical part of the bill. I want to stress that this part of the bill is about working in collaboration and partnership, because I think that’s what our patients need and deserve from both our physicians and other primary health care providers and the government.", "Effectively, LHINs would be the focal point for care planning and care management. We would bring primary care planning much closer to communities where the services are being delivered and to the patients who are receiving those services. Think about how effective this would be for patients. The LHINs or LHIN sub-regions would engage local clinical leaders. They would monitor performance, identify performance challenges and implement targeted improvements. They would be perfectly placed to improve patient access to interprofessional teams. They would also be responsible for recruitment planning in partnership with local clinician leaders, and each LHIN sub-region would have a process to match unattached patients with a primary care provider.", "This isn’t about telling patients which doctor they can see or taking patients away from doctors. Quite the contrary, it’s about ensuring that every patient who wants a family doctor or a nurse practitioner can have one. Our government takes a great deal of pride in the progress that we’ve made to help ensure that patients have access to primary care services.", "The Patients First Act is also focused on delivering more consistent and accessible home and community care. What we propose to do is to give LHINs responsibility for the management and service delivery of home and community care. We would transfer direct responsibility for service management and delivery from the community care access centres, which currently undertake work for the LHINs. These LHINs would govern and manage the delivery of home and community care. This would mean that CCAC boards would cease to exist and that all CCAC functions, as well as those CCAC employees who provide client support, would be transferred over to the LHINs. This also means the transition would be seamless for the patient. Former CCAC employees would continue to provide care coordination, and home care services would still be provided by current service providers. Continuity of care is a top priority.", "What this transition would do is allow the LHINs to further integrate home and community care with our hospitals and primary care providers. Our home and community care workers are going to be better connected with doctors, nurse practitioners, nurses and other health professionals, working together to put patients first.", "And, Speaker, I need to be very clear. The decision to transfer our CCACs into the LHINs is not a reflection on their work, because they have done some great work. In 2015-16, over 646,000 Ontarians received home care from CCACs. CCACs have delivered home care in this province to tens of thousands of people in tens of thousands of places every day. And, in that year, 2015-16, approximately 210,000 people were able to return home from hospital with CCAC care. That year, Ontario CCACs delivered 28.7 million hours in personal support and homemaking visits, 6.9 million hours in nursing visits and 1.7 million hours in therapy visits.", "CCAC employees have worked hard to provide services to Ontarians for many, many years, and we look forward to those employees continuing to work with the LHINs to improve home and community care, which includes implementing the Roadmap to Strengthen Home and Community Care.", "Another way the Patients First Act, if passed, would help improve our health care system is by strengthening the links between population and public health, and other health services. Again, it’s a question of bringing forward all of our health services together on the same team, with patients the main focus.", "This bill, if passed, would integrate local population and public health planning with other services by formalizing the linkages between LHINs and public health units. This would create a formal relationship between the medical officers of health and each LHIN, so that they can engage with each other and work on planning together.", "I know that in my community of Ottawa, we’re very fortunate. Our Chief Medical Officer of Health has actually worked quite closely with many of the health partners to address things like youth addiction and teen suicide, and understood that that was a population health problem. We need to do that across Ontario. We need to have that kind of system collaboration and co-operation. I want to thank Dr. Isra Levy for his leadership in that regard.", "By engaging the medical officers of health, it would allow us to ensure that public health services are being directed to the people who need them most. Because right now, unfortunately, the people who need them most are those who experience the most significant barriers to access.", "Linkages between LHINs, public health and other health services would allow for joint planning activities and greater consistency of service. We know there are disparities in the capacity of some of the local public health units, and further integrating local health care systems would allow us to reduce and even eliminate those gaps.", "Speaker, those are the four areas of focus. I want to make it clear that in all of these areas, our goal is to simplify and improve the patient experience. Through this plan, there would be no added bureaucracy, and any financial savings would go to improving patient care.", "We would undertake any changes carefully and in collaboration with our health care partners to make sure that patients have ongoing, smooth access to the health care services they depend on, and we would update patients, caregivers and partners all along the way.", "I also want to add that our government will continue working with First Nations, Métis, Inuit and urban indigenous partners and health providers to ensure that their voices are heard, in particular with respect to equitable access to services that meet their unique needs. Our indigenous partners have been very clear for some time that there’s a real need for a respectful engagement process to help address the unique relationships between indigenous peoples and the health care system. I would like to echo the comments made by Minister Hoskins, that we’re committed to meaningful engagement with our indigenous partners and we’re following through on that commitment through parallel processes that will collaboratively identify what is needed for responsive and transformative change.", "Should this legislation pass, we would be moving forward with the meaningful and productive engagement that is geared to achieving results and improving patient outcomes.", "It might also interest my colleagues, as the minister said, that we had some considerable time over the summer to take a look at the direction of the bill and take the input of stakeholders. With some of the changes that we have made and incorporated into this bill that has been put forward, it would be very clear that the proposed directive powers over hospitals for operations and new policies, and the proposed power to appoint a supervisor over a hospital, would only be at the minister’s discretion.", "It would be clear that the LHIN oversight of primary care providers, including physicians, would be to support collaboration between the LHINs and primary care providers.", "And it is extremely important that it would recognize the importance of French-language services provision and enhance more equitably access to health care services for the francophone community.", "Speaker, I don’t have much time left. I simply want to say that this bill proposes a great many benefits for health care in Ontario. I’m very proud to support it, and thank my colleagues for their time and attention." ],

It sounds great, but when it gets to the actual hospitals, they’re seeing in many cases an actual reduction in funding. At one of my hospitals in particular, it’s almost a million-dollar cut, when you look at the whole funding envelope. Money is not getting to the hospitals.", "When I look at some of the increases they have had, of course, salaries—hydro has not had as big an impact in the city of Cornwall, because at Cornwall Electric, we’re somewhat insulated. But out in the rural areas—we’re serviced by two hospitals, one in Alexandria and one in Winchester—they’re not so lucky. They’re seeing significant increases in energy costs that has to come out of that million-dollar loss.", "You can see the challenges. Wages are up.

We’ve heard these all before when it comes to the LHIN and we haven’t seen the net benefit in our communities.", "I’ll tell you about some of the challenges that we have at our local hospitals: nurses that have been laid off, front-line-care workers that aren’t able to deliver the care that’s needed in our emergency hospitals. We’ve got a resurgence of nurses coming back to Windsor for work from all parts. They’re coming back to Windsor for jobs. Guess where they’re working? At Beaumont Hospital in Michigan and at Henry Ford hospital in Michigan because there have been such drastic cuts to our health care system in Ontario that they can’t get a job. These are nurses that have been educated here in Ontario, are fully certified and fully ready to contribute to our health care system but can’t get a job due to the cuts—juxtaposed with a federal government that is now going to slash even more than the Harper government did.", "We need a Minister of Health that is going to advocate for true support from the federal level—true accountability. Undoubtedly, this bill comes on the heels of an Auditor General report where we saw that the CCACs spent 40% of their budget on administrative costs, nearly $1 billion a year. We know that’s why this is coming forward, but it does nothing to support front-line care. We’ve got home care workers who are barely making minimum wage. You can’t provide quality service to people in this province if you’re not going to pay the people correctly and you’re relying on private care providers. There are systems out there that are better than this, and we expect better than this from the government of Ontario." ],

But he’s worked in a number of provincial health care systems. He’s an operating room nurse and describes this system here as phenomenal.", "My mother has had several battles with cancer in this system, and she has lived in three provinces.

She lives two blocks away. She’s 89 years old—in about two weeks—and she lives independently. That says something. For all the carping about that, I can tell you the health care system in this province, I think, is, if not the best in the world, one of the best in the world.", "I have had the privilege of living in a few other places.

I understand what the Minister of Health and Long-Term Care wants to do; hence, a nice title: “Patients First.” I always have concerns in our health care because we need to take a lot of the money and flatten some of the organizations.

I’m sure that that’s what the minister’s intentions are, but, again, I’m concerned about that.", "We’ve even had discussions about hospitals and what I would call “empire building” and how, again, we need to take those dollars that are maybe rich at the top and push them down to the front line where we can hire more front-line workers, because health care, obviously, is the biggest expenditure in our government this day.", "Again, we have some serious concerns and hopefully that can get sorted out in committee." ],

She also served as the parliamentary assistant to the Solicitor General from 1989 to 1990. This was a time, Speaker, when debates centred on victims’ rights, children and families within the justice system, and the Special Investigations Unit.", "I’m not certain what sparked her interest in politics, but it might have happened in 1983. That year, she was named as special adviser to the late Supreme Court Justice John Sopinka, who chaired the William Davis government’s Task Force on Equal Opportunity in Athletics. The report was an analysis of physical activities for boys and girls in Ontario’s public school system, noting that boys were more advantaged than girls in sports and exercise in Ontario and concluding that there should be greater equality. Her contributions to that task force helped set the tone for the changes that would come in the decades ahead.", "Before politics, she made her mark in competitive marathon swimming—first, at the young age of 16 years old. In 1974, she matched Marilyn Bell’s 1954 crossing of a wind-swept Lake Ontario, and she did it in a record time of 15 hours and 10 minutes. Her little group, which included her father and a Globe and Mail reporter, departed from Youngstown, New York, at 2 a.m. on the morning of August 16. Except for family and friends and, of course, the intrepid Globe reporter, no one knew of the attempt. They were armed only with a 10-foot wooden dinghy, a compass, a 10-horsepower outboard motor and some leftovers from the refrigerator. It wasn’t until they were spotted the next morning by a passing pilot that news spread and she was accompanied by a flotilla to Exhibition Place in Toronto.", "This was a time in our history, Speaker, when Canadians were searching for heroes, and her fame spread instantly. As she said in 2005 at her induction ceremony into the international hall of fame, “I became a celebrity overnight.” She also said at that time that the swim “would have to be the highlight of my career because it was the first time doing a long swim.” But Speaker, her swimming exploits did not end on the shoreline of Lake Ontario. She went on to cross the English Channel 19 times and held the women’s record for the crossing until 1988. She was known as the queen of the channel from 1987 to 1992.", "Cindy became a lawyer in Scarborough after obtaining her degrees at the universities of Toronto and Windsor. She received numerous awards, including being made a member of the Order of Canada in 1979, inducted into the sports hall of fame in 2003 and the swimming hall of fame in 2005.", "In addition, Cindy was the first recipient of the Scarborough Award of Merit and was honoured with a star on the Scarborough Walk of Fame in 2006. Now, each year, the local community recognizes her contributions with the annual Cindy Nicholas Swim Classic, marking 40 years in 2017. And her dream of an Olympic pool at the University of Toronto’s Scarborough campus was finally realized in 2015.", "She loved her community and the people there who sought her help. She was a member of the youth employment project advisory committee and the sports head injury inquiry, and she also served on many other community and charitable boards, overall improving the lives of so many residents, Speaker, so many residents. Michael Read, the Channel Swimming Association president, said, “She was an incredible swimmer, her achievements were seemingly endless and well-deserved, a lovely and charming person and a great inspiration to all who were lucky enough to meet her.”", "Cindy Nicholas was a national and local hero. She was a passionate champion for sport and for Scarborough, always proud of her roots. To Cindy’s family, Cindy leaves a tremendous legacy to the province as well as to Canada, and for that we’re extremely grateful." ],

I am honoured to stand and pay tribute and remember Cindy Nicholas.", "First, I would like to welcome her family and friends to the Legislature today. Welcome to Leahanne LeGrow and her father, Raymond LeGrow. They are joined today by Cindy’s cousins Gail Wheeler and Pam Dornan, and friends Marsha Simmonds and Shoshana Teitelman. Welcome to Queen’s Park.", "When we pay tribute to former MPPs, it is a chance to remember them, to recognize their work and celebrate their lasting impact. It is also a special chance to connect with their loved ones. Thank you to Cindy’s only daughter, Leahanne, for sharing some of her very special memories.", "Many of us remember Cindy Nicholas as being the legendary and record-breaking marathon open water swimmer. Cindy swam across Lake Ontario from Youngstown, New York to the CNE in Toronto when she was just 16 years old. She dived into the lake at 16 and in that moment into the public eye. She was the very first woman to complete a nonstop two-way crossing of the English Channel in 1977, finishing with the fastest time of any male or female swimmer. She was known as the queen of the channel because she swam the channel 19 times.", "Cindy was well-recognized for her athletic achievement, being named top female athlete of the year in 1977 and given the Bobbie Rosenfeld Award. She was made a member of the Order of Canada in 1979 and was inducted into Canada’s Sports Hall of Fame in 1993, inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 2003, and into the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 2005.", "She always liked to swim, and was a very competitive person and wanted to be good at everything. She was always encouraged by her father, Jim, and her parents were wonderful supporters and made sure she had all the opportunities she could. Throughout Cindy’s life, whenever she was in the water, they were right alongside her in the boat.", "It seemed that her father also really enjoyed Cindy’s opportunities. She was in law school and her father said, “Cindy, there is an opportunity for a race in Egypt.” But Cindy said, “Daddy, I don’t really want to swim in the Nile.” But Dad thought Egypt was a pretty neat opportunity, and she did end up swimming in the Nile, with him alongside her, which does sound like a pretty special adventure.", "Cindy was very close to her parents. She grew up in Scarborough, in Cliffcrest. She grew up there, made lifelong friends there, worked there and knew she wanted to represent it. She was elected to the Ontario Legislature in 1987, to serve her neighbours and constituents in the riding of Scarborough Centre. She was a Liberal MPP who served as parliamentary assistant to the Solicitor General from 1989 to 1990.", "Cindy was elected in 1987, and Leahanne was born in 1988. While she doesn’t remember much from that time, her very first family picture was proudly taken on the steps of Queen’s Park. Cindy remembered fondly that she used to tote Leahanne around with her. When the bells would ring and she would have to come into the chamber, she would have to hand Leahanne off to whoever was closest, and afterwards come out of the chamber and have to ask, “Who’s got Leahanne?”", "Apparently, even back in the late 1980s, traffic was a challenge. Cindy and Leahanne spent a lot of time sitting on the DVP, singing songs in the car.", "Cindy loved her community. There were about four blocks between her home and constituency office, and another block to her parents’. She actively and wholeheartedly represented her riding. She was always proud of her time at Queen’s Park, and at the end of her term in 1990, she continued to be an active participant in her community. She was a lawyer, and her office was right around the corner from the grocery store and her church, and she couldn’t go anywhere without connecting with someone. She was well known and well respected by her clients and neighbours. She inspired others. Scarborough thought so much of her, and she thought so much of her community.", "Cindy became a member of the Scarborough Walk of Fame at the Scarborough Town Centre in 2006, as one of the first people recognized for sports achievement. She was later on the nomination committee, because she grew up there. She knew the community, and she wanted to be active in recognizing the good folks from the area who deserved recognition for making Scarborough great.", "She was so proud of the community and wanted big things for it. In fact, she always said they needed a bigger pool in the east end. She was so excited to finally see that happen with the Pan Am centre.", "Cindy always had big goals, a big heart, but also a big pool. Generally, people have about a 30-foot pool, but their family pool in Cliffcrest was a 52-footer. She never lost her love of swimming, and in her retirement, she still swam a couple of miles a day.", "She continued to give back and connect. She dedicated much of her time to her dear mother, Victoria, and to volunteering across Scarborough, appreciating the needs and strengths across the community she knew so well and loved so much.", "Cindy Nicholas was sadly lost to her family, community and to the province too soon, at the age of 58, after a battle with cancer. Thank you to her family and friends for sharing her with us. We offer our sincerest condolences.", "Those who knew Cindy in real life are richer for knowing her, and those who knew Cindy as larger than life were inspired by her. Cindy Nicholas dived into our hearts at 16, made waves throughout her life, and her love, strength and authentic spirit will forever send ripples throughout our province." ],

For the most part, we tend to acknowledge those that have left public life and have often gone on to some form of retirement prior to their passing. Unfortunately, today we’re here to pay tribute to Cindy Nicholas, former MPP for Scarborough Centre, who left us far too young.", "I would like to acknowledge those—they’ve already been acknowledged—who are in the audience today: her daughter, Leahanne LeGrow; her former husband, Ray LeGrow; her cousins Gail and Michael Wheeler, Pam Dornan, Ryan Wheeler; and some of her close friends who are here; as well as a friend and former colleague in this Legislature, Steve Mahoney. I want to thank them for being here as well.", "I had the privilege and opportunity to connect with Cindy’s mother, Victoria, at Cindy’s memorial earlier this summer. I was actually somewhat surprised to learn that she remembered this young kid from Scarborough in her living room with a number of my political friends, on behalf of the then opposition leader David Peterson, trying to convince Cindy and her family that running for a provincial seat in Scarborough would actually be a good idea. I’ve got to tell you that while that first try was unsuccessful at getting Cindy to run, I recall that there was no doubt in our minds whatsoever that Cindy had a very strong desire to serve the public. Three years later, indeed, she did answer that call.", "In many ways, she had been serving in public life for her entire adult life—and really her teenage life as well when you think about it. Public office was really just the next step in what I would call a lifetime of service to Scarborough, to Ontario, to Canada, and, frankly, to the world.", "We all know that Cindy Nicholas was a truly accomplished long-distance swimmer, and my colleagues have spoken about some of her incredible feats. Her accomplishments in the water are frankly unrivalled, and they’re unrivalled to this day. She defied the impossible. At age 16, as was mentioned, she swam Lake Ontario in just over 15 hours. I think that was a record at the time.", "Through the years, she swam the English Channel, as was mentioned—I find this absolutely incredible—19 times, earning the title of Queen of the Channel. She was also the first woman to complete a two-way crossing of the Channel, and she did that in the quickest result ever for a male or a female. Again, that’s something that would have been seen at the time as absolutely impossible.", "She was unsurprisingly named the top Canadian athlete in 1977 and she earned that Bobbie Rosenfeld Award. She was named a member of the Order of Canada, as was mentioned, in 1979. She is, of course, in both Canada’s and the Ontario Sports Halls of Fame, and of course she’s in the International Swimming Hall of Fame. I don’t think there was ever a doubt, probably from the time she was 16, that she wouldn’t be getting those honours.", "Two of the honours that were mentioned by my colleague from Whitby–Oshawa were the honour of the Scarborough Award of Merit and the Scarborough Walk of Fame. I was with her during those ceremonies. I know how proud she was of those as well because she really was a true champion of her home community in Scarborough.", "When I think about it, Cindy’s real accomplishments didn’t just come in the pool, in the lake or in the Channel. They went far beyond that. Cindy was an inspiration to generations of Canadians of what could be achieved through perseverance, through training and determination.", "At the same time, Cindy was unique for a sports celebrity. She never, ever lost her humble Scarborough youthful innocence. To call her “Scarborough’s Sweetheart” nowadays might be considered borderline sexist, but that’s what she was referred to, back in the 1970s and 1980s, often in the media. Really, that was in response to the fact that this great athlete and this strong and determined role model was an incredibly kind and caring human being at the very inner core of her being.", "Yes, she worked here at Queen’s Park between 1987 and 1990, and she served on many committees and as a parliamentary assistant to a couple of ministers during her time here. But again, what made Cindy stand out at Queen’s Park wasn’t her legislative achievements as much as it was the fact that she always maintained her Cindy Nicholas kind and sweet personality. The cut and thrust of partisan debate simply never had a place with Cindy Nicholas. Her ability to come across as “just Cindy” was always noted by her constituents, Ontarians and her colleagues—Steve Mahoney would remember—and I think all of us in this Legislature, many of whom had very close connections with Cindy.", "And so, I say on behalf of all of us today, on this side of the House and on all sides of the House, Cindy Nicholas is missed and will always be missed by all who knew her. We thank and acknowledge her loved ones—many of them are here today; some of them couldn’t be here. I hope that today’s celebration of Cindy’s life brings you comfort in her premature loss, and I hope that the reflections that you’ve heard in this Legislature today that we’ve all had the opportunity and the privilege to share with you—reflections of Cindy’s huge accomplishments and of her as the person that she was—bring smiles to your faces as well today, along with pride in having been such an important part of her life, as she was an important part of all of ours: all Ontarians, all Canadians." ],

Can you imagine a town with 1,500 people in the area with no grocery store?

Mike was prepared. He saw that number and he was prepared to live with that number. He called me a couple of months ago, and his hydro bill was $6,800 a month. He called me a few days ago, and his last hydro bill was $7,500 for 35 days. Mike is almost down for the count.", "The Premier says she wants to create jobs in rural Ontario, but why have they gotten to the point where they’re actually killing small business throughout the province?" ],

His involvement within the Davenport community and in community development has been an inspiration both to me and to our community.", "Everywhere you look in Regal Heights, you see his influence, whether it is in the friendship and co-operation between residents, or the garden in the park which he helped build. Over the years, he planted trees, removed graffiti, organized community carolling and Canada Day processions, annual community clean-ups and art installations, and planted bulbs on what is known today as Daffodil Hill at Davenport Road and Dufferin. Dick also promoted the history and heritage of the area by supporting the restoration of the portico at Regal Heights public school and hosting annual heritage walking tours.", "His constant initiatives on behalf of the community were extensive, and he did them all for the benefit of everyone. It was his true dedication to his community that made Dick Watts special.", "Sadly, Dick passed away at the age of 93 on October 12, 2015. Last week, I attended a ceremony with the local community, Dick’s wife, family, and friends to commemorate a recently renovated staircase at Regal Road and Glenholme Avenue that descends onto Davenport Road." ],

I welcome all our friends today.", "As the Attorney General, the issue of access to justice is incredibly important to me, and it should be to all members. In all of its forms, access to justice is the most central and relevant challenge facing the broader legal community today. We must always be working to ensure that all people enjoy the same advantages in our justice system, regardless of financial means, geography, ethnicity, sexuality or gender identity or expression.", "The Action Group on Access to Justice’s recent report, entitled Public Perceptions of Access to Justice in Ontario, which was conducted by Abacus Data, makes this very clear: 78% of the people who participated in the study said they felt Ontario’s justice system was old-fashioned. About 70% of people said it was intimidating and confusing. Four in 10 people said they do not believe they have equal and fair access to the justice system.", "Speaker, it is clear that the status quo is not working. The reality is that our justice system and our services are not always modern and accessible, which people expect and deserve. We need to shake things up.", "I’m excited by this challenge because I believe that we have an amazing opportunity to use technology in a way to make our justice system work better for all people. Used in the right way, technology and digital innovation can make information, ideas and services more accessible. It can open doors that are usually closed or are only open to an elite few. It’s about ensuring, wherever possible, that justice services are accessible and user-friendly for the public and members of the legal community. That is why a key part of the solution is modernizing old-school justice processes and the way we deliver our services.", "Having grown up in the Internet generation, I’m inspired and excited about the opportunities that are available to us now. One can already do day-to-day banking on our smartphones. You can buy groceries online without ever setting foot in a store. You can even get a master’s degree online today. It is time we provided the same convenience for justice services.", "I’m here today to tell you that we are on our way. This means examining processes and procedures that are largely paper-based and currently delivered in person, and taking a hard look at court and tribunal operations that, frankly, were designed in another era for another era.", "A big focus of my mandate as the Attorney General is on using digital innovation to provide more accessible, responsive and easy-to-use justice services for Ontarians. Although it will take time, my ministry has started laying the groundwork for the next generation of justice services.", "I would argue that to be successful at increasing access to justice through digital innovation and technology, it is essential for government to engage with organizations, innovators and the private sector. That is why my ministry is supporting Ryerson University’s Access to Justice Challenge, led by the Legal Innovation Zone, a co-working space and incubator for people whose ideas will help change the status quo of Canada’s legal system.", "The Legal Innovation Zone helps support, foster, and develop solutions and technologies that aim to improve the justice system and legal services. In July, six start-ups were chosen to work in the Ryerson incubator for four months. During this time, they will have access to mentors, advisers and other resources that can help them grow their companies.", "In early December, three of these start-ups will be chosen to receive seed funding to get their projects off the ground. This is exactly the kind of thing we should be trying to foster in the justice system: new ways of thinking and new ways of working together, tapping new sources of energy and expertise.", "My ministry has taken some first steps to introduce digital innovation in the core system. Last year, in partnership with the courts, we made it possible for people to submit all small claims online. Since then, almost 50% of all claims are now being filed online. In many cases, people filing claims are even able to obtain a judgment online, meaning that they never have to set foot in a courthouse.", "Earlier this spring, we rolled out an online service for setting up and updating straightforward child support payments; 100 applications have been received through the new service to date. This means that instead of filling out lengthy court forms and spending hours in court lines and hearings, parents can focus on what matters most: their children.", "Moving these straightforward claims and cases out of court also frees up valuable court time that can be used to deal with more urgent and complex cases.", "We’re also working to increase remote video capacity in our bail courts and our correctional institutions. In 2014, we launched a new service in partnership with the judiciary to make daily court lists available online as well. Now, over one million visitors a year go to ontariocourtdates.ca to find out where and when they need to go to court instead of having to go into a courthouse.", "The Ministry of the Attorney General is also working with the Safety, Licensing Appeals and Standards Tribunals Ontario to modernize the Automobile Accident Benefits Service launched this past April. This independent dispute resolution system helps people who have been injured in a motor vehicle accident and have had their claim denied by an insurance company appeal that decision. Work is now under way to develop an e-filing tool for this service, reducing the amount of paperwork that needs to be filled out and speeding up response times to claims. This will help people move forward with their lives sooner.", "These are gradual steps, Speaker, but it’s just the beginning. Over the next two years more online services will be available, aimed at making it easier for even more people who use our justice system to complete transactions without having to visit a courthouse or handle a lot of paperwork. Work is already under way to expand online filing to civil claims in the Superior Court of Justice. Documents filed for civil claims make up about one third of all documents filed in our courts today. You can imagine, Speaker, that’s a lot of paper. Following the success of our e-filing tool for Small Claims Court, we expect that people filing civil claims will experience quicker turnaround times for court documents, a faster and more efficient way to file forms and pay fees, and fewer trips to the courthouse.", "On the family law side, based on the latest census information, four in 10 first marriages end in divorce in Canada. While that is extremely unfortunate, we don’t want to add to people’s stress at such a difficult time by making the process of getting a divorce cumbersome, time-consuming and hard to understand. That is why I have asked my ministry to look at whether we can make this process easier and less expensive by making the filing process for divorce available online as well.", "Nearly 30,000 divorce claims are filed with the court each year. Many of these cases are fairly straightforward and shouldn’t require a court hearing. Just to be clear, Speaker, we’re in the very early stages of this project, but it is something that we have identified as a priority within the ministry.", "We also want to modernize our jury processes. Each year, over 500,000 people across the province are engaged in processes related to jury duty. We recognize the valuable public duty that jurors perform and we appreciate their dedication and the time they spend away from their regular lives, so we want to ensure that the overall experience is fast, simple and as convenient as possible.", "Some of the things we are considering include completing the eligibility questionnaire online instead of by mail and making it easier for jurors and prospective jurors to find out when and where they have to attend court. To do this, we are now gathering information about what services and expertise are available in the marketplace. Our next step will be to assess what we have learned and to determine how to move forward.", "Speaker, while that is by no means the extent of the work we are doing, you can see how the use of new technology is at the forefront of our thinking. I’m truly excited about all of these future opportunities and I believe that each one of them will work to make our justice system and our justice services more accessible for all.", "I want to thank all the justice sector partners who engaged in many activities this week in Access to Justice Week. We look forward to working together to make sure that our justice system is accessible to all Ontarians." ],

As Canadians and Ontarians, we need to celebrate the successes of the women who came before us, and realize how important they were, given the challenges they had to overcome. It’s especially important to tell these stories because they can serve to inspire future generations of women to keep building on the achievements of these pioneers and to make their own mark in society.", "Just yesterday, we marked the 87th anniversary of the decision in the Persons Case, which paved the way for women to become fully involved in the civic life of our country. The Famous Five, as they are known, were women ahead of their time. They challenged the idea that women were not legal persons, and they won.", "Next year, we will mark 100 years since women of Ontario were granted the right to vote.", "In the wake of these historic changes, we have seen many women enter the world of politics and make a real difference. We’ve seen a political trailblazer like Ellen Fairclough from Hamilton, who became Canada’s first female federal cabinet minister. Later, Margaret Birch became the province of Ontario’s first female cabinet minister. We also witnessed the appointment of the Right Honourable Kim Campbell as Canada’s first female Prime Minister. All three just happened to be Conservative, by the way, Mr. Speaker.", "As it stands, we can of course celebrate that 35% of the seats in this Ontario Legislature are currently represented by women, but we must continue to do our part to see that that number does improve.", "This also applies to other sectors of our society. For example, we have seen women entrepreneurs and executives make their mark in the business world, although there is still a long way to go. Today, only about 9% of corporate CEOs are women, but when you consider that just 10 years ago it was half that number, at 4.5%, we can see that women are breaking through barriers in the business world.", "In closing, as we mark Persons Day and celebrate Women’s History Month, we congratulate and thank the women who opened the doors for those who were to follow, and celebrate them as role models for women and girls across this province and this country.", "We recognize that “Because of Her,” our province, and our country, is the extraordinary place it is today." ],

I want to borrow from one of the leading legal minds of our country, Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin, who says, “There is no justice without access to justice.” Those are powerful words and absolutely accurate.", "Access to justice has many forms. One of the important areas that we need to talk about when we talk about access to justice is income barriers. One of the key barriers is that income thresholds are set far too low, so people who are earning just enough to barely get by cannot afford legal representation.", "Geography is a major access issue in certain communities, being able to access legal advice. That’s why it’s so important to commit to community-based clinics to ensure that people have access.", "Language is a serious barrier to ensuring that people from various walks of life who speak different languages have access in the language of their choice.", "There are also certain perceptions and a lack of education or awareness around one’s rights when it comes to accessing justice. There needs to be a campaign around that.", "Another really troubling area where we see some serious problems with access to justice are the serious delays in the court system. Again, another very powerful line is, “Justice delayed is justice denied.” We need to do far more to ensure that people have that access to justice.", "I think this is a tremendous step forward, to have a week where we can address these issues, but I think the reality must be named and must be pointed out: Access to justice in our society is not where it needs to be. Justice McLachlin, again, was asked the question, “Do we have adequate access to justice?” She responded, “It seems to me that the answer is no,” that we don’t right now. That’s a terrible thing. If we want to build a society that is based on the rule of law, that is based on justice, we need to ensure we have better access to that." ],

It doesn’t seem to get any better, quite honestly, when you realize the role that the LEAF National had to play in the Alberta case where the judge, Judge Camp, asked a young 19-year-old aboriginal women who was homeless at the time and who had been sexually assaulted why she did not keep her knees closed. This happens. These are words and language used in our courts. Obviously, there’s a huge challenge, as it should be.

  "text" : [ "I’m glad that the members from the opposition have something to sing about, but here we are debating the Protecting Students Act, so that’s where I’m going to begin.", "This act, Bill 37, amends the Ontario College of Teachers Act, as we’ve heard. It’s based on 49 recommendations from the LeSage report. It essentially makes the disciplinary process for provincial teachers more clear and transparent. I was glad to have had the opportunity yesterday to speak at length, and I would like to reiterate that we support this necessary piece of legislation.", "We recognize that very few teachers will ever be affected by this legislation, which deals with exceptions. All teachers are in positions of influence, authority and trust. Almost all teachers value and protect our children and teach professionally with integrity and with the best interests of our students at heart. Those who violate that trust, however, and are found guilty should be disciplined firmly and appropriately.", "New Democrats support tough legislation that protects kids and ensures fair due process. We absolutely must have proper oversight and measures in place to ensure that crimes are punished and our children are protected.", "As I said yesterday, there is nothing more important than the safety and psychological well-being of our children. We’ve heard our critic for the NDP from Windsor West speak at length about what a safe and supportive learning environment should look like in our education system. Across the province, we hear about unsafe learning environments or stressed learning environments. The Auditor General points at the $15-billion backlog when it comes to repairs in our schools.", "We talk about learning environments. We’ve heard about temperature extremes affecting learning, affecting the well-being of our children—those who have to sit in cold classrooms in their coats, or in sweltering heat. While I don’t expect the Liberal government to control the weather, we do need to be having conversations about safe and appropriate learning environments and what those look like.", "Also, when it comes to safety equipment, when it comes to appropriate learning materials, I had the opportunity yesterday to mention that where there are funding gaps, oftentimes our teachers reach into their own pockets and do their best to offset those. I have never met a teacher who will let their children go without, whether that is art supplies that need to be replenished, whether that is new shoes when they outgrow their own, whether that is granola bars for snacks, whether that is pencils or backpacks, whether that is children who can’t go on field trips for financial reasons. For all of this, we do our best. I have met so many teachers who do their best to ensure that that child has the best education they can have. That is not just protecting students—obviously, those aren’t safety things—but that is protecting their best interests and doing their best to safeguard their potential.", "One of the things with this bill, which is called the Protecting Students Act, is not what’s in it, which we support, as we’ve talked about—and I spoke at length yesterday—but what isn’t in it. There are conversations to be had. I’d like to use my time today to focus on an issue that has come to my attention, with specifics being local—I’m sure that teachers and educators across the province, once they know this is a conversation that is being had, are going to be forthcoming with their specifics in ridings across the province—and that is the issue of violence in our schools. Bill 37 chooses to omit that in this.", "As the critic for community safety and correctional services, I have the opportunity to talk about personal protective equipment—Kevlar vests, things like that—with some of our stakeholders and our first responders. I never thought I would stand in this Legislature and have this conversation about grade 2 teachers and personal protective equipment, but that’s what I want to talk about. I want to talk about escalating violence. I want to talk about a lack of funding for special education—that we’re seeing fewer resources, we’re seeing fewer supports, and now we’re seeing fewer options.", "We’re here to talk about protecting students. We have things like evacuations happening in our schools when there are violent incidents. I’m not talking about things we see on the news; I’m talking about children who aren’t getting the supports that they need. Some of our special-needs children are no longer getting the supports that they need and are in a state of agitation. The behaviours can become violent. We now have policies in place like “hold and secure,” where classrooms are locked tight, locked down, where students can’t leave to go to the washroom. Last week, we had one of our schools in hold and secure for four hours over lunchtime. No one could leave. No one could go home for lunch. No one could leave to use the washroom. That is standard now. That is something that children are getting used to: hold and secure, regular classroom evacuations. It’s less and less the exception and more and more what is becoming the norm. Violence should not be expected. Imagine the psychological impact of regular immersion in violence or unpredictable circumstances. How will that affect their learning? How does that affect their relationships? What will that look like when they leave the system and enter our society? When we’re underfunding and cutting special education, and we’re not ensuring that special education money is going where it should, we are creating dangerous, untenable situations.", "A little bit of background and getting specific: Behaviour safety plans are used when there’s a need, and they are legally binding documents. They’re more and more common for mainstream classroom teachers. Right now, in classrooms, teachers are being mandated, where there is predictable violence, to wear heavy, bulletproof, bite-proof Kevlar—Kevlar. How can a grade 2 teacher be expected to inspire, to teach, to engage in learning and to bend to tie shoes when wearing fully weighted Kevlar hoodies and Kevlar shin guards all day, every day? If it’s dangerous enough for Kevlar in our classrooms, how can we ensure that our kids are safe? I would say that we can’t.", "Children who are so unsupported by the system that they are consistently agitated and violent are not getting the supports or education that they deserve. How is that protecting students? Children whose learning is regularly interrupted by evacuations or violent behaviours are not getting a safe and secure education. They’re learning about violence. They’re learning about violence without consequence. The Minister of Education can assert that children have the opportunity to learn in safe and secure environments. She didn’t say “hold and secure.”", "We’ve heard from a teacher who was locked out of her classroom over lunch during a hold and secure. One of her primary students suffered terrible psychological distress because it triggered past trauma; she was terrified. That may be the exception, but we’re going to hear more and more about how this is affecting our classrooms. We need to be protecting our students. This is happening in my riding. We’re going to be hearing about it happening in your ridings. Kevlar hoodies—look it up. Kevlar hoodies are real. They’re not bulletproof vests; they are Kevlar hoodies.", "Stop cutting our special education funding. Stop putting students last. Normalized violence, violence towards teachers without consequence, evacuations, hold and secure, and Kevlar body armour should not be a part of our education system. Every student has the right to a safe and secure, positive nurturing and learning environment. Please strengthen our education system.", "I think I’m out of time." ],

This sounds so extreme. Stop and think about a grade 2 mainstream teacher wearing standard-issue Kevlar hoodies and shin guards. This is now becoming what is required with the behaviour/safety plans more and more, as there is not the appropriate funding for special education. In our small class placements, they’re being forced to make challenging decisions. Those children are not getting what they need. Then we’re finding out that Kevlar is becoming the norm. Those are important conversations to be had.", "“Protecting Students,” as my colleague says, opens the door to have that conversation.

I know how hard educators and school teams in my riding of Mississauga East–Cooksville and across this great province are working to ensure that each and every student under their care is being supported.", "Every day, these teachers work tirelessly inside and outside the classroom. They’re dedicated to our students’ success and are passionate advocates for their safety and security. It is because of their efforts that we have seen so much progress in our schools over the past 13 years.", "We’re also seeing more students graduating from high school than ever before. Back in 2004, only 68% of high school students were graduating within five years. Today 85.5% of students are graduating within five years and moving on to their initial post-secondary destinations, including apprenticeship training, college, community living, university or directly into the workforce. This means approximately 190,000 additional students have graduated than would have if the graduation rate remained at the 2004 level.", "Students are entering a fast-paced global economy that is far more challenging and interconnected, and that is why we need to support the development of a highly skilled workforce. This is a shared responsibility and we will work with our partners, including employers and educators, to help build a strong and dynamic workforce.", "Our progress is the result of a collective focus by the entire education sector to pursue ambitious goals for our students. This focus builds on the good work we have done and establishes four ambitious goals: achieving excellence, ensuring equity, promoting well-being and enhancing public confidence.", "We’ve been able to make significant progress in all of these goals because of the commitment, professionalism and dedication of Ontario’s teachers. Our teachers have also been instrumental as we implement new and exciting initiatives that will take our education system to the next phase of student success. They have worked tirelessly to prepare their classrooms to accommodate their young students throughout the day.", "It goes without saying that everyone in this Legislature knows what kind of incredible influence a teacher can have in the lives of children. In fact, Mr. Speaker, I’d like to give credit where it’s due: I really liked the way the member from Oshawa phrased it when she said that teachers are in a position of influence, authority and trust. I know this from personal experience, because when I was 12 years old, I went off to a boarding school. As you can imagine, if you’re in a boarding school and you’re 12 years old, your entire life is dependent on teachers. You don’t get to go home to your parents. There’s nobody that you can go home to and say, “I was bullied today” or “I’m finding homework difficult today.” Your world is your teachers.", "So I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, that this bill is particularly close to my heart, because I spent from the age of 12 until I graduated from high school in a boarding school, where from the time we woke up to the time we went to bed, it was teachers who took care of us, teachers who not only taught us the academic lessons, but they instilled the values that I carry today, as well as they taught us life lessons. For me, I understand not only what a great teacher can be like, but sometimes, very rarely, if there is a teacher who isn’t doing what they’re supposed to, it can be devastating for students. It is in that context that we’re bringing this bill forward.", "As we all know, a great teacher can make the words of a good book come to life. A great teacher can show you how an abstract math problem can have a real-world application. A great teacher can see the potential for success in every child. Along with quality, dedicated teachers, teachers also ensure our students are able to learn in a safe and accepting environment. Students who feel safe, welcome and connected to school are more likely to succeed academically. That is why we need the Protecting Students Act to become law. We were very pleased yesterday to see both opposition parties supporting this important piece of legislation.", "We have an ongoing commitment to students’ safety in Ontario. While we know that the vast majority of teachers are committed to the success and safety of their students, we need to ensure that in those rare circumstances where discipline is necessary, teachers, students, parents and administrators can count on a disciplinary system that is transparent, fair and effective.", "The Ontario College of Teachers is an independent regulatory body that is responsible for regulating the teaching profession in Ontario, including disciplinary proceedings. These proposed changes would help give the college the tools it needs to ensure there is a transparent process in place when disciplinary action is required. It would also give the college an increased ability to protect our students when there may be an immediate danger to a student.", "Most of the proposed changes in the bill reflect recommendations from a review of the college’s investigation and disciplinary procedure, conducted by the Honourable Justice Patrick LeSage. Justice LeSage’s report contained 49 recommendations to modernize the Ontario College of Teachers’ investigation and discipline practice. Since the release of the report, our government has been working closely with the college to address all 49 of the recommendations.", "I want to acknowledge the leadership at the college for not only asking Justice LeSage to conduct the review, but also for moving quickly to address his recommendations. However, while the government and the college have been working hard to address many of the recommendations, some of these recommendations require legislative changes, and that is why we have brought forward the Protecting Students Act. The proposed legislation and subsequent regulations in the Protecting Students Act would improve the college’s disciplinary process, reduce the potential for conflicts of interest and help increase the protection of our students.", "I know, Mr. Speaker, that quite extensive details of the legislation have been covered in the debate yesterday as well as a little bit today, but I want to take this opportunity to talk about a few key elements of the bill.", "First, the legislation would, if passed, ensure that a teacher’s certificate is automatically revoked if they have been found guilty of sexual abuse or acts relating to child pornography.", "Mr. Speaker, I’m really proud and pleased to say that this is an area where we are actually proposing stronger provisions than what Justice LeSage originally recommended. Here’s a great example of the government going the extra mile. While LeSage did not recommend mandatory revocation of a certificate, we don’t believe there is any reasonable circumstance where there is a confirmed case of sexual abuse or child pornography where a teacher should be able to keep their teaching certificate. I suspect that many in this Legislature would agree with that: that we are building on what Justice LeSage had suggested and going beyond what he had suggested.", "There’s also provision in the bill that would prevent an individual from reapplying to the college for a teaching certificate for five years if they have been found guilty of sexual abuse or child pornography. While someone could reapply after five years, there would have to be a public hearing of the discipline committee to determine whether or not their certificate should be reissued. In addition, a notation of every revocation of a certificate of registration is kept on the college’s public register forever.", "The five-year time period is an increase compared to the minimum of one year, as currently provided in the Ontario College of Teachers Act. The five-year time period is also consistent with other regulated professions in the health sector.", "Finally, all I would like to say, given that I’m coming up to my time, is that this proposed legislation, if passed, would strengthen the authority of the Ontario College of Teachers to take action while ensuring the process is open and transparent for everyone involved. This is one more example of our commitment to improve student safety and well-being so our children have every opportunity to succeed." ],

I’m happy and indeed very interested to speak to Bill 37, the Protecting Students Act.", "I want to give some of the premises of the bill, or the underlying philosophy of the bill. The underlying philosophy of the bill is protecting the safety of our children and students and maintaining the integrity of the teaching profession. That’s a top priority for our government. The bill is both about students and about maintaining the integrity of the teaching profession. The Protecting Students Act, 2016, is the next step in our government’s partnership with the Ontario College of Teachers to improve its teacher discipline practices and processes.", "Ontario’s teachers, and I want to be clear about this, do an excellent job supporting our students. It is in rare circumstances where discipline is required, and when it is required, the discipline must be fair, transparent and decisive. It’s a process that is necessary to maintain the public interest and, above all, protect our children. Protecting our children is in the public interest.", "If passed, the Protecting Students Act and the subsequent regulations which will follow would make the Ontario College of Teachers’ disciplinary processes more efficient. It will better help to protect students and teachers and it will reduce potential conflicts of interest. In short, everybody—teachers, students, parents, government and the college—will know what the rules are. We are taking an important step to make sure that Ontario’s families continue to have confidence that their children are safe and protected in school.", "Let me say something about the costs of the legislation. In this era of restraint, costs are always a topic to be considered. There would be no financial implications for the government in implementing Bill 37 as currently drafted. The Ontario College of Teachers and the College of Early Childhood Educators are independent bodies that are funded through their own membership fees. Costs to stakeholders, such as school boards, would be negligible and mainly related to the implementation of administrative requirements for reporting responsibilities.", "Having said that by way of background, what is actually being proposed in the legislation? The proposed legislation would amend the Ontario College of Teachers Act to do the following:", "(1) Require the automatic revocation of a member’s certificate by a discipline panel if a member is found guilty of sexual abuse or acts relating to child pornography.", "(2) The act would require the publication of all decisions of the discipline committee on the Ontario College of Teachers website. This is an important piece to the legislation because this goes to transparency and to openness. On an issue as sensitive as this, it’s important that the process and the end results of the process be open and transparent to parents, to other teachers, to school boards and, indeed, to the public generally.", "(3) The act would set very clear rules for the use of the dispute resolution process.", "(4) It would provide employers with clarification regarding the reporting of members whose duties have been restricted. That’s a very important point because if there is a disciplinary process that results in some action, then that result—that discipline, if you will—has to be available to users, be they school boards or early education centres or, indeed, parents.", "(5) The act would provide authority to the Ontario College of Teachers to disclose information about members to police and to other regulators. Again, this goes to the requirement for transparency, openness, full disclosure and the like.", "(6) The act would improve timelines for the investigation and consideration of complaints. That’s an important piece because if there is a situation out there that has given rise to a complaint, it is so terribly important that that complaint be dealt with quickly, efficiently and fairly. I want to emphasize that the complaint will be dealt with quickly and in a timely way, recognizing, of course, all the requirements: due process, fairness and so on. But the key here is that if there is a complaint out there, it should not be left to just hang there for months or sometimes a year or more, because there is the potential for great harm to students and great harm to the reputation of the college and to the teaching profession if these complaints aren’t disposed of in a timely way. They may be disposed of in a timely way that results in discipline, or they may be disposed of in a timely way such that the complaint perhaps ends up unfounded. But in either case, it’s important to resolve the matter quickly, for obvious reasons.", "Let me say something about how Bill 37 differs from Bill 103 or Bill 200. When introduced, the Protecting Students Act, 2016—that was Bill 200—only a few additional amendments were made from the original bill, which was introduced in 2013. That was Bill 103. What this—" ],

Of course, we saw the emails deleted and the changes over the last few years with removing some of the functions of the Auditor General and the chief financial officer. That doesn’t speak to a government that’s interested in being open and transparent.

In the rare cases where discipline is required, teachers, parents and students know that a fair, timely and transparent process will be in place.”", "I know that, if passed, this piece of legislation would make the Ontario College of Teachers’ disciplinary processes more efficient, help protect students and teachers and reduce the potential for conflicts of interest.

Teachers play a pivotal role in a child’s development. As a family with four teachers, I certainly hear the issues every day that they experience at work. I know the care and the extra time they put in. There’s no shortage of work and care that our teachers put in. The public, and parents in particular, place an incredible amount of trust in the teaching profession and students are incredibly impressionable, especially when they are very young.", "Teachers are regulated by the College of Teachers, a body tasked with ensuring the profession complies with the highest professional and ethical standards. Sexual abuse of children by educators is a circumstance our communities would never wish upon their worst enemies.", "Recent police operations show that there is no stereotypical user of child pornography. Any category of people or professionals is vulnerable to having some bad apples among them. With educators, the issues of child abuse and child pornography acquire an additional upsetting dimension that involves a breach of a deep bond of trust between the parent, the student and the educator.", "It is definitely time to update legislation governing educator licensing and discipline to reflect the particular stigma our society rightly places on abusers and those found using child pornography.", "The legislation has been before the House several times and it has repeatedly died due to dissolutions and prorogations. The LeSage report is now four years old and counting, released all the way back in 2012, so we are seeing the bill once again introduced. The first time, it sat there for two years and still the government had not conducted enough debate to get it through the House.", "The current framework for disciplinary procedures at the College of Teachers has needed to change since a 2011 Toronto Star report into what many defined as “lenient treatment” of teachers accused and found guilty of professional misconduct. Lack of transparency in how disciplinary hearings were conducted did nothing to shore up the public trust.", "The LeSage report recommended, first and foremost, clear and defined timelines for all parties to supply information and responses pertaining to an investigation. Ambiguity generates confusion and mutual suspicion between boards, professionals, labour representatives and the public.", "LeSage further recommended that the duties of the discipline and dispute resolution processes be defined much more clearly, such that any misconduct or offence that would result in admonishment or a caution should enter the dispute resolution stream and generally not be entered into the public register, while serious complaints, such as those involving abuse, should only be dealt with in a public disciplinary hearing.", "It sounds inconceivable in this day and age that educators found guilty of abuse or accessing child pornography may, depending on the committee’s decision, avoid the revocation of their certificate.", "The report also recommended a public website where information about disciplinary hearings could and should be posted with regular updates. The PC caucus and I will continue to insist on a similar system for the public to access information about educators and teachers who have had their certificate revoked for abuse or child pornography reasons.", "Reporting obligations and the framework to protect those who report potential instances of abuse have been recommended by the Baldwin inquiry, amongst others.", "We must, at all times, remember that our first and foremost obligation, as both legislators and members of the public, is to our children and preserving their well-being.", "Being found guilty of abuse or a child pornography offence should imply an automatic cancellation of your teaching privileges—no ifs, ands or buts. The PC caucus would explore strengthening the bill and the protection of the public trust in the teaching and education profession by calling upon immediate leave without pay for those professionals accused of, or being investigated for, acts of misconduct.", "Other regulated professionals already include protection for their members from frivolous and vexatious complaints, and it wouldn’t take such a significant effort to transpose those principles into the College of Teachers.", "I’m sure most people here are familiar with the TV show Breaking Bad and the involvement in the drug trade. Under this bill, such offences would fall through the cracks.", "We hold teachers and educators to a higher standard of professional conduct, higher than other members of the general public, exactly due to the amount of trust we place in them. Regulatory bodies charged with enforcing professional codes of conduct and professional discipline should therefore be tirelessly committed to the principle of transparency in their operations. There are no benefits to secrecy in a self-regulating profession when it affects our children.", "I see that the government has titled this bill the Protecting Students Act. I think there were some comments made before by a member of the third party that talked about some of the issues that we are seeing in schools. I really wonder about this bill, if it’s really going to hit the mark in protecting our students in all areas.", "There also needs to be, as the member from this side brought up, protection for the teachers as well. We want to make sure that this does not become a witch hunt. We want to make sure that the educators also get a fair hearing.", "I know that in my own riding, not too long ago, we were subjected to an inquiry that looked at the possibility of a conspiracy of sexual abuse. After $60 million being spent on an inquiry, and over many years they came to the result that although there had been sex abuse instances in our riding, as there are all over the province, it highlighted the fact that this is a common problem not only across our province but across the country. We need to put in special cautions and protections for children, some of which are covered in this bill because it is important. It also showed the concern of the public. You want to make sure that both sides are receiving a fair hearing, that it’s not just another witch hunt, and there’s access to affordable legal services.", "The member from Bramalea–Gore–Malton made some good points about this Liberal government and the mismanagement of this important file. We want to make sure they get this file right.", "Another issue related to the protection of students—in my own riding and the neighbouring ridings, in the Upper Canada District School Board we see a change in the system where we’re looking at busing students over long distances to large schools. I wonder: In the spirit of this bill, is that another area where we’re failing our children? We talk about the importance of being involved in extracurricular activities, whether it be sports or other events, and when you’re putting students on a bus for more than an hour, are we really protecting their educational rights and what we should expect to be provided in this province? It eliminates the opportunities they receive.", "In this one report in my riding, we’re losing six schools and replacing them with one. So we’re losing five. Think of the opportunities they’ll miss there—sports teams and all the things that go along with that. Again, we talk about the need to protect our students. This is another way that we’re not protecting our students.", "There have been a large number of meetings that have come up; I think it’s over 10 meetings in the communities surrounding this. It’s got the public upset, but a message from one of the directors—and we’re very proud of the system of schools and how well we score. A message came from the director calling the principal at our local school, stressing the importance of reaching a 90% passing rate on the EQAO testing. The principal responded back that he could see that being a huge problem, and they asked him why. He said, “Well, we’d have to get 3% of the students to actually fail, because we’re over that mark already.” I hear that the average is in the 80s in a test that I think the government has set up really to make it much easier to pass, but it shows the quality of rural schools. Sometimes there’s more to school than just the selection of courses. It’s all about the quality of the teachers and the quality of the environment they’re in, and we certainly want to see that continued.", "I know I’d better let the member from Sarnia speak because I know he wants to talk about this important issue.

Thank you to my colleague from Stormont–Dundas–South Glengarry for allowing me to share some time with him.", "With that, I’d like to speak to Bill 37, the Protecting Students Act. This, I believe, is the third time that the Minister of Education for the government has introduced this particular piece of legislation. Hopefully, we’ll prioritize the bill during this session of Parliament so we will actually see it become legislation.", "For most pieces of legislation, it’s easy to relate them back to situations in the riding. It is either to support or make the case for opposition to a particular government policy based on how that issue plays out at home—in my case, the riding of Sarnia–Lambton. Bill 37 is not one of those bills, fortunately. I can’t recall a local media story that deals with the item central to this bill, which is good. I’m not saying it hasn’t happened, but it certainly hasn’t been a recurring issue like rising hydro rates, for example. I’ve checked with my office staff in the constituency, and we haven’t dealt with any issues related to teacher discipline in recent history. I suppose that is part of the reason that legislation like this is needed. Transparency has been lacking in the past from the Ontario College of Teachers.", "My understanding is that this bill was drafted following a series of media reports in early 2011 indicating that at that time there were serious problems with the disciplinary system of the College of Teachers. In August 2011, the Honourable Patrick LeSage, who at the time was counsel at a Toronto law firm, Gowling, was retained by the Ontario College of Teachers to conduct such a review into their intake, investigation and discipline procedures and practices. Justice LeSage was also asked by the College of Teachers to examine and consider issues including communication and publication practices; impartiality and timeliness of adjudication; training and legal support; appropriateness of disciplinary outcomes; confidentiality; and the handling of concerns about its members. Mr. LeSage ended up issuing a 76-page report, with 49 recommendations drafted with the central theme of student safety.", "In talking with my caucus colleagues and listening to the debate so far, I am encouraged that this bill has been strengthened since it was last introduced by the previous Minister of Education. Bill 37, the Protecting Students Act, seeks to amend the Ontario College of Teachers Act and the Early Childhood Educators Act in order to continue, as it should, to implement the recommendations stemming from the LeSage report, which was released in 2012. This version of the Protecting Students Act, if passed into law by this government, will implement all 49 recommendations from the LeSage report.", "I believe, as has been pointed out, that the majority of the recommendations were made to the Ontario College of Teachers on how it conducts its affairs as a self-regulating body. However, Bill 37 still includes many recommendations that deal with legislative and regulatory matters that would be handled by the Ministry of Education.", "This is the third time that this government has brought forward this bill. When this bill was first introduced in 2013 as Bill 103, the official opposition did not feel it went far enough. At that time, my caucus offered support for the bill as a good first step, but we certainly felt that there were elements missing from the bill that needed to be entrenched in legislation. Now, however, I’m pleased to see that Bill 37 will ensure that a teacher’s certificate is automatically revoked if he or she has been found guilty of certain forms of sexual abuse or acts related to child pornography. This addresses perhaps the most alarming of the outstanding recommendations in the LeSage report, recommendation 32, which stated: “The penalty for sexual abuse or sexual misconduct by a teacher involving a student should almost invariably be revocation of the member’s teaching certificate.”", "Sexual abuse and exploitation of children are unacceptable crimes on one of the most vulnerable populations in our society. There should be zero tolerance for these types of acts. There’s no place for child exploitation in this province, or in any part of society, for that matter. We expect all individuals, regardless of their profession, who engage in this behaviour to be brought to justice.", "I will never understand how that wasn’t already the standing policy of the College of Teachers, but I am pleased that it will be the policy moving forward, and I applaud the government for that. The fact that it has taken the LeSage report and three cracks by this government at introducing this legislation to make that sort of change really is something that leaves many people shaking their heads. Really, why has it taken the government so long to move on this file?", "The recommendations from the LeSage report were made almost four years ago, in 2012. These key provisions include:", "—ensuring a teacher’s certificate is automatically revoked, as I said earlier, over those forms of sexual abuse or pornography;", "—requiring employers to inform the college when they have restricted a teacher’s duties or dismissed him or her for misconduct;", "—allowing the college to share this information with the school board if the subject of a complaint is subject to an interim restriction/suspension because he or she poses an immediate risk to a child or student;", "—requiring the college to publish all decisions from its disciplinary committee;", "—setting clear rules for the use of dispute resolution;", "—providing authority to the college to disclose information about its members to police and other regulators; and", "—improving timelines for the investigation and consideration of complaints.", "Some of these issues, you’d think, would have already been in place. Others here have reviewed this act a lot more than I have. I can’t understand how some of these things weren’t in place already.", "While the Ontario College of Teachers has taken steps to address the recommendations aimed at them, what’s clear is that the government has introduced this bill three times and it’s gone no further. There have been three education ministers since the first report, and three bills aimed at addressing the recommendations have been tabled, but little concrete action has actually occurred since 2012. Progress on this file is painfully slow. I am hopeful, however, now that a new Minister of Education has taken this issue on, that we will see these recommendations implemented and the legislation move forward.", "I sat in on the debate of Bill 37 yesterday—I guess it might have been the day before, now—when my colleague from Huron–Bruce spoke to the bill. She made a lot of very salient comments on both the bill and how this government has managed the education file. It says “managed,” but maybe it should be “mismanaged.”", "I want to reiterate some of that because I thought the member made a very good point. All too often, it seems that the government, regardless of the minister assigned to the portfolio, is having difficulty building a system to match Ontario’s needs. A perfect example is how the previous Minister of Education strung along for months the families and students who utilize the most important programs and services of Ontario’s demonstration schools. They had no idea if their schools would be open the following school year. They had no idea what they would do.", "They had to come down by busloads to try and get the Minister of Education’s attention. I had a number of families from my own riding participate in that. It’s disappointing, Mr. Speaker, that it takes this sort of advocacy to get action from this ministry. It only took one meeting with students and parents from my riding of Sarnia–Lambton who were enrolled at the Amethyst demonstration school to realize how really important this school is in our education system, and more importantly, to the education of their children. I had a long-time friend of mine—he was my campaign manager years ago—say, “The two most important words in education—and you’ll learn them; I learned them when I first started teaching—are ‘my kid.’” He said, “It doesn’t matter what the rest of the rules are or what the arguments are; the two most important words to that individual you’re sitting across from are ‘my kid.’”", "Anyway, I digress. It took months before the Minister of Education came to the same conclusion. But all that time that the ministry and the government were inactive or refused to prioritize the file led to all kinds of uncertainty and stress.", "In conclusion, again, I’m hopeful that we’ll finally see these recommendations made into law and prioritized by this government so that this legislation will move forward for a thorough discussion at committee, and then be brought back here for final reading. If we don’t get that from this government, who knows? We may still be debating this bill in another four years. Let’s hope not. Let’s move forward." ],

At the centre of this debate, obviously, should be a principled concept of justice, of fairness and of openness and transparency, because that is really at the root of the problem, quite honestly.", "When I had my opportunity to speak to this piece of legislation—which, just for my mom, who’s watching, is Bill 37, Protecting Students Act—I had the opportunity to talk about what happens in a community—not just a school community, but in the broader sense of a community—when false claims are made against those who work in the education system. One, it does destroy a reputation. It destroys that level of trust that exists in that school community. And even when justice is served, when the claims are proven in or out of a court or through the Ontario College of Teachers, the damage still is done. So there has to be a careful balance here with this piece of legislation.", "But let me tell you, right now in my community, we are dealing with a situation where the claims appear to be very true. That leaves a black mark on the profession. The colleagues who work in that education environment are harmed by it. The trust and the balance of integrity of the teaching profession are harmed by it. Most importantly, the children who we entrusted to exist in the system and meet their potential in that system are also harmed. It’s a huge responsibility that we all bear to get this right." ],

But I know the Minister of Education is working closely with the Minister of Health and Long-Term Care to share information and see where there may be overlapping or mutual developments." ],

I’ll start by saying that in my nine years of experience in the Legislature, I’ve come to recognize and conclude that the better the title, the more flowery the title of a Liberal bill, the less that it actually achieves. Bill 7 is a good example of a bill sounding lovely, sounding wonderful, but actually achieving little to nothing in practice.", "Let’s examine a little bit of Bill 7 and the promoting of affordable housing. First, we should start off by looking at some facts. Typically, we would expect a government to look at facts and evidence before they bring in legislation to remedy a problem. In 2003, when this Liberal government took power, the wait time for seniors to get affordable housing in this province was, on average, two and a half years. Thirteen years later, that two-and-a-half-year wait time has increased to four and a half years." ],

  "text" : [ "This is interesting. I just heard from the minister, “How many more seniors?” This is nearly double the wait time. I know that our population has grown in Ontario in the last 13 years, but it has not doubled. I think even the elementary students could figure out that math—even the ones who may not pass, who the EQAO has so readily identified.", "For families in 2003 waiting for affordable housing, the wait time was 2.3 years. It has now increased to 3.7 years.", "So for whichever category we want to measure affordable housing and wait times with, the Liberal government has a failing grade in the last 13 years. Wait times are up.", "Yes, more people are in need of affordable housing. Of course, with the great increase in electricity costs in this province, it is also further bringing acuity to this problem. People are not only unable to find affordable housing, but then to maintain affordable housing with these rising utility costs is putting further difficulties and exacerbating the problem.", "Speaker, we ought to be striving for affordable housing, but in order to reduce the amount of people who need affordable housing and reduce the cost of housing for people, we should take a fact-based approach. We should examine the evidence and then bring in legislation, not bring in legislation and then begin consultations and examinations.", "Let me give the House a few facts that they may ponder and discuss with relation to Bill 7.", "The GTA housing market from 2005 to 2015: The price of houses in the GTA in that period of time has increased by 71.1%. The consumer price index in the same period of time has increased by 18%. That’s since 2005. So is housing becoming more affordable or is it becoming less affordable? Well, the facts say that people are having a harder time finding affordable housing in the GTA.", "Here’s another important fact for the government to consider. In 2004, just after the Liberal government took power, it took 3.9 years of salary, on average, to buy the average home in Toronto. So the median annual salary and the median home price was a multiple of 3.9. What is it today in 2015? Well, it’s risen to 6.7 years of salary to buy the median home in Toronto.", "Has housing become more affordable or less affordable during the government’s mandate? Clearly, if it now takes near seven years of annual salary for a home as compared to less than four, the cost of housing is outstripping and outpacing the consumer price index and any other measure.", "What have we done? Why has this happened? Because we know, looking back historically, that housing affordability in Toronto actually improved from the years 1971 to 2001. The cost of homes in relation to income was actually improving up until 2001. You can look at all the StatsCan statistical evidence and see that we were on a trend line of improving affordable housing in this province up until 2001, and it has just gotten absolutely, terribly worse since 2004.", "Why has that happened? Why has that trend line altered from improving affordable housing to worsening under the Liberal mandate? Is it because of Liberal policies or is it just misfortune and bad luck? I don’t think it’s just misfortune and bad luck; I think government policies actually have an impact on society. I think government policies actually have an impact on our economy. Government policies actually impact our standard of living, and with respect to the housing market and the affordability of housing, their policies have had a negative influence and have been hurtful.", "Speaker, let’s look at the bundle of policies and the bundle of circumstances that might lead us to a conclusion about affordable housing. We know labour costs have gone up, but we also know labour costs have gone up in relation to the consumer price index. There hasn’t been a great deal of change there; they’re pretty well mirroring one another. So it’s not increased labour costs that have impacted affordable housing.", "We do know that technology and productivity gains have been substantial in actually reducing labour costs in the price of housing. All our new technologies as far as tools and equipment to build a house have improved productivity there. Even new building materials and supplies have lowered the cost of homes. But still, in Ontario, the price of homes and affordability of homes worsens.", "So it’s not labour, and even with productivity gains and technology gains, the affordability still goes up. What else is there that makes affordability of homes in a worse position today than it was when the Liberal government took power? Well, I can offer a couple of suggestions, and maybe instead of playing Sudoku or doing crossword puzzles on the government side, they may want to listen to this so that they could maybe include some amendments in the bill during—" ],

Before a plumber gets on site, before an architect designs anything, before an electrician gets there or a bricklayer, there’s a $45,000 cost, on average. That’s a significant amount of money. Does it impact affordability of homes? I think we would all agree that it does.", "Does Bill 7 do anything to alleviate or reduce that built-in regulatory cost? No, it doesn’t. It does nothing. But it does actually permit and incent and allow that regulatory cost to increase even more.", "So $46,000. Now, here’s another one: On average, in the GTA, to get approval to build a single residential unit takes 17 and a half months to get the approval. That’s a cost as well. That’s a cost of money. That’s a cost of time. It’s a cost of lost opportunities. There’s a multitude of costs—17 and a half months to get approval to spend the $45,000 before you get the shovel in the ground. That’s astonishing. Do those 17 months have an impact on affordable housing? I think they do, Speaker.", "Now, if you happen to be caught in the problem of needing to rezone the property before you apply for the permit and before you spend the $45,000 up front on costs, it’s only another five and a half months, on average, to rezone the property before you start the process of 17 and a half months to get the approval for the building permit. Does it impact affordability? I think it does. I think we can all recognize that that has a big impact.", "I think it may lead, and be a significant contributing factor, to why it now takes somebody to work nearly seven years to buy an average house, as compared to 2004, when it took less than four years of salary to buy a house. Am I wrong? I think there’s a correlation there. I think there’s a correlation." ],

I would suggest the basic laws of supply and demand, which Minister Coteau may not be aware of, are indeed important laws for us to recognize. We know this government has restricted the supply of land for building residential units in this province. They have done a restriction of the supply with acts such as the Greenbelt Act. They have also done it with the Places to Grow Act and the Smart Growth for Our Communities Act.", "I could go on with a number of different public policy initiatives by this Liberal government which all sound super-duper. The Greenbelt Act, just like the Promoting Affordable Housing Act, sounds good. Who can argue with good, especially the Liberal good? The Places to Grow Act: That sounds great. We should embrace that, right?", "But maybe we ought to examine the impact of these things at some point. That’s what I’m doing here today: examining the impact, and seeing how the rising cost of housing in Ontario has made housing less affordable, has brought acuity to the problems of seniors and families waiting for affordable homes—as I said, four and a half years now for seniors to wait for affordable homes. These have impacts. These are important. And Bill 7 does nothing. Bill 7 might as well be another Sudoku piece of paper or a crossword, because it does nothing for affordability.", "But there is another element of Bill 7, and that is this new imposition on municipalities, under the Residential Tenancies Act, where many rural municipalities are going to face a new burden, placed on them by the provincial government, that they will have to enforce and that they will have to collect on. It will have to look like it’s their initiative, but it’s really a provincial initiative. The municipalities are not in any position to take on further provincial costs with no additional resources, I know, in rural Ontario. There may be some municipalities in Liberal land which can, but not in the area that I represent—not at all.", "I want to go back to that restriction of supply, because there is that law of supply and demand. The greenbelt was 7,200 square kilometres of properties which were taken out of the marketplace. They were extinguished from being able to be built on. You may say that was important and necessary in the name of the environment. I’m not saying that it isn’t. I’m just saying we ought to know not only what the positive consequences are, but what the negative consequences are.", "In this Liberal government, like the titles of their bills, everything is only positive. There’s only positivity in the land. There is no such thing as a negative consequence with a piece of Liberal legislation. Well, I’ve just demonstrated, Speaker, that there are. Housing affordability has gone down in this province under your watch. They need to start doing some heavy lifting now. They need to start doing some heavy lifting and improve housing affordability in this province, not make it less affordable." ],

We’re not fooling ourselves; we are all hearing it. Mine is over five years at least for some type of affordable housing.", "So it’s double the wait times, 13 years later, now that the Liberal government has been in power. I’m sure this bill tidies up a few things, I’ll give you that. It does increase the cost for municipalities, probably more so rural municipalities than urban municipalities. They require them to do an enumeration of homeless people. I have to applaud the Kawartha Lakes-Haliburton group, who have been out through the summer taking this enumeration of homeless people.", "But you know what the number one thing is? And I’m sure you’re not going to be shocked on the government side to hear. The cost of hydro has tipped people into poverty and there is no way in the realm of their predicament that they can afford housing. They can’t afford to pay their hydro bills. I have spoken many times—not only are my food banks up; I now have Fuel for Warmth, which is basically a heat bank, because people have no choice in my area. The number of people in poverty has increased immensely. Affordable housing lists of course go with that." ],

  "text" : [ "Speaker, there are so many important pieces of legislation we are debating, and this includes affordable housing. There are basic needs and there are basic dreams people have. One of them is, at one point, to own a home. It’s a lifetime investment. People are finding it very difficult to fulfill those dreams.", "I know life is much more expensive than when my generation started—finished school and started looking at their future and getting married and having a family, that kind of thing. But what is happening is—and this is not the first time I’ve heard this example—I’ve known a few people where the kids go to post-secondary education. They come out of that with, of course, a debt. They hopefully can find a good-paying job, because jobs are scarce in their field, where they can pay for their loans that they took out for school. So once they get that paid off, then they have to save for the down payment for a home. What has been happening with people that I know closely is that their kids are moving back home. They’re staying with their parents for at least a year to save the down payment to buy a house. Living on their own, if they are renting an apartment or paying bills and buying groceries and all kinds of other expenses—insurance etc.—they can’t afford enough savings to put away to buy that house. It might take years. People want to start their life. They want their independence from an apartment. So that is problematic.", "Affordable housing is really important and the inclusionary zoning piece is essential. We can’t leave it up to the private market to fill that need. I’m looking forward to further debate on this very important issue of affordable housing." ],

Of course, everybody heard I referenced facts. She takes exception to facts. I know the member for Scarborough–Agincourt offered up opinions, and most Liberal members are very, very adept and effective at offering up opinions, but I recognize that there is a difference between opinion and fact.", "Facts are what ought to drive public policy. Facts are what ought to drive debate, and not just opinions. If you think opinions are as valuable as facts, well, then you’re in trouble.

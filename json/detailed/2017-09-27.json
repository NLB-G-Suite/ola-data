  "text" : [ "Like many in the Legislature, I come from a background of serving as a regional councillor, for the better part of 13 years. Eleven of that was as the chair of the planning and development committee.", "Bill 139, the Building Better Communities and Conserving Watersheds Act, 2017, if passed, will clearly fundamentally change Ontario’s planning and appeals process. This bill proposes changes to several pieces of legislation, including the Planning Act, the City of Toronto Act, the Ontario Planning and Development Act and the Conservation Authorities Act. Finally, it would also replace the Ontario Municipal Board with a newly titled Local Planning Appeal Tribunal.", "Speaker, I intend to speak to the proposed sections of this bill that deal with official plan policies and the Ontario Municipal Board reforms. The proposed changes included are significant, and we should not underestimate the task of transitioning from the Ontario Municipal Board regime to a Local Planning Appeal Tribunal.", "One of the central components of Bill 139 is that it seeks to introduce new official plan policies to the Planning Act. These new policies would align with separate new policies in the provincial growth plan and require all municipalities to include in their official plans climate change policies and “may include policies that identify the area surrounding and including an existing or planned higher-order transit station or stop as a protected major transit station area....”", "Now, provincial plans generally use purposefully broad language and directions in conjunction with other provincial planning policy statements. However, Speaker, there have been substantial changes made to provincial plans that you’re familiar with, through other recent coordinated provincial reviews.", "Given that the test for the success or failure of an appeal under the proposed Local Planning Appeal Tribunal will be judged based on how the case conforms to provincial plans and, by extension, municipal plans, much greater definition in the details and guidelines are necessary to distinguish what constitutes conformity to provincial plans. For example, there is a significant lack of detailed guidelines for the measurement and achievement of density targets around major transit station areas. How are climate change policies going to be implemented by regional, or single-tier, municipalities, juxtaposed to how these policies may impact the lower-tier municipalities?", "Because there is a lack of detail in the form of policy or guidelines, it will be challenging for the proposed tribunal to establish and refer to precedents during the resolution of particular issues that are under appeal. I would add, Speaker, that any transition policies, regulations or directives are not currently available to review, so it’s difficult for municipalities to ascertain the full impact of Bill 139’s proposed changes to the land use planning system.", "However, what is clear is that if Bill 139 is passed in its current form, significant changes to the planning and development system in Ontario will result. For example, there will likely be a lengthy transition period where some matters currently under resolution by the Ontario Municipal Board regime will continue to be so, while new matters will be considered under the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal regime. But there is also concern about how individual appeals will be treated, specifically under the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal.", "Because provincial plans are deliberately broad in language and oftentimes do not provide a sufficient level of detail, it will be further challenging to measure an appeal’s consistency to its requisite provincial plan. Municipalities—of which I have eight in Durham region—which will benefit from significant transit investments, such as Toronto or other municipalities in the Greater Golden Horseshoe, have to grapple with the measures in Bill 139 that relate to height and density of major transit station areas. This raises a challenging question on transit stops and major transit station areas in municipalities throughout Ontario. For example, will all transit stations meet the definition in the growth plan and the Planning Act of “higher-order transit”?", "Speaker, in answering that question, what methodology will be used? It’s not evident when you read the legislation. How will the methodology assess existing versus proposed future development of major transit station areas? Again, it’s not evident in the reading of the legislation, particularly with regard to height and density. I’m especially curious as to how municipalities will issue guidelines for the measurement and achievement of density targets in areas surrounding major transit stations. There simply aren’t any guidelines in the existing legislation.", "Now, in the region of Durham, the planning community and councils are concerned about some specific issues that they feel will affect them more greatly. For example, knowing that a council must base their decisions on conforming to a provincial plan, municipal plan or other related policy, how can a council make a decision without the fear or, conversely, the protection of an appeal to the Ontario Municipal Board or Local Planning Appeal Tribunal? If approvals and amendments made in the future are restricted from appeal once the new plans and policies are in force, how will the municipal consultation process for stakeholder engagement change as a result? The legislation is silent in that regard.", "If there’s a backlog of files under the Ontario Municipal Board, what happens if these files no longer conform with the latest iteration of a growth plan? Again, the legislation is silent in that regard. In addition, both the planning community in Durham region and I are concerned that the details of the transition from the Ontario Municipal Board to the proposed Local Planning Appeal Tribunal have yet to be released—they haven’t been released yet. This is a critical issue which requires further consultation, alongside the timeline for transition and how existing appeals currently before the Ontario Municipal Board would be handled.", "On a related point, the proposed measure in Bill 139 to create a Local Planning Appeal Support Centre lacks details regarding its implementation, in addition to the functions of the support centre such as its location, the timing for its establishment and the eligibility of support services. In order to ensure that there’s a meaningful participation in the appeal process, it’s absolutely crucial that this support centre receive adequate resourcing.", "In closing, Speaker, if approved as it’s currently printed, Bill 139 represents a significant change—a significant change—to the planning and development process that you and many others in this Legislature who have served with distinction on municipal councils are well familiar with, in the way the land use planning industry operates.", "The successful passage of this bill will fundamentally alter, for several years and beyond, how all of the stakeholders in the planning, development and conservation sectors interact with each other. As such, all those who will be directly or indirectly affected by Bill 139 would no doubt benefit from some additional time to consider this bill and all of the complexities contained within.", "We know from our experience here in this Legislature that when you have a very complex piece of legislation that takes into effect close to 18 different pieces of legislation, the best result is when you extend the consultation period related to this piece of legislation. I, as a member of the Ontario Progressive Conservative caucus, certainly look forward to a continuation of the robust consultation that’s necessary on Bill 139.", "Thank you for the opportunity, Speaker, to speak on this legislation today." ],

We’re happy that he is because he brings a lot of experience when it comes to municipal planning and some of the challenges that they face, especially in a growing community like Whitby.", "Whitby is a growing community. It’s one of those communities that’s probably only about five kilometres wide, but it’s quite long north-south, and there are a lot of intricacies there, going from the shores of Lake Ontario all the way up into farm country, into the Oak Ridges moraine. So it’s a very diverse riding, and he brings a lot of expertise when it comes to that.", "This bill does contain some significant changes, and a lot of people will say that a lot of these changes are long overdue when it comes to land use planning. I know every municipality is different. Not just the geography of the land or the makeup of the land, but the way the community feels about planning is different in every community. I know I can say the same thing in Prince Edward–Hastings. There are communities in my riding that are very, very pro development, and then there are those that aren’t so pro; they want to see things stay the way that they are.", "But planning, development, the conservation authorities and the reach of conservation authorities are all addressed in this bill, and I think, as the member from Essex just said, there has been a healthy debate and a very useful and educational debate on this subject so far, and I appreciate the fact that the member from Whitby–Oshawa brought his expertise to the table here today." ],

I think he touched on a lot of the difficulties that we’re going to see in this bill, a lot of ambiguities. Overall, I think it really is critical that the OMB be reformed; frankly, that it be taken apart and something be put in its place. I was pleased that he noted that in future, official plans are going to have to have policies regarding climate change. As we’ve seen in Windsor, there is no doubt that the impact on our cities—and rural areas—of a regime of much greater rainfall is going to have a huge impact on people’s lives.", "But, Speaker—and I’ll get a chance later to enlarge on this—there’s an awful lot in this bill that is just being left up to regulation. I think we, as legislators, are going to have substantial questions about exactly what is going to happen and what is not going to happen, because we aren’t actually going to have the details of what has come forward put before us.", "It’s unfortunate that this government took 14 years to act on this problem—14 years. Speaker, I’m not sure if it happens in your riding, but certainly in my riding many a time city planning decisions which are consistent with provincial policy statements have been completely overturned—ignored—by the OMB, so that we get decisions on development that don’t reflect the considered thought you need to build a community, make sure that it’s planned right and operates properly. So I don’t think there’s any question the OMB has to go. The question all of us have is going to be, is there enough detail in this bill to understand what we’re really going to get in exchange? That’s the question before us." ],

What’s clear within that context is that the provincial interest must be responsive to local circumstances—the member from Toronto–Danforth made this point—and there needs to be a shared understanding of how they are reflected in local planning documents, official plans and amendments. The province needs to give a clear indication as we move forward of their priority or if the local council can choose among competing priorities.", "I’d also like to recommend that the evaluation of the outcomes of the new tribunal process take place every two years to assess where improvements can be made. This is really a business-like approach to the planning exercise that’s been lacking and I think would bring a feature to the new tribunal that is not in place at the present time.", "I think, in summary, that the changes proposed in the bill, Speaker, bring out a more streamlined process with less administrative burden and clearly shorter timeframes. But, having said that, I’d like to emphasize that there’s still a need for additional consultation as we move forward to ensure that we get this right; after all, we’ve waited 14 years." ],

  "text" : [ "Speaker, I’m very proud to rise today to speak on this bill as the member from London–Fanshawe, living in London, on how important this is to the London Plan. I’m echoing some of what the members have said already about the need to establish the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal and implementing much-needed reforms to the OMB, something the Liberals have been promising, really, since 2003.", "London is one of the first cities in the province to come together with an urban plan, and it’s the only plan currently sitting under the developer-friendly OMB awaiting approval. So it’s sitting under the old, existing legislation. The London Plan was a collaboration between the city council, community organizations and thousands of Londoners. The plan is the result of over 100 different meetings in the community, and imagines what the future of London will be in 2035. You can see how far out this plan goes.", "The plan focuses on building the city upward and inward to protect vulnerable farmland, decrease our carbon footprint and make our city attractive for future investors. This approach to city planning will cut down on the cost of growth and urban sprawl. It is conducive to strong neighbourhood-building and is friendly to our vibrant seniors’ population. The plan, which was conceived over a two-year period, also aims to preserve our cultural heritage, protect the natural environment and make new use of the urban environment. So, you see, this plan is very comprehensive. It touches many areas of what a city should be like in 2035, those long-term goals.", "The fate of the plan, however, of the London Plan—which has been meticulously laid out by thousands of Londoners—may rest in the hands of only a few if it isn’t allowed to transition and to be reviewed under the new rules laid out in this bill. The people involved in authoring the London Plan fear that the essence of the plan will be gutted if it’s left to be reviewed by the OMB. If left under the OMB for review, the original ideas for the plan may never see the light of day.", "The government needs to start listening to municipalities and improving the hearing process. Promoting an atmosphere that’s focused on resolution and mediation, instead of fostering a climate of conflict like that of the OMB, is a key part of a healthier hearing process.", "There are 42 complaints currently under the OMB and Londoners want to see their plan, which they have worked on so hard, be transitioned to the new system for review. People have been asking for a new system, something other than the archaic OMB, to be put in place, again, for 14 long years. But the transition must be real, a tangible one, and have substance.", "The Local Planning Appeal Tribunal must live up to the terms defined in this bill, such as:", "—improving the hearing process at the tribunal so that the possibility of settlement, resolution and mediation are the norm instead of the exception. That’s the good thing. That would take the conflict out of this OMB process that we have now;", "—establishing a planning appeal support centre that provides affordable legal guidance at different stages of the appeals process: That’s also a good thing because it’s engaging the public, the person who doesn’t know how to get through the system and how to file that complaint and concern. This is a good step; it’s supporting them;", "—access to plain-language summaries of available options. We all know that we need to have plain language when it comes to terms around specialized areas. Not everybody is a legal beagle, Speaker;", "—reducing, or eliminating, the ability of the tribunal to overturn municipal decisions. That’s very important because we want to give the process meaning. If you go to this process and you’re expecting an outcome and all you know is that they’re just going to side with developers, then that doesn’t help decisions that are being made for the betterment of the community;", "—giving municipalities greater control over local planning; and", "—sheltering major planning decisions from appeal.", "The city of London has created an initiative, called ReThink London, which will lay out the work of the official plan. So you see how in-depth London has put their thought into this plan; they’ve actually had a ReThink London group. Over 10,000 Londoners have participated in ReThink London. Those people come from a diverse range of backgrounds and represent the diversity of the city. So why should the survival of their grassroots plan be subject to the whims of the ancient OMB, a regulatory body that even the government admits must be dismantled?", "ReThink London identifies eight key points that would make the London Plan a reality:", "—fostering a prosperous city;", "—connecting the region;", "—building a mixed-use, compact city;", "—providing transportation choices;", "—building a greener city;", "—supporting a culturally rich and diverse city;", "—building strong and attractive neighbourhoods; and", "—making wise planning decisions, careful management.", "This government owes it to the 10,000 Londoners who have built this plan together to give them a chance to see it through.", "A central part of the London Plan is to capitalize on the city’s culture. Through the ReThink process, Londoners identified several ways to culturally enrich the city through the London Plan, such as:", "—creating more spaces for artists to create and showcase their work. I think that’s a great idea, Speaker, because we have so much talent in Ontario that we forget to showcase and brag about the work that we have in arts and culture;", "—creating affordable, mixed-use spaces for both artists and residents. I think it’s a wonderful thing to bring art into our neighbourhoods and for people to experience that;", "—investing in a downtown arts centre;", "—better promoting London’s music scene; and", "—designing more public spaces for better community interaction.", "It was really important to Londoners, when they did the ReThink London for the London Plan, to make sure that we incorporate arts and culture into our everyday lives and enrich our knowledge and our history with the art and culture that’s been happening throughout civilization.", "The London Plan goes beyond the important arts and cultural aspects of London and focuses on building a greener city. London is situated in an urban forest with a diverse ecosystem and is surrounded by rich, fertile farmlands. Amendments proposed by Bill 139 to the Conservation Authorities Act are potentially beneficial to London if implemented properly.", "Speaker, This bill is really important to London and it’s a long time coming. If this government looks at its history—and they had proposed different bills before that were really not meaningful and did not reform the OMB. They proposed Bill 26 in 2004, they proposed Bill 51 in 2007, they proposed Bill 73 in 2015, and none of these bills gave municipal councils significant control or sway in decisions, as they had promised, and the OMB continued to reserve little or no regard for municipalities. They were ineffective.", "I think this is the right bill to move this forward. But, again, we have to have debate on it. When it goes to committee, we need to ask the questions; we need to hear from people coming forward, from stakeholders.", "Bill 139 presents several opportunities to modernize Ontario’s aging infrastructure, protect our watersheds and ecosystems, and ensure our children and grandchildren are protected against climate change. It also presents the opportunity to abolish and redefine the OMB, instead of just renaming it and allowing it to continue in the same capacity.", "Speaker, there are several questions posed by Bill 139. OMB reforms come into effect upon proclamation and not royal assent. Will the proclamation be before the next election? People are waiting for change when it comes to municipalities, and London is one of the first cities to actually have an official plan. Their forward-thinking deserves that this government pay attention and help them transition from the old, archaic OMB system, which we know is developer-leaning, to this new system, to Bill 139, where there’s going to be a process where a community can feel engaged and supported, where it’s not going to be arbitrary and conflicting, where people can present and understand that there’s going to be mediation at the table. Because when you come together at a table and you hear the other side, things actually get resolved. It’s when there are lawyers and all kinds of legal beagles getting in the mix that the conflict continues and it perpetuates, and nobody really knows what the other person wants.", "I think it’s a good step. There’s still work to be done on it. I’d like to see it go to committee and I want to make sure that municipalities’ voices are respected.", "I’d especially like the minister to consider the fact that London is asking something that’s really reasonable: Take it out of the old OMB appeal process, their London plan, and put it in this bill where they’re going to have a chance to have further community consultation at the planning process, so that citizens who live in London—this is going to affect their lives gravely—are going to have a voice at the table, not just an archaic, developer-leaning OMB, where everybody knows what the outcome would be; it’s developer-friendly, and that’s where they go to.", "I’m happy that we’re talking about this bill. We’re happy to support the bill. I look forward to having more debate on it this morning." ],

  "text" : [ "After 14 years, it is good that we’re finally getting around to seeing this come to the floor of the Legislature, but I wanted to talk a little bit about the entry provisions for the conservation authority officers. We’re repealing a clause, where “the entry is for the purpose of enforcing a regulation” etc. and “the authority or officer has reasonable grounds to believe that a contravention of the regulation is causing or is likely to cause significant environmental damage and that the entry is required to prevent or reduce the damage.”", "Now, the new clause doesn’t require that the officer have grounds to believe there’s a contravention or that such a contravention is causing environmental damage. That is concerning. It raises questions. The bill proposes to say that they may enter “land situated in the authority’s area of jurisdiction for the purposes of determining compliance” and regulations “or with the conditions of a permit.”", "We will look to some amendments, perhaps. There may be wording we can propose that will address this.", "Again, it’s been 14 years, as the member from Whitby–Oshawa so aptly presented in his 10 minutes and his two-minute summary. This is a long time coming. Some may even say it’s too little, too late. We’re saying part of it may be too much. We’ll be looking forward to that opportunity to look at the amendments." ],

The member from London–Fanshawe talked about the positives of this being a really substantive answer to what the public demands have been with regard to reform and to rein in the OMB decision-making.", "The bill is a step in the right direction. It’s never too little, too late to actually improve the lives and the opportunities that are there for municipalities and within our cities across this province.", "What the member touched on in a lot of her comments this morning is that it actually establishes a true process of meaningful engagement so that your local decision-makers, which are your community members and the municipality, have an opportunity to have a discussion and hold to that decision, and to move forward and not have a third party come in and overrule those positive engagements, that local decision-making, so that everybody seems to be happy moving forward. I think a lot of her comments were based on that.", "I want to give her a little bit more credit. Her city, down in London—being thoughtful, thinking forward, preparing for the inevitable and doing the steps that they require shows an eagerness to address some of those issues that have always come up when a decision is put in front of the OMB board.", "I loved her comment when she said “the legal beagles,” when they come out, and she’s absolutely right. When you have individuals who speak from their experience, as far as what’s happening in my community, versus municipal leaders who absorb those comments from the leadership perspective, they know how to relate to each other. When we do bring in others, or third parties, it does at times confuse the issues. It’s nice to see a clear process that is going to be done. It is a step forward." ],

I had to really cut down on some of the things I was going to say.", "One of the things I wanted to address was the Conservation Authorities Act. It was originally implemented in 1946 in response to extensive flooding and erosion, and its purpose has never been more important and pertinent than it is today. We have flooding in Windsor; across Ontario; in Peterborough, I remember, a few years ago; and also in Quebec this summer. The conservation authority piece in this act is extremely important and maybe should have been separated and debated separately from the planning piece.", "Having said that, the Conservatives have really focused on the conservation piece, which is good, but we have to remember that when the Conservatives took power in the 1990s, they gutted the conservation authority, the ministry. They went from $52 million down to $8 million. With this new piece under the conservation authority, and their new powers and the new structure, the restructuring of it, I hope there’s going to be some funding available so that they can actually do the job that they are given under this bill.", "I want to wrap up by saying that the government is proposing to completely redefine one of Ontario’s most complex and powerful regulatory bodies, but much of this bill is left up to regulation and ministerial direction. Whether or not Bill 139 delivers the accessibility, accountability and oversight it promises remains to be seen.", "I think that’s when we want to make sure, when it goes to second reading, that we do the real nitty-gritty work at committee and make sure that this bill is going to deliver on the promises it has made. Municipalities, constituents, people who live in cities and people who live up in the north are depending on these things, so that when they have their plans set out, they’re going to have a fair chance and a voice at the table when making local decisions in the place that they live." ],

  "text" : [ "Before I start by speaking to the specifics within Bill 142, I just wanted to take this opportunity to say a few brief words that, I guess, are long overdue.", "I’m very proud of the opportunity to stand and join everyone in this House. I decided to run for this office because I wanted to have an opportunity to do something meaningful to help my community—like everyone in this room. I’m sure you all had the same feeling when you decided to take that shot at running in an election. Obviously, everybody here knows how difficult it is on your personal life, your family life and your professional life to try to do something like this. You all, I’m sure, like I, have these great aspirations of what you hope to achieve on behalf of the constituents within your riding.", "Growing up in Sault Ste. Marie as a young person—born and raised there—I always felt that we in northern Ontario, and specifically in the Soo, had a lot of challenges, challenges imposed primarily by our geography, certainly, which is interesting, because when Sault Ste. Marie was first created, it was our geography that was our strongest point. Now, many years later, it certainly has us so far removed from Toronto central and the GTA in general that it makes it very difficult for people in the north to have the same advantages as those in the southern jurisdictions.", "But the motives that I had and the motives we all have are always very simple: We want to do the best for our community. While I stand before this House, whether it is in opposition to the government on any specific matter of the day or in agreement, I trust that we all appreciate that, ultimately, we’re all here trying to represent the people of our riding and the people of Ontario.", "I want to take a brief opportunity as well to thank those who made this opportunity for me possible. I was blessed and am blessed to have a very strong family network. I have a wife, Heather, who, oddly enough, encouraged me to jump into this role, knowing full well what that would mean for our family life. I have three young children at home who are about to be three, four, and five—currently two, four, and five, all boys—so we are on our way to creating our own hockey team. It is a challenge, but one that I would not have been in a position to take if I did not have the support of my wife and all of our extended family and my children as well, even given their age. They’re excited all the time. We run to events in Sault Ste. Marie, and they’re quite happy to participate and do things within the community—in fact, quite excited. I’m sure, for all of you out there who have had young children while you’ve been through this process, it’s nice to be able to participate in events in your community and abroad. When you can include your family in them, it gives you the opportunity to sort of have a two-tiered approach, where you can do your job and also exercise your role in a meaningful way as a parent.", "I’m also very blessed: Not only within my own home, but my extended family played a huge and critical part in me coming into this role. My mother was actively at doors. In fact, I had to shoo her away sometimes. It was quite comical: She’d come in to the office some days sick during our campaign, and I’d say, “Mom, you’ve got to go home. What are you doing here? Just get out of here.” It got to the point that I would ask the people on the campaign not to give her material to go to the doors, because she just wouldn’t stop. She was so passionate and excited to participate.", "Both my parents are immigrants from southern Italy. It was incredible for them, I know, and for me, and for our entire family, to be able to participate even in the campaign itself, let alone what has flowed from that. It is a very exciting endeavour. Certainly, for a guy like myself and a family like mine, that came from the sort of background that you sometimes hear about—you know, “I came to this country with nothing but the shirt on my back and a suitcase”—who tried to make a life and tried to provide something for their children, as my parents did—I owe them so much gratitude for bringing me to this point. And really, my community, because if it wasn’t for them instilling the fire in me that I have, I would not be able to do what I hope is effective representation of my community.", "Of course, as we all know, it doesn’t stop there. I had the love and support of so many extended family members who came and knocked on doors with me and helped me throughout the campaign, making phone calls and all those sorts of things. I want to extend so much thanks and love to all of my family and friends who participated in my campaign, and certainly also to those who participated in the campaign executive, if you will, as we like to call it.", "My campaign manager, Ian MacKenzie, is a Scottish immigrant who was quite a ball of fire himself and did a great job of helping me out throughout the process. Our former CAO of the city, Joe Fratesi, was great and helpful towards me.", "We had within my campaign Bill Freiberger, who took on our financial role in the campaign, and he was incredible. To have someone as meticulous as he throughout the process to make sure that all the i’s were dotted and the t’s were crossed was so beneficial to me and helpful.", "John Coccimiglio, a personal friend, also helped us out in our executive. He was such an incredible person, doing everything from accepting my phone calls early in the morning, late at night, grabbing trucks and trailers and going out for signs. We all know, again, how much effort these people put in.", "It was funny—I digress for a moment—but at the conclusion of the campaign, I had no idea what would happen the night of the election and the days that followed. As I’m sure you all are aware—most people maybe are not, because I certainly wasn’t—you are inundated for about three or four days after the election with so many text messages, Facebook messages, phone calls and emails that it didn’t matter how quickly you typed on your phone, how quickly you responded to calls, you’d answer 30 and you’d see 60 more on the phone. And for three or four days you’re just completely consumed and overwhelmed and essentially almost living in a cloud thinking the whole experience is so surreal. In the meantime, while you’re doing that, all of these people are out collecting your signs and working their butts off for you.", "I think in my situation, I was so surprised and so caught in the moment that I didn’t immediately run to these people and thank them. I felt bad that I wasn’t out grabbing signs with them. And so to all of you who did that in Sault Ste. Marie for me, thank you so much. You have no idea what it means to me, the support that you provided to me, to my family, to our campaign and, of course, most importantly, to the people of Sault Ste. Marie. It’s incredible what you’ve done. Thank you.", "I listed some names and I know I’ve not listed them all; I’m still in the process of speaking to people individually, but thank you so much for everything you all did for me. It was incredible.", "Just a few other names: Helene Groulx was in our office every day trying to keep me sane. Thank you so much, Helene. Again, the names go on and on and on. I said I wouldn’t say specific names, because I knew I would miss others, and I’m sure you’ve all been in this role before, but there are just certain people I really wanted to recognize. By no means at all does that dismiss all of the other individuals who provided so much help and support. Don Mitchell, Jamie Caicco—the list goes on, so many people who helped us out.", "There is a point of interest that is a touchy subject. When I first got here, the one thing I did not appreciate—I’ve been a lawyer for the last 12 years and I’m used to a certain protocol. It’s funny—I’m still learning. Every time the Speaker in the House gets up, I stand, you’ll notice, a lot of the time, and then I quickly sit down, because I’m used to, when the judge stands, you stand, so I’m trying to get used to this new atmosphere.", "But in the courts, I’ve always felt—as a lawyer, as a professional—that you owe, as a person within that profession, a great deal of respect to that profession, one of the most historical professions, certainly, we have. I feel no less passionate about this. In fact, the bar is elevated significantly.", "My first day, as I walked into this chamber back on September 11, just a few weeks ago, I walked in and I looked around. I saw the beauty in the carvings and the history of this building, and I thought of the 1,800-plus members that have taken this role before me. I walked in with this incredible sense of passion and love and desire to serve my community, to serve the province of Ontario, and to show not only myself but everyone around me, I hoped, within my community the level of respect I believed the role we are in deserves.", "I recognize we are all partisan. We are driven by our partisan agenda. But I think we all inherently feel that we are driven by the people within our communities, and that is our principal objective every day and every minute we step into our working shoes. I recognize that across party lines there are going to be divisive issues, there are going to be moments where we clearly will not be seeing eye to eye, and there is going to be opposition, to put it mildly. I think there is a time for fierce opposition, there is a time for passive opposition, and there is a time for agreement and a joining of hands when something is positive for the province, positive for the people within our community.", "Over the last several days, I’ve struggled a great deal with what I’ve seen. I’ve struggled with how I feel we, as a group, are demonstrating our level of respect for the profession and for the roles that we’re in. I don’t question anybody individually. I include even myself within that discussion and that comment, regardless of anything that led to where we find ourselves today.", "Yesterday I spoke from the heart, while reading notes or not, about people within my community who have done incredible things to serve my community, people who have put Sault Ste. Marie on the map, people who the community of Sault Ste. Marie loves, who are named in our walk of fame, who our community is proud to call members of Sault Ste. Marie and who, when we go out to the communities at large within the province and the country and the world, we’re proud to tout as members of Sault Ste. Marie. And to hear the kind of heckling that was happening simply while saying those names really caught me off guard, and I thought we should be better than that. There is a time for the partisan lines to be drawn and there is a time for us all to embrace what each of our individual communities provides to our great province.", "Every day when I come into this House, I look at these young persons we have, our pages, sitting—often as confused as I am as to when to stand and sit—and I look up in our gallery and I see classrooms of children, and I think about my three boys, three, four and five. I think about how we talk about bullying and those types of discussions and how we don’t want our children to be subject to that kind of an atmosphere in schools, sports teams etc. We always want to tell them how to deal with these types of issues. While I sit in this room some days, I look at these young children and I look up at the other classrooms and I think, “How are we doing any better? Are we really demonstrating the type of environment we want them to see, grow up in, learn from? Are we setting the example for them that we ought to?”", "It really does strike a nerve with me. I really do struggle with it. I certainly don’t want to set that example for these children or for mine. So with the greatest respect to every single person in this room, I will pledge to you that while I will hold my role dear and I will always fight for the people of my community, I will never diminish or disrespect yours or the people within yours.", "Now, I’m going to transition at this point into Bill 142, and I will say, in the same line of thought that I just concluded, last week I stood before this House speaking to the northern boundaries act bill. I said that our very leader, Mr. Brown, has said there’s no monopoly on a good idea. I stood before you all and said that the northern boundaries act, the creation of two new ridings in the north creating enhanced representation in the north for indigenous people, is a good idea.", "I want to say here, with respect to Bill 142, I think it’s a good idea. I met with the construction association last week in my office here at Queen’s Park. Of course, looking at one of the principal stakeholders referred to in this bill, they feel it’s a good idea. If I had to criticize, I would say that it’s long overdue, but they are motivated by it and, in my review, I think that it’s a good thing. There are some areas of concern with respect to perhaps a little bit of lack of teeth, if I can put it that way—enforcement mechanisms—but I believe that looking at it, on the whole, in terms of its pith and substance, I agree with what’s being proposed and I think it does wonders to improve the system for construction workers at all levels, from the smaller operations, the guy who just makes cabinets, kitchen cabinets or something along those lines, or who does restoration of a bathroom, right up to your large-scale construction groups doing major government projects, building hospitals, schools etc. It remedies something that, back in my professional career, I used to see on a regular basis. Perhaps, as opposed to speaking on a very, very—and I will summarize very quickly—" ],

Marie but her work in the Canadian space program.", "It was, as I said, a delight to hear from the member this morning. We wish him well as he continues his role here.

I think at times it wasn’t his mom who needed to be restrained; it was Ross who actually needed to be restrained and take some time off, away from the campaign trail.", "It was an excellent maiden speech. Your first two and a half weeks here obviously have been very impactful. I think you’ve made a difference already in standing up for your community, as you pledged to do.", "I know, from being in Sault Ste. Marie, the community passion that exists in that community, being a former broadcaster with the Belleville Bulls and going into Sault Ste. Marie for Greyhounds games. They’re fiercely loyal to their Greyhounds, they’re fiercely loyal to their community, and I can tell that the newest member of the Legislature is fiercely loyal to the community that he grew up in, in Sault Ste.

About a month ago, on August 29, a pickup truck crossed the centre median of the 401 near Dutton, and smashed into a van on the other side. The two people in the van were a mother and her five-year-old daughter. They died of their injuries, and the driver of the pickup has been charged.", "Sadly, there was yet another tragedy before that one. On July 31, this summer, two people were killed and two more were seriously injured in a collision involving a tractor-trailer and six cars. Those cars were stopped because of another collision farther ahead.", "A median barrier would do a lot to prevent needless deaths and accidents like these. In 2009, the Ministry of Transportation received environmental clearance to expand this strip of highway, known as Carnage Alley, to six lanes and to install a median barrier. But when I last checked, the MTO claimed that it wasn’t worthwhile to make Carnage Alley safer, because of a lack of traffic on that stretch of the 401.", "The government’s position, Speaker, is appalling. There may be a little less traffic on Carnage Alley than before, but there’s no shortage of accidents and death. Has it occurred to the MTO that a lot of drivers might be avoiding Carnage Alley precisely because it’s so dangerous?", "I have a very simple message for the government: If you won’t expand the 401 to six lanes, then pave the grass and build the barrier.

I urge the Wynne government to contact their federal colleagues and request that these changes be put on hold until their full impact can be assessed with real consultation.", "Farm families want to work with all levels of government to ensure that together they continue to grow quality food, provide employment and, yes, pay their fair share of taxes.

Families flooded into Toronto, leaving behind their homes, their possessions and their families for a new and uncertain life. They often came without strong language skills but with a desire to come and contribute to their new home.", "In this time of turmoil, and as people across our country looked for a way to help our new friends, Len Senater and Cara Benjamin-Pace had a wonderful idea. Len’s Davenport restaurant, the Depanneur, opened its doors to a small group of women to come and use its kitchen to prepare a home-cooked meal to break up the tedium of hotels and prepackaged food. The event was an immediate success, and soon these women were preparing extra meals to cover the costs to the restaurant.", "Operating out of the Depanneur, Newcomer Kitchen is a not-for-profit social enterprise that invites newly arrived Syrian refugee women to cook a weekly meal in their kitchen. The meals are sold online for pickup or delivery, and the proceeds shared among the cooks. This model works, as it allows for the money to get into the hands of the refugees who need it and who aren’t ready for part-time or full-time work. It also helps newly arrived Syrians with a new set of skills to help them bridge the gap between the life and career they left behind as they try to rebuild their lives in Canada.", "Over the past year and a half, Newcomer Kitchen has been able to sell over 2,500 Syrian suppers to supporters across the city, and they proudly claim they are just getting started. This organization has been a force for good in our community, and I was proud to nominate them this summer for a BIG on Bloor award and bring the story of the good they do to this House." ],

You may remember this, Speaker: I have a private member’s bill that passed at second reading. I thought it would be a simple solution. Hiram Walker’s Canadian Club brand of whisky has been made in Windsor since 1888. It’s still made in the same place. The brand centre was Walker’s headquarters. It’s a magnificent building, modelled after Italian palaces. It’s up for an architectural award this week. Some 15,000 people a year have been touring this facility, but it’s expensive to maintain.", "Ownership of the Canadian Club brand changed a few years ago. The distillery is still there, and Hiram Walker’s products are still made there. But there is a glitch in the regulations, a technicality—a little piece of red tape, if you will.", "In Ontario, no matter if you are a micro-distiller or a world-famous distiller such as Walker’s, Corby’s or Wiser’s, you can sell your products on-site right where they’re made, but—and here’s the red tape—if a distiller makes a product under contract for someone else, that product can’t be sold, even if it’s next door in a heritage building, the Canadian Club Brand Centre, where we celebrate our Canadian distilling history and where we show 15,000 visitors a year our colourful history: the prohibition days, the rum runners, Al Capone and the boys. It’s all part of Windsor’s history.", "Hiram Walker was a visionary. He made good whisky, whisky aged in oak barrels that sold well in the United States and around the world. But now, since it’s bottled under contract, it can’t be sold at the brand centre where we celebrate our history of fine whisky.", "My PMB attempts to change that—to cut the red tape. It says that as long as it’s sold within 500 metres of where it’s distilled, it can be sold, since it’s still made by the same people in the same vats in the same precinct on the same block.", "The owner of the brand, Beam Suntory, ended the public tours in March, and no weddings are being booked for next year. Our mayor has been working with the owners of the brand to come up with other ways of paying for the upkeep of the building—maybe, for example, to move the tourist board in there, if it reopens. But if we cut the red tape and allow Canadian Club whisky to be sold at the brand centre, the owners will open its doors to the public again; they’ve told me that. Some 15,000 visitors a year, our second biggest attraction after Caesars—this is big stuff in my community. This is an example of how red tape can have a major impact on a community.", "I must say, it is disappointing to me that to date the government has been unable to find a solution. Sometimes we wrap ourselves so tightly in red tape, it overwhelms us; it cuts off the oxygen to the brain; it stifles clear thought and leaves us helpless to go to seek solutions, simple answers, common sense—and I think that is what has happened in this case.", "No one on the government side wants to take the scissors and cut the red tape, the red tape that is holding us back, that is harming our tourism industry, that is blocking our access to one of the most beautiful buildings in North America, a building with a colourful history where the father of John Fitzgerald Kennedy would come to buy his whisky, which he turned into a fortune during prohibition; where Al Capone was a frequent visitor; where Hiram Walker made his fortune and created a worldwide distribution system for the whisky made in Windsor. Okay, the label says Walkerville, and Walkerville was created by Hiram Walker. He paved the streets, built the sidewalks, put up the streetlights, hired the police officers and the firefighters, built schools and a hospital. That is our heritage; that is our history, and the doors have been shuttered because of government red tape. It makes no sense, absolutely no sense, to anyone living in my area—none at all.", "If there is another example of reducing red tape, it’s making forms easier to understand and having fewer forms.", "Let’s take a look at the Ontario Disaster Recovery Assistance program. It’s 12 pages long, that form—12 pages. Compare that, Speaker, to a form for basically the same purpose in other provinces. In Nova Scotia, for example, that form we’re talking about is one page—one page in Nova Scotia, 12 in Ontario.", "The independent insurance bureau has been trying to convince the government to change the form. Maybe, finally, we will see some positive results; maybe, just maybe, we will develop a form that is simple and to the point and supported by the insurance industry. If we change the form, we might as well update, revise and change the guidelines of what is covered during brutal rainstorms, including, yes, sewer backups. That is one of the biggest complaints from my area.", "Mother Nature is angry. Climate change hits us with storms so severe that our sewer systems, no matter if they’re separated sewers and not the old combined sewers—the sewers just can’t keep up anymore. Sewage backs up into our homes. The insurance industry is overwhelmed. Some homeowners are finding it difficult to find private insurance; make no mistake about that. They’re finding it difficult because of sewer backups. They look to us, here, in the Legislature, all 107 of us. They look to us for help with our disaster recovery assistance program. It’s Ontario’s program.", "Because the terms of the plan were written sometime in the last century before what we know today is the effect of climate change, before regular storms of this magnitude—what used to be once-in-100-year storms are now slamming us every year or two—we need to come to terms with this. We need Ottawa and the municipalities to partner with the province to have that conversation and to agree to new terms. We can’t allow our private homeowners to shoulder this cost alone. We are downloading the impacts of climate change onto the backs of ordinary citizens.", "We can do better. We must do better. Photo ops in neighbourhood streets with soggy furniture piled in heaps no longer cut it. These are peoples’ lives—heirlooms and family treasures.", "We need leadership. We need solutions. We need an acknowledgement that the old system isn’t working. We need to cut the red tape. That is what this bill is about: cutting red tape.", "We need to write legislation that provides relief for those whose homes are in flood-prone areas. This isn’t a replacement for private insurance. We still need—as the minister reminds us—private insurance. But we need to find ways to close the gap between what the private industry will cover and what role can be played by our federal, provincial and municipal orders of good government.", "Sometimes, Speaker, the private industry will provide insurance for sewer backup, but most of us just can’t afford it. The premiums are too high. I, for one, am convinced that this can be done. I, for one, don’t think Ontario will go bankrupt when we do so. I, for one, believe that our homeowners need others to step up to provide the leadership that is needed and change the guidelines to cut the red tape and fashion a system that is fair to all concerned—just as long as that red tape doesn’t deal with health and safety regulations. Leave those provisions alone.", "I think that flood insurance continues to remain either not available or unaffordable for Canadian property owners with high flood exposure. I’ll give you that quote. It’s from Balz Grollimund. He is the head of underwriting for Canada and the English Caribbean at Swiss Re. Swiss Re, as you may know, is the leading wholesale provider of insurance, reinsurance and other insurance-based forms of risk transfer. He says:", "“Flood insurance continues to remain either not available or unaffordable for Canadian property owners ... with high flood exposure.” He says that—and he was saying this a year ago—“9% of the homes in Canada are ... in a 100-year flood zone and can be considered at risk for severe flooding. For these homes, and especially the ones located within the 10- to 50-year flood zone, which affects 3% of all homes, flood insurance is either not available or the premium is preventively high.”", "That same article quotes Minister Mauro: “Policy makers ‘need to look more closely’ at government programs intended to help people recover from natural disasters, and these programs ‘may evolve’ in the coming years.”", "I certainly hope that Minister Mauro is right and these programs will evolve in the coming years. I’ve been advocating for that, and many of us from all across the province in this chamber have been advocating for that. I see the Insurance Bureau of Canada, just yesterday or the day before, is saying that “climate change is causing severe weather events ... to happen more frequently and with greater intensity,” especially storms involving floods. Speaker, when it comes to cutting red tape, that’s another area we could look at very closely.", "Thank you for your time." ],

My background, of course, was insurance. For this government to say that people can buy insurance for sewer backup is really misleading. There are areas in the province of Ontario that are specifically zoned, where you cannot buy sewer backup because the risk is too high. The insurance companies would then have catastrophic losses, and that would dig into their pockets, and that means their profits would be lower. So they won’t have that available for people who experience those catastrophic sewer backups.", "By the way, flooding is never covered; that is a catastrophic loss.

This is an important bill, which makes a number of small, but vital, changes to several pieces of legislation across government, including the Ministry of the Attorney General. I will spend my time today talking about the changes that relate to the Ministry of the Attorney General.", "The justice system is one of process and tradition which can sometimes result in delays. Bills like this one are critical for improving efficiencies. From my perspective, this is especially true for the justice system, as people now more than ever need efficient services because of the landmark Jordan decision.", "Speaker, I have spoken in this House about the impact of the Jordan decision and things that we need to do to move our system in a more effective and efficient manner. There’s a tremendous amount of work that is happening right here in Ontario in that regard, but also at the federal level in collaboration with provinces and territories so that we are able to make structural changes to our justice system, especially the criminal justice system.", "That’s why I’m proud of the work that the Ministry of Economic Development and Growth has done on this bill, which includes key efficiencies in the justice system, and has added to this very important piece of legislation.", "Our government is always looking for ways to advance and improve the justice system, no matter the size of the change, and making sure that locally, in communities, people have access to good facilities because we know that results in the better relaying of justice. For example, in my hometown of Ottawa, in my community of Ottawa Centre, I was very excited to announce just in March earlier this year about $350,000 in funding for the County of Carleton Law Association, the CCLA, as they are embarking on renovating the law library in the Ottawa Court House.", "The library is located in the courthouse. When I practised law in Ottawa, I of course used the library. It’s very often and frequently used by the local bar and by the lawyers. This renovation will go a long way in terms of making sure that lawyers have the kind of facilities they need to be able to represent their clients. The CCLA provides invaluable library and research services, as well as offering its members advocacy, legal education and guidance. These new facilities are going to play an important role in that, and I’m excited that the Ministry of the Attorney General was able to provide this grant to make this project move forward.", "As my colleague the member from Davenport mentioned when outlining the bill the other day, this bill includes a wide range of measures to reduce unnecessary red tape. We would, if this legislation is passed, be amending a number of pieces of legislation, such as the Courts of Justice Act, the Interjurisdictional Support Orders Act and the Provincial Offences Act.", "However, Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity today to highlight for you three other key pieces in this legislation that we are proposing to change.", "First, I would like to explain some of the important amendments we are proposing to make to the Charities Accounting Act. Social impact investments are relatively new, and I know members in this House have spoken about those and some of the unique things that are happening in their respective communities, including mine of Ottawa Centre. These types of investments are made with the intention of generating social or environmental benefits. However, the current rules were not designed to address these types of investments. The changes we are proposing in this bill would clearly authorize charities to make social impact investments, while at the same time establishing important safeguards surrounding this activity. We would like to amend this act to clarify that investments that directly further a charitable organization’s purpose are excluded from the prudent investment rules in the Trustee Act, which would help charitable organizations further their purposes and achieve a financial return.", "Our government consulted broadly with the charity sector before preparing these amendments, and we are pleased to propose these legislative changes to support innovation in this area. These proposals would give charities another tool to manage their assets more effectively, and would position Ontario as a leader in facilitating social investment activities.", "I’m sure many of the members of this House have met with charities who wanted to do social impact investments and have spoken about the red tape that has existed in terms of the rules which prevent them from doing so. In consultation with our charities, these changes are an important part of Bill 154, making sure that those charities are able to do that important work in terms of the social benefit and the social impact they generate.", "In addition, we are also proposing to make a number of changes to the Juries Act, to make it easier for the public to participate on juries. I can tell you, Speaker, that one of the things that I have learned a lot about since I became Attorney General is that you become quite of interest to your friends. A lot of my friends have been sending me photos of the notices they receive for jury duty with my signature. Either they ask me why I didn’t call them personally and tell them to go, which I can’t, or if I can get them out of jury duty, which I cannot do either. But it has allowed me to get in touch with a lot of old friends who have been getting letters from me with my signature.", "But it also highlighted to us that our jury duty system is a bit antiquated, and we need to modernize the system, which we are proposing to do with changes in Bill 154. Every year, over half a million Ontarians are sent a jury questionnaire, and for many people, this is the first interaction they’ve had with the justice system. Our government is dedicated to modernizing the process for potential jurors, because we want to make the experience simpler, faster and more convenient.", "Under the current process, Ontarians often experience losses in productivity and earnings because they have to take time off of work to attend a summons to be excused or deferred from jury duty. To help save people time and money, we are proposing to allow many of these interactions to take place electronically, as opposed to their going to the courthouse, waiting for their time and then presenting the reason why they cannot participate in the process, or defer. We are trying to see how we can do this more efficiently through electronic means, which means that people could one day receive a summons online or by text. It could also mean that potential jurors spend a lot less time travelling to and waiting at the courthouse, which, unfortunately, is the reality for many jurors.", "And we are taking another step to make participating in jury duty easier. We would like to give the public more time to adequately respond to jury questionnaires by extending the time to respond from five days to 30 days, so that they don’t feel the kind of pressure that is faced today—not to mention that we all live busy lives, and we want to make sure that everybody is accommodated.", "In fact, Speaker, this proposed extension was a recommendation made by Justice Iacobucci in his landmark report, First Nations Representation on Ontario Juries. As members may recall, this committee, struck in response to the report, consulted extensively with First Nations, individuals and organizations, which endorsed giving the public more time to adequately respond to the jury eligibility questionnaire.", "These changes, while they seem minor, will go a long way to helping Ontarians perform their civic obligations in a way that is the most convenient for them and, ultimately, will help make the public’s experience with our justice system a lot better overall.", "Speaker, I would also like to bring to your attention some important changes we are proposing that will impact individuals wanting to become a notary public in Ontario.", "Currently, individuals must be a Canadian citizen to qualify to be appointed a non-lawyer notary public. Many individuals who would otherwise qualify to be a notary public are unable to be appointed because of their citizenship. This not only impacts those individuals but the individuals and businesses that would benefit from their services. It only makes sense that we help reduce barriers for these individuals, which is why we are proposing to eliminate the requirement for non-lawyer notaries to be a Canadian citizen.", "To be clear, our proposed amendment will not change the rigorous qualifications that need to be met in order to become a notary public. An individual wishing to become a notary must still submit an application and pass an exam, to ensure that they are qualified. We are simply proposing to remove the citizenship requirement in an effort to help ensure that more people in Ontario, such as permanent residents, are eligible to apply to become notaries.", "Before closing, I would just like to quickly mention that I have only highlighted three key pieces of legislation that the Ministry of the Attorney General is proposing to change through Bill 154, but really, there are in fact many others. I won’t go into too much detail here about these additional amendments, but I would like to mention that, overall, they are important changes that will serve to ensure that our laws are up to date and reflect the best interests of Ontarians.", "This includes updating the wording in several pieces of legislation in English and French to improve accessibility, as well as amending 13 pieces of legislation to ensure that when laws are posted online on government websites, they meet the highest web accessibility standards, so that anyone can access and read them online. This would help ensure that Ontario laws are accessible, and that the government of Ontario is meeting its obligations under the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act.", "Speaker, when people think of government, it is unfortunate that they sometimes associate it with red tape. I hope that the people of Ontario who learn about these proposals in this legislation will see a government delivering on its commitment to Ontarians to make government work more effectively and more efficiently for them, and a government that is always striving to serve its people better, because these amendments, however small, will help to break down barriers and, as the name of this bill suggests, cut the unnecessary red tape.", "In closing, I encourage members to support this important piece of legislation. I look forward to hearing from the member for Mississauga–Brampton South in the remainder of the time." ],

I’ve run, I think, three elections on the need to reduce red tape. I’m glad to see something come in that manner. I hear from business people and farmers on an ongoing basis about being fed up with having to deal with government bureaucracy and compliance instead of being able to build their business and get on with running their business. Resources and attention are diverted from seeking new opportunities, innovating products and processes and finding efficiencies, to trying to figure out, for example, cap-and-trade, the government’s various energy schemes, tracking proposed labour changes or handholding inspectors through redundant or superfluous evaluations.", "The cost of this red tape, according to many economists, is estimated at $14 billion a year, so this is a real and significant issue. It’s not only an impediment to business, but the Progressive Conservatives support reducing burdensome red tape, eliminating redundancies and streamlining regulations. Businesses in this province have a lot going against them because of this government: high energy costs and a chaotic regulatory environment, to start with. We need to be taking real action to help them be competitive.", "The CFIB conservatively estimates that the cost of regulation in Ontario has grown from $12,800,000,000 to over $14 billion from 2005 to 2014. So it’s safe to say that this is not an area where this government has excelled. Unfortunately, once again, we have a pretty ho-hum effort from this government on burden reduction." ],

It’s a challenge across northern Ontario. It’s great that we’re going to be streamlining a lot of these and making them available, but it raises a lot of other questions. We’ve had this discussion and I’ve raised it numerous times—when we were looking at streamlining services through ServiceOntario, taking away some of the red tape that is there. Well, the reality is, it’s creating more barriers, and that’s what people in northern Ontario are facing.

But they had to jump through so many hoops. They were pulling at their hair. They were so frustrated with the red tape that they met.", "Another business, in Walkerton: Price Schonstrom. They make amazing products. A lot of their customer base is based on word of mouth, and, unfortunately, it’s all the red tape that restricted the easy flow of their product from Walkerton down to Port Huron that caused them to not have repeat business. To paint the picture in more real terms, Price Schonstrom developed a great product. It had to travel to its end-user in the States. It had to travel through three different states. It took 10 business days to get the proper paperwork for that product to move through three states. Guess how long it took for the MTO to generate the same paperwork? Six months—totally unacceptable.

  "text" : [ "Speaker, the debate on the unnecessary red tape—it’s a pleasure to speak to it for a short period of time today.", "I listened to the debate yesterday and I’ve been listening to the debate today, and clearly I think it needs to be stated and emphasized that members on the government benches have been attempting to conflate and confuse terminology and phrases. Let me put it clearly: Regulations are not the same as red tape. They can be, but they are not necessarily the same thing. Red tape, by its very definition, is—let me just state a few of the definitions of red tape: the bureaucratic practice of hair-splitting or foot-dragging; rules and regulations that are unnecessary and prevent things from being done quickly and easily; excessive routine or procedures marked by excessive complexity, resulting in undue delays and inaction. These are some of the definitions of red tape. So, by its definition, red tape is unnecessary. So I don’t know how you only focus on the unnecessary unnecessary regulations.", "So it is not regulations; it is unnecessary regulations. And we do have a few. We know in this province, by this government’s own admission, that we have about 400,000 regulations. I don’t think anybody believes that they are all necessary. I don’t believe anybody believes that some of them or a great member of them don’t cause undue delays or are used in a manner to foot-drag and to split hairs. How many are there that are red tape? Well, we know that independent analysis has shown that the regulatory burden in this province is somewhere around $14 billion per year. We know that this bill is, by the government’s own admission, going to reduce that regulatory burden by between $6 million and $9 million. I think I could say that you won’t even notice the hair-splitting of that $14 billion in burden with a $6-million-to-$9-million reduction.", "I just wanted to clearly emphasize that there are regulations that are not red tape. I think everybody would say that having a posted speed limit under the Highway Traffic Act is not red tape. It’s a regulation, but it’s not red tape. It serves a purpose and doesn’t unduly impede, impair or restrict people’s movements. There are a great many regulations that are worthwhile. But 380,000 or 400,000—I’m not sure if we need quite that many.", "I do also want to state—and I have heard this time and time again from the government members of the House: Whenever it’s talked about regulations, they raise the spectre of Walkerton. What they fail to mention when they raise the phrase “Walkerton” is that there were two government-paid employees who were charged and convicted of negligence. It wasn’t that there was an absence of regulations; it was two individuals convicted of negligence. Also, the evidence bore out that there was a significant level of—well, sobriety wasn’t their hallmark, those two brothers. There was a level of impairment while on the job and a fudging of numbers.", "I just want to state that for the record so that the members on the opposite side do know that there were—how shall we way?—extenuating circumstances that had nothing to do with regulations.", "I want to also make mention, Speaker, that there is nothing in this bill that the government is not already presently authorized to enable and to enact. They have the full statutory authority from this House to make any of the changes without tabling this legislation. They could have just made this happen without any discussion or debate. They have the statutory authority already, even though it’s amending about 100 different acts, or thereabouts.", "I want to illustrate my comments today. This book is the Consolidated Statutes of Ontario from 1892. Every law, every regulation, including the budget from 1892, is contained in this one book. It’s about 900 pages and it’s in a big font, easy to read. That’s all the laws that were present. For illustration and comparison, Speaker, this is the pocket edition of only the provincial offences of 2016 in Ontario. It’s very small print, and it’s 3,500 pages in length. So here is a good comparison and contrast on how the growth of government—and again, this is just the provincial offences. It’s not the consolidated statutes. It’s not the full body of law; it is just the pocket edition. I would like to see if any of the members in the House who have deep enough pockets could put the pocket edition in their pants. But it’s just for comparison.", "A couple of years ago, during the 40th Parliament, I tabled a number of motions in both the Standing Committee on Regulations and the Standing Committee on the Legislative Assembly. Some of those motions were adopted by the regulations committee, but they have not been brought forward to the House for debate or discussion. As a result, I did compile and provide all members of the Legislature with a booklet called Constituents First: Empowering Local Legislators, back in the 40th Parliament. Let me read briefly from a page about the Standing Committee on Regulations:", "“With almost 500,000 regulations in Ontario today, elected representatives are often inundated with concerns with a variety of different regulations and how they affect people’s prosperity and pursuit of happiness. Though Ontario had many fewer regulations in the 1960s than it does today, Chief Justice McRuer recommended”—through the inquiry into civil rights—“that debate be allowed ‘on the merits of any particular regulation.’” That’s important. The recommendation from the chief justice of this province said that the merits of a regulation ought to be debated. He went on to say, “Because subordinate legislation could affect someone’s life as much as legislation can, the commission thought it right that elected representatives be able to debate the merits of a regulation.” That recommendation was not enacted, and it hurts the ability of all members to discuss regulations that are injurious to their constituents.", "We have a Standing Committee on Regulations in this House. All regulations are permanently referred to the committee, but it is prevented from discussing or debating the merits of a regulation. If this government was sincere about reducing unnecessary regulations, sincere about reducing red tape, they have the ability to have 107 members of this House participate and bring forth regulations that they find injurious, and allow them to be debated. That motion, although adopted by the regulations committee, has never been acted upon.", "Speaker, I think I should share a number of examples of unnecessary regulations that are indicative of red tape that aren’t included in this bill and that could be discussed and debated at the committee, should the government really take red tape seriously.", "Health Care Connect: That’s the mechanism to help individuals who don’t have a family physician find a family physician. I’ve had a number of occasions this summer where—a doctor in my area was retiring. He informed all his patients that he’s retiring and that they ought to go looking for a new family physician.", "Health Care Connect prevents people from looking for a new doctor until their family physician has already retired. That is red tape. That is a regulation which is preventing people from doing things that are beneficial to themselves, but it’s not included in this bill.", "How about another regulation in the health care system? Again, for people who don’t have a family physician, this is important, because you can’t get a referral to a specialist unless your family physician gives you that referral. People without a family physician have significant difficulties, and significantly greater times, trying to access a specialist.", "Here’s another one. Six years ago, a long-term-care facility in the South East LHIN shut down. That long-term-care facility had 78 beds licensed by the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care. I just got a letter from the Minister of Health, because I have asked him on a number of occasions, when are these 78 beds going to be reallocated and permitted to be used in this province? The minister sent me a letter back, saying they are working closely with the LHIN to allocate those 78 bed licences. I don’t know how close they’ve been together, but in six years’ time, they have not been able to permit those beds to be utilized.", "When you hear that they have 20,000 beds in Ontario in long-term care, take it with a grain of salt, because not all of them are permitted to be utilized, in large part because of red tape. This bill does nothing for those 78 unallocated beds.", "I had the pleasure of dealing with a constituent, a fabulous fellow, who faced a very tragic situation. It’s hard to believe that somebody could be so upbeat. His name is Paul Pelletier, and he contacted my office this year because he had his leg amputated and he was having care. They have what is called a vacuum-pump bandage, which is a requirement to help drain the injury where the amputation was.", "But the LHIN and the CCAC had a requirement that you can only use a vacuum-pump bandage for no more than 28 days. That’s the regulation. His doctor said that he must keep this vacuum-pump bandage on. Serious infection would occur if he had to remove this vacuum pump.", "It took a lot of effort. The CCAC dug in their heels: only 28 days. We went to the media. We made a stink about it. Finally, we got Paul Pelletier able to continue with his vacuum pump and, thankfully, he never developed any further infection. But it’s another example of red tape, Speaker.", "I had another one just recently with a gentleman who owns an engineering and consulting firm in my area. His engineering and consulting firm provides drawings and consulting on roofs and roof construction.", "The WSIB has informed this gentleman that because the word “roof” appears in his business title, he must be a roofer, and he is subject to WSIB premiums for his consulting business. They’re charging him $15 per $100 of payroll, as if he was on the roof shingling, as if he was on the roof tarring, but he’s in his office doing plans. The WSIB says that if the word “roof” appears in your business name, you must be a roofer. It’s another example of costly, inefficient, ineffective red tape which serves no purpose, serves no benefit. The gentleman is not going to fall off the roof from drawing roofing plans in his office, I can assure you.", "There are so many others. Here’s another one: A good friend and an acquaintance, an elderly couple, want to adopt another adult. I won’t get into all of the family circumstances, but there is a blood connection, and the parents want to adopt this adult into their family. The adult, the daughter, wants to be adopted as well. Every province in this country permits that to happen, for adult child adoptions. In Ontario, you actually have to live in the same province for that to happen. The adult child would have to uproot and move from Alberta and to Ontario for this to happen.", "We spent much time with the various ministries trying to facilitate this family coming together after so many years, but so far, no luck, no success. Is that red tape? I think it may be. Is it in Bill 154? No.", "Let me also talk about Ed Embry. Ed Embry has a nice farm in the riding, nicely graded. It’s a nice-looking farm. The MOE came onto his farm and said, “You must remove this berm.” Ed said, “Well, that’s not a berm. That’s the way the topography of the farm has always been.” The MOE said “No, no, whether it has been like that or not, we think that that soil is a berm, and you have to remove it.”", "Anyway, Speaker, I could go on and on. I do encourage and hope that there’s further discussion and that we actually remove red tape in this province." ],

It prohibits the use of any of the information provided. It requires confidentiality around the information. It even designates a location, site or territory for the prospective franchise.", "Those concerns certainly have been raised with us.

This is a concern. People who have jobs can lose their income because they don’t have a place where they can be on desk duty or whatever the case may be. They’re waiting for months and months and months. Because of that process, they lose their employment; their bills are backed up; they have a financial burden. So there’s something that we need to do to actually lessen red tape but then make the process better in other ways in other ministries—and one of them, I have to say, I experienced with the Ministry of Transportation." ],

It’s a matter of tradition as to why you do that. I wanted just to start today by giving that explanation to the people back home because some people look at it as a waste of energy. It’s never a waste of energy addressing you, Mr. Speaker. And to all other Speakers that sit in that chair, I always enjoy your leniency and how you are extremely engaging in bringing us all to order and making sure that we are always kept on topic.", "Having said that, it’s always an honour for me to stand here in my place on behalf of the good people of Algoma–Manitoulin.", "Today we’re talking about unnecessary red tape. The bill itself is to reduce the regulatory burden on businesses and to achieve cost savings for government. The new act would require the government to provide some kind of offset to businesses if the government enacts any regulation that causes an administration cost to businesses, as well as additional requirements to ensure regulations meet international standards and to impose lower cost requirements to small business whenever possible.", "I look forward to having some further discussions along with some of the small businesses across Algoma–Manitoulin and some of the chambers over these decisions in the upcoming weeks. I’m actually looking forward to meeting up with the Algoma District Municipal Association this weekend to talk about them, about some of these changes, because they see that it’s—some of these might be reflected on their agenda.", "I think everyone in this House, Mr. Speaker, wants to pass good, substantive reform, and I think we’ll be able to do that with Bill 154. It took a long time to get through it. You’re looking at it, and here’s the bill. It’s a hefty one, pretty intense, over 40 statutes and acts that are going to be touched in one way or another, that are going to be changed. So let’s just say it was a big task in going through it.", "Overall, I didn’t see anything really problematic in regards to what is being proposed in there. Of course, you have to do your homework and look at it from one end to the other. I was pretty happy about it, is my honest opinion. I was even a bit surprised: Even though it’s a heavy bill, it stays pretty straightforward all the way through.", "When you’re looking at this, you really want to find ways of reducing the regulatory burden on businesses and achieving cost savings; that’s what this government is attempting to do. But as my colleague the member from Kitchener–Waterloo, who gave her one-hour lead on this, mentioned in her notes during her hour lead, does cutting unnecessary red tape also mean that there’s necessary red tape? It’s just a friendly reminder that not all regulations are bad.", "As you know, businesses in the north sometimes have a harder time to grow. There are less people, meaning less demand. Opportunities are often more difficult to find. Hydro prices are much higher. I’ll get back to the hydro prices a little bit later in my comments.", "Of course, anything that can reduce the burden of the northern Ontario economy is something I will certainly support.", "There is also this mention that the government will provide some kind of offset to businesses if it enacts any regulation that causes an administrative cost to business, as well as additional requirements to ensure regulations meet international standards, and to impose lower costs in requirements to small businesses whenever possible.", "Honestly, that sounds like a pretty sweet compensation that will help the northern economy to stay competitive, but let’s be clear: We need to do much more for northern Ontario’s economy. I strongly believe that when northern Ontario’s economy is doing well, so is the rest of this province.", "When you do look around down here in Toronto—you look at the structures that are going up. A lot of the economic opportunities and the businesses and the companies that are within those structures are mining companies, financial companies and forestry companies. That is because the resources that we have in northern Ontario are moving forward. That is because the opportunities that are there are bringing this province forward. I’ve always said it, and I will always say it: When northern Ontario is healthy and working, so is the rest of this province.", "Most people don’t realize that the wealth created in the north greatly benefits southern Ontario, but we should never forget that the investment and big gains come with the development of northern communities. These communities also depend on small businesses thriving and reinvesting in their communities. We need a government that understands the realities of all of Ontario. We need to make sure small businesses can thrive, grow their communities and attract investment. Then, and only then, can we grow our province and reinvest in communities that have a harder time to survive and be competitive. We need to actually think of policies and reforms that will create growth and benefit everyone.", "Although Bill 154 seems like a good start, we need to consider other things as well. I’m talking about a job creation tax credit. That was in our platform in 2014. It’s not because it’s 2017 that the proposal isn’t valid anymore; it just makes that much more sense to have it. We need to have a practical approach to create jobs. That means rewarding companies that create jobs in Ontario.", "Just like Bill 144, it’s a pretty straightforward way to help businesses. After reducing the burden on businesses and saving costs, the government will have money to reinvest. Why not reinvest that money with targeted policies that help job creation? I want to see our economy grow so we can actually improve our underfunded programs. It’s simply a virtuous circle.", "A job creation tax credit is a plan that will help real people. I don’t want to see a tax cut for big corporations. I want a tax credit for small businesses that would actually grow our communities. It makes sense. There are so many people in the communities I represent who are trying to grow their businesses and make their towns a better place and a nicer place. Not only are they trying, they’re actually giving back to the community by providing them with sponsorships. Whether it is hockey teams, community events, engaging suppers, they’re always there and they’re looking at those opportunities to make it grow.", "Mr. Speaker, I see young, creative entrepreneurs on Manitoulin Island and across my riding creating jobs, new opportunities for their communities. I’m talking about microbreweries, bed and breakfasts, restaurants, coffee shops and art galleries—all of those becoming community hubs, places of gathering where people can exchange ideas and actually grow their communities even more. What they’re doing is really amazing. A little boost here and a little boost there could actually make such an important difference. Create a job; get a credit. It’s as simple as that. It just makes sense.", "We also talked about the manufacturing tax credit as well. In the same mindset, you want companies to invest in themselves. A manufacturing tax credit would make it more affordable for companies to purchase machinery and equipment and reinvest into their workers. Bill 154 will show our willingness to companies that we want to make it easier for them to operate in Ontario, but a tax credit will actually convince them to stay in Ontario and invest here in Ontario. The moment we start focusing on reducing the burden on business, invest in job creation and truly prioritize growth, we will be able to do a heck of a lot more. When you start saving money here and there in ways Bill 154 is trying to do, it also allows us to reinvest here in Ontario where we can best serve Ontarians.", "Now, growing our economy shouldn’t mean tax cuts. All that money should go back into our health care system, our education system, pharmacare, child care and all the great things that make Ontario a fairer and more affordable place to live.", "Just today, meeting up in—and most of you did meet with them. We had people here from the Alzheimer Society on dementia strategy. They were looking at ways as to—“Where we can be of benefit to you in helping the people we’re representing here is by finding additional dollars.” Where are those additional dollars going to come from? Well, from initiatives like this where you can invest those dollars into preventative care; where you can have the vision, that the investments that you’re putting in today, you’re not going to see the benefit of it tomorrow or next week or next year. You’ve got to have a longer vision. Five, 10, 15, 20 years down the road is where you’re going to be able to recoup and see the benefits of those initial investments.", "Needless to say, when people are not worried about being able to pay for their medication or if they don’t have to pay crushing student debt, they are more willing to spend or even to invest into small business here in Ontario.", "The same logic applies to hydro prices, Mr. Speaker. I’m not even sorry to talk about this again, because people in my riding and all across Ontario are suffering from the mismanagement of consecutive Conservative and Liberal governments on the hydro file. I will use every chance that I get to talk about hydro and how we can fix it in this province. I mentioned it last week during some comments that I made in regard to the plan that we put forward. I’m proud of that plan. You know what? Not everybody agrees with it. That’s fine. At least it’s generating a discussion and at least we have a plan put out there where we can actually help and assist Ontarians going forward.", "If we’re talking about unburdening business, let’s talk about having some of the highest electricity rates in northern Ontario. I highlighted that story as well last week. Big companies want to come to Ontario and invest, but they end up going elsewhere because they can’t afford the high hydro rates that are here in Ontario. That’s a lot of money not invested in our province. That’s a lot of jobs that could be lifting individuals out of poverty. That’s a lot of communities that would benefit from the investments and the small businesses that could be created from true investment in Ontario.", "Lower hydro prices would also mean that businesses wouldn’t have to constantly downgrade. I talked last week about a small family-owned sawmill on Manitoulin Island and the Taylor family who owns it. They went from 20 or 25 and now they are down to 12 employees, because they couldn’t afford it. Their hydro bill during peak periods went from $4,500 to $6,000 in just over two years. You can’t continue to operate when your costs keep going up. You can’t invest into your business when your costs keep going up.", "For many, the reduction in employment doesn’t sound like a lot, but to a small community like M’Chigeeng on Manitoulin Island, those eight jobs, that’s eight families. And that’s a lot of economy that comes into that small area.", "People are hurting, Mr. Speaker, while this government is privatizing Hydro One, and the official opposition is staying silent on the privatization of Hydro One. We are losing billions in potential revenues that could be reinvested in our services. Goodness knows we need investment in public services in the north. We need transportation services in northern Ontario.", "You want to talk about red tape? Try getting to a doctor’s appointment, when you’re living in Elliot Lake, either in Sault Ste. Marie or in Sudbury. You’re a senior and you live alone in your condo up in Elliot Lake. You have to travel first from Elliot Lake to Highway 108. Then you have to wait there for the bus to come in. Guess what? The scheduling on those bus routes: They come in at 12 or 3 o’clock in the morning. Now, that’s one thing when you’re talking in the summer months when it’s nice outside and you have that shelter or that car that is there with you. But when you don’t have that shelter and you’re being dropped off because the bus was delayed, or you don’t know if the bus is going to show up and you’re out there in the morning—those are the investments that we need in order to see true, meaningful transportation corridors when we’re talking northern Ontario.", "A rail system we once had that was really one of the biggest highlights that we had in northern Ontario, where it could have been expanded and really had a true transportation strategy for northern Ontario, the one train that we had, the ONTC, is now gone. Gone—more challenges, more red tape for northerners in regard to getting to and from their destinations. School kids that were relying on that bus getting from northern Ontario to southern Ontario have lost that ability.", "So the challenges are somewhat different, but the red tape still exists and we need to see more of that red tape being removed, but also removed prudently so that it doesn’t impede Ontarians.", "I’m happy that the Liberals—who, by the way, cancelled the Red Tape Commission when they formed government in 2003—finally decided to introduce these amendments. I know the Conservatives appreciated this commission because, for them, it was about making government smaller. But personally, I like efficient government. I don’t want to downsize government per se; I want a “restructuration” that will help us become more efficient and find more savings to reinvest into public transportation, into schools, into hospitals, into front-line workers to care for our seniors.", "I think it appears to be clear that businesses—and people as well, for that matter—are tired of dealing with a government that bounces them from one department to another department and never seems to have an answer for you.", "From a lot of my constituents—the member who just spoke to the bill earlier about the challenges that are there for an individual who is looking at securing employment but is being told that he has to go through a battery of visitations for getting his proper class of driver’s licence. The challenges that you have with first just getting through that process and the delays that are there—an automatic delay for when you file for that driver’s licence and your application goes from on top and you’re going to have to wait 30 days. It doesn’t matter if a job is available to you as soon as you get your licence. Well, you know what? You’re going to lose out on that opportunity and you’re not going to get that job. That’s the red tape that we’re looking to fix. It’s an immediate opportunity for those individuals.", "The thing is that Bill 154 will give more power to the minister as well. That’s not something new under this government. But I raised this point before: Maybe the minister is a great administrator and an expert in the field, but will the next one be? That’s going to be an important question as well. The centralization of power can be a tricky thing, especially if you don’t have enough experts in your bureaucracy to make the best decision possible.", "In the north, that centralization of public services results in cuts. It really affects people on a daily basis. We’ve seen it when there was an attack on public services and ServiceOntario offices in northern Ontario and across this province, where we were successful in getting this government to reconsider some of the decisions that were made and those centres were maintained and kept open. These services are a much-needed service across this province, particularly in northern Ontario where the communities are spread far and wide. It’s part of our tourism and it’s part of our economy. They’re much-needed services that we need.", "It’s a fine line between too much and too little bureaucracy when it comes to helping people and businesses. I think people expect their government to make changes in their bureaucracy. To streamline, update and modernize are good things from time to time.", "Another potential problem with that is that, already, this government has been outsourcing and privatizing government agencies, supposedly to save money. The reality is that now we get poor-quality service, and it’s costing everybody a little bit more at the end of the month. This bill will actually allow more of that to happen.", "That, again, is a big concern for us in northern Ontario, where we see a lot of these services that we’re going to be potentially losing, where the individuals who were there—by cutting this red tape, what’s going to happen is that it’s being passed on to the private sector, and those individuals have to come back in order to fix the errors that were there. I’ve had many opportunities to have many discussions with individuals out of those centres, particularly out of the ServiceOntario offices, who are experts and who go out of their way to assist community members in order to make sure their application is properly done; in order to make sure that that transportation permit is there; in order to make sure that that load leaves the yard on the Monday morning.", "There’s a lot of red tape that can be used, but we have to make sure that it’s being removed properly so that it doesn’t hurt Ontarians and that it actually helps the good people across northern Ontario." ],

Little things are taking six weeks, eight weeks to get a response from MTO, so it’s very frustrating.

That’s how the government should work in partnership with small businesses—and not try to overly burden them and make it complicated to hire workers and to train them.", "However, I’ve been in this game for a little while here now. I always am shocked at the way in which the Progressive Conservatives talk about red tape when, in fact, in all the years that I’ve been here so far—six years—I’ve seen multiple times when the official opposition puts forward bills that are indeed regulation. I remember the member from Renfrew–Nipissing–Pembroke brought forward a bill that would require truck drivers to clean the snow off the top of their trucks in the winter. That’s regulation. That’s a regulation that is safety-oriented, but that would require truck drivers and operators to get out of their trucks and clean their trucks. That’s going to add time. It’s going to cost money. That’s one regulation that you put forward. It’s reasonable.", "When you reference 400,000 regulations in the province of Ontario, be specific.

Ontario is really competitive in Canada and globally. We know that our plan for the economy is working. We’re growing the economy.

I’m really watching this one, and I’m going to be looking forward to the discussions that are going to be happening at committee.", "When you look at the potential savings that are here, the $6 million to $9 million that is going to be here—I guess what small businesses are looking at as we’re having this debate is, “How are those savings going to be able to come back to us and assist us? What are those savings going to look like? Is it going to come in as we have proposed, as far as what we have as far as an idea of a job creation tax credit or a job training incentive? What is that going to look like, and how is that going to benefit us?”", "When you say that Ontario is open for business, I’m sorry, but as the critic for northern development and mines, it’s certainly not the message that I’m getting from industry when I go out and talk to them. They’re looking at Ontario and saying, “You guys figure out your framework. You guys figure out what you need to do. But in the meantime, the resources that you have there are fine. They’re going to stay in the ground, or they’re going to stay standing up in the forest. When you guys have an actual plan going forward, we’ll come back, but in the meantime, we’re going to take our dollars, we’re going to take our investments and we’re going to go into other jurisdictions as you guys figure it out here in Ontario.”", "That’s the message that I’m hearing from industry. I’m not sure where this government is getting their information from, but there is a lot of investment and a lot of opportunity that we’re missing out on because of the red tape that we have here in Ontario." ],

I come from a business background. I studied business in my undergrad, and I studied business in my graduate studies. I was a commercial lender, and I worked for a management consulting firm where we advised businesses on how to overcome a range of challenges: some of the more complex problems businesses face, the kind of problems that they didn’t have the internal expertise or experience to solve themselves. So I know a lot about this. I know a lot about the impact of government regulation, and various forms of government regulation, on businesses.", "I also know a lot, as a result of providing businesses with that advice, about how businesses actually make decisions: everything from when they choose to expand, how they do that, how much risk they’re willing to take, how they finance that expansion and how they choose which jurisdictions to operate in and to expand into.", "As I was listening to the debate and listening to the member from Algoma–Manitoulin talking about how businesses are choosing to go elsewhere because of regulation, or because of the amount of regulation in Ontario, I think that, with all due respect to the member, he shows a strong misunderstanding of how businesses actually make decisions.", "Businesses make decisions as to which jurisdictions to invest in and which jurisdictions to expand within based on a number of factors. Those factors include things like a skilled workforce, and for most businesses, that’s the number one consideration.", "They look at infrastructure. Can they move their goods to and from their manufacturing facilities? Can they move their people from where they’re living to where they need to work? That includes all kinds of infrastructure: highways, transit, airports etc. All those things are important.", "As part of the consideration around how they attract the best-quality talent, they think, “Does the city or the community or the region that I’m in offer the quality of life that the people I want to have employed by my business will want to live in? Does it provide those kinds of living conditions?” A lot of cities, and a lot of municipalities and communities of all sizes, invest a lot of resources to attract that talent, because by attracting that talent, they attract the investment from businesses to hire that talent on.", "Regulations and taxes are part of that consideration set, but when you think about all of the things that businesses consider—and I’ve just listed a few, but I’ve certainly listed the top ones. Businesses think about how they invest; they think about if they can attract the talent and workforce that they need, the people that they need, now and in the future. Does it have the infrastructure and supports that they require to operate their business? Is it a stable business environment and banking environment? What are corporate taxes like? How high are they? How low are they? How does that compare to other jurisdictions? And then they also think about regulations. When you think about all of those things, those are some of the things that businesses consider when making a decision.", "Unfortunately, when you listen to the debate here in the Legislature, sometimes you hear from members saying, “The regulations in Ontario are scaring away business,” and that’s just not true. That’s just not factual or accurate. I know it’s not factual or accurate because I used to advise those businesses on those decisions, number one, and number two, that’s just not how businesses make decisions. There are other factors that are more important.", "That’s not to say that regulation isn’t important, and that’s not to say that we shouldn’t minimize the cost on business when we can. As a business person who had to help companies navigate regulation, I know how important that is and how impactful that can be to a company’s bottom line.", "That’s what this bill is about. It’s really about making sure that government reduces the regulatory burden on business, and it’s also about making sure that if we do have to impose regulations, that we’re offsetting them. That’s one piece.", "The second piece is about making sure that we’re remaining competitive when it comes to regulation, so that our regulatory regime is aligned with the regulations in other jurisdictions, and that’s a helpful measure to make sure that we remain competitive in this regard. That’s just going to further reinforce the fact that when people stand up and say, whether it’s in this Legislature or elsewhere, “Businesses aren’t investing in Ontario because of regulation”––this will help ensure that that doesn’t happen and that argument doesn’t hold water.", "We’re going to consider the unique needs of small businesses in this legislation. As we move forward with regulation, we’ll recognize and reward businesses that maintain a good compliance record. We should be focusing our inspection and enforcement resources on those businesses that are not complying, rather than those that are. That’s just good business sense. That’s a good way of rewarding those who are good actors, and it also helps to make sure that we invest the enforcement resources where they’re most needed.", "I’ve talked about four of the measures in this bill, Speaker. Ultimately, what I think we have to remember is that Ontario’s economy is performing well, that businesses make decisions as to where they locate and where they invest based on a range of factors, of which the regulatory regime is one, and this government is making sure that we’re minimizing the regulations in place. This bill does that, and I urge all members to support it." ],

  "text" : [ "It’s my pleasure to lend my voice and my support to this bill. It’s named Cutting Unnecessary Red Tape Act, 2017.", "As you know—I think I’ve shared this story with the House in the past. A little bit about my family background: I came here when I was 13 with my mom. My dad was already here, and he was a film producer before we immigrated to Canada. Like many immigrants, when they first landed here, it would be very difficult for them to actually put their knowledge and their skills to use. So, like many of his peers, he tried a few small businesses.", "With our arrival, with additional hands in the family, he decided to invest in a coffee shop business. I remember I helped out. I got the pleasure of doing the graveyard shift after school for, I think, almost two or three years. I enjoyed it. It really gave me an opportunity to learn more about the society and the community that we lived in. It also gave me a good understanding of what a small business details.", "To me, looking back, I think there were three aspects to the business, if you have to categorize them. One is the back operation. It includes inventory. You’ve got to order your product and your merchandise. You have to deal with the bank and the finances, doing your daily bookkeeping as well as looking at other business clients to potentially negotiate a better deal.", "Then, it’s the front service. You’ve got to talk to your clients. You’ve got to make sure that they get the right product and that they’re happy with the quality of the product.", "As well, in those three years, we learned and adapted to the regulatory requirements that every business operator is facing, such as the fire codes and the regular inspection of that equipment. We also had a tobacco licence—so you want to make sure that everything is up to date. Health inspections: They may arrive at any time, so we want to make sure that everything is up to standard. If we want to do some renovation, we want to make sure all the building codes and all the requirements are met. It’s quite a bit, although the business is small. But still, it’s quite a bit for a newcomer family to realize, to keep up with the regulations of the day.", "That’s just a bit of my understanding of small business.", "Let’s put that aside for a minute. I heard this afternoon a lot of talk about the history of this government. I think we have a very proud history. In the last 14 years, this government has done a lot to reduce the cost of doing business in this province. For example, the introduction of HST: In that process, we were able to save businesses hundreds of millions of dollars every year in the filing costs in the paperwork. Of course, unfortunately, we didn’t get the support from parties across the floor—but that’s a real saving of administrative burden.", "We introduced online service. Now you can incorporate a business online. It saves time; it saves money. People are so used to it that they tend to have forgotten about it.", "As you know, there was a time when everything had to be done with paper and all that process. Even birth certificates took up to six months to complete. It is this government that got that digitized. I think that at the time, we put out a promise that if you don’t get your birth certificate in 15 days, you get your money back. I think that guarantee is still in place.", "That’s the reason why we are seeing great economic growth in this province. We’re leading the G7 nations in GDP growth for two and a half years. That is very significant, and I have to say that it has something to do with this government’s policy on supporting businesses and their growth in this province.", "When I was going through what this bill potentially could do, I was very pleased. There are five areas I see that you’ll be looking to realize. One is that for every dollar of new administrative cost imposed on business due to new regulations, the government will have to find $1.25 to offset that cost on business. This has a prolonged effect to the businesses in this province. They have a guarantee from this government that if we’re going to introduce new regulations, we’ll find offsets to save business 25% more.", "The other thing I cite out of the five—well, of course, the harmonization of regulations with other jurisdictions is very important. Consider the unique needs of small business. I think this is very important. When we design policy and regulations, we look at industries; we look at the economy. But this bill, if passed, will be looking at the specific needs of small businesses. As you know, the ministry of small business was newly created to work with other ministries to cater to the needs of small business. This is very important.", "My favourite is that we will recognize and reward businesses that maintain a good compliance record; for example, by potentially reducing the number of inspections for business. Again, having had experience with small businesses, I remember waiting for the inspector to show up, and going through those inspections. You know that you’ve done everything up to the standard, but there is additional anxiety. You don’t know what the inspector may say. Let the record show that if you are a good operator, you should be awarded with less inspections and less burden on your business.", "Lastly, business will be guaranteed the option to submit any documents electronically to the government instead of having to waste time and money by doing so on paper. That’s what I said before on online incorporation of businesses. This is to go further on that.", "I think this bill is going to reduce red tape for small business, and business across the province. It’s going to have my support. I urge all members of this House to give it a look and consideration, and consider supporting it." ],

For the most part, the ones that I talk to at least—job creators and small businesses in my community—want to go to work. They want to employ people. They want to provide a service or a good, of course. But too often, there’s government constantly in their way—constantly.", "I can think of a variety of different issues.

They bring you into a room and they’re like, “Here are all the things you need to comply with. Here are the taxes, the fees, the costs,” and they somewhat have it backwards.", "It’s due to that mentality that we see companies leave our great province of Ontario for other jurisdictions—because they’re being sought after in high demand, frankly.

One of the things that we know can help small businesses is the cost of hydro. It’s exorbitant, and many small business owners have talked about their unaffordable hydro rates.

You have to apply for these programs, you have to know where you’re going; you have to know they exist to get there.", "It really speaks to the fact that when we’re talking about red tape—why don’t we just make hydro rates affordable and forget all these extra systems to bring down the cost of hydro?

In fact, it’s a universal pharmacare program for everyone under the age of 25. What do we mean by “universal”? We mean that every individual who is under 25 years of age will qualify for this program. It doesn’t matter what the family income is; every person in Ontario who has an OHIP card will qualify for this program. There isn’t any copayment; there isn’t any deductible. It means that if you’ve got a prescription from your doctor and your OHIP card, you can go to any pharmacy in Ontario come January 1, 2018, and you can get the drug you need.", "The other thing that we’ve done with this program is that all 4,400 drugs that are on the Ontario drug formulary will be available through this program. The reason that that is so very, very important: Obviously, this program is going to be really important to families who are low income and have no drug benefit program, because they struggle to pay for even the simplest of prescriptions—the antibiotics for a child’s ear infection. For many families who are middle income, those occasional prescriptions for antibiotics or something to deal with those occasional childhood diseases aren’t a big deal. What’s a big deal is if the child has a chronic disease, if the child has a rare disease or if, God help us, the child has cancer or some really life-threatening incident. Because all 4,400 drugs are on the formulary, that means that no matter what sort of disease the child or young person has, they’ll be able to get those drugs covered.", "It isn’t just pharmacare. We’re investing in hospitals.

He represents most of Wellington, and I represent Guelph. I was able to announce funding increases for all the hospitals in Guelph and Wellington. When we put them all together, we get a $4.2-million increase just in Guelph and Wellington.", "On top of that, the money is in the budget for construction to continue at Groves Memorial Community Hospital in Fergus, in the Speaker’s riding.", "So we’re doing not just pharmacare but a lot of other great things in health care.", "Now I’m going to turn it over to my colleague from Beaches–East York, I believe." ],

  "text" : [ "The minister is quite right: She is turning the debate over to me at this time. I too, of course, am delighted to be able to announce and be here to participate in debate on a balanced budget, the first in over 10 years.", "What’s particularly of interest in this for me is that it was a fundamental campaign promise when we were elected three years ago, one that I ran on in my community. This budget fulfills a promise that was made at the time. What is extremely important about it is that it demonstrates it is a truly balanced budget, because it is going to be projecting out for the next three years to continue to be balanced. At the same time as the economy is growing, it will allow us additional opportunities to invest new expenditures in the province of Ontario to help build Ontario up.", "So there’s so much more in this budget than the signature piece and the pharmacare.", "One of the things we didn’t talk about yet today, certainly, is in pharmacare—how this is a nation-leading program, Speaker. This is a program where we’re coming forward and starting to send the signal that, yes, as part of all health care in the province of Ontario, pharmacare should be there universally. Although our plan doesn’t get to universality, it does provide a very significant segment of our population with access to 4,400 drugs. That needs to be done. We sent that signal in a very fiscally responsible way. We certainly have no disagreement with the members of the third party that this should be a program. We have been advocating for years at the federal level, through our Minister of Health, through our Premier and at Premier meetings across the country, that we would like to do a universal plan. It’s now up to the federal government to step up and to send the signal, and to other provinces to step up.", "There’s a parallel here, Speaker, that relates to the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan. We took that initiative; we led. When we were negotiating with a very, very hostile government in Ottawa—a government in Ottawa, I would remind people, that the current Leader of the Opposition was a backbencher in, and not a very active backbencher. We’ve been trying to find examples of him speaking, and they’re very hard to come by. He was somewhat silent for his many years in Ottawa. Nonetheless, he was part of a government that not only increased the debt load of the government of Canada by unprecedented amounts, but was there not supporting our retirement initiatives at the time.", "We took the initiative in Ontario, under the leadership of our Premier, to say we needed to boost people’s retirement income. That, too, was a significant promise that we made in the 2014 election: that we would address opportunities to enhance people’s retirement incomes. Because we did not have the co-operation of the feds, we went out on our own. In my own riding, I took some heat for the additional bureaucracy, for the additional costs, because people thought, “Why don’t you just get together with the federal government and do a national program?” They wouldn’t do it. But once the government changed, and once we had a receptive ear in the federal government, then they did take this notion, because it was important that we improve people’s retirement income.", "So the parallel here, Speaker, is that we’re doing the same thing now with pharmacare. I’m very excited that we’re proceeding in that direction.", "There is, again, so much more in this budget of tremendous interest—in health care, particularly.", "Another one of the campaign promises that I made in my community—because it was the calling of the election in 2014, because the members of the third party over there wouldn’t support one of the most progressive budgets, if not the most progressive budget in decades. They wouldn’t support it. As a result, funding for our local hospital, the Toronto East General Hospital, was put at risk. They were in the midst of a rebuild. They had designs and planning in the works. Had we not come forward and made government in 2014—they knew those investments in health care in our community were gravely at risk, because they heard the messages from the official opposition about slashing jobs, getting to balance by cutting programs and cutting services. That was going to be unpalatable. So in my community, the Toronto East General Hospital was able to continue its planning.", "I’m so delighted to announce that in this budget, we are providing an extra $11.5 billion into the health care system. As part of our $190-billion plan over the next 13 years, there is sufficient funding in that program that Toronto East General Hospital—now renamed the Michael Garron Hospital, I would add, as a result of a very generous gift from the Garron family, after their son Michael—that program continues. They are now evaluating the request for proposals, they are looking for that builder, and I’m hearing estimates that this could be upwards of a $400-million booster shot in my own community to help create the most efficient, well-run health care of a very difficult population, which is lower-income, new Canadians, with complex needs, complex disorders. This additional funding will allow us to build a new patient care wing, which is being named after the Thomson family because of their generous gift, and we will be able to get rid of ward rooms in my hospital where we have four, five or six people in the same room in a ward. In this day of infectious disease, Speaker, it’s so important that we get our hospital rooms where you’re managing one person at a time so as not to transfer anything. Our new patient care wing is going to accommodate a whole raft of new rooms to provide better health care services in the community.", "I’m also pleased to say that we have additional funding in education, again part of that $190-billion program in education. We’re building new schools. We’re rebuilding George Webster school, which is in the north part of my riding, and I’m just delighted about that, because the school was old, falling down, single-storey and wasn’t meeting the needs of the community. In fact, there were so many kids there that the Toronto District School Board had to lease space from another school, a Catholic school nearby, in order to accommodate the influx of new students.", "We’ve also got, in transportation, the Eglinton LRT. When that came forward with David Miller and Adam Giambrone, it was a program for which the province of Ontario stepped up with 100% of the funding. We’re now going to continue to move forward with new funding for new projects in Ontario, including right through my riding of Beaches–East York, where at the corner of Main and Danforth, where the GO rail is, we’re going to get regional express rail coming from Stouffville, coming from the Lakeshore East line. We’ll have downtown service every seven to eight minutes at Main and Danforth, to get people downtown in 10 minutes.", "This is what our budget has done, what it has done extraordinarily well. I, for one, am very proud to support it. I certainly hope other members in the Legislature will.", "I’ll turn it over to the member from Etobicoke–Lakeshore." ],

I’ve prided myself throughout my career on keeping the commitments that I’ve made to my constituents.", "Back in 2014 when I ran in Etobicoke–Lakeshore, I committed to my constituents that this government would bring about a balanced budget during the term and that we would continue investing in transit and other key infrastructure for my community and communities across this province—a promise made; a promise kept. I’m very proud of that, Mr. Speaker.", "In this budget, we’re enhancing our historic commitment to infrastructure spending by going from $160 billion over 12 years to $190 billion over 13 years. To compare that to the very important and very welcome announcement in the federal budget, the national government will be spending just over $180 billion during that time frame across the whole country. We’re spending more than that just in our beautiful province.", "In the city of Toronto, where I served on councils where we struggled to secure funding from other orders of government and where we saw plans being created that could never be funded—that’s where I spent my formative years as a municipal councillor. Now, as an elected member of provincial Parliament, I’m proud to see historic investments in the city of Toronto—a government that is the single biggest contributor of transit funding to the city of Toronto in our history. Mr. Speaker, this is great news.", "Last year—I know it rolls over into this budget—we provided $150 million towards the planning of the downtown relief line, a key additional element of the transit solutions for the city of Toronto and for the GTHA. That is our down payment and our ongoing commitment to building infrastructure in the city.", "But this budget is about more than just bricks and mortar and rails. It’s about people. My wife and I are part of the sandwich generation. We have a beautiful, soon-to-be-eight-year-old daughter, and we also have aging parents. This budget contains so much for my family and for my neighbours and my friends. This budget includes a historic commitment to pharmacare so that young people 24 and under in this province will never again have to worry about the medications that they need; that family doctors will never again, when you go and see them with a sick child, ask you, “Do you have a health plan? Do you have prescription coverage?” because they know that many families struggle with that. They’ll know now that if a child needs prescription medication, that prescription will be filled and it will continue to be filled until it’s no longer needed. This is so incredibly important to our families.", "On the other end of the spectrum, Mr. Speaker, with our older Ontarians, there is much in this budget to help them and to help those who care for them: historic investments in support for caregivers; caregivers’ tax credit; opportunities for more respite programs in our communities so that, for those dedicated sons and daughters who look after their parents and other family members, there’s something there to help them ease their burden, give them some respite, give them some additional supports.", "There are additional funds in this budget to help our hospitals which are straining with the load that is placed on them: an across-the-board increase in hospital budgets across the province which will help alleviate waiting times in emergency wards and make sure they can continue to provide excellent service; investments in a number of elective surgeries that will reduce those wait-lists, across the board. That’s so incredibly important.", "In my community of Etobicoke–Lakeshore, I remember a time when another party was in government, where our local hospital, the Queensway hospital, was going to be closed—not reduced, but closed. In this budget, there is a historic investment in hospital expansions across the province, but my community hospital, part of the Trillium Health Partners, the Queensway site, will see significant investment. The sister site in Mississauga will see over 500 new acute-care beds, and our Etobicoke–Lakeshore site will see over 100 post-acute-care beds put there which will provide support to those people as they transition out of the hospital and hopefully back to their homes soon. These are very important investments in my community, and they’re mirrored in communities across the province.", "As I said at the beginning, I pride myself on keeping the commitments that I make to my constituents. We’ve balanced the budget, we’re investing in our infrastructure, and we’re investing in our health care and education systems to help Ontarians, and people in my community as well.", "Mr. Speaker, this is not just a good budget; it is a great budget. The calls I hear from across the floor are perhaps pangs of a guilty conscience, because when you claimed that you had a balanced budget, it was actually a $5-billion deficit. That’s your guilt. We’re proud of what we’re doing." ],

But, Speaker, the problem with the government’s budget is not so much the document as the authors of it. This government has no credibility when it comes to financial management or any fiscal responsibility.", "I don’t need to talk about all the scandals and whatnot. We can talk about their day-to-day incompetence of the management of the province’s budget. Last week in public accounts, the ministry of training, colleges and universities was there with Employment Ontario. Employment Ontario creates employment opportunities or jobs programs for the unemployed. Their budget last year was $1.3 billion. Out of that $1.3 billion that they spent to help people get jobs, only 10% of the people who went through those employment programs actually got a job they were trained for—one in 10.", "They did do a little bit better. One third of people actually got some work after doing the employment programs, but fully two thirds were still unemployed after the employment programs—$1.3 billion, and they’ve been doing this for a long time. The Second Career program has been going on for eight years, and they can only get one in 10 people trained effectively and have a job. Fiscal mismanagement is their stock in trade." ],

It is great that youth and children and babies will have their drugs covered, but I’m worried that it will be a hard cliff to look at once you turn 25.", "Let’s be clear. The number of prescriptions filled for that age group is about one in 100. The money that we spent on covering four million youth is one tenth of the money we spend to cover the elderly population at 65. It’s fine to cover children, but I’m worried about the cliff. What happens at 25? As much as it is important to cover children, it is important to cover their parents too. When you look at 2.2 million workers in Ontario who get up every day to go to work and don’t have a drug plan—they are still left with nothing.", "When the NDP, or anybody else, talks about a universal plan, “universal” means whoever you are, no matter how old you are, but we still don’t have that.

Our members were actually fighting to get a chance to speak to this budget, so we had to share the time.", "With regard to financial management, I am not going to take lessons from that member or that party on fiscal management. First of all, we took a thoughtful approach to balancing the budget under the leadership of the previous Treasury Board president, who’s here, and the current one, and the Minister of Finance. We’ve taken a thoughtful, measured approach and gone through every program in government to look at how we can get better value for money and how we can better results for taxpayers.", "That’s exactly how we went about balancing the budget—not the way that member and that party did, by slashing and burning the public services that underpin the quality of life that we enjoy here in Ontario; by closing hospitals and putting teachers out on the street. The NDP would appreciate that. The kinds of things the PCs did when they were in office to balance the budget are unacceptable in this the province, and we didn’t go down that path. For them to lecture us now on how to balance the budget I think is laughable.", "I also think it’s laughable because, in the best of economic times—they were in office when Ontario had record economic growth. What did they do? They slashed taxes and had trouble balancing the budget, so they had to resort, in an election year, to selling off the 407 to balance the budget in the final year on a one-time basis. Now the PCs have the gall to lecture us. As someone who has two business degrees and who studied economics and finance and advised companies on how to manage their money, I’m not going to take lessons from that member on fiscal management.", "Lastly, I’m just going to add quickly, on the issue of pharmacare: I’m really proud of this pharmacare plan, the OHIP+ plan. I have to remind the NDP member who talked about how adults won’t benefit from this: There are four million children out there, all of whom have parents who will benefit from this because they’re the ones, the vast majority of the time, who are absorbing the costs.", "I’m really proud of this budget, and I’m proud of the way we’re moving ahead, both in terms of funding services and in terms of our fiscal plan." ],

They stopped caring about the people of Ontario and took partisan lines with regard to how—they should still be jumping up and down about how the federal government has changed and drastically cut the health transfers.", "Mr. Speaker, this budget offers little for my riding. Five schools are still going to close due to this government’s incompetence. The Dutton wind farm is still going to be built.

Hydro One was the price Ontarians paid and will continue to pay to keep the Liberal Party, in their minds, in power, but I think Ontarians are wise to it.

As my colleague from Elgin–Middlesex–London just said, they were making huge cries in regard to the federal government when Mr. Harper was Prime Minister, and yet with Mr. Trudeau it’s all rosy and they accepted the exact same deal that they totally went crazy and ballistic on Mr. Harper for. It’s interesting, that $1.5-billion trust fund: Have they got an agreement from the Prime Minister every year to get that? Let’s not forget, we’re still a have-not province.

In the six years I’ve been here, you can’t almost trust a number they come out with. At the end of the day, they told us that the gas plants were going to cost the taxpayer of Ontario $40 million. It was $1.1 billion, Mr. Speaker. I’ll repeat that: $1.1 billion from $40 million. Even the Liberals should be able to admit that was a little bit of a miscalculation. At some point, the people of Ontario have to start asking questions: What can we truly believe with those numbers? They were supposed to have eHealth up and running.

Can we trust any of the numbers that you bring out?” I don’t think this budget is any different when you bring $5 billion to the table that is one-time, special one-offs that are not truly balancing the budget and will not be there next year.", "If the members in the back benches are still in denial about their Liberal economics, they should listen to the message from the Financial Accountability Officer, whose report was very clear: The government’s promise to balance the budget by 2017-18, just in time for the next election, can only be met using artificial solutions. This isn’t the official opposition; this isn’t the third party saying it. This is an arm’s-length third-party member of the Legislature who is questioning whether this is truly a balanced budget and whether it’s sustainable. In his Economic and Fiscal Outlook, he says the budget has an actual deficit of $2.6 billion. So if we take $5 billion and there’s a deficit of $2.6 billion, that’s actually $7.6 billion that we, as Ontarians, have to question this government: Can you validate? Can you substantiate?", "I’m going to intermix a few because I don’t believe we would ever, if there’s a good idea—and our leader has said that if there’s a good idea, let’s do it. There are some good things in this budget.", "They did actually suggest money for dementia care, which I think is huge. That is a problem in our society, particularly in our province, that is going to continue to grow. They put $100 million over three years to support and care for people with dementia as early as possible, once a diagnosis is made, by expanding their access to programs in the community, retirement homes, long-term-care homes and day-away programs. The promise is to also use some of this money to support caregivers. This is a welcome step, albeit details are still lacking. We all need to ensure that those funds get to the front line.", "My colleagues and I have been calling for improvements to front-line resources to better support seniors with Alzheimer’s and related dementias and for a fully funded dementia strategy—but it’s in the details. It’s one thing to say, “Here’s $100 million over three years.” It’s kind of like they say they have all that infrastructure, but all they do is, they keep adding numbers and years to it. What we really want to see is how much of that money is truly getting to the front line so that it’s actually helping people.", "The problem we have heard time and time again from patients and families is that access to dementia supports and care continues to lag post-diagnosis. I don’t believe the government has provided clarity yet as to how these funds will be allotted across Ontario, especially as it concerns diagnosis. It’s key to get there and get that person some care as quickly as possible so we can prevent it, so we can slow it down, so we can give both the patient and the caregiver some kind of support, some kind of assurance that there is hope and that we’re there for them. We again want to know the detail, and we want to hear in the near future from the Minister of Health and Long-Term Care.", "The second item that was positive was the dedicated behavioural supports, or BSO, services to meet the needs of older people with cognitive impairments who exhibit challenging and complex behaviours. With a new $10-million investment in 2017-18, the total BSO commitment is now $64 million, representing a $20-million increase in the past two years. Again, good news: They’re putting it out to where there’s need in that one specific area. But as the experts have said, the goal should be to have a BSO resource in every long-term-care home in Ontario, and I don’t believe we have received any information from the government if in fact they will be doing that. When they come out with these grandiose announcements of money, we want to see the detail. We want to be able to have some trust that they’re coming out with the money and it’s truly going to get to the front line of care and to the patient. That’s the most critical thing we need.", "There was $20 million extra in 2017 for 1.2 million hours for respite care and unpaid caregivers: family and friends of seniors and people living with dementia and other home care patients. Again, we want to know: How is this coming out? How do people access it? What’s the reality of that money actually flowing to the person? With these new investments in respite care, the province’s three-year investment will be $120 million, but the devil is in the details. Is it truly getting to the front line?", "I want to remind people here that, again, the Auditor General last year came out in regard to community care access centres and said that 38 cents of every dollar was going to administration. You can take $120 million and say it’s a wonderful thing if you only read the headlines, but we want to make sure it doesn’t fall into that quagmire where almost 40 cents goes into administration, bureaucracy and spinning paper. We want those dollars to go to the front line and ensure that it gets there to the caregiver, who won’t benefit from a credit against taxes. CARP, the Canadian Association of Retired Persons, is advocating for a refundable caregiver tax credit or a means-tested caregiver allowance. We want to see that those ideas have been implemented and are there to ensure the taxpayers are getting the dollars they need.", "One of the concerns I’m starting to hear about more often is the lack of meal prep supports for seniors who are aging at home. One of them is Gail Gadsby’s 82-year-old mom, who has complex care needs. The Owen Sound CCAC has assigned her three visits a week, about an hour each, which includes helping take a bath, but no help with the activities of daily living, such as laundry and meal preparation. The CCAC has advised that the family can ask for it, but it likely won’t be funded because it’s “outside their scope.”", "I think we need to be looking at these people. The keyword that the government always says is “listening”—listening to the people who have the care needs and making sure the need is met by the actual dollars and the resources that are there.", "It’s troubling to think that serving the needs of seniors does not include some form of keeping them safe and healthy in their home with basic meal assistance. I don’t think there’s anyone out there who could argue that that isn’t truly a health and safety concern, and yet the government says they’re not certain it can be funded because it’s outside their scope.", "While these are welcome investments in the budget, as I said earlier, the Liberals did not make any commitments to the most critical piece: increasing capacity by adding new beds. As critic, I’ve been asking the government at every opportunity, whether it be in estimates, whether it be in this House through questions or whether it be by direct correspondence to the minister. There are 26,500 seniors on today’s waiting list for a nursing bed. They did not announce one new bed. They did not announce anything really even looking towards new beds, and we’ve already been told by the industry that that list will double to over 50,000 required beds in six years, yet there’s nothing in there.", "What they actually talked about was more redevelopment. They’ve been redeveloping beds for 14 years under their administration, yet if you ask anyone out there if they’re comfortable that those beds will be there when we need them, the answer is a resounding no.", "They’re talking about 30,000 beds which will all come offline in 2025 as a result of a directive they gave, yet many of these operators I talked to say that there is nothing there that makes them really, truly assured that they’ll have their licences. Why would they step up, with the way the funding formula is working, to make it sustainable and a reality going down the road?", "What happens to those people who are already in beds? There are 26,500 more already on a waiting list. That’s going to grow to 50,000, and yet there’s not one single word in the budget about how they’re going to address this.", "These are seniors who built our great province and yet we do not even show them the respect in the budget to say, “We are going to take care of you. We will give you hope that we will take care of you.”", "They’ve ignored this file for almost 14 years. When I ask at estimates, they can’t even give me the list of where they were going to redevelop the beds and what timeline they were going to build them on. To me it was a 30,000-bed announcement with no reality. I’m back to: Is there credibility in their numbers? Can we trust their numbers if they cannot give me something as simple as where the plan is to redevelop those beds and on what timeline?", "They’re trying now to play catch-up by shuffling the decks. They’re saying, “We’re going to put money here; we’re going to put money there,” but is it truly going to satisfy the needs of the people we know?", "What happens to these 26,500 frail seniors who are sitting there at home wondering where they’re going to go? The caregivers are asking the exact same question: Where is my mom or dad, where is my brother, sister, aunt or uncle going to go with a government that has not said one single word about developing one single new bed?", "The government’s lack of action on long-term-care beds is, frankly, inexcusable and appears to be confusing even to their own ministers.", "I’m going to switch a little bit, Mr. Speaker, and talk about the redevelopment of beds. The Minister of Energy was quoted in The Nugget one week ago, promising new beds. He said, and I quote from that article, “The budget includes 72 new long-term-care beds for Mattawa.” But frankly, Mr. Speaker, that’s not true, as the 72 beds are rebuilds of existing ones, not additional beds. That is not new. They may be actually a new physical bed, but it’s not new in the actual quantity of beds that are going to be available to the seniors of Mattawa.", "It’s a bit of a shell game here: They use terminology where, if people don’t look at the details, they say, “New beds. That’s wonderful.” But if they go and actually say, “Dad is on a waiting list. Mom is on a waiting list. When am I going to be able to access that new bed?” the answer they’re going to get is, “Oh, those weren’t new beds; those are just redeveloped beds. They’re going to look a little different, but there are no new significant beds being built.”", "They know they have created a crisis in long-term care. So it still leaves us wondering: If 26,500 seniors on the wait-list isn’t a call to action to add new beds, then how many more seniors will have to be wait-listed in Ontario before the Premier acts on this very important issue?", "A number of seniors’ groups, including the Ontario Long Term Care Association and AdvantAge, formerly known as the Ontario Association of Non-Profit Homes and Services for Seniors, expressly asked for new long-term-care beds. The budget did not deliver any. A senior, Cathy McCartney, in my riding sums it up like this: “I believe the seniors of Ontario are being left out. Some of us can hardly get by on the OAS and CPP. We seniors need glasses, hearing aids and dentures, and I think we should get some help from the government. It is disgusting to see some seniors not able to eat proper food. We hardly ever get a cost of living added to OAS, and when we do get a raise, it wouldn’t buy us a cup of coffee. I and many other seniors paid part of our CPP but we sure aren’t getting back what we should. I’m really upset with the government today, as we are being left out. What is happening in this world? Something is not right here.”", "Mr. Speaker, I’m going to transition into something that I’ve spoken in this House a great deal about: school closures. Sadly, it appears a similar narrative applies to students with special needs in rural schools. This government continues to ignore Ontarians’ call for a moratorium on mass school closures. Consider that the Premier told Ontarians she was going to run an education government and to trust her with their education in their schools. Yet two years after Ontarians put her party back in power, she is overseeing the largest wave of school closings in Ontario’s history. They like to trot out and say how many new schools they’re building. What they don’t say, Mr. Speaker, is how many they are closing and how many communities are actually going to be ruined as a result of their ideology and willingness to not listen.", "They have just appointed a three-person panel to go out and start listening. There are already schools in many of our ridings that have closed and will never return because of their action. There are many more on the chopping block today, and if they are only going out to do a dog-and-pony show, to try to do some damage control, that is simply not acceptable.", "Two reports, as I shared this morning in question period, by People for Education and the Ontario Alliance Against School Closures, show this government is hollowing out schools across rural Ontario. Three experts who submitted a report published by Municipal World said this about the Liberal school closures—again, a third party, nothing to do with us as opposition, nothing to do with the third party: “In Ontario, the education policy is driven by the funding formula dictating that the ideal size of an elementary school is in the neighbourhood of 500 to 800 students regardless of the characteristics of the surrounding community. This one-size-fits-all approach may work well in urban settings that have the population to support it; but, it does not translate well in ... rural surroundings.” They said the formula was biased against rural Ontario.", "I have been challenging the government to fix this funding formula. In both of the elections, 2011 and 2014, that I ran in as a candidate, the government of the day came out and said, “We realize there’s a problem. We will fix this funding formula. We will do that.” They made an election promise, Mr. Speaker, and yet it has fallen on deaf ears. They have not changed one thing; in fact, they’ve removed $450 million in special funding for rural Ontario and northern Ontario out of their actual financial allocations.", "So, as I said in this morning’s question period, it is so sad: They have no money to keep schools open, but they were quick to find money to cancel two gas plants for $1.1 billion and waste $8 billion on eHealth consultants with nothing, zero, a big, big goose egg, to show for it. I hear some heckling, and that’s fine. I assume, when I ask these questions and I say it, that I get to the guilt of some of them. Those over there that are actually speaking up must know that what I’m saying is true, because otherwise, why would they have to say anything, Mr. Speaker? They are challenging it, and yet it’s a fact. They have closed more schools in their tenure of 14 years than any other government in our province’s history.", "Small business is hurting. The Liberal government has promised a reduction of hydro rates by an average of 25% under the fair hydro plan. Julie Kwiecinski of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business says that its 42,000 Ontario members are in “wait-and-see mode” with regard to its effects. Small businesses in my riding are saying that they’re left out of the Liberals’ hydro reduction schemes, including Hellyer’s food market and the Chesley Grocery Store. These are small businesses in small communities. They cannot absorb continual 40% increases in their hydro. They have the coolers and they have all of the refrigeration they have to run, as well as the lighting and all of the other things to keep their stores operational. They cannot absorb 40% increases.", "Moving in that same direction, we saw nothing in this budget—and I’m going to talk a little bit about the 25% relief program that’s coming in. The Liberals are great at coming out and saying, “We’ve got yet another relief program; we’ve got another relief program; and here’s another relief program.” Do they ever actually go back and address why they need more relief? I can’t believe they’re that proud to have the need for so many relief programs. Why would they not do something to address the exorbitant costs and 40% increases? To tell people that they’re going to give them 25% relief on the bill that they’ve created—some bills have gone up between 200% and 400%. Telling me you’re going to give me 25% just doesn’t cut it.", "Saugeen Cedars campground in my riding: Their bill went from $8,000 a year to $36,000 a year—for a seasonal campground. How do they ever recoup those types of costs from people? It’s like another tax increase from the government. They have to go back to say, “Sorry about your luck, but if you want to camp here, we’re going to jack your costs up.”", "All of that is a result of their mismanagement and incompetence. They’ve overspent every year I’ve been here. They don’t do anything about the debt. In fact, the deficit this year went up again, to $12 billion—one of the largest expenditures on their side of the House, in the government. They spent more than all of the post-secondary sector on interest payments, which do absolutely nothing to help keep our hospitals open; keep our schools open; help our seniors in long-term care with all the needs they have.", "According to the Ontario Energy Board, their hydro rates have climbed 81%, 18 cents per kilowatt hour, since November 2010. Those are those two small grocery stores. An 81% increase: How do they sustain that? Chesley Grocery Store’s global adjustment was $3,500, just for the month of March. In 2015, the Auditor General said that the global adjustment cost consumers $37 billion from 2006 to 2014, and will cost an additional $133 billion from 2015 to 2032. The report also noted that consumers will have to pay $9.2 billion more for a renewable energy project over a 20-year contract for wind, solar and biomass than under a previous plan.", "Mr. Speaker, they moved the goalposts out. They took their mortgage and said, “We’re going to extend it out a number of years,” but they don’t tell people it’s going to cost them $25 billion. These pages sitting in front of you are going to be the people, sadly, who are saddled with that debt so that they can just put it out and make it look like we’ve balanced the budget this year.", "We still struggle. What we wanted to see was hydro rate reductions. We wanted to see them talk about school closures: that they would put in a moratorium until we can go out and find solutions to keep these communities and these schools viable.", "Hospitals are in significant challenge at this point. They’ve put some money in to say, “We’ve given money back to the hospitals,” but they’ve capped them for four years. At the end of the day, if they’re not keeping up, our hospitals will be like our school closures, which they start to target across rural Ontario.", "I’ve mentioned already the $12 billion they pay in interest. That’s incredible. Think of what we could do for our schools, for our education system, for our long-term-care facilities and, more importantly, the services for those people if we had $12 billion.", "They’ve doubled the debt in their 14 years. It will soon be $312 billion—again, at a time with the lowest interest rates we’ve ever had in our province’s history. If they start to inch up even a bit, that’s more money going to interest payments as opposed to front-line care for seniors, for students, for all of the great people of this great province.", "It is not a balanced budget. There’s a $5-billion hole. They’re still overspending, and it’s simply unacceptable." ],

He attended one in Prince Edward county for the closure of a rural school. What he described in his article is exactly what is being played over and over and over in Nickel Belt. I will quote from him. He said, “I recall the constant cautionary refrain from northern and rural Ontario leaders about the one-size-fits-all solutions emanating from Queen’s Park. Indeed, equity should not mean sameness.”", "The funding formula, the way those decisions are made to close rural schools is so, so detrimental to northern and rural schools, I can’t tell you how much damage we are doing. I can talk about Naughton. Our Lady of Fatima was a beautiful school, kindergarten to grade 8. Actually, some of you will remember Rick Bartolucci. Rick Bartolucci was the principal at that school and it was packed: 400 and some students, and life was good. Our Lady of Fatima has been closed; right after that, the ice cream shop closed, then the chip stand, then the one and only community store. And now even the gas station is gone.", "What happens in rural and northern Ontario when you take the school away?

There were some people in my riding who were listening to this.

  "text" : [ "I’m glad to finally have my opportunity to speak in this fine Legislature, on behalf of the people from Oshawa, on Bill 127, which is An Act to implement Budget measures and to enact, amend and repeal various statutes.", "We’ve been talking a lot about the budget, but this particular bill is called the Stronger, Healthier Ontario Act. I’ll tell you, Speaker, I’ve said it before, but I’m always so impressed by the titles to the bills that the government offers. The Stronger, Healthier Ontario Act: There are so many wonderful things that one would expect from this bill, but, sadly, alas, many of the things you would anticipate and expect when you think of a stronger, healthier Ontario are missing. They’re absent from this bill. Anyway, we’ll get into that, because I have a full 20 minutes. I would never want to share my time, Speaker. I’m glad to have the full 20 to dedicate to this fine topic.", "One of the things I wanted to start with, when we think about a stronger, healthier Ontario—I’m a little biased. I come out of public education, so I’m going to start there. I’m going to start focusing on education in this province. We fundamentally, if you’ll pardon the pun, need to look at the funding of our education system here in the province. I think it’s a debate that we need to have as a province, and certainly as members of this Legislature, but we need to be talking about it in our communities. When we hear from the government, we hear about how “stable” and “supported” and “safe” and “flexible”—and all sorts of other fun buzzwords about public education. But when we hear from our community members, when we hear from our students, we hear a different story. So one of the things I really wish we had seen in the budget was appropriate funding for education, really looking at it holistically and putting the money where it needs to be to address a lot of the issues.", "We’ve been talking about northern and rural schools. We’ve heard a lot about school closures, and I’ll tell you that, in Oshawa, one of our only south-end high schools, Central, was unfortunately closed. Now we just have one school in the south and one high school. And you know what? I had a meeting with some of my young constituents, some grade 11 students. They scheduled an appointment—and you know the government’s in trouble when 16-year-olds are making appointments with their MPP to sit down and discuss public education funding. They came to talk to me about the realities in their world. These were university-bound students from the south end of Oshawa, which report after report suggests is a very high-needs area, with very high poverty rates, low youth employment and high rates of youth homelessness. But these were some students who were in grade 11, and they were wanting to pursue academic classes, university-bound classes, to get to university. That’s their plan.", "Unfortunately, with the cuts in funding and the realities—their enrolment is dropping, and because our funding is based on enrolment, they were faced with the reality that they wouldn’t be able to take any of those classes. Those classes wouldn’t be offered at their high school. The only high school in the south end of Oshawa was faced with the reality that they couldn’t afford to offer these courses because there weren’t enough students to fill them. We’ve been working that out, but again, it was a reality that that school in my community was faced with. I know it’s happening in northern and rural communities that don’t have the numbers.", "We talk about school closures, but what happens up and until that point? Up and until we’re faced with closing the school, we’re starving the students of those opportunities. We’re having to cut classes. I was talking to someone who said, “You know, there are schools across the province that, in all likelihood, don’t offer university-bound courses at all.” I throw that challenge out there. I’d love to hear from some of those schools because I think that’s a bigger part of the conversation that we’re not having—students who want and are seeking those opportunities. They need to be there. We as a province and we as a Legislature need to say, “Okay, we will ensure that every student has a pathway in front of them.” Every student needs to reach their full potential, whomever we’re talking about, whatever child we’re talking about, wherever they live—north of the Liberal snow fence that they like to pretend doesn’t exist, or in the GTA, or anywhere in between.", "I’m sticking with education because that’s where I feel most passionate, I would say. One thing, again, that was missing was the focus on safety. We’ve been talking about that. We’ve been talking about students being safe on the way to school: whether it’s the hour or hour-and-a-half bus rides because they’ve closed their schools; whether we’re talking about four-year-olds on the bus, to and from school—in the winter, in the dark both ways. How do we expect them to become lifelong learners and be enthusiastic when that’s the situation?", "I want to talk about other kindergarten children in my area, in Durham region. I have a letter here from a teacher who teaches kindergarten. The government speaks very proudly about all-day, full-day kindergarten. There are things to be proud of; there are things to be pleased with. But if you’re going to institute a program and not appropriately support it or re-evaluate it and make sure it is operating the way it should, then we have a problem. This teacher said:", "“I am concerned about the level of safety in my classroom. I have students on a daily basis running around and out of the room, destroying and trashing the classroom and disrupting the learning environment of my classroom. Students are getting hit, kicked, pinched, scratched, taunted because the behaviours cannot be dealt with in a timely fashion, or at all. The” special education resource teacher “is busy running around tending to emergencies or dealing with behaviours to help admin ... more time is needed observing the behaviours and conferencing with teachers to build next steps to get students support and help that they need. Administration is busy on a daily basis running around dealing with behaviour and emergencies and often there is no one to come from the office to help in all areas of need.... Incidents are not being reported because teachers are stressed, overwhelmed and many do not get ... any breaks.... It sounds terrible, I know, but there really is not enough support in order to maintain it all. Students ... are taken out of the classrooms and then later put right back in. Admin says it’s progressive discipline, but the behaviours just escalate because students are not held accountable for their actions. Teachers are telling me they are tired and they are exhausted and they are giving up ... losing hope.”", "Speaker, does this sound like a supportive learning environment to you? Does this sound like we’re putting the money where it needs to go? Because this is one of many conversations I’ve had and many letters I’ve had.", "Our local papers have done a couple of articles—and I have one here—on violence in the schools. This is from an article on April 20:", "“Violence in some Durham schools has reached a point where teachers are issued Kevlar jackets or hoodies to deal with aggressive children and classrooms are regularly evacuated or locked up when a child has a meltdown.”", "It goes on to discuss different situations, parents coming forward, children stressed and in danger. Obviously, it doesn’t have solutions, because that’s what we’re here to do. We need to talk about ways forward to protect and support our children.", "There are more comments here from the president of the local teachers’ federation of Durham. He says that they have many “reports from Durham teachers reporting violence including being bitten, kicked, punched, stomped, spit on, verbally assaulted and stabbed with objects like scissors.", "“He says many of the reports involved primary-aged children with some as young as kindergarteners.”", "Remember, we’ve got three-, four- and five-year-olds in our schools without the appropriate supports that they need to reach their full potential. We’re not doing all we can and we’re not having the right conversations.", "I’ve already brought forward two examples: (1) the 16-year-old students who just want to further their education and have a pathway in front of them; and (2) four-year-olds who are learning in an unsupported, often predictably unsafe learning environment. That’s inappropriate.", "It goes on to say—here are some stats of teachers: Of 700 teachers who responded to a survey about safety, “just 24% said that they never felt unsafe at work while 70% responded”—wait, hold on. Let me read that again.", "“Asked how often they felt unsafe at work, just 24% said never”—good—“while 70% responded sometimes and almost 6% said always.” That’s a lot of people saying that they always feel unsafe at work, any workplace—and we’re talking about our public education system; we’re talking about our classrooms.", "You know what? I’m going to move on because—well, good—I’ve spent 10 full minutes talking about safety in our schools, and I’m glad to finally give that voice because, Lord knows, the government isn’t going to bring it up and talk about it. But I will get back to some of these issues.", "I’ve had the opportunity to talk about education. I would like to pick up the actual bill itself and go through some of these. There are 33 schedules in this bill, Speaker—lots of potential for conversation, so I don’t want to waste the opportunity. Here’s one that’s brief: Schedule 12 is the Forest Fires Prevention Act. There are a couple of little changes in here. This is a really specific one, but I just thought it was worth the conversation.", "There’s a section that would expand liability and would also hold railway companies liable for forest fires that originate within 15 metres of rail line operations. Good, I would say. There are a few more specifics, but why am I mentioning that? I’m mentioning that because my colleague from Nickel Belt reminded us with a petition today, but has been relentlessly bringing this forward to the government, about the folks and community of Gogama. It was over two years ago, March 2015, that over 1.2 million litres of crude ended up in the Makami River. We have been calling on this government to push CN, to encourage them to do the cleanup. It’s their cleanup to do.", "So when I see something tucked in the budget about holding railway companies liable for forest fires that originate within 15 metres of rail line operations, I’m not arguing; that sounds like a fine plan. But how about a plan also to make them clean up the mess, encourage them to clean up the mess they have made, which two years later we’re still dealing with? Just saying, if you’re putting it in writing to hold the railway companies responsible, let’s actually hold them responsible.", "There’s schedule 23: This is an environmental section, the Oil, Gas and Salt Resources Act. Without getting too far into the polluted weeds here, this is something that, when our research team met with ministry staff and had an understanding of what the government’s intention was with this—there is no reference to obtaining free, prior and informed consent of First Nations before approving licences or permits. That was a problem. Also, the provisions of this schedule haven’t been posted on the Environmental Registry, which seems to circumvent the public’s right to participate in environmental decision-making as described in the Environmental Bill of Rights. Speaker, I couldn’t possibly imagine that the government would want to circumvent public input, so they might want to go back and make that change.", "But also, one of the changes they made—this current section 19 of the act prohibits waste from oil and gas activities that result in:", "“(i) a hazard to public safety, or", "“(ii) pollution of the natural environment....”", "So schedule 23 is similar to what is already there. However, it does not specifically prohibit pollution of the natural environment with respect to these new, as-of-yet-unidentified activities. They still have the first part in there about “a hazard to public safety” but, by design, they have taken out the second part that protects the natural environment. Why? We have some wonderful natural environment in Oshawa, and I would hate to think that it would ever be at risk because of an omission. I’m just pointing it out to them. They can always go back and change that, I’m sure.", "The Pension Benefits Act is another section, schedule 27, that the government is making some changes to. Essentially, this makes legislation that corresponds to several processes that are already under way, including an MOU signed by some of the parties to the creditor protection process. The CCAA process is winding down and we have a situation under way where the government is sort of—I won’t say this legislation mirrors that but is necessary legislation. But I have thoughts on this, and that is that if the government is going to open up the Pension Benefits Act and make any kind of useful changes, again, this is a missed opportunity. They could have, at the very least, even made changes to the Pension Benefits Guarantee Fund, or the PBGF. It was set up in 1980 to ensure that if a company goes under and a pension plan is wound up, pensioners aren’t left bearing the full brunt of that impact. As it stands now under the current system, it would cover up to $1,000 per month in lost benefit for a worker. Back in 2008, Mr. Harry Arthurs had recommended that it be increased to $2,500 instead of $1,000, and at that point, that was to make up the difference in the cost of living. Here we are now nine years later; I wonder what that number would be?", "Why I’m bringing this up is that, as schedule 27 opens up the Pension Benefits Act, couldn’t they have increased it to the cost of living, the PBGF amount? You know, it might not be the exciting story that the government would be looking for, but it is an important part of the bigger picture. My colleague from Hamilton East–Stoney Creek has brought forward a private member’s bill twice, so it’s not like this is an idea that the government hadn’t been aware of. So, again, it’s a missed opportunity at the very least.", "Schedule 33 is the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act, 1997. They went in and have made some changes, long-sought changes from our partners in labour. We support them. But this schedule excludes “mental stress caused by decisions or actions of the worker’s employer relating to the worker’s employment, including a decision to change the work to be performed or the working conditions, to discipline the worker or to terminate the employment.” So this change addresses chronic or traumatic mental stress arising out of and in the course of the worker’s employment, but—here’s that asterisk—not under these circumstances. Well, either you care or you don’t; either you cover them or you don’t. Again, this entitlement is being limited, and I would say needlessly.", "We used to have a compensation system—this was the great compromise, right?—such that if a worker was injured, that there would be fair compensation. And that’s so far from where we have landed, because now we have bits and parts. We have a system now that is not about compensation; it’s begging for scraps and it is a system without dignity anymore. We as a province need to say, “Do we care about looking after those who are injured, maimed, hurt or made ill on the job? Yes or no?” And if the answer is that, yes, we do care, then we have to put our money where our mouth is. We have to actually make this system accessible to them and support them.", "Oh, good, I still have two and a half minutes.", "One of the other things I’d like to share, because we’ve been talking a lot about health care, about pharmacare—well, actually, that’s not entirely true. On this side of the House, we’ve been talking about universal pharmacare. On that side of the House, they’ve been talking about junior drug plans. Covering our youth is important, absolutely, but so is covering their parents.", "When you talk about the cliff that is turning 25—think about milestones. It’s interesting now to imagine the landscape. When you think about a child now growing up, when they’re 16, they think about driving; at 18, voting; at 19, maybe, should they be so inclined, legally drinking; at 21, visiting the States and doing the same. Then, when they hit 25, losing their drug coverage—what a thing to look forward to, and disappointing.", "I’m going to read a letter that I got from a woman in my community. She said, “I’m a 32-year-old Ontarian, born and raised. I earn less than $24,000 a year. I am in a job that does not offer any type of benefit plan, and when paying for rent, car, phone, grocery and student debt, you can only imagine there is nothing left for extras. When I heard of the pharmacy care plan for people under 25 I was, well”—I’m going to change her word to make it parliamentary; ticked “off. I have asthma, IBS, anxiety and depression, GERD, and have just been diagnosed with a heart problem as well. So you may ask how I afford the medications I need. The ... answer is I can’t. When Ontarians are putting prescription medication on their credit cards, we have a big problem. Where is the help for people like me, when a puffer can cost $50 to refill? I’m paying $50 to breathe! It’s disgusting. I have to ask for samples when I go to the clinic. I have to ration out some of my meds for when I’m feeling really bad. Tell me how that makes Ontario great? You will charge me interest on a student loan, a loan that I had to take out so that I can hopefully get a better paying job, but I’ll be too sick to go to work.”", "You know what? That kind of sums it up. It’s a shame that someone like that won’t have access to this government’s junior drug plan. But under a universal—which means “everybody in”—pharmacare plan, she and everybody else absolutely would. I think that’s not only the conversation that we need to have but that’s the plan that we need to move forward with.", "With that, I’m out of time. Thank you, Speaker." ],

But I have to point out that I disagree with her on what she said, particularly near the tail end of her remarks, around the pharmacare program.", "We’ve done a number of things to help people in the circumstances of the constituent that she was referring to. For example, now it’s going to be 210,000 students who are going to benefit from the new OSAP, so 210,000 students will get free tuition across Ontario. But also, those students who have OSAP loans currently now no longer—you used to have to pay them back when you had $25,000 in income. We’ve now increased that to $35,000 in income. So that will provide tremendous relief, on their costs of living, to people who are in the circumstances that the member opposite was talking about.", "The other thing to talk about with regard to pharmacare is that this OHIP+ plan is very exciting because it doesn’t just help those young people who are under 25. Of course, it directly helps them because their prescription drugs will be covered, but it also helps their families because, ultimately, in most of those cases, the pharmaceuticals, the prescription drugs, are paid for by the parents of the young person. So this is something that really helps everybody, but it obviously very substantially helps the young person who’s in that situation.", "I understand the NDP would prefer to have a plan that has 125 drugs covered—versus the 4,400 that we’ve tried to focus on—that would cover people across all ages, but a little bit. We’ve really focused on young people so that they can get the best start in life, so they can pursue that education that the member was talking about. We also are helping them with their cost of living so they can pursue the quality of life that they deserve." ],

With this budget, I’m not certain that there were extras, because I’m not certain they are actually even providing many of the essentials that we need out here.", "The member from Etobicoke Centre just talked about free tuition. If we didn’t have a $12-billion deficit that they’re paying interest on, how many people would truly get free tuition? If they balanced, why are they still going to close 300 schools? Why did they not change the funding formula, which they promised in two elections?", "At the end of the day most people in any riding say, “I want the government to come out and say what they are going to do, to make commitments, but follow through.” They said they would change the funding formula in two elections, and they have failed to do that. They have not even attempted to do anything with that.", "If they truly balanced the budget and have no concerns with what they’re doing, why will they not reinstate the actual community impact component, going forward, in any other ARC reviews, which we’ve asked them for over and over and over? Many of the schools in ridings like Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound are single-community schools, where they are devastating a community because they are not consolidating schools; they’re taking the only school out, which decimates that community.", "If they have a balanced budget, why were there no dollars allotted to long-term-care beds when they know that there are 26,500 people on a waiting list? Why are there no new beds, Mr. Speaker? They keep talking about redevelopment; that’s not helping the 26,500 people sitting on a wait-list.", "If they had balanced, where is this $5 billion coming from next year? Will they come out and tell us today where the $5 billion is next year, when Hydro One sales are gone and the sales of OPG and LCBO are gone and they can’t use pension assets, which the Auditor General said?", "Mr. Speaker, we still have significant challenges with a budget like this that will not be able to continue to support." ],

When teachers feel at risk, when teachers feel threatened, nothing good comes of this. Everybody deserves a safe workplace. That includes nurses, I will say on this nurses’ week, but it also includes every worker, which includes all of our teachers.", "She talked about what happened in Gogama two years ago. On March 7, a CP train derailed. It fell into the Makami River and spilled 1.2 million litres of crude. That year, in 2015, CN was there at the site and they cleaned up as best they could, till winter came and four feet of ice came over the river and they couldn’t do anything. The next spring, the spring of 2016, as soon as the ice came off the river, there was oil everywhere. You could see it, you could smell it—it was everywhere. It took us seven months to convince the government to tell CN to come and continue the cleanup. This doesn’t cost the government anything. It is CN that made the mess. It is CN that needs to clean up the mess. But it took seven months to convince the government that this was the right thing to do.", "So when we read in the budget that they are going to hold train companies accountable for fires that the railway track causes, allow me to be a bit skeptical about this, because I have seen what a train derailment looks like, and I have seen our government missing in action to get the cleanup." ],

The member comes from the education field, as I do. I was really pleased to see a very significant increase in funding, both in terms of capital and operating, contained in this budget. One of the criticisms that we get, particularly from the right wing, is, “Well, there are fewer students in the system, so why are you spending, on a continuing basis, more money in education?” I think the member, having been in education more recently than I, recognizes that because there are significant changes that have evolved over the years in education, the kind of targeted spending and increased spending that we see is justified.", "I can also talk a bit about the difference between being in opposition and government, because I spent longer in opposition than I did in government. I remember, for instance, the NDP in Saskatchewan. They had a pretty good government. Roy Romanow was a great person. Dr. Janice MacKinnon was Minister of Finance. I read her book, Minding the Public Purse. She talked about when they had to close 52 hospitals in the province of Saskatchewan. They didn’t do it to be mean.

It was a line from a letter I received that I used the term “extras.” They were saying that with “rent, car, phone, grocery, and student debt, you can only imagine that there is nothing left for extras.” I did not say that there were fun things to find in the budget that were extra.", "But also, I wanted to say to the member from Etobicoke Centre talking about those youth under 25, that this junior drug plan the government is proposing will somehow help their parents, who, as likely as not, would be paying for those drugs otherwise—that’s interesting. I think it would also be a help to their parents if we would cover their pharmacare needs but also if we would talk about affordable housing options so that their under-25-year-olds could—I don’t know—do something crazy like make plans to move out or to find an apartment, if we had inventory of low-income housing, if there were any options when it came to buying a first home, other than just pipe dreams. So if we’re going to talk about helping families and helping those youth, let’s have that conversation, but let’s make it a real one.", "Then, to the member from St. Catharines, I got a little tangled in what you were saying about what was justified when it came to targeted spending and under-enrolment. I’m not necessarily arguing what you said: I just didn’t quite follow. My point was that in the last high school in south Oshawa that remains open, there’s under-enrolment and therefore now not enough funding to even cover these university-bound courses. So we’re shifting and moving things and making creative solutions that are not sustainable. These are children who deserve pathways, and that should be our priority." ],

  "text" : [ "I’m very honoured to stand here today and speak on Bill 127, which is the implementation bill for the budget that the government introduced, which helps us to build a stronger and healthier Ontario.", "I speak today in the role that is the most important to me, and that is to represent the community of Ottawa Centre. As their member of provincial Parliament, it’s my honour to serve in this Legislature and to speak about things that are important to my community every single day.", "In simple words, I am supporting this budget because it speaks to things that are important to my community of Ottawa Centre. It speaks to things that I hear from my constituents when I go to their doors every weekend, as I just did this past Saturday, and ask them what’s important to them.", "Time and time again, my constituents tell me that they want their government to invest in things that are essential to them. What are those things? Our health care system, our education system, our infrastructure that particularly helps public transit: Those are the things that my community in Ottawa Centre are very keen on. As I pore through this budget document, which I have done, I see a strong emphasis on investments in our health care system, investments in education for our children and investments in infrastructure such as public transit.", "There are many references to things that are happening in Ottawa and things that will be coming for Ottawa which are exciting to me personally, but are also endorsed by my constituents who live in the great community of Ottawa Centre.", "I will start first with the balanced budget. I can tell you, Speaker, as I canvassed in my riding, as I did in the last election, one of the things that I did hear from my constituents on a regular basis was that they do want the provincial government to balance its books. They recognized that a deficit had to be incurred, that money had to be borrowed, because of the great recession. There was clear recognition and continues to be the recognition in my community that we had to borrow money because of the devastating impact of the great recession, the largest recession since the Great Depression in the 1930s. Government had to be proactive in terms of stimulating the economy, and they supported that borrowing to stimulate economies, to be investing in our schools and our hospitals, in our community centres and our public transit, which resulted in the creation of hundreds of thousands of jobs across the province. In my city of Ottawa alone, that borrowing resulted in not only keeping our hospitals and our schools operating—in fact, growing—but also significant investments in our community centres like in Hintonburg, where we renovated the entire basement of the community centre and made more spaces available; as we did in rehabilitating Hintonburg Park—I was just there last weekend for the Happening festival in Ottawa; that park has become a huge hub for the community to come together—and as we did by investing in building two new buildings, the River Building and the Canal Building, at Carleton University, which is located in Ottawa Centre and which I know, Speaker, your two sons attend as well. It’s a fine, fine institution. Those two buildings are just marquee buildings that were built as a result of that seamless funding, creating better learning spaces for our young people.", "I can go on with the list of investments we made, but what it resulted in was not only creating better places to live and to learn in my community of Ottawa Centre, but also it helped stimulate our economy. When I talk with many friends that I have in the building trades, they are thankful for those investments because they kept them in business and made sure that they had a good livelihood that they were able to then reinvest in our economy, and not only them, but other professionals and other service providers in our economy as well.", "The negative effect of that borrowing to stimulate the economy so that we can come out of the great recession is that we had a fairly significant deficit, a deficit of over $19 billion. The government said some time ago that we will balance our books by 2017-18, but we’re going to do so in a prudent way. We’re going to do it in a manner that does not impact the key things that are important to our communities: health care and education.", "By sheer hard work and that commitment we made to Ontarians and that we articulated in the last provincial election, I’m very happy and proud that we are at that moment where we are able to balance our budget. We are able to balance the budget because we made prudent decisions in terms of growing our economy. We made prudent decisions in terms of the services we provide by keeping our focus on things that are important to people, like health care and education.", "Also, that investment resulted in the economy growing, which is paying dividends, because we have more people working now, more people are paying taxes and there is more investment that is taking place in Ontario. This province is an amazing destination to invest in and to do business in. We’re seeing the result of all that in this great economy that is growing, that is outpacing the G7 countries and outpacing other provinces in Canada.", "I’m happy that my constituents kept my feet to the fire in making sure that we do balance the budget. I am really proud to report back to my constituents in Ottawa Centre that we have accomplished that task. We have achieved that task and we see a path where the balance will remain for the next few years to come.", "Let me move on to issues that are important and that I’ll highlight. I’ll start with investments in health care, which are extremely important, because at the end of the day, no matter who you speak to—a young family or a retired senior or anybody in between—they will tell you that their number one priority is good delivery of health care. They want to make sure that the health care system is there when they need it.", "We can have political differences on what we think about various initiatives in this budget, but I think in our hearts we’ll all agree that the introduction of OHIP+ pharmacare—a universal pharmacare program for our children and youth aged under 25 for all drugs that are available as part of OHIP—is a game-changer. You may think that this does not go far enough or you may think that it’s gone too far. The fact of the matter is, in all frankness, this is a game-changer. We have never had this, Speaker. This is a significant step in protecting and providing universal health care in a true fashion for the most vulnerable in our society, and that is our children and our youth. By covering all kids from zero to 25 and under, in terms of all medication, is a very significant step. It’s a step that we’ve announced and we will be taking starting January 1 that has caught the attention of the entire country, not just in Ontario. Coast to coast to coast, including the federal government, everybody’s talking about it.", "As I am out in my community, since the budget was announced, this is one thing where people have come up to me and said, “Bravo. Well done, this was needed, this is important. I hope this is the beginning of ensuring that we truly have universal health care and universal pharmacare.” My response to them is, absolutely.", "You know what? We wanted to start somewhere. You can talk about it and you can put a grand vision out, which is important, but we wanted to take a practical step and we have taken that step. We decided that our priority is going to be children and youth to start with, and hopefully by working with other partners in this Legislature and by working with federal government, we may be able to expand it to everyone. But let’s start somewhere. The fact that we are doing the OHIP+ pharmacare is remarkable. Maybe I’m speaking as a parent of two very young children. I am quite excited about it, and I continue to hear positive feedback.", "People ask me, is it really true that it will be available January 1, 2018? Absolutely. Is it really true that there’s going to be no hidden costs? Absolutely. Is it really true that there are going to be no copayments or no deductibles? Absolutely true.", "In fact, some of the smaller businesses who look after their employees and have health insurance plans have come to me. They’re excited because they see some savings coming their way, because now they would have to pay, hopefully, fewer premiums as a result. The benefit goes on and on. In many instances, in fact, some small businesses told me they don’t cover everything in the health plans for their employees’ children, or there is a significant deductible. That assists their workforce and it makes their workforce even that much stronger and healthier, to be able to help build our economy.", "The other important aspect from my view is investment in our hospitals. I was with my colleagues from Ottawa at the Ottawa heart institute, which is located in my riding of Ottawa Centre, announcing that we will be investing $35.9 million per year for our Ottawa hospitals—the Ottawa hospital, the heart institute and Bruyère continuing care, which is also located in my riding. We have the Hôpital Montfort, we have CHEO, the Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario, and we have Queensway Carleton Hospital. All those partners were present. They see this investment as a very important investment. Anywhere from 2% or 3% increased funding in the base operating funds will result in them reducing their wait-lists and being able to provide improved services to our residents in Ottawa, a very important aspect of this.", "I’ve also heard from my community health sector side. I got an e-mail both from the executive director of the Centretown Community Health Centre, Simone Thibault, and the executive director of the Somerset West Community Health Centre, Naini Cloutier. Both of these community health centres are located in my riding, both are saying bravo on OHIP+ pharmacare, on investments that we have for the community health sector and for allied workers that will see an increase in compensation. They both wrote unsolicited emails to me saying that the government is taking the right direction. I want to thank them for the great work they do, along with their staff in providing essential important services to our constituents.", "I want to move towards education again, a very important aspect of building our economy and making sure that our children have the base, the great foundation in place. We are very lucky to live in Ontario, where we have one of the best education systems in the world, and I will make that claim because that claim is true. Every ranking we see around the world—PISA comes to mind—continues to demonstrate how well we do in Ontario. I think we should be excited about that: We compete on a global scale when it comes to our public education system.", "We have a great foundation to continue to build from, from kindergarten all the way to PhD, because our greatest asset, our natural resource in this province—and I’ve said this before—is our talent, is our people. The best way to nourish that and to build that is to invest in our education.", "When I see that in our school system we are investing an additional $1 billion, almost $1 billion to base funding for our schools, even though enrolment numbers are down, it’s heartwarming. For the first time, per pupil funding has now topped $12,000 per pupil. How incredible is that, Speaker? I see my five-year-old son, Rafi, who goes to junior kindergarten. The kind of care and education he is getting and the excitement that I see in him—he goes to a local school, St. Augustine—is just amazing. I’m just one parent. I was just with him at the muffin breakfast party at the school last Friday, and all parents were just absolutely thrilled with the kind of education they’re getting in our education system.", "I’m really excited that we are capping full-day kindergarten. Maybe I’m a little selfish because my son is in full-day kindergarten. I think that is a very important move. The fact that we’ll be capping enrolment for grades 4 to 8 is a very progressive move. We will continue to make these very important investments that matter to parents, that matter to our children.", "I can go on and on about child care and the investments in building new child care: 24,000 spaces just this year across the province. Many of them are going to be in Ottawa. Making sure that those places are accessible and affordable by way of subsidies is also just an incredible investment. That speaks to the theme of building a stronger, healthier Ontario. It really speaks to how we’re investing where it matters the most, which is our children and our youth.", "We’re seeing a similar investment in our post-secondary institutions. I think that one cannot undermine the new OSAP and what it really means when it comes to giving an opportunity for young people who come from a low-income background. They should have the same opportunity to succeed. There should be no discrimination in our system whatsoever. Just because you come from a well-to-do family, yes, you get to go to university or college, but if you come from low income, sorry, you may be able to do well, but because you can’t pay, you can’t afford that. Well, Speaker, that’s not the kind of society that we have signed on to.", "If you look at reports like the poverty reduction report or the Pascal report on full-day learning or if you look at the roots of violence report that was done, it all talks about breaking the cycle of poverty. It focuses so much on initiatives that governments can take to say that those who are poor should not be subjected to poverty, that we need to ensure that we break that cycle. There is no better way to break the cycle of poverty than by investing in education, by creating a level playing field and giving that opportunity to those kids who come from low-income families and to say, “You know what? You can go to school as well. You can go to college or university as well and get the same education and be the first one in your family to do so and build a better life.” We know: Study after study has shown that when one child goes to post-secondary education, to college or university, most likely, their children will do the same thing. You start turning their fate.", "So that’s what we’re doing with the new OSAP. We are creating that exact opportunity. I think it’s exciting. I continue to meet with people like Cheryl Jensen, who’s the president of Algonquin College, and she keeps telling me how exciting this is; or my president, Dr. Roseann O’Reilly Runte at Carleton University, who will be leaving Carleton soon to go to another exciting job, and we wish her the best of luck in that—how exciting that proposition is.", "I actually had a meeting with a child and youth counsellor from CHEO, Gilles Charron, and we were talking about the kind of services provided. We started talking about this change. He said, “I knew a little bit about it, but not in detail.” Right away, he started identifying students that he knows, or young people he is working with, who are just starting to make changes from homelessness and from some mental health issues or addiction issues they’ve been dealing with, and they can take a course or two at Algonquin or La Cité or maybe at Carleton University or University of Ottawa—but they may not be able to afford to do so. He says that this is the kind of thing that, through the OHIP program, they will be able to do. Imagine, Speaker, the opportunity that we can give to those young people, which is part of this budget and a commitment from this government that will be available starting this September.", "Speaker, the last thing I want to talk about—and there’s so much that I can discuss—is investment in our infrastructure, be it building new hospitals, hospitals like we’re doing by building a whole new extension, over $200 million, to the University of Ottawa Heart Institute, which is a global institution. It does incredible research and provides the most incredible cardiac care. That construction of a new tower is ongoing, and it should actually be open by April 2018, as I was just recently informed. That’s a brand new surgery room, state-of-the-art, that is amazing, not only for Ottawa, but all the surrounding communities in Ottawa, the valley, the eastern part of Ontario. Those are important services.", "Or, as we saw in education—investments in building a brand new school, the Broadview Public School in my community of Westboro, a beautiful new school. It replaced an old school from 1927 in a downtown urban community. You can see the vibrancy that has come back in that school and the programming that they are offering in that school.", "Those are important infrastructure investments, and we see once again a very strong commitment on the part of the provincial government as part of this stronger, healthier Ontario budget—a balanced budget, Speaker—that will continue with those important investments.", "The one investment that is close to my heart is investment in our light rail system in Ottawa. We know that the Confederation Line is on time and on budget, Speaker. The province invested $600 million. It builds the spine right in my community of Ottawa Centre, to the downtown core. It has a subway part in the downtown core. But the government has also committed—and it’s referenced in this budget, which I fully endorse—an investment of over a billion dollars in the second phase of the LRT, as well, that will go further east, all the way to Trim Road in Ottawa–Orléans, further south to the Ottawa airport in Ottawa South, and further south in Nepean–Carleton and then west in Ottawa West–Nepean. We really start to see an incredible LRT system. The Ontario government has committed over a billion dollars for that important infrastructure, because not only will it help create jobs, but it really links our city to our universities, to our colleges, to our downtown, to the new Innovation Centre in which the province invested $15 million, from our airport to the downtown. You really start to see how that’s not only going to improve our quality of life but also going to enhance our economy.", "Speaker, this budget, from my perspective, is a good budget. It’s a good budget for Ottawa. I will be supporting this for all the reasons I just outlined, and I hope other members do the same." ],

They are addicted to running debts; it’s a real addiction. It’s too bad that there wasn’t a pill in this new drug program they’ve brought out that they could take to make them stop running these debts, because it’s going to have to be paid back sometime. It’s going to have to happen. You’re spending almost $12 billion a year to service this debt, and yet you keep increasing it all the time.", "Don’t believe me when I say that this is a false balanced budget; it’s my constituents who are telling me this. I think I told you this story, about going to the Legion for lunch the other day, and they’re saying, “What is this government trying to pull over our heads? We don’t believe it at all.

I am curious to see: How do they intend to make sure that that $450 million doesn’t go directly into the pockets of those insurance companies?

  "text" : [ "It’s been an interesting afternoon so far with the back and forth that’s been going on between the government and the members of the opposition and the third party. There have been a number of things said that, I suppose, depending on what side of the House you’re sitting on, you can believe or disbelieve, but I think that when we get down to really thinking about what’s proposed in this budget, when I get the ordinary person in Perth–Wellington, who just wants to live a good life—whether they’re starting a new job, a family or retiring—coming up to me and they see in the paper or they hear on the news about this budget—the newspaper reporters and radio reporters are all saying the same thing, that this government is hiding a $5-billion operational deficit in this budget. I don’t have to start the conversation. In fact, I like to go out on weekends into the riding to different events and not talk politics. I like to go to festivals, like one I was at on Saturday, of the Teutonic choirs in Ontario. These are people who sing in German. They sing classical music, hymns and all kinds of songs. It was great. It was a two-hour performance. We had five choirs performing, and it was something that was just absolutely beautiful.", "They showed me to my seat, and they had my name on the back of the seat. Before I got there, right away this lady came up to me and started into, “What’s this government trying to pull on us now?” That’s what she said: “What’s this government trying to pull on us now?” I said, “Ma’am, maybe we can speak about this later, after the performance.” But she was that upset, she kept on and on with it. This is what bothers people so much in this province. They get upset. Maybe at events such as this, they shouldn’t be talking about politics or anything of that nature, because we’re here to listen to a performance by these choirs, but they’re that upset at what has been going on with this government for this many years. That’s happening all over the province.", "I went to the Listowel home and garden show on Sunday morning. The place was packed with great exhibits—furniture exhibits, lawnmower exhibits. It was just packed in the arena. It was the same thing. People were coming to me, saying, “What is going on here? It’s just unbelievable. What’s this government trying to fool us with again?” They were so dead set against selling Hydro One—some 80% of the people in this province are against selling Hydro One—which nobody knew they were going to do because it certainly wasn’t brought up at the last election, and they went and did it anyway. They had to do that. They had to sell assets because they didn’t have the money to pay for what they were trying to pay for.", "Certainly, the revenue coming from the cap-and-trade tax has to be dumped into this to achieve what they call a balanced budget. As far as I knew, I thought that was supposed to go for infrastructure funding, but now they have to use a portion of it to pay down their deficit, to reach a balanced budget. Then, fortunately, they have a friend in the federal government, Mr. Trudeau: “Let’s help Ontario out.” Are they going to do that again next year? I doubt it. As we’ve seen, the federal government is running quite a deficit this year, so they’re going to have their own issues next year when they bring out their budget.", "Then people say, “They claim they have a balanced budget by doing all these things,” but also what the newspapers are reporting and the reporters around my area are saying, is “But the debt is going up by another $8 billion again this year”—I think that’s the figure. “Well, how come the deficit is being balanced and they can’t get control of the debt?” Because it’s doing this. What they don’t realize is that there’s almost a billion dollars a month going out to service our debt. That billion dollars could go a long way to health care—that would be great—or our education system. In fact, we spend more in paying for our debt servicing than we do for education. That’s scary.

But they’ve been caught certainly this time.", "Like I say, I go to events on the weekend like the lawn and garden show; I go to the choir on Saturday. I went to a public speaking that was put on by the Legion on Saturday—quite an entertaining show. They had young folks there, up to the grade 8 level, putting on very good speeches. Then I went to the Shriners’ event in Stratford that was held at the Rotary Complex, which is quite a big complex they built in Stratford a number of years ago. They feed—I don’t know—1,400 people there, I think the figures were. A chicken barbeque, excellent, and guess what? Same story: I walk in, I buy my tickets. I go over there and it’s the same thing: “What are they trying to do to us now?” It’s too bad that’s what has come through this so-called balanced budget.", "As I said, the debt is projected—I thought it was $308 billion. It’s supposed to increase to $312 billion, which is 24% more than what it was five years ago. The debt is supposed to go up another 8% in two years, to $336 billion. So as I said, I wish they could get off their addiction to debt. You’re passing on a terrible load to our children and grandchildren as we look down the road. I think it stands at about $22,000 of debt load right now to our children and every person who lives in Ontario. A $22,000 debt; it’s incredible. But of course, they don’t care about that, obviously, because they keep increasing the debt all the time. There is nothing over on the government side that says, “We care about the debt in this province,” because they just keep raising it all the time.", "The budget is certainly a patchwork attempt to fix the mess they have created, and if they keep getting re-elected all the time, they’ll keep going back to their old ways, raising your taxes, which they’ve done this time with the cap-and-trade tax, which is exactly what it is. They’ve raised your taxes." ],

We look at the electricity scheme in this province, the Green Energy Act especially, which has been nothing but a failure except for those who invest in wind turbines and solar projects. It locks taxpayers into 20-year contracts for overpriced wind and solar power.", "It’s also energy we don’t need. Since 2009, Ontario has given away $6 billion in surplus energy to the United States—$6 billion. I think of a friend of mine in Milverton. I brought that story to the House, too. It’s a great reminder of the mismanagement of the hydro system that has cost this man quite a bit of money. He’s a grocery store owner in Milverton who actually got money from Hydro One to help him refurbish his store with LED lights. He also went and improved his cooling system in his freezers and his refrigeration system, doing all the right things in order to lower his cost of hydro. What happened, Speaker? You might remember this: His hydro bill went up 30% after he did all this, after Hydro One gave him money to help with fixing up his store to use less power. But the problem was that he was using less power now, so it put him in a different bracket, a different category, and his delivery rate went up 30%. Does this make any sense? In fact, Mr. Carter said, “How can this government justify anything so stupid as this?” That was what he said.", "We have had different stories. I have another: a hotel owner who went through the same thing. He improved his hotel, reinsulated it, put in new windows and doors, new lights. His costs went up.", "The mismanagement of our hydro system has just been incredible in this province for the last number of years. We have asked to stop signing contracts under the Green Energy Act. This government is still doing that. We cannot continue to sign up for these contracts. We don’t need the power.", "You may know, Speaker, that currently we are spilling water over Niagara Falls. That is, pure and simple, the best green energy we have. Yet this government claims that wind and solar are the green option. Since 2015, this government has spilled or abandoned three billion kilowatt hours of energy from water power facilities that Ontario bought and paid for decades ago, because of these 20-year contracts they sign at high rates, which has certainly raised the cost of our electricity in this province.", "Then we find out that the Liberals are so out of touch on spending, they spent nearly $1 million on partisan advertising to spin their plan—almost $1 million. It also looks like they’re going to approve $4.5 million of executive salaries to one person at Hydro One—$4.5 million to one person, Speaker. As I said before, they’re continuing to sign contracts and they’re continuing to sell surplus electricity to other jurisdictions at a loss.", "The government also says that they have a plan to help increase the supply of housing. In fact, their budget shows that they’re reducing supply. The budget shows housing construction starts are projected to go down next year by almost 10%, or 6,500 housing construction starts. At the time same, they’re cashing in huge because of higher housing resale prices and they’re collecting more on the land transfer tax than ever before.", "We’ve all been listening to the crisis in Toronto and the GTA with people not being able to buy houses or afford what houses are being listed for, but that’s coming out to our area too. It’s coming out to the Stratford area certainly. Housing prices have gone up—certainly not as dramatically as they have here in Toronto and the GTA, but it’s filtering out our way. People are willing to drive farther to work in order to have a house of their own, so they’re coming out our way for that.", "But, again, we’re in the same position that’s happening down here. It’s difficult to accommodate everyone who is looking for a new house, even out in our part of the country, because of the wave that’s coming out. Yet this government is in the position of being able to collect more land transfer taxes because of the higher housing resale prices that we see.", "I have just over a minute to continue. We’re pleased, certainly, that the Liberals are following our call for more investments in graduating students for the jobs of tomorrow, but this government, for over 14 years, has failed to address the skills gap. Right now, we are graduating students for jobs that don’t exist. This needs urgent action.", "Speaker, I’m very fortunate that my three boys have gotten good jobs, but they chose to go into the trades a number of years ago. The companies that they work for are looking for people to work for them, but they can’t find any. As has been brought up here before, we graduated a couple of thousand more teachers than we needed in the province because of this government’s misguided programs.", "I want to thank you, Speaker, for the time.

As a result, the province’s public finances are in significantly worse condition than the American state of California, once the poster child for weak public finances....", "“This rapid increase in debt is problematic for several reasons. First, it represents a burden that will be passed along to future generations.... It also means more money must be spent servicing debt which makes it unavailable for other purposes such as” reducing taxes, “health care, or education.”", "I’m going to close by saying we need to rein in the cost of government here in the province.

  "text" : [ "It’s a pleasure to join the debate here this afternoon on Bill 127, the budget measures act.", "I’m going to be focusing on a couple of schedules contained within the budget bill as they relate to current issues that we’re facing in Kitchener–Waterloo and the province as a whole, and drawing, of course, the comparisons that the measures that are contained within the bill do not meet the needs of the people of this province. As we will be maintaining consistently, this budget does not undo 14 years of serious damage that the Liberal government has done to this province.", "I’m going to get right into this because this is a very current issue. Schedule 13 deals with the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, and schedule 20 the Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act. The reason that I’m raising this issue is because we discovered last Thursday in Kitchener–Waterloo that there had been a serious privacy breach with ServiceOntario that actually involved the personal information of as many as 5,600 people in Ontario being mailed to strangers after a printing mistake on health card renewal notices. The Ministry of Government and Consumer Services said Wednesday that they were still trying to determine the exact number of people affected and that they are still investigating what caused the error. The main point is that they do not know.", "The release of personal, private information: Be it medical information, be it financial information, this is a government that has consistently had issues with maintaining the integrity of that information over the last 14 years. Some of it does go back to the way that this government seeks out or does an RFP process for contracting out of public services. We will maintain that the contracting out of public services to for-profit companies, who have private interests, who have profiting interests, often undermines the services that we rely on and that Ontarians that we are elected to serve rely on. Certainly that is a concern as it relates to this issue.", "This story just broke on Thursday, and it says, “At least two Waterloo region families are left wondering who has their personal information after receiving health card renewal notices with someone else’s details.”", "This is Darrell May, one of the constituents from K-W. He says, “It’s kind of important the government protects that information.” It’s kind of important, right?", "“His eight-year-old twin daughters have a birthday in July, and recently a renewal form came in the mail for both of them. One was fine. The other contained a shock.", "“On the front of the form that’s visible through the envelope was his daughter’s name and address. On the back was the full name, address, date of birth, and health number of a young girl in Brantford. Both shared the same birthday, although a different year.", "“‘It was another person’s typed in with the wrong health card number,’ May said of the information on the form.", "“Now he’s worried”—as you would be—“who may have received his daughter’s information, and what they could do with it. His other daughter’s form also included her birth certificate number.", "“‘Obviously there’s some problem with the system,’ May said.”", "This would be an understatement. But it isn’t all that shocking, actually, based on the record of this government.", "“A New Hamburg father also contacted the Record to say his daughter’s renewal notice came with another young girl’s details, also from a different city with a birthday that was a few days different.” So there’s no rhyme or reason here.", "“He said when he contacted ServiceOntario immediately after opening the letter, the two people he spoke to there did not seem overly concerned about the privacy breach. He was told a fixed version would be mailed, and he was asked to send back the incorrect form.” So he was left to deal with the problem himself.", "“Both fathers wondered how widespread the problem is and how many other people’s personal information was sent to the wrong address.", "“‘I just thought people should know. They should be held accountable,’ May said. ‘It applies to the whole province of Ontario, not just the city.’", "“The ministry said it will send an apology to all those affected, and ask they return the letters they received in the included prepaid envelopes.", "It also notified, as it should, “the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Ontario about the ... privacy breach.”", "I have to say: That’s a pretty nonchalant response to a serious privacy breach. This is a breach of trust. So the question remains: Was it a system error? Was it a human error? Why doesn’t the minister responsible for consumer protection know? Why can’t she even identify what kind of a problem it was? Why can’t she identify how many people are directly affected, and what measures are going to be put into place to actually protect the people who now have the personal information of children, Mr. Speaker?", "I read, with great interest, schedule 13 of the bill. I have to say that there are several other breaches that have happened across the province of late. This is a government that talks a lot about accountability, about transparency and about governance, and yet we have these continued issues where the personal information of the people we serve is shared in an irresponsible manner. It is unacceptable.", "I did receive a response from the minister this morning. I asked her for an update, and she said, “Well, that’s it. That’s the letter.” The letter says that they’re very concerned, there is an issue and that the privacy commissioner will be investigating.", "Once again, I want to say thank you to the independent officers of this Legislature for the work that they’re doing because I feel that there will be some trust in the investigation that that privacy commissioner does with regard to this issue.", "The other schedule that grabbed my attention is schedule 24, which is the Ontario Drug Benefit Act. This allows the government to reduce payments to pharmacies for dispensing drugs through the Ontario Drug Benefit. You will know that this is the seventh drug plan that the government has brought in. It has some limitations, but it does provide drug coverage for those under the age of 25. It is not a universal plan. When the minister was asked on budget day why the line was drawn at 25, the government could give no good reason, no rationale, why this plan is designed as it is.", "If you have asthma and you are 24 years old, as of January you will have access to some medication free of cost. That’s a good thing, but you will still have asthma when you turn 25 and then you don’t have access to that medication." ],

  "text" : [ "Asthma is a very serious issue; no doubt about it.", "I will say that as I was knocking on doors on Friday in Waterloo, some new buildings that are there, some condos, I had our petition and I was explaining the difference between this plan, this seventh drug plan that the government has brought in, OHIP+, I think they might be calling it, and the pharmacare plan that we think is genuinely in the best interests of the people of this province. I think that one of the major issues that people fundamentally understand is that this plan, the Liberal plan, will give access to drug coverage to a group that will not use that drug coverage as often as those who are 25 to 65. The workers I was speaking with on Friday have recognized that in their own life, in the lives of their children and some of them their grandchildren, the nature of work is changing desperately in the province of Ontario to have more part-time, precarious contract work. Because that work is of that nature, the averages of actually having a drug plan within those part-time, precarious contract jobs are almost nil. There’s a reason why some employers want precarious part-time work: because they don’t want to pay the benefits. They don’t want to pay into a pension. You can do that if you have two split shifts with a worker, with two hours in the morning and three hours in the afternoon. There’s no responsibility on the part of the employer to honour a true commitment in a collegial and responsible manner.", "My goal was knocking on doors. I, quite honestly, enjoy knocking on doors between elections because I basically get to say, “I’m your MPP. I work for you. This is an idea that I feel strongly about, that our leader, Andrea Horwath, feels strongly about, because we feel that if the province of Ontario, embraces a true pharmacare program, this will force the Prime Minister to follow through on a promise of a national pharmacare plan.”", "You have to start somewhere. But it has to be a pharmacare plan in order to inspire pharmacare leadership. I feel strongly about that. I was really pleased that people were receptive to starting the petitions.", "One of the biggest differences between the government’s OHIP+ and our pharmacare plan is that you have greater bargaining power, Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the 14 million people who will require a drug program. The Ontario provincial drug plan would be negotiating on behalf of a demographic, on behalf of a huge number of potential clients, to secure a reduced price on those drugs.", "Ontario has some of the highest drug costs in Canada. There is absolutely no reason for some of these drugs to be so cost-prohibitive when the research out there shows that this province could be leveraging their ability to negotiate for lower-cost drugs. The Liberal OHIP+ would—the government would only have approximately eight million, who are current ODB beneficiaries, plus children and youth. Ours would have 14 million. We have done some preliminary running of the numbers on how much this will save employers, such as small and large businesses and governments, individuals and private payers, as it’s phased in: between $835 million to $1.9 billion.", "I have to tell you, I think the government has underestimated the positive response to a true pharmacare program. This is good for businesses in Ontario. It’s actually a competitive factor to hold businesses here, to draw them to the social infrastructure that we are so proud of in this province. These are fundamental differences, Mr. Speaker. Our plan would allow the vast majority of people in the province, the 2.2 million people who have no coverage whatsoever, to have some coverage with a very small copayment. The Liberal plan, unfortunately, promises drug coverage to a demographic and an age group who are not likely to need blood pressure medication, heart medication or diabetes—one would hope. So those are the fundamental differences on that.", "The schedule 33 is also of great interest. It’s the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act. This entitles workers under the insurance plan to receive benefits for chronic or traumatic mental stress arising out of and in the course of workers’ employment.", "This raises the entire spectre of mental health issues. I have to tell you, Mr. Speaker, I was attending Lutherwood’s Steps for Kids this weekend. The lack of funding in the budget bill for children’s mental health—advocates from across the province have asked for an immediate infusion of $118 million. When I asked this question last week, the deputy minister stood up and said, “We gave $7 million to the universities.”", "A hundred and eighteen million dollars is needed to alleviate a one-and-a-half-year wait-list for children who are suffering from mental health issues. They are your own study, your own research, your own evidence in the face of knowing that hospitalization of children with mental health issues in crisis has gone up 67%. Hospital visits of children who are suffering—their families are in crisis—hospital ER visits have gone up 65%, and what is in this budget for children with mental health issues? Almost nothing. It was a complete and utter shock to the advocates across the province who have been sharing and working in so-called collaboration with this government to ensure that children have access to the kind of counselling that they need. The results, Mr. Speaker, are often devastating for the entire family and sometimes for the community. We have a shocking suicide rate in the province of Ontario. We can do something about it and we need to do something about it, but this budget does not address the need for mental health funding in any significant kind of way. The cost to the health care system, the cost to the economy and the cost to the quality of life that we are all trying to improve for the people that we serve is undermined once again by a budget that leaves mental health to the side, on the back burner.", "Last week, we had the family counselling centres here, and they told us first-hand. KW Counselling said that they rely on funding from the Ontario Trillium Foundation and from United Way. Now, I’m going to tell you, that is never sustainable funding from Trillium. People are so happy to get it; of course, they’re happy to get it. The children’s mental health patchwork system is so frayed—it’s frayed; it’s broken—and these amazing advocates who were here last week are essentially stitching it together. They are barely holding a mental health level of service together in the province of Ontario. So much needs to be done on that front.", "The last schedule—or one of the last ones that I probably will only have time to talk to—is schedule 16, the Land Transfer Tax Act, or schedule 4, the City of Toronto Act. Schedule 16 addresses the fact that this year the provincial government took in $2.7 billion in land transfer taxes. This is higher than average and directly related to the cost of homes in the GTA. So the provincial government is benefiting from the high cost of housing in the city of Toronto.", "I have to tell you, the lack of affordable funding in this budget I think was the biggest shock for us, especially given the fact that the mayor and council have done an amazing job, really, of trying to educate this government, and in the face of a crisis. It is a housing crisis in the province of Ontario, and no one, especially in the GTA or the 905 ridings, can deny that on the supply side of affordable housing, this government has barely done anything in 14 years. Not only that, but Toronto Community Housing, the largest social housing provider in Canada, is planning to close 400 homes next year because of a lack of repair money. Those closures, on top of 600 units to be boarded up this year, would bring the total number of shuttered homes to 1,000 by the end of 2018.", "We are going in the opposite direction around housing, and this, again, in the face of evidence that shows and demonstrates that when you have an affordable housing option in life, it is the number one factor to raise a family out of poverty. It stabilizes the life of the children in that family so that they can reach their potential in the education system. It is a direct economic driver not only in the creation of those affordable housing units, but in the stabilizing of those workers in those houses. It adds to the health care system and the mental health care system. It addresses fundamental core principles of addressing poverty in the province of Ontario.", "This government had $25 million in affordable housing. The province of Nova Scotia, with an overall budget of $10 billion, had $38 million. Nova Scotia had more money for affordable housing than the province of Ontario, Mr. Speaker. It’s a fact; it’s not an alternative fact. You can check it, I have to tell you. Joe Cressy said last week at the city of Toronto: “We should be discussing how to open new affordable housing units, not debating how many we’re going to have to close.” The repairs that are on the backlog are no surprise to anyone.", "Toronto Community Housing, which manages the 60,000 units—minus 1,000 now—over 2,100 buildings, needs to secure an additional $350 million for repairs. We have said that we will come to the table in a shared funding model, in collaboration, in a sustainable funding partnership with the city of Toronto. We have said that because we understand how important housing is. For some reason, in the face of a very high-pressure, very tense political relationship with the city of Toronto, you have members across the benches who have done almost nothing for affordable housing in their own riding, in the face of dire need—particularly how it affects women.", "Those are the main schedules that I wanted to bring to your attention, Mr. Speaker. I think they warrant further attention: children’s mental health, housing and health care.", "The story that I brought to the Minister of Health this morning of the seniors who cannot stay in the same long-term-care facility after 14 years of not having a provincial strategy; to address changing demographics in the province of Ontario—the family has called that cruel. They see it for what it is. And I believe the people of this province see this budget for what it is: electioneering document extraordinaire." ],

She talked about seniors in long-term care—and again, nothing in there for new beds, despite knowing that there are 26,500 people on a waiting list.", "The Deputy Premier, when she was speaking earlier, challenged me in regard to a comment I made. Well, what I’d like to bring up is that when you receive equalization payments, which our province almost never had heard of before, that is still taking a handout. You can spin it; you can use whatever terminology, but the people of Ontario understand that you’re just moving the shell game here and trying to use terminology.", "I want to correct the record for my colleague from Perth–Wellington.

I can tell you some cuts that happened in my riding as a result of this government: 50 educational assistants, and yet I didn’t see any money in there to replace any of those; 18 potential schools in my riding are going to be cut and taken out of our communities; and $47 million was cut from the agricultural budget, despite this government suggesting that they are the keepers of agriculture.", "Also, the member from St. Catharines, the dean of the Legislature and the chief government whip—he was good. He suggested that you sometimes have to be negative in opposition, not because you want to, but because that’s the reality of the facts.

Was the $6 billion paid to the US and Quebec to get rid of our surplus energy or the $8 billion on eHealth a challenging circumstance? I would suggest that there were choices that could have been made. That was poor and bad management." ],

  "text" : [ "I wish I could say that I’m here to speak on this budget motion with pleasure in my heart, that it was actually a pleasure to stand and rise to speak to the motion, Speaker, but it is actually my duty to speak today out of concern for the people of Ontario who will be impacted by this budget. The simple fact is, the people are hurting in the province of Ontario today. Wages are down, the cost of living is up, and families and businesses are reaching a breaking point. This budget was the Premier’s chance to turn things around, to undo some of the damage she’s done and show Ontarians that she understands what they’re going through, but that’s not what Ontarians received in this budget. To be blunt, this budget doesn’t even come close to undoing the damage that the Liberal government has done.", "Ce budget ne renverse pas les dommages causés aux familles de l’Ontario.", "Under this government, hydro bills have shot through the roof, and this budget offers no new relief. Electricity is not a luxury, and it shouldn’t be priced like one. Everywhere I go, people are telling me that their families are at a breaking point—people like Jane in Kingston. When I met Jane, she told me that she struggled with rising costs and couldn’t afford both her hydro bill and her groceries—I’m sure the MPP from Kingston is quite interested in this story. Jane was quite worried, having to make that choice. Faced with groceries or the hydro bill, Jane decided that the most important thing was for her to buy groceries. Of course, not surprisingly as a result, her hydro was cut off. It’s heartbreaking to see the choices that people are having to make, that people are being forced to make by Kathleen Wynne’s Liberal government.", "I also think of Richelle in Smithville. Her hydro bill is so high that she was forced to choose between filling her family’s prescriptions or paying to keep the lights on. No mother should ever have to do that.", "So many people feel trapped. They’re working harder than ever, but they’re struggling every single month to keep their family above water, to get ahead of the bills. There are people in Ontario who literally lie awake at night, worried sick about how they’re going to pay their hydro bill. I see what families are dealing with. I have been seeing what families have been dealing with for year after year after year, as this government has paid no attention to the struggles that people have been facing. I see that we’ve actually reached that tipping point in our province, in Ontario.", "What we need is bold action in our province. We need bold action to help people right now. We need big ideas, the kind of big ideas from government that help families find security, that build their future, that help them to build their future and help them to make sure that their kids are going to have the same kind of opportunity that they did right here in our great province of Ontario.", "But that’s not what we see in this budget; that is not what we’re seeing in this budget. The Liberals have spent 14 years driving up hydro costs for families, and instead of using this budget to finally help the people of Ontario, the Premier is continuing the sell-off of Hydro One, further damaging the public control of a vital service.", "The budget in fact shows that $1.2 billion in dividends from our profitable corporation are gone. They’re filling the pockets of the Liberals’ friends who bought the shares. So families like Richelle’s are paying more for their hydro and getting less—less money for schools, less money for hospitals.", "The Premier watched those hydro bills rise year after year in our province until it became an absolute crisis for people, and she didn’t seem to get it. All that time when we were travelling around the province—myself as leader of the Ontario NDP, my colleague NDP MPPs—listening to the horrifying stories of people at their wits’ end because they could no longer pay their hydro bills, she didn’t seem to get it. She seemed to be the only one in Ontario who didn’t get it, that people were unable to pay their bills anymore. In fact, she didn’t seem to care—that is, of course, until it became a political crisis for the Liberal government. Once it became a political crisis for the Liberal Party, well then, holy smokes, let’s get some action on that file.", "Ontarians have made it clear: They believe in public power. Over 80% of the people of Ontario believe in public power. Ontarians know that to solve the real problems in hydro, the system must be publicly owned and publicly operated. Most importantly, it needs to be operated in the best interests of Ontarians—not the best interests of shareholders, but the best interests of families like Richelle’s, families like Jane’s. It’s time the people of Ontario were able to pay less for and own more of our hydro system.", "I’m happy to say the New Democrats have developed a plan that would do exactly that. That plan is available for everyone to see, for everyone to read in far more detail, frankly, than what the government has proposed, where we still don’t see any details of their intentions.", "I strongly urge the Premier to read the NDP plan. This plan will stop the damage that Premier Wynne is doing and actually start to reverse it. It will take immediate steps to regain control over hydro costs without simply kicking the can down the road to the next generation, which is what this Premier has proposed. She’s content with an electricity system that serves the best interests of her friends, as opposed to the best interests of the people, and in order to keep her friends happy for the long term, she’s prepared to let the next generation of Ontarians pay for it. How shameful is that? Absolutely the wrong direction and the wrong thing for the province of Ontario.", "To make a real difference in the lives of Ontarians, we must stop the disastrous sell-off of Hydro One and bring it back into public hands with full public oversight. We need to restore fairness to the system. We should be working to lower bills through such measures as making sure that rural folks are paying the same delivery charges as urban customers are paying. We have to cap the private profit margins that are built into our electricity system. We have to end mandatory time-of-use pricing—which is a failed policy; that, everyone can see—by giving the Ontario Energy Board a new mandate to stand up for the public and ensure that the bills are lowered.", "Speaker, we have to make it fair, and we have got to fix systemic problems that are inflating rates, so that the people of this province know that their electricity system is there for their benefit, for the benefit of business and industry, and not simply for the benefit of Liberal friends.", "The NDP plan shows exactly how we can do that: by ending the ridiculous practice that we currently undertake, which is paying for all kinds of power that we don’t even use; by renegotiating terrible, terrible contracts that feathered the nests of Liberal friends but that we’re paying through the nose for. Of course, I’m talking about those private contracts that Liberals—and, frankly, Conservatives—have signed, which make insiders very, very wealthy, but leave Ontario families and businesses paying for electricity that, as I said, we don’t even use.", "The meaningful changes that I proposed would make a real difference for people. By acting now, we could lower hydro bills by up to 30% in the short term and much, much more going forward. Affordable, reliable, clean public power can be the backbone of our electricity system, just like it used to be the backbone of our electricity system until that party and now that party got a hold of it. But it needs a government that is willing to make bold and meaningful change that benefits the people of our province, not that benefits some certain select friends and acquaintances of the governing party.", "Unfortunately, this budget makes it very, very clear that Ontarians won’t see that kind of meaningful change. They won’t see that kind of meaningful change until they see a change in government.", "The Premier sold off Hydro One without the consent of its owners, the people of Ontario, while denying for years that skyrocketing hydro bills were even a problem, and she’s doing it again. This Liberal government isn’t undoing the damage that it has done to hydro in Ontario; it’s doing more damage, Speaker. It’s all incredibly clear when you look at the government’s phantom plan in the budget. There’s nothing there to save money for anyone who pays a hydro bill: no savings for Ontarians, no transparency for Ontarians, no accountability for Ontarians, no fixes for long-standing, system-wide problems in our electricity system; just more privatization, more deregulation.", "This budget doesn’t help Ontarians who are struggling with the choice to heat or eat. The budget actually makes it worse. This Premier governs like she has never even had to open her own hydro bill. It is shameful. Out-of-control hydro is hurting this province, and this budget is only going to make things worse.", "While families’ costs are up and their wages are flat, which we all know is the case, the things that they count on—the things that families count on, the things that Ontarians count on, like health care—are being squeezed by this government.", "Mr. Speaker, the chronic overcrowding of Ontario hospitals is absolutely out of control. This government has starved our hospitals for nine years. I remember being on the campaign trail and I remember a certain Kathleen Wynne saying in her platform that she was going to cut the deficit—get rid of the deficit—and not touch health care or education. What a joke that turned out to be.", "This sounds a little bit like promising to get auto insurance rates down. I guess it was a stretch goal for the Premier. I guess it was like not telling people that she had an intention of selling off Hydro One. People deserve a person who is going to be running for the leadership of this province, for the Premier of this province, to be truthful on the campaign trail, to tell people what she’s actually going to do.", "That’s not what happened, of course, and now we know that as a result of nine years of hospital cutbacks—four of which were literally frozen budgets, which we know with inflation means rollbacks in the amount of money that hospitals have to take care of the patients in this province—what’s happening? People are being treated in what the government calls “unconventional spaces.” If you go to emergency, instead of a hospital room you might end up in one of those unconventional spaces. People say, “What does that look like?” It looks like stretcher after stretcher after stretcher lined up in a hallway with a sign over top that says, “Hallway Room 1” or “Hallway Patient 1.” “Hallway Room 2.” “Hallway Room 3.” Imagine being a patient, Speaker; imagine being a patient in pain—in agony—worried about what’s wrong, worried about what’s happening to your health because you had enough of a concern about what was happening that you ended up in emergency. And there you lie in a hallway for days on end, where the lights are constant, 24/7, where there is activity everywhere, where, when the doctor comes to talk to you about what’s wrong, everybody in the hallway hears about your personal health problems.", "How undignified is that, Speaker? How undignified is that? That that Liberal government has allowed our hospitals to degenerate to that point where people cannot get dignified service is shameful. It is a disgrace. They should be embarrassed. They should be ready to give up and walk out of here and never run for government again, they’ve done such a terrible job on the most important file, the thing that people care the most about, which is their health and the health of their loved ones.", "You’re in a hallway or you end up in a utility closet or a broom closet, or you end up in a TV room, like the 84-year-old woman from Sudbury who ended up in a TV room for almost three weeks straight, with three other patients and no bathroom. That’s the kind of health care that this Liberal government has been providing to the people of Ontario. We deserve so much better than that.", "When New Democrats talk about the damage that Kathleen Wynne and her government have done, look no further than hydro and hospitals. Unfortunately, the list is much, much longer. But let’s face it: in a hospital, lying in a TV room, a hallway, a shower room, a broom closet, no privacy, no comfort and no dignity whatsoever; those alarm bells have been sounding for a long time, Speaker. This problem did not occur overnight. New Democrats have been raising those concerns in this Legislature for years now. Doctors, nurses and health care professionals have been speaking out, but the Liberal government still doesn’t seem to get it.", "Linda Haslam-Stroud, the president of the Ontario Nurses’ Association, says this: “Our hospitals have been starved of funding for years, and our patients have paid the price as hospitals slashed more than 1,600 RN positions—to dangerously low levels.”", "This budget was the Premier’s chance, Speaker. This budget was actually the Premier’s chance to finally start undoing some of the damage she has done in Ontario hospitals. But once again, this Liberal Premier and this Liberal government have let us down. They have let all Ontarians down. Instead of fixing the problem in our hospitals, this budget falls over $300 million short of what the hospitals themselves say that they need just to maintain the current level of service, which we all know is extremely inadequate. And that wouldn’t even undo the damage that the Liberals have done over the last decade.", "The government’s starvation budget and callous cuts have broken our hospital system—nine years, they’ve broken our hospital system. The Premier is making decisions like she’s never had to go to a crowded ER before, like she’s never had to watch a loved one suffer the indignity of being treated in a hallway. Hallway health care is a crisis, and boy, we are in that crisis now. C’est une crise humaine.", "Every day, Ontarians are paying the price, Speaker, every single day. I was talking earlier about Olive Bird. Our colleague from Nickel Belt talked about Olive’s concerns in the Legislature last week. I wish Olive’s experience was an experience that was an exceptional one, something that rarely happens in Ontario’s hospitals. But more and more and more, Olive Bird’s experience of being in a TV room with three other patients, with no washroom, is happening all the time in Ontario hospitals.", "Just last week, I was joined here at Queen’s Park by a young woman named Jamie-Lee Ball. Many people will remember Jamie-Lee. For days, she was known as “Hallway Patient Number 1” in Brampton. She is one of many Ontarians who have felt the damage done by this government. Jamie-Lee was left to suffer in a hospital hallway in Brampton in terrible pain, with internal bleeding. You know what, Speaker? I have to tell you that I think Jamie-Lee is actually a hero. That woman is a hero because she went through an experience that made her vulnerable, that attacked her dignity, and then she opened up even further to tell her story, because she wants to stop this kind of thing from happening to any other fellow Ontarian. Her bravery is inspiring. It takes a lot of courage to go public and allow your personal health information and the indignity that you experienced in the hospital to be known to everybody—everybody out there who’s got a TV or reads a newspaper or happens to be on the Internet. She is a hero because she took that personal experience and her own private information and she agreed to talk about it publicly, to try to solve a problem, or at least to try to highlight a problem, hoping that the government would be able to then step in and do what they’re supposed to do and solve the problem, instead of make it worse.", "So Jamie-Lee and I connected after the budget to talk about what we saw in that budget. Was the government doing what needed to be done to solve the problem? Of course, everyone hoped this budget would be that turning point, that turning point in our province that would undo some of the damage that this Liberal government has done in our province. But like so many of us, Jamie-Lee was extremely disappointed by what she saw. The budget does not even begin to undo the damage that has been done to our hospitals, to our health care system.", "I want to tell Ontarians that I believe firmly that it does not have to be this way. People like Jamie-Lee and Olive deserve a government that will stop the cuts inside Ontario hospitals and ensure that hospital funding always keeps up with demand. And they deserve a government that will place a moratorium on any further cuts to front-line health care workers, health professionals and providers of health care. Ontario deserves a government that puts people at the heart of our health care system. That’s what needs to happen. People need to be at the heart of our health care system. But from the looks of this budget, Speaker, they’re going to have to wait for a change in government before they get the leadership that they deserve when it comes to our hospitals.", "Of course, health care doesn’t end at the hospital door, as we all know. When a patient like Jamie-Lee Ball finally leaves the hospital hallway or their doctor’s office, they often head home with prescriptions. But this government believes that anyone between the ages of 24 and 65 should have to empty their wallet or rack up credit card charges in order to fill that prescription.", "That’s why, not long ago, I announced a comprehensive, universal pharmacare plan for the province of Ontario. That plan would give all Ontarians access to the medications that they need. Even Health Minister Eric Hoskins has described universal pharmacare as “the missing half of our health care system.” I couldn’t agree more, but the budget was Kathleen Wynne’s opportunity, the Premier of this province’s opportunity, to give Ontario that missing half of our medicare system. It’s a big idea, absolutely, but it is doable. It is doable, it is reasonable and it is affordable, Speaker. It’s just the kind of big idea that Ontarians need to make their lives a little easier, to help make their paycheques go a little further and to better protect their health.", "As someone who has been listening to Ontarians about their struggles under the Liberal government, I can’t help but think of a young graduate from university, struggling to pay down their student loans and find a good, stable job that lets them plan for the future, who has just lost their student health plan upon graduation. The Premier believes that graduate should pay up if they need medicine.", "I think all those working people, those hard-working people who don’t have a prescription drug plan, one third of all workers—I believe that all of those people should be able to get the drugs that they need without having to rack up debt, without having to pull out their wallet. The Premier believes that those people should still be paying up for their prescription medication. She thinks that all those folks, those one in three workers without a benefit plan at work, should still be opening up the wallet, getting out the credit card.", "One in four Ontarians right now don’t take the medication that they need, Speaker. Some of them will actually get the prescription filled and go straight to the kitchen table and start cutting their pills in half to try to stretch that prescription for a little bit longer, because it’s so expensive that they know they can’t afford to get it filled at the regular interval. Some don’t even fill their prescriptions because they can’t afford them. They walk out of the doctor’s office with that prescription in hand knowing full well that they have no intention of filling it: not because they don’t want to, not because they don’t want to take care of their health, Speaker, but because they simply cannot afford it.", "That has serious long-term consequences for that person. It has consequences for them and their health and their well-being. It has consequences for their loved ones. And it has consequences, also, for our already overworked health care system.", "It just doesn’t make any sense whatsoever that in Canada, someone could go to a doctor without having to pay, thanks to former NDP Premier of Saskatchewan Tommy Douglas, but to get a prescription filled after seeing that same doctor, they have to empty their wallet.", "People deserve to have access to the medications that they need, Speaker. When we think about the lives we can save, the families we can make healthier, we can’t afford not to have a universal pharmacare plan in the province of Ontario. We must put in place a universal pharmacare program for the families, the individuals, the people who call the province of Ontario home—for their health, for the well-being of their families. In fact, it will actually create significant downstream savings in our health care system because people will stay healthier and they will stay out of the emergency rooms and out of the hospitals longer.", "Speaker, I’ve been talking a lot about affordability of hydro bills and medications. These are things that are draining people’s wallets and chequing accounts, but I have to say that under this Liberal government, housing costs have also skyrocketed and social housing stock has been allowed to crumble. As a result, while waiting lists for social housing continue to grow, housing units are literally being taken out of circulation. They’re being shuttered, shut down and, in some cases, sold off.", "This morning, as has been mentioned, I had the opportunity to tour some of Toronto’s decaying social housing. The conditions I saw this morning were heartbreaking: going into a unit and seeing what was once probably a beautiful parquet floor literally torn apart, with little bits of the parquet wood all over the place, the flat concrete slab of the floor pretty much visible everywhere. The kitchen was literally falling apart. The cupboards where the sink was were completely decayed from many, many years of leaks of water. Mold. Really, it was quite a sight. Obviously, that unit was uninhabited. That was a unit where one of the close to 200,000 people on the waiting lists for social housing in Toronto could have actually been living with a roof over their head that was affordable, but because of the lack of attention by the provincial government and other orders of government to the repair needs of the social housing stock in this province, that housing unit is not usable, is not livable.", "Then we went to a couple of the units where there were tenants, Speaker. Anne told us about a door that was broken, windows that were broken, and she hadn’t been able to get any repairs. We went to see a gentleman named Assad. His unit had its problems as well, particularly the kitchen. Along the ceiling, the plaster was all mottled. It obviously had had a leak and it was starting to chip off. It was all blistered. The cupboards were literally falling off the hinges. It was a disgrace. No member in this House would want to be living in those kinds of facilities. No member in this House would allow their loved ones to live in a facility like that.", "The social housing stock is called social housing because it’s owned by government, and government should be doing its job to ensure that that housing is habitable for the people that live there, but so far, that’s not the case. These Ontarians deserve safe, clean, affordable housing. Families, parents, seniors and people with mobility issues and various other kinds of disabilities and exceptionalities live in that housing. They have to go there every day and deal with the state of repair that none of us would deal with. They deserve to live with dignity, like everybody else deserves to live with dignity.", "The city of Toronto is investing $900 million in the repair of Toronto Community Housing Corp.’s stock, but so far this provincial government has refused to come to the table with their share. The newest provincial budget was the Premier’s chance to undo some of the damage that her Liberal government has done to social housing by being absent across the province. But in 2018, provincial funding for Toronto’s housing programs is expected to be less than half of what the city received in 2011. That’s a loss of nearly $180 million a year for Toronto’s social housing, emergency shelters and homelessness prevention programs.", "Well, you know what? It seems to me that I remember this government, time and time again, when it took their fancy, bragging about what they were going to do about homelessness in this province. They’ve done the opposite. They’ve allowed social housing to crumble to the point where the units aren’t even available for people to rent. That’s not how you solve homelessness. You don’t allow your social housing stock to crumble and be forced to be taken off-line. That’s not how you solve homelessness.", "There’s almost no new money for affordable housing in this budget, and there’s no money for social housing repairs, which leaves urgently needed social housing stock at risk of closure—especially in cities like Toronto, where the repair backlog has reached crisis levels. This budget will not help any of the 181,000 families on the affordable housing wait-list, and it will not protect any family living in social housing whose home is at risk of closure due to disrepair. With this recent provincial budget, it has become clear that if Ontarians want a provincial government that will take social housing seriously, they’re going to have to wait for a change in government.", "With 300 schools on the chopping block today, there is no commitment in this budget to save schools that families depend on. A $4.6-million cut to special education funding is still going ahead in 15 school boards. That means that the most needy children, those children with exceptionalities that require extra help and support from our education system, are not going to get that support in those 15 school boards because this Liberal government is taking away over $4 million—$4.6 million—of special education funding, when in fact the opposite needs to happen. There needs to be more special education funding as we see more and more children show up on the autism spectrum and more and more parents dealing with the need to make sure that their kids get a chance to actually fulfill their best possible potential. This government doesn’t seem to care about that.", "The other thing that we didn’t see in this budget is any acknowledgement and recognition that the vibrant urban centres that have modern-day transit systems need to have the participation of other orders of government when it comes to the operation of those transit systems. This government has completely ignored the fact that in other major metropolitan areas the state level or the provincial level comes to the table and helps in the operation of those systems. In New York City, New York state is at the table with billions of dollars of operating funding for that transit system. The same thing happens all over the world, but not here, not here in Toronto." ],

While I know this is not necessarily a questions-and-comments section this afternoon—this is me providing my thoughts on the budget. Again, many times I’ve stood in my place in this chamber over the last four and a half years and I’ve listened to that particular leader, the leader of the third party, and members of her caucus speak out on a wide variety of issues but never—and there was once a term that I used in this Legislature when I referenced their contribution to debates. I talked about the “convenient mythology” of Ontario’s NDP. Today, perhaps, they reached a new level. The leader of the third party reached a new level with respect to the propagation of that particular mythology.", "When you think about how much we have invested to support public transit in the city of Toronto and every other community around Toronto, all of the 905 communities, and when you consider how much we’ve invested literally in that leader’s own hometown of Hamilton and how much we’re currently investing in public transit, to suggest in this chamber or outside this chamber that somehow we are not making the investments we are, that we are not providing for these particular transportation achievements or outcomes, is simply, again, part of that larger convenient mythology that has been espoused by this leader and the Ontario NDP for a number of months, if not years—" ],

That means an additional $170 million a year, each and every year, for the city of Toronto, and an additional $335 million province-wide for those 99 communities that I referenced a second ago, including Hamilton, including Windsor, including Niagara Falls and including communities in northern Ontario. That’s not convenient mythology—that’s what they espouse on that side of the House. That is actually tangible proof that we are moving the province forward and that we’re making critical investments. And that’s just in transit. I could talk about transportation. I could talk about the highway projects, the support for Connecting Links, the Ontario Community Infrastructure Fund and so much additional work that we are doing to help make sure the yardsticks continue to move forward.", "Do you know what’s interesting? I will say that members of the Conservative Party, but also the NDP, every single time that we’ve heard them stand in their place over the last couple of weeks to talk about the budget, are—and look, I’ve said this many times in the House. I’m very respectful of the role of our opposition parties. I love the cut and thrust that is produced here in this chamber. It is essentially what helps us produce the best outcomes possible. But, Speaker, literally every single time I hear a member of the opposition stand up and talk about the budget at a global level, they have nothing but criticism. And then they come to talk to us privately or they stand up and ask a question when it relates to their community. They don’t want us to do the big things; they just want us to do the selective little things that will help them in their ridings. I find that dichotomy, that difference in approach, to be, again, a little bit more than unfortunate. It just shows you sometimes that it’s not about the big picture for both of the opposition parties.", "Having said that, I know my colleagues will want to provide their comments on the budget.", "I will say, a budget that is balanced, a budget that continues to show we’re making the right investments at the right time and in the right places, is exactly the plan that we need to move this province forward.

From what I understand, it’s mostly a tax giveaway to the rich. This will have practical implications. As an example, if you suffer from ongoing asthma, meaning requiring frequent medications and occasional trips to the emergency department and so on, this will add to your family budget something on the order of US$4,000.", "All of these types of issues and potential perils are not before the Canadian health care system, and are being even lessened by moves such as our OHIP+ and pharmacare.", "Of the 200,000 students that we estimate will benefit from our free tuition—and once again, to remind our colleagues and folks who are listening, through you, Speaker, for families that are of modest income, making approximately $50,000 or less annually, tuition for both college and university to their eligible children is free. A glass of milk isn’t free in this country, but we’re ready to offer free tuition and free college. We estimate that something on the order of about 200,000-plus students—and of course, in turn, their families—will benefit. That is a generational landscape change that will really fortify Ontario and Ontarians in Canada, in this knowledge-based economy.", "We’ve already announced—it is, I think, now a week that it’s happening—as of May 1, 2017, a full 25% reduction of hydro fees: something, yes, that is an issue, but ultimately it is our responsibility as stewards of the electricity system to not only foster proper generation but also distribution, and also, of course, to keep the lights on, the heat on, the AC on and so on. That’s what we’re attempting to do—and, I have to say, Speaker, after many, many years of neglect, as you will know.", "Humber College is the beneficiary of approximately $90 million of largesse, for not only their faculty but also the student centre as well as courses. For example, not too long ago we were there to help inaugurate and welcome even more offerings from their advanced skills and training development centre. It’s really quite a jewel in the crown of Etobicoke North.", "I would also like to commend the Minister of Transportation, the Honourable Steven Del Duca, MPP for Vaughan, not only for edifying Mayor John Tory recently during a fact-finding and fact-sharing mission to city hall, but also for the $1-billion commitment just to my riding alone of the Finch light rail transit, the Finch LRT, leading to eight stops in my own riding. They are Humber College, Highway 27, Westmore, Martin Grove, Albion, Stevenson, Kipling and Islington. Speaker, I’m asking for an opening ceremony at each and every one of those stations, so I look forward to that.", "Lastly: the $400 million that is coming to Etobicoke General Hospital for a new emergency room, quadrupling its footprint, a new cardiorespiratory and neurodiagnostic unit and so much more.", "Speaker, I would share the desire of all parties here to, yes, move Ontario forward, but I would respectfully suggest that the anger and the venom that you’re actually directing to us probably ought to be directed south of the border to Trump and his crew and what they’re doing." ],

About a year ago, his younger sister, who’s probably around 12 years old—it was identified that she also had type 1 diabetes.

He goes on to say, “I don’t think there’s anything disappointing” in this budget. He’s saying that what he’s reading in the budget is factual.", "Then it goes on to say: “Critics have said the Liberal government is now making election-friendly decisions which are simply fixing problems created by the government and the party’s preceding government.", "“But McGregor said the budget’s approach to hospitals appears to be different because it is ‘targeting legitimate pressure points.", "“‘I don’t think it’s a case of correcting for mistakes so much as being on top of the issues that are out there’” today.", "Of course, he “expressed relief at Ontario’s extension of its transformation fund for smaller hospitals. In the past, it’s been used for technological upgrades and other improvements.”", "“‘For a system like QHC, where we have small hospitals ... it’s absolutely critical that we get that funding, so we’re very, pleased.’”", "This is not what we’re saying; this is what some of the folks in the health field have said.", "I would just hope that the members opposite, both the official opposition and third party, focus on the parts that are important to Ontarians.

But there’s also reducing wait times for specialized care, and there’s an additional $245 million.", "I want to talk about how we’re expanding home and community care. I’m very proud of this because I see a consistent investment in the people who are providing these very important services to people in need: personal support workers, home nursing and physiotherapy. Those are the things that our seniors require, and people who need specialized care in our communities, like in my riding of Scarborough–Guildwood. Some $85 million is set aside in this budget to expand home and community care.", "In addition to that, there’s $74 million for mental health supports. We know how critical that is, that we’re providing this level of support to people who need it in the community.", "What I am very proud of in this budget is that we are making investments, but these investments are really ensuring that Ontario’s economy and our community continue to thrive. The minister responsible for economic development and growth announced last Friday that Ontario’s unemployment rate has hit 5.8%, Mr. Speaker. That is remarkable, because it’s showing that the investments that we’re making in the skills and the talents of our people through our education system, innovative programs that are much needed like the new OSAP that’s ensuring that people don’t see barriers to post-secondary education—those are paying off.", "When we invest in our earliest learners, like our investments in child care, we are ensuring that our economy will remain strong for the future, because we’re building that confidence right across our economy.", "I just want to say to the parties opposite, there is not a lot to disagree with in this budget, because this budget is about investments in the people of Ontario. When you look at pharmacare and the fact that Ontario’s government is leading this nation in the expansion of universal pharmacare to everyone under the age of 25, that is an important start towards the future of universal care.", "Mr. Speaker, I support budget measures 2017, and I would encourage the parties opposite to do the same." ],

He keeps talking about how the budget isn’t balanced. As someone who spent my career advising companies on how to manage their money and invest and grow their businesses, I know a thing or two about accounting. I know a thing or two about economics and finance. This is a balanced budget. It’s absolutely balanced. In fact, it’s balanced this year, and it’s going to be balanced next year and the year after.", "I’m going to say it again: I’m not going to take lessons from members of that caucus who stand up and on the one hand ran on firing 100,000 people—many of whom were part of a Mike Harris government that slashed and burned. In fact, they did all that and they still couldn’t get to a balanced budget because they cut taxes so much. They had to sell the 407 to make it work. Now they’re coming around and saying, “Oh, you know what? We want you to pay down the debt. We want you to reduce interest payments. We want you to do all that stuff, and on the other hand we need you to spend more money on health care, more money on education in my riding and everything else.”", "I want to know who the real PC Party is. Will the real PC Party please stand up and make itself known? Because on the one hand, it’s standing up and talking about, “We want to spend, spend, spend,” and on the other hand, they’re saying, “No, you’ve got to pay down the debt and the interest.” You can’t have it both ways. You can’t have your cake and eat it too.", "Will the real PC Party please stand up? The people on this side are standing up for the people of Ontario. It’s about time you did as well." ],

The Auditor General has reported that there’s $1.5 billion in pension liabilities that the government is inappropriately counting as an asset. So if we look at the Auditor General’s report, indeed, this budget is not in balance; it’s not in balance if the Auditor General’s statements are accepted. The problem is, this Liberal government will not accept the Auditor General’s reports.", "I will make one last comment about the education minister’s comments, where she stated the huge investments in education.

Let me tell you, in Nipissing, my riding, and specifically in North Bay, the labour market participation rate last year in February was 65%. That meant 65% of the people in the city were working and 35% were not, for whatever reason—they may have retired or they may have just given up looking for work. All of these things, Speaker, are what make a labour market participation rate.", "Well, we were shocked at home last week when the current labour market participation rate came out. Speaker, it has tumbled from 65% last year to 50%. That’s the reality. This is not a partisan statement. It’s not a political statement.

It says that there is a $5-billion operational deficit, a $5-billion hole in the budget, and that is primarily due to receiving one-time revenues such as the sale of Hydro One, such as the monies from cap-and-trade, which have both been put right into the direct revenues of the government. This includes the sale of the LCBO headquarters. It includes the sale of the OPG headquarters. Next year, it’s going to include—we just heard the Premier talk about the money that will be coming in; she did a presser this afternoon—$2.8 billion coming in from the next tranche, the final tranche, of the sale of Hydro One. This will be the Lakeview property; this will be the Seaton lands.", "It’s all one-time revenue, Speaker. That’s why we say there’s a hole in the budget. The Auditor General also says there’s a hole in the budget because this government has used the one-time pension funds. Many of us were around when the pension funds were underwater. Today they happen to be flush. That’s why. It’s so large a number now that it has become material. It’s a big enough number to actually put where it belongs. When it was a small number or an insignificant amount, it didn’t matter that it was or wasn’t included. This is the auditor’s explanation.", "Speaker, they talk about a balanced budget, but a balanced budget would mean that you take in money and you pay out money that would be either the same—certainly not pay out more. There’s a $10-billion amount of money that’s being added to the debt this year. That’s why we put in this reasonable and reasoned amendment, because there’s new debt. The only way they can artificially balance the budget is by the use of one-time revenue. I find that to be purposely done to the people of Ontario, and I also find that unacceptable." ],

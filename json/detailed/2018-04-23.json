Unanimously supported by the Liberals, Conservatives and the NDP, the proclamation of April as Sikh Heritage Month recognizes the important contributions that Sikh Canadians have made to Ontario’s social, economic, political and cultural fabric.", "This month is an opportunity to remember, observe and educate our future generations and society at large about Sikh Canadians and the important role that we play in communities across Ontario.", "Sikh Heritage Month aims to celebrate the contributions and aspirations of all Sikh Canadians and develop a greater understanding and appreciation for a rich, unique and diverse heritage.", "Some of the tenets of my faith that I hold dear include equality, truthfulness, tolerance, honesty and respect for all. These are important pillars for a civil society, a place where we can all work together to build up communities. My role as minister is informed by this. I believe that the work I’m doing is building a fairer and more equitable province. I’m honoured to be a part of a government that values diversity and fights for equality. I’m dedicated to building a society where everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed.", "In my role as the Minister of the Status of Women, I work very hard to address and break down the barriers that hold women back. I work hard to celebrate diversity and encourage equality and equity for all. Some of our most recent work highlights our government’s commitment to equal and fair opportunity for all Ontarians. It’s Never Okay, Ontario’s strategy to end gender-based violence, was an investment of close to $242 million, and it aims to create a system that better responds to the growing demands for services for survivors of gender-based violence.", "We know that gender-based violence can happen to anyone, but the risk is even greater for racialized, indigenous and newcomer women, members of the LGBTQ2 community and women with disabilities. That’s why we put this important strategy forward.", "Then Now Next: Ontario’s Strategy for Women’s Economic Empowerment is the first of its kind in Canada. It aims to eliminate barriers and make workplaces more equitable and accessible for women and men equally.", "Speaker, I grew up in a family that was very politically active. I’ve always believed that the role of government is to provide people with the opportunity to realize their full potential. It is our role to recognize the value in engaging with as many different voices as we can.", "Like many children of immigrants, my parents came to this country from India, and they worked many long hours to build a comfortable life for me and my brother. But they never lost sight of what was important, and for them, that was helping people.", "When my father entered public life in 1993, it was with the trust and support of his community. He became the first turbaned politician to be elected outside of India. By the age of 12, I was helping my father knock on doors around Brampton. Our home bustled with neighbours. Sometimes they were there to seek help, and other times to complain. I watched my father work tirelessly to serve his community. It is from my parents that I learned the value of listening. I learned the true meaning of “community,” and it is a sense of community that lies at the foundation of Sikhism.", "Guru Nanak Singh Ji started Sikhism as a social revolution, a faith based on principles of equality and social justice. The Sikh community is based on these fundamentals, including faith, unity and equality for all.", "As the Minister of the Status of Women, these are the same fundamental values that drive the work that I do every day to achieve an equitable Ontario for women and girls, for now and for the future.", "In Sikhism, we have a very important philosophy called Seva. It means selfless service, completed as a community action. It is performed for the goodwill and benefit of others. It is also done with no expectation of reward. You see, the reward is the act itself, because generosity and kindness are infectious. The concept of Seva is, however, more than just action; it is the very essence of Sikhism.", "When Sikhs began arriving in Canada in the late 1800s and early 1900s, they arrived on the west coast and worked the railway, lumber mills and mines. From these origins grew a vibrant and diverse group of men and women in this country. We now play a significant role in every aspect of Canadian life. We are politicians, lawyers, doctors, labourers, teachers and bankers. We have settled across every province, from British Columbia to Newfoundland. We have made this great nation richer.", "As we celebrate Sikh Heritage Month, we should remind ourselves of how many Sikhs have found success here in Ontario, in so many fields and professions. Sikh Canadians represent a growing and dynamic population making significant contributions to the growth and prosperity of Ontario.", "I’m proud to stand before you today as a Sikh Canadian and recognize the most important contributions that Sikhs have made to Ontario’s social, economic, political and cultural fabric.", "I want to speak to you about one such hero, Buckam Singh, the first Sikh to enlist for World War I with an Ontario battalion. He was wounded twice in France and died in Canada in 1919. He is buried at Mount Hope Cemetery in Kitchener. His tombstone is the only known Canadian Sikh soldier’s grave in existence.", "These days, Canadian Sikhs are breaking down barriers and forging their own paths, people like Jagjeet Singh Hans, also known as Tiger Jeet Singh, who rose to prominence as a professional wrestler. He went on to be almost as well known for his humanitarian work as he was known in the ring. There is an elementary school in his hometown of Milton, Ontario, named after him.", "Sikhs have also made their mark and found great success in public service, serving in the House of Commons, the Ontario Legislature and on municipal councils across the province. Gurbax Singh Malhi, my father, became the first-ever turban-wearing politician to be elected in North America when he was elected to the House of Commons in 1993.", "In 2016, Sarabjit Singh Marwah became the first Sikh appointed to the Canadian Senate. He is the former vice-chairman and chief operating officer of Scotiabank, retiring in 2014 after 35 years with the bank, where he began his career as a financial analyst.", "In October 2017, Jagmeet Singh became the first member of a visible minority to lead a major federal party. The criminal lawyer, originally from Scarborough, had been an MPP since 2011 and the Ontario NDP’s deputy leader since 2015.", "Herb Dhaliwal was the first Sikh minister in Canada’s federal cabinet.", "Speaker, the list goes on.", "I am a Sikh Canadian, MPP for Brampton–Springdale and the Minister of the Status of Women. Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize my fellow Sikh members. The honourable members from Brampton West and, of course, from Mississauga–Erindale—our very first Sikh cabinet minister in Ontario—and our member from Brampton South are also Sikhs and long-serving MPPs in this Legislature who have blazed the path.", "Mr. Speaker, we now know that our province is made even stronger through the diversity that immigration creates. I believe many Sikhs are attracted to this province because we value diversity, independence, freedom and equality. We are extremely fortunate to reap the benefits of the different cultures and peoples that make up our province, and Sikhs are prominent among these.", "In closing, I want to thank my fellow Sikh brothers and sisters for their immeasurable contributions to this province. To all, I hope that you have a joyous Sikh Heritage Month." ],

Our province would be a much lesser place without the efforts of our volunteers to support people and make their communities a better place. Our volunteers deserve our recognition, our support and heartfelt thanks.", "During National Volunteer Week, I had the honour of recognizing our volunteers, including awarding the June Callwood Outstanding Achievement Award for Voluntarism to 12 outstanding individuals in four different organizations. I was also on hand, on April 19, to honour the 10 winners of this year’s Ontario Medal for Young Volunteers.", "As many of you know, the annual volunteer service awards ceremonies have been happening in communities across the province since March 19. It will continue until May 1. Through the volunteer service awards this year, more than 8,100 volunteers are being recognized across the province at 57 ceremonies in 45 different communities for their outstanding community service.", "This year also saw important changes to our government’s ChangeTheWorld program. Since 2008, over 240,000 youth volunteers have contributed more than 1.2 million volunteer hours in their communities through the previous ChangeTheWorld program. Our government has revised ChangeTheWorld to help provide more meaningful volunteer experiences for young people. The time frame for the program has been expanded from six weeks in the spring to include volunteer activities throughout the entire year. We also broadened the age limit to include youth from the ages of 12 to 18. We have increased the program’s reach by encouraging a wider range of organizations to consider delivering volunteer projects, and 32 projects worth $1.2 million over two years have received funding to engage youth by promoting volunteerism and fostering a sense of community responsibility.", "Volunteers play a critical and essential role in building strong communities. During National Volunteer Week and throughout the rest of the year, people across Ontario have a reason to be grateful for the efforts of our five million volunteers." ],

Along with being Sikh Heritage Month, April also marks the coming of the Vaisakhi festival, one of the most important days of the Sikh calendar. During Vaisakhi, the Sikh community reflects upon the past year and expresses gratitude for the blessings received, while together looking forward to the coming year.", "Vaisakhi also celebrates the founding of the Khalsa by Guru Gobind Singh Ji in 1699, and observes the participation of traditional Sikh practices, such as the introduction of the Sikh articles of faith also known as the five Ks. Vaisakhi showcases true Sikh values for humanity: a passion for justice, equality, integrity and compassion, which is shown through acts of Seva, or selfless service. Individuals perform acts of charity for those less fortunate, encourage service to others and also promote positivity. These values are embraced by the Ontario PC caucus and are principles that we hold dear to us.", "With a community of over 200,000 strong in Ontario, Sikh Heritage Month provides an important opportunity for recognizing the many contributions Sikh Canadians play in vibrant communities all across this province. It is also a time to remember, celebrate and further educate future generations on Sikh achievements in business, politics, medicine and culture. Canadians of Sikh faith represent an amazing success story across our province, worthy of appreciation. Your resilient spirit inspires us all.", "As Ontarians come together this month to celebrate Sikh heritage and Vaisakhi at various Nagar Kirtans across our province, it’s my pleasure to convey to them this House’s and the PC caucus’s warmest wishes for a successful Sikh Heritage Month.

That said, volunteers make an immeasurable impact on our communities.", "I know, as we are wrapping up volunteer week this weekend, we heard the news in Orangeville that Kaden Young, the three-year-old who was lost on February 21, has been found—mercifully. I can’t think about volunteers and what they do for our community without thinking about the literally hundreds of people who, every single day, have been going out trying to find this young man and bring closure to his family.", "Two people in particular literally put their lives on hold for the last 60 days. Richard Croft and Derek Bennett have been actively organizing volunteer searches and organizing social media connections so everyone across Ontario who had any ability to come out and assist in the search were able to coordinate and connect with the family. It was incredible to see.", "So it’s somewhat fitting that, on the last day of the volunteer week in 2018, we finally brought Kaden home." ],

It gives us a platform so that we can talk about the contributions that Sikh Canadians have made. We can talk about what they are about, their beliefs and values, so that we can share in celebrating their diversity and create a society that is more accepting. It should be one of our goals as parliamentarians, to make sure we create a society that is accepting of all people, and this could be one step towards creating a more accepting society for Sikh Canadians.”", "Speaker, I want to take this opportunity to highlight the contributions of Rupi Kaur today. Rupi Kaur is a Punjabi Sikh who came to Canada from India and grew up in Brampton. She has become a celebrated poet and woman of impact and influence for youth and young women—and the not-so-young. I discovered Rupi Kaur years ago and have dog-eared the relatable pages of her books. When I discovered her, I discovered myself and the stories of my friends and loved ones reflected in her pages. Most others discovered her work through social media. Her appeal as a poet, though, is not dependent on the platform she uses, but is due to the shared complex emotions that fill her words and poems. As she has said, “People want to feel understood.” Themes of her works include sexual violence, trauma, and everyday moments of joy or of torment.", "Heritage months help us to learn to accept and to grow.

  "text" : [ "The motion is that the House approve budgetary measures. We don’t, and I don’t know how anybody actually could, because when you look at this budget, Speaker, there are a number of things that stand out, in my view. There are three in particular that I want to speak about.", "First is that the budget is full of promises that will never be realized. They’re promises that won’t be realized even if the government were to be re-elected, which they won’t be. The second is that it continues the never-ending process of adding debt to the people of Ontario, adding debt to our children not yet born. Then, the third element that I think needs to be addressed and talked about is how this government, with the budget, is twisting and distorting and using words to camouflage their actions in an attempt to cleanse away some of the unseemly actions we’ve seen of this government with their scandals and with their actions.", "One thing that we could be certain of, in stating the financial record of this government: If it were to continue, one thing that would be certain is that our children, in the future, would be living in darkness, living in the cold and eating cat food because there would be no money left over for anything other than the mountains and mountains of debt that this government has created and wishes to continue to create.", "Let me speak about some of the promises first in this budget. Let’s take a look at the universal daycare that they’ve advocated for—and this is not a new promise, Speaker. This promise of universal daycare has been pulled out of the wish list by many Liberal governments in the past.", "Actually, the very first time I heard of a Liberal promise for universal daycare was when my youngest son was just born. That was 1993; he’s now 25. That promise was made by the federal Liberal government. My son doesn’t need daycare anymore at age 25. It was also promised once again by the provincial Liberals in 2003. And now, in 2018, they are promising universal daycare once again on the eve of a general election, but look at the details, Speaker.", "The details are important. We have 800,000 children under the age of four in this province. The budget promises 10,000 new daycare spaces starting in 2020—not starting this year; in 2020. That’s 10,000 out of a group that is over 800,000. You look in the city of Toronto alone, and there is a wait list of over 20,000 children whose parents are looking for assistance and help to pay for daycare.", "Speaker, it is a sham, a sham of a promise in this budget by this government. What is so egregious is not that it’s a rehashed promise that will be broken again; what’s so egregious is that affordable daycare is a very profound and important public policy discussion that we ought to be having. There are many, many families who are finding the burden and the cost of daycare exceptionally difficult—so difficult, in many cases, that it is not worthwhile for at least one of the parents to work. It is prohibitive, the cost of daycare, and preventing people from working. It should not be used as an election ploy. That’s a terrible, terrible undertaking, to purposefully advance a policy and a budget which they know cannot be done and will not do anything for the very people that they are talking to.", "The same thing applies with long-term care. Here we have a crisis in long-term care. We have wait-lists that are in the multiple of years. Many people on the wait-lists will never get into a long-term-care facility. They will perish and die before they get to the end of the Liberal wait-list for long-term care.", "But in this budget, this government says that they’re going to create 5,000 new long-term-care beds, but they’re not going to start until 2022. We have a crisis in long-term care now. We’ve had it for a number of years. But once again, on the eve of a general election, they’ve had an epiphany, and 5,000 long-term-care beds will not make a dent in that wait-list.", "But there was also that other puzzling—when I listened to the throne speech—they are now also going to ration and segregate long-term-care beds based on cultural preferences. When I heard that, I had no—what did that mean? We know that one of the greatest problems in long-term care is the rigidity of the system, and now they’re saying that they will actually segregate a number of beds in each facility for culturally preferred people? I find this astonishing, that we are going to ration out our health care even more with this budget.", "It’s the same with the promise of a guaranteed increase in daily care for people in long-term care. It does not take effect in this budget until 2022. They are promising things beyond the mandate that they would have, should they be elected—which they won’t be. But that is an outlandish action, in my view, when people promise things that go beyond their mandate to be here.", "There are words to describe that, when it’s purposeful like that. but those words would be unparliamentary to use during a debate. But when somebody knows that they cannot accomplish the promise that they’re extending, it is outlandish; it is cavalier; it is brazen in their approach to the people of Ontario.", "Also, what about the debt—the continuing, relentless accumulation of debt? In this budget, there’s another $7 billion of debt. They’ve nearly tripled the debt of this province in their tenure.", "Speaker, we all get it: If you are going into debt to purchase something that is a necessity, something that is beneficial, something that will improve your standard of living, something that you require to get back and forth to work, like a vehicle, or a house to keep you warm, then going into debt is not, in and of itself, a bad thing to do. But if you’re going into debt because you want to go out to the restaurant every night and drink and party, that is a recipe for ruin. That is what this government has embarked on for the last 15 years: a party on the taxpayers’ dollar.", "Continuous debt, not to build more roads, not to build more schools, not to build more hospitals—indeed, they’ve closed 600 rural schools. They have not invested. They have accumulated debt so that they can party and pay for their friends and their insiders, so that they can have a better life at the expense of all people in this province.", "The Auditor General has come out and condemned the actions of this government—and not just the Auditor General. The Financial Accountability Officer, all our independent officers, and others who have looked at what this government is doing have all condemned these actions. The Auditor General used the term “bogus” accounting. I guess that’s a parliamentary word. There are many other words that are synonyms for “bogus” which would not be allowed to be used in this House.", "It’s astonishing that this government thinks they can hoodwink and distort and twist words. We saw the Minister of Energy relentlessly, over the last number of weeks, suggesting that the accounting was all approved by Deloitte and EY and KPMG. But the Auditor General, very clearly, both in public accounts and with her public document, has stated that Ernst and Young has not given any approval on that fair hydro scheme, and neither has Deloitte and neither has KPMG.", "KPMG informed the Auditor General that they have not provided an opinion on the accounting of the fair hydro program. Deloitte and Ernst and Young have provided no opinion on approving the accounting for their fair hydro plan.", "I believe it is incumbent on people to speak factually in this House and, when they make an error, to stand and correct those errors. We have not seen that happen yet. We have a very, very different view of this government’s accounting practices by the Auditor General than by the Minister of Energy.", "Part of that, Speaker, we will find out on Wednesday. On Wednesday, the Auditor General will be making another announcement on the state of Ontario’s finances. We will not prejudge that outcome, but already, in advance of that, she has identified billions and billions of dollars of our debt that this government has hidden from view with their bogus accounting practices. I think that anybody, in a reasonable, objective manner, will see that Wednesday’s announcement will be further condemnations of this government’s practices of how they purposely distort and skew and stretch what words mean into a place where they are no longer intelligible whatsoever.", "Speaker, that leads us to where we have a huge problem at the present time with the level of debt that we have, where over $12 billion a year of taxpayers’ money is being used to service the debt, to pay the debt. That’s $12 billion that cannot be used for needed services. It’s $12 billion taken out of people’s pockets and paid to lenders that cannot be used for anything else.", "We have seen what happens when we divert much-needed money out of services. This spring, we had numerous examples of people, residents of Ontario, who were vacationing overseas or out of country and fell ill or were stricken with a disease and needed to get back to Ontario so they could receive health care. With many of those examples that we heard about this spring—a number of them, Speaker—those people could not find a bed to come back to, and a number of them perished waiting to get a hospital bed freed up in this province.", "That is what happens when a government spends, spends, spends on needless favours for their insiders such as green energy, the smart meter program and the fair hydro program. All of that money is like a party slush fund for those fellows over there with such a cavalier and brazen disregard for how much it hurts the people of Ontario.", "Speaker, it is true: You continue on that path and—we’re seeing it now. You know, I said at the beginning that the future does look very dark for many people. The future looks like they will be living in darkness and living in cold and eating cat food, the way this government continues. We’re already seeing it. Sixty thousand people in Ontario couldn’t afford their electricity bills under this government and were disconnected—60,000. That’s a number that would be outrageous in a Third World country, and it’s happening here in this province by the hand and the actions of this Minister of Energy, by the hand and the actions of the Premier and the total cabinet and the backbench who acquiesce and accept and go along with this brutal, brutal treatment of the people of Ontario: 60,000 people cut off.", "I see that the minister thinks that’s good. That’s an improvement for the environment, he says, because they’re not using up fossil fuels and they’re not using gas-fired generating stations. He chuckles over there when I state about how 60,000 families can’t have the lights on or the heat on. The Minister of the Environment still chuckles and still laughs at the brutal treatment that many people in this province are experiencing.", "We’ve heard the term of choosing between “heating and eating.” For those people, they have made the decision; they’ve cut the power off. Maybe they can get some crumbs to eat.", "Speaker, on this side of the House, we do not support the budgetary measures of this government for many, many reasons, some of them that I’ve just explained: promises that will never be executed or realized, debt that will never end, and the twisting and the distorting of words to try to cleanse the actions of this government, which can only be viewed, Speaker, as a corrupt and contemptible government." ],

What a wonderful title. Unfortunately, that is the title of the budget that this Liberal government has brought forward. We all know, Speaker, that we’ve had this government in power for the last 15 years. We see a health care that is in crisis. We have schools that are crumbling. We have 32,000 seniors on wait-lists for long-term care. We have 12,000 children on wait-lists for mental health. We have seen abuse, literally, to families with autism. We have seen scandal after scandal. We have seen people who have worked for this Liberal government been put in jail. We have seen so many miscomings for the people of this province.", "By knocking on doors, I can tell you that this government is done. Its days are done, especially in my riding.

We see Doug Ford literally taking us back to “the future is dark,” as per the member’s words. That is not the change that people are looking for, and I know that they are looking for that hope." ],

I think that the voters in June will make, quite frankly, the right decision at that time. But I do want to talk about some of the key things in this budget that really speak to the residents of my riding. Key among them is the continued increase in funding for our hospital care sector. We have a hospital in Newmarket that is a fantastic place. It’s called Southlake Regional Health Centre. I was delighted to be able to talk to them about an increase to their base funding of some $14.4 million over the past year and—just this past budget—part of that was $8.2 million to their base funding.", "But what is really exciting is the 12 adult mental health beds that we’ll be adding to that hospital, because that’s a key concern, not only in my riding but right across Ontario, with the $822 million to support Ontario’s publicly funded hospitals. That’s a 4.6 average, I’m told.", "So, Speaker, enough of the diuretic bombast from members opposite.

That money could be going to all sorts of social programs and health care and all the things that people need and want. When we’re downgraded, people do understand, especially in my riding of Thornhill, that that means we’re paying a higher interest rate, so that means even more money is going into covering the debt, and it means even less money is available for programs and things like that.", "Yes, we see, with the Liberal government’s budget plan, that there are promises that won’t be realized.

They’re changing the structure. The Auditor General, to her credit, is waving the alarm bells. The government is doing what they can to disagree and discredit the Auditor General, but, quite frankly, the Auditor General is waving the alarm bells. Why? Why is she waving alarm bells? Because it’s her job to audit the consolidated books. The only way you can audit the consolidated books—and this is, again, from the farmer perspective; it might not be totally 100% from the accounting perspective—is that everyone who is in that consolidation has to present the books the same way, and in that way you can paint an accurate picture.", "But, when you have, out of the blue, the IESO presenting their books in a different way, because it looks better for the fair hydro plan and looks better for the government, it makes it very hard to consolidate the books so they’re actually accurate.

It’s not the job of the big three or the big four or the KPMGs of the world—who I have lots of respect for, and the other ones—to sign off on the government’s books. In fact, the big auditing firms—it’s their job, actually, to design programs so that big companies pay the least tax possible. I don’t know if it is their specific job, but they come up with tax schemes to make sure that their clients pay the least tax possible, so that they can show their books in the most advantageous way possible for their company.", "That is what IESO is doing, because the government told them to do so. But they’re not presenting their books in the best way possible so that the people of Ontario can actually understand what is going on.", "When I was at the public accounts committee, we had the people from IESO there. Public accounts can get pretty heated. I specifically asked, several times, “So the books from IESO are market-regulated?” and they disagreed with that. I specifically asked several times if the IESO could present the books in the way that the Auditor General wanted to. After several pointed questions, the answer was, yes, they can, but they don’t want to, or the government doesn’t want them to. That’s the issue.", "If the only issue is that you present the books one way or the other—there’s no hidden money here. It is not a scandal per se. It’s just that the Auditor General wants the books presented in a way that’s easy to consolidate, so people can understand. The IESO doesn’t want to do it, the government doesn’t want to do it, because then they’ll have to admit there’s a lot more debt there than with regulated accounting.", "Four years ago, the Premier was going to be open and transparent. We heard it again in the federal election: “sunny ways.” Well, this was the provincial version of “sunny ways.” And yet, here we have the Auditor General of the province saying, “Excuse me, but on something as simple”—and anyone who has ever done a bank statement at home—“as consolidating the books”—it’s not that simple when you dealing with the government, because the government is big but the principle is the same. In midstream, the IESO, at the government’s direction, says, “No, no, no, we’re not going to present them that way. Even though we can, we have decided not to.”", "Then people start to scratch their heads, because they may not fully understand exactly what’s going on, but they go, “Wait a second.

Perhaps back on the farm we don’t understand how the business world works, but I think we do. The sale of Hydro One—and they say, “Oh, we’re going sell 60%, but we’re going to keep 40%, so we will be the majority shareholder at 40%.”" ],

They are going to operate, not as a private company, but at the bidding of the government.” I distinctly remember the Minister of Finance telling us that—great.", "So if the government, as the majority shareholder, and since we all agreed in this House—it was before I got here, but we all agreed, including the Conservatives. I’ll give the Conservatives due when the Conservatives need due. They need all the help they can get some days. They agreed, as well, to stop burning coal, because burning coal for power is not good for the environment. So if the government is the controlling interest in Hydro One, why are they investing in coal plants in other jurisdictions? If you burn coal in one jurisdiction and the other jurisdiction—it doesn’t make any difference; it’s not good for the environment, period.", "The issue, again, regarding the executive salaries: The government obviously approves that. But the one thing that I’m really worried about, as the critic for agriculture and rural affairs—the one reason why it’s so important for us to regain control of Hydro One is because fixing hydro lines in rural Ontario is not a profit centre for the company. When you’re a private company—I don’t blame private companies for this; private companies have a huge role. Private companies should look out for the interests of their shareholders. But if Hydro One is only going to look out for the interests of its shareholders, then their main focus is not going to be the dependability of hydro in rural Ontario. I have no faith that the current structure—that the 40% is going to say, “Oh, no, wait a second.” These same 40% let them buy coal power plants, so I don’t think that this 40% is going to stand there and say, “No, no. We’re going to fix hydro lines in rural Ontario first.” They’re not going to do that. That’s why we have to regain control of that company—so that we can make sure that that company is actually doing things for all the people of Ontario, every one of them, and one of those things is so that all the people of Ontario can have dependable access to a necessity of life in our modern lives, which is hydro. By selling the controlling interest, these folks have completely and totally forgotten about that.", "I hear the minister once in a while talk about the Ontario Energy Board. Again, they have a role to play, but all the rules in the world are not going to change the focus of a private company. A private company has a different focus than a public company, and there are things that a private company won’t do.", "I’ve got another example, something that we’ve had to fight in northern Ontario: We have something in northern Ontario called the Ontario Northland Transportation Commission—great bunch of folks. It’s a public—I guess you can call it a company. It’s an arm of the government. I think it was in 2012, the governing Liberals were going to dump it— “divest” was their fancy word.", "For Hydro One, they have a different phrase. For selling Hydro One, it’s “broadening the ownership.” That’s another phrase I have never heard down in farm country. You either sell a part of it or you sell the whole thing. I don’t go home and say, “We’re selling a part of this. But we’re not actually selling it; we’re broadening the ownership.” That doesn’t last long in farm country. If the governing party wonders why people are getting sick of them—it’s stuff like that; it’s “broadening the ownership.” No, you sold 60%. It was a public company. It was very broad at the start. You decided to sell 60%. That’s a good example of what people are getting sick of. The phrases that they don’t really—it’s not that they don’t understand them, but they’re trying to say something by not saying it. It’s just like saying—and I’ve heard the member from Beaches–East York say many times, “Well, actually, in the last campaign, we did talk about selling Hydro One.” No, they talked about reviewing the assets. Those are two totally different things. At no time when the candidate had debates did he say, “The first thing we’re going to do is sell Hydro One.” No, he didn’t say that, because they wouldn’t have been elected if they had said they were going to sell Hydro One. They were going to “review the assets”—which didn’t say anything to anybody and actually sounds reasonable. And then, when they decided to sell it, they were going to “broaden the ownership.” Again, they wonder why they’re in trouble.", "Getting back to the Ontario Northland Transportation Commission: People in northern Ontario, and a lot of people in the rest of Ontario too—I have to give credit where credit is due—mobilized to stop the government from making that huge mistake. But before we got mobilized, they closed the train, which we’re going to bring back—and I’m going to get back to that later.", "They sold off Ontera, which was the Internet service in much of northern Ontario. How that was going to work: “We’re going to sell it to a private company because they have much more expertise in this. In the end, your service is going to get better because private is always more efficient.” You know the whole spiel. I believe it cost them $60 million—and someone can correct me if I’m off by a few million—to get the paperwork done, and they sold it for $6 million. They had just finished doing a lot of upgrades, putting a big fibre optic cable through, and they gave it away. Do you know what happened then?" ],

The folks who had Ontera service that was provided by the Ontario government, because they live in places it doesn’t really pay the private sector to go—that doesn’t mean that they don’t add to the economy. It’s just that in certain areas, just because it doesn’t pay the private sector to provide a service—overall, the provision of that service actually adds to the economy greatly. The folks who were on Ontera talked to the folks on Lake Temagami who had Ontera service and asked them how much better the service has gotten under Bell Aliant. Do you know what? You will get some interesting responses. In places that used to be served by—and it still says “Ontera.” My daughter has a house in a place served by Ontera. She called: “I’d like to get my Internet hooked up.” Ontera: “No, we don’t service that area anymore.” Bell Aliant doesn’t service it either.", "So we know what happens when public services get taken over by private enterprise in places that aren’t profit centres. Northern Ontario, rural Ontario: They are not going to be first on the list when it comes time to repair. When you have a business in rural Ontario or a baby in rural Ontario or animals to ventilate and feed in northern Ontario, you need dependable power. Actually, for any modern type business, you need dependable broadband. That’s why we’re proposing to put $100 million a year into broadband that people can use in rural Ontario. In a lot of places the private sector won’t supply that. That’s why the private sector is going to fall short in the provision of hydro transmission in rural Ontario. That’s why we have to buy Hydro One back.", "The detractors are telling us, “Oh, my gosh, the NDP is going to borrow billions to buy Hydro One back.” We’re not. It’s going to take a while, but we don’t need to own 100% of the company to make the changes we need; we need to own over 50%. We’re going to own 100%. It will take a while. But you don’t need 100% to make sure that the company is doing the right thing; you need to own more than 50%. You don’t need just to be the majority shareholder of 40%; you need to be the controlling shareholder at 50%-plus." ],

They failed—no, they didn’t fail. They decided—they decided—not to act. That’s worse." ],

So these are families who are very, very thankful for what our plan includes with regard to free child care.", "Having this in our budget not only allows the mother to think about going back to work—which is a good thing, because that means that her career can continue to thrive, that she continues to get increases in her pay, and that we are shrinking, if you will, and lessening the wage gap between woman and men, mostly due to the fact that woman stay home for as long as they do to take care of their children.", "People have asked me, “What’s the difference between what your government is offering and what the NDP are now offering?” Mr. Speaker, if you’ll indulge me, I’m just going to refer to an article in the Toronto Star from today that has Gordon Cleveland, an economist from U of T, who was instrumental in the plan that we currently have in our budget for free child care. He refers to the two-page NDP plan for child care as “completely unrealistic.” There’s actually a mother quoted in the article as well—I don’t have her name here in front of me right now—but she says that it looks like the Liberal plan is more doable because there is more thought that went in that plan.", "Let me tell you, Mr. Speaker, that as much as free daycare seems very enticing to people, and I understand that, and perhaps the ones that make a little bit more money should be the ones who pay for daycare—I think, as being proposed by the NDP, at $12 a day or less—what their plan fails to do is to invest in daycare in general. When you are thinking about the fact that there are only 60,000 licensed child care spaces for this age group across the province and you look at what the NDP are proposing, in their third year of mandate, the demand for preschool spaces in this age group would actually exceed 181,000 spots, when we currently only have 106,000 spots. Their plan is not actually investing in the construction of new spaces, in being able to build on what our government has already done with regard to child care and building child care for those children and infants across the province.", "I’m going to just quote Mr. Cleveland here again, where he says, “The NDP plan would result in huge space shortages and long waiting lists, rather than affordable child care.” Their plan would actually go against what they continuously talk about here in the House, which is to create more affordable spaces and get rid of the long waiting lists. In fact, what their plan would do is, it would increase that. We would have huge waiting lists and space shortages in the province for child care.", "I’m very proud of what this government is doing with regard to child care and what our plan actually states, because if you’re serious about national child care or universal child care, then we’re talking about doing what our government is doing. I’m proud of what we’re doing and I will stand behind that." ],

It’s also important to know that, when Hydro One was on the Ontario books, it used rate-regulated accounting, and it was approved by the Auditor General. It’s also important to know that when the Ontario Power Authority existed, it used rate-regulated accounting, and it was approved by the Auditor General.", "In fact, IESO, the Independent Electricity System Operator, has now taken over the function of OPA. When the controller said, “Do you know what?”—she found out there was a second set of books, and that there was $17 billion in activity that wasn’t showing up on the provincial books, which would if you went back to the old OPA way of recording the same transactions. That’s why IESO is now using rate-regulated accounting to keep track of exactly the same transactions that OPA used to use rate-regulated accounting for and had it approved by the Auditor General.", "So I totally reject the notion that rate-regulated accounting appeared from nowhere and that no Auditor General in Ontario has ever approved it.

My mother is 88 years old. She lives with my husband and I. In my riding, also, I have the privilege to represent a great number of seniors. I see that many of them have a hard time making ends meet on a fixed pension, with the costs of life rising every day—just because that’s the way it goes, with inflation and all.", "Many seniors in my community would really benefit from the expansion of OHIP+. This is a historic investment that the province will be making. Everyone 65 and over would have free access to 4,400 prescription drugs. That means no deductibles, no annual deductible and no copay. It would save a senior an average of $240 a year.", "Another program that would kick in next year, and which is very popular with the seniors I speak to, is the healthy home program. The government knows—and we know, I think, everyone in our constituencies—that our seniors want to live independently at home for as long as possible, but they need some help. Sometimes the difference between being able to remain at home or going into a retirement home or a long-term-care home means receiving that little bit of help. So we are providing seniors that are 75 years or older with up to $750 annually to help with the expenses, the cost of maintaining their homes. For seniors who own a home, it could be shovelling the snow or cutting the grass; for those who are renting, it could be just to help with some cleaning expenses. It would provide essential relief for some seniors, who would see in this the difference between being able to stay in their home versus having to give it up. That a makes a great difference for our seniors.", "Another initiative our government is implementing is Aging with Confidence. There is a one-stop website and 24-hour phone service in 150 languages.

That doesn’t sound like a lot of planning. To say that they’ve been planning this for many years—I know that, as I heard earlier, in 2003 they committed to more long-term-care beds.

Twenty-two per cent of families can only afford child care because they can only find child care; 63% said that they would use a licensed spot if they could find one—161,000 licensed spots in Ontario with over 500,000 children needing quality child care. Only 23% of the children can be accommodated in licensed child care, where children are safe, where quality is monitored.", "I have to tell you, Mr. Speaker: The largest barrier for women in Ontario to find child care is in the infant and the toddler—that is the barrier for them to enter the workforce.

I think that for my daughter and for future generations here in Ontario, it is just the wrong direction to move this province." ],

I’m certainly pleased to talk for a few minutes about the budget 2018, otherwise known as the Liberal Party re-election plan.", "Unfortunately, I can’t say that I’m pleased with the actual budget. This document is, in a word, astonishing. It borrows billions of dollars to pay for expensive pre-election spending promises. Thanks to this government’s fiscally careless approach, Ontario taxpayers are now burdened with $325 billion in debt. Interest on the debt is $12.5 billion this year—more than a billion dollars a month just to service the debt. That’s going to fall on the heads of our children and grandchildren.", "The Liberals don’t seem to care about the long-term effects of this staggering debt. Let’s not forget it was the member for Mississauga–Streetsville who said, “We have tripled [the debt] and we’re proud of it.” Proud of tripling the debt—incredible. With that attitude, it’s no wonder Moody’s Investors Service downgraded their outlook for Ontario’s credit rating from stable to negative.", "What’s worse, they pointed to budget 2018 as a reason for their downgrade. Specifically, Moody’s said that the budget 2018 “highlights growing spending pressure that will need to be addressed in the near future.” They also noted that, “The province’s debt is expected to measure 233% of revenues in 2017-18, up from Moody’s previous estimate of 227%.” Two hundred and thirty-three per cent of revenues in 2017-18: That’s a deeply troubling ratio.", "We’re paying the consequences as a province, too. I’m reminded of the words of my honourable colleague from Simcoe–Grey, who eloquently said last week, “Private sector job growth? Ontario is third-last. New debt per capita? Next to last. Real median household income? Dead last. As we can see, this government has been responsible for the decline of Ontario’s once-powerful economy. At one time, Ontario was the engine of Canada’s economy. Now it lags behind because of this government’s destructive policies.” I agree with him. It’s a truly sad state of affairs.", "This budget doesn’t just run a massive deficit and pile on the debt, either. It also raises taxes on individuals and businesses, to the tune of $2 billion over the next three years. The personal income tax hike alone will take $227 million out of the pockets of hard-working families. And the punishing new business taxes will hit over 20,000 businesses.", "Businesses are already struggling under a cap-and-trade carbon tax, skyrocketing hydro rates and other reckless Liberal policies. Indeed, the Ontario Chamber of Commerce recently stated, “Budget 2018 has chosen to follow the federal government’s lead on changes to the tax code, resulting in a new tax burden on Ontario employers of nearly half a billion dollars over the next three years.” That’s not to mention the sudden increase in the minimum wage and other drastic changes brought in under Bill 148.", "Small businesses all over the province are hurting as a result of this government’s crass political agenda. A small business owner in my riding, Sarah Drake, recently wrote me with concerns about the new holiday pay formula. I’ll quote a few lines from her message:", "“Like all small businesses, I have observed that the new labour legislation effective January 1, 2018, is extremely unfair to employers, particularly the new formula for calculating statutory holiday pay.", "“For a small business, the cost of paying for statutory holidays is enough of a burden, and now it is worse.", "“I’m sure you will gather lots of complaints about this. For your statistics, I would like to report that the new formula has increased the cost to my business by 60% for each stat holiday.”", "Now, I understand that the Liberals are desperate to cling to power. That’s why they are running a nearly $7-billion deficit to finance their pre-election spending spree. But there’s a big disconnect between the government’s smooth rhetoric and what they will actually do.", "Looking back over the past 15 years, we see a long trail of Liberal waste, scandal, mismanagement, massive debt and tax hikes. Here are just a few of the most egregious examples: $8 billion wasted on eHealth; $1.1 billion spent on the gas plant scandal, plus a criminal conviction and jail time for a former senior aide to the Premier; $2 billion on smart meters; a $6.2-million salary for the CEO of Hydro One. And let’s not forget the almost $54,000 spent on Canada Goose jackets.", "This budget changes none of that. It just makes it worse. In fact, it just confirms that the Liberals will say anything and do anything to stay in power.", "Speaker, I’d like to explore a few of the areas where the government is suddenly interested in fixing the problems it created. I want to show that, despite their claims, this government’s legacy is mostly empty promises and cynical politics.", "Long-term care is a prime example. With the aging baby-boomer generation, the senior population in Ontario is expected to nearly double to 4.6 million by 2041. We know that right now, more than 32,000 seniors are on the waiting list for long-term care. Without increased capacity, that wait-list is projected to balloon to almost 50,000 by 2021. This situation is reaching a crisis point, Speaker.", "The government used the budget to reannounce last year’s promise of 30,000 new long-term-care beds over the next 10 years. I support that goal. Those beds are desperately needed, especially in rural and small-town Ontario. Unfortunately, I think that promise is not worth the paper it’s printed on. After all, it was this same Liberal government that made an eerily similar promise during an election year, in 2007. They claimed they would redevelop 35,000 outdated long-term-care beds in 10 years. When all was said and done, they only delivered about one third of that number.", "I know my colleagues on the other side like to use the term “stretch goal” to describe that sort of thing. On this side of the House, we call it a broken promise.", "In Perth–Wellington, we know the importance of having long-term-care beds in our community. Last spring, the government was reviewing a proposal that would have shut down a local nursing home, Hillside Manor, and moved up to 50 beds to London. Our community came together and spoke with a strong, unified voice against closing Hillside and transferring beds out of our area. We launched a petition, and over 3,800 concerned residents signed it. I introduced a motion calling on the government to halt the bed transfer, which was debated and supported by all parties in the Legislature. In this case, the ministry eventually announced that Hillside and its 90 beds would stay in the community. Our efforts were successful.", "But the long-term-care issue is about much more than just one home in a single community. I recently wrote an open letter to the Minister of Health and Long-Term Care, making that very point. If I may, I’d like to read that letter into the record:", "“Dear Minister:", "“After years of neglect, we need you to commit to—and fund—new long-term-care beds for Perth–Wellington. My constituents have experienced years of growing waiting lists at many homes throughout our area. They understand that we are not ‘over-bedded,’ as your government has misleadingly suggested.", "“Under your government’s watch, Ontario has a crisis in long-term care; we in Perth–Wellington have experienced it, too. This crisis comes despite the very best efforts of long-term-care homes in our area. Many new admissions come with increasingly complex needs. Homes are also coping with staff shortages—especially as it concerns personal support workers (PSWs)—with no effective plan from the province to address them. Costs, which your government has exacerbated, keep rising. At the same time, funding has been flat-lined.", "“We acknowledge that your government promised, in the run-up to an election, to increase the number of long-term-care beds in Ontario by 5,000 between now and 2022, and by 30,000 before 2027. These beds are needed. In light of your government’s past performance in this area, however, people are understandably skeptical.", "“I was very pleased to learn that a number of long-term-care homes, in both Perth and Wellington counties, responded to your government’s request for proposals to accept new beds. For all of the homes that have contacted me and requested my support, I have written directly to you to endorse their applications. I reiterate that support today.", "“It was beyond disappointing, however, to read recent news reports stating that Perth county is ‘not a priority area’ for your government when it comes to new beds. I also understand that your government told long-term-care administrators in Perth county that because they are in the county, they should not even bother applying. If true, this would be a massive mistake.", "“As we have said many times: the ‘bed ratio’—that is, the number of beds per 1,000 people at least 75 years of age—is the wrong metric to evaluate the unique needs of various areas. Bed ratios do not account for demographic shifts to rural and small-town Ontario. They do not account for the growing population under age 75, people who also need long-term care because of chronic illness, disability and so on. They do not account for added costs to smaller local hospitals and municipal ambulance services, which would have to transport patients over greater distances. Finally, bed ratios do not account for long travel distances, sometimes in dangerous winter conditions, that families would have to drive to visit loved ones. It is amazing to me that your government has yet to acknowledge these basic facts.", "“Again, I want to repeat my unequivocal support for every long-term-care home throughout Perth–Wellington that has applied for new beds. Our administrators have made the case that they need them, and our area would clearly benefit from them.", "“I would appreciate your response to this matter, and all of the issues I have raised. Thank you for your consideration.”", "I hope to hear back from the minister soon. Thousands of residents of Perth–Wellington and across the province are paying close attention to how the government handles the issue of long-term care.", "Another issue the Liberals have shown a sudden interest in is developmental services. For almost a decade, the government froze the budgets of developmental service agencies and allowed the Passport Program wait-list to balloon. Bill 148, with its drastic employment and labour law changes, only pushed agency budgets closer to the brink. Now, just six weeks before an election, the government is promising $1.8 billion over three years. That’s a welcome investment, and long overdue, but that’s only part of the solution.", "The Ombudsman’s 2016 Nowhere to Turn report highlighted many problems in the way developmental services are delivered in the province.

He is a resident of Guelph, Ontario, who has Down syndrome. For years, Duncan has been employed through contracts with organizations that provide vocational day programs. These are local non-profits that hire people with cognitive and physical disabilities to do work in sheltered workshops. This type of job allows a worker to perform duties at a pace that matches his or her abilities. These job opportunities are a wonderful experience. They give people like Duncan a sense of purpose, a routine to plan their day around and an expanded network of friends.", "Unfortunately, for about a month now, Duncan has been without work, as a result of this government’s Bill 148. Duncan’s employer can’t afford to pay him at the new $14 minimum wage, so he has let him go.", "I found the quote from the MCSS official in the article especially troubling. In response to sheltered workshops closing, he said, “Some individuals with developmental disabilities may prefer to focus on community participation, such as volunteering or recreational opportunities.” Well, that’s fine as far as it goes, but what kind of a paycheque does a volunteer bring home? What about people like Duncan, who want to work and earn a bit of money? Apparently, the government thinks they should just do volunteering or sign up for recreational opportunities instead. This government talks about fairness and doing what is right, but where’s the fairness when you strip away the dignity of paid work?", "This is happening all over the province. Everyone deserves to feel like they’re an integral part of their community, including with paid work. This government is taking that away.", "Again, there is a real disconnect between this government’s talking points and what they actually do. They claim to care about creating fairness, but their record on issues like long-term care and developmental services is seriously lacking.", "This government claims to respect taxpayers’ money, yet under their watch, Ontario has seen nine budgetary deficits since 2008-09.", "Last year, the finance minister stood in this place and boasted that he’d balanced the books. However, the Auditor General recently called the government’s accounting methods “bogus.” Bogus, Speaker: That’s a strong word with a strong message.", "The reality is that Ontarians can’t afford four more years of this government.

People are working harder than ever and getting less and less.", "While families are struggling to make ends meet, we have watched the Liberals hand out rewards to their special friends and insiders, and they are continuing to show flagrant disrespect for taxpayers’ money.", "Over the last three weeks, the government has done a total of 39 campaign-style announcements. They claim that the purpose is to promote the budget, but in reality, the Premier is spending public money to trash the PC Party and our new leader, Doug Ford. With an estimated cost of $7,500 per event, the Liberals have wasted almost $300,000 so far on these partisan announcements. Following a complaint from the PC Party, we’ve also learned that the Liberals are now under investigation by Elections Ontario for this practice.", "Speaker, the people of Ontario aren’t stupid. They see this pre-election budget for what it is: a desperate attempt to cling to power by a tired and cynical government. As PC leader Doug Ford is fond of saying, the party with the taxpayers’ money is over. Ontarians can’t afford this budget, and the PC Party can’t afford to support it." ],

  "text" : [ "Once again, it’s a pleasure to join the debate on the budget motion 2018.", "To my friend from Perth–Wellington: No offence, specifically, but the context of this budget motion is very important, and it’s actually quite timely.", "It’s hard for me not to think of the emotion at the doors, because I know that we’re all knocking on doors. I do it throughout the whole year. It has been very interesting to see the response and the anger at the door, to be quite clear. Given the latest polling, that shows that 80% of Ontarians want change. They are desperate for change. This is the one thing that we know for sure.", "Having those important conversations at the door—that’s still a very important part of our democracy. You can have good social media platforms to work from, and you can have a good on-the-ground team that maybe makes phone calls, but having that face-to-face conversation with constituents, in all of our ridings, I think, is incredibly important.", "What I learned this weekend is that people are angry at this Liberal government, and they’ve taken it very personally. I equate it to the fact that in 2014, there was the gas plants scandal, Ornge, eHealth and a few other things, but what makes them angry this time is that they get that hydro bill, so they have directly connected the energy portfolios and policies of this Liberal government to their lives. It’s tangible. Of course, the government changed the billing. It used to be every two months. Now they get an angry bill every month. Some people have seen a reduction, but now that they know how you achieved those reductions, they’re even angrier.", "The more that this government does, the more cynical people get. I just want to say that that’s a problem for all of us, because we want people to be engaged in this election and we want them to be informed.", "What came from this budget, quite honestly—this government got a quick little bump, Mr. Speaker. They got a bump in the polls, because the Premier said that this was better than free. When she was talking about, I think, the preschool program, she said, “It’s better than free.” Nobody in this province believes that—nobody, Mr. Speaker. What they know for sure is that this government has made successive decisions on health care, on transit, on child care and especially on energy which have negatively impacted their lives. At the doors, they articulate it very well, Mr. Speaker.", "I was really pleased to address some of the issues that I’ve cared about a lot for a long time, and one of those is early learning and care.", "I first became a child care advocate when my son was born, which was 20 years ago. When I found that almost three quarters of my wages were going to be going to the Orde Street daycare, which is just down University, making that decision to stay engaged in the workforce, as a mother and as a woman, was very difficult.", "So I got involved in the Ontario Coalition for Better Child Care, and I got on the board of the child care. I started learning where the fees go and why Ontario has the highest fees. To this date, after 15 years of Liberal government, Ontario still has the highest child care fees in Canada. That is indisputable. It’s actually part of Gordon Cleveland’s report to the government.", "But that’s not all, Mr. Speaker, because this government has had year after year after year to rectify the problem and to address the core issues. In fact, they even commissioned a report—and this one is actually from 2007. It’s from the Ontario Expert Panel on Quality and Human Resources, chaired by Dr. Donna Lero. It made the recommendation that there should be an establishment of “provincial guidelines for wages, benefits, and working conditions for early learning and care” programs, and immediate increases in funding “to enable programs to implement substantial wage and benefit increases.”", "In the early learning and care field, the most important people are those who are directly delivering the service. Those people, those workers, should be respected. When you respect those people, then the quality of that child care goes up because you are investing in people. So did the Liberal government act on this report from 2007? No, they did not. They had their chance. So that’s why it rings hollow for child care advocates, for activists, for parents across this province when they drop a budget like this and the Premier of this province says that this is better than free preschool—better than free.", "The credibility of this government has been seriously compromised. More importantly, we are behind most provinces in this country on supporting an early learning and care program and funding that actually lifts women up—because when you lift women up, you actually lift the whole community up, and you lift children up.", "The one thing from the Gordon Cleveland report, actually, because I have it here in front of me, is that he did recommend “a generous sliding scale of child care fees, where all families with earnings less than $40,000 pay nothing,” and “all families with incomes above $240,000 pay 80%.” Part of our child care plan is that for those families who make $40,000, their child care will be free.", "Earlier, the member from Davenport said that we didn’t read the report. Of course we read the report, but we are addressing the serious barriers for women to access the workforce and access their educational opportunities, because when women do access those educational opportunities, they actually meet their economic potential, and then we wouldn’t need another piece of legislation like pay equity and pay transparency because women would be earning very good money. So we see this very much as a continuum.", "The fact of the matter is that we focused on infant care and toddler care, because these are the most expensive and these are where the fewest spaces are. That is why we have a capital strategy to address the capital infrastructure, because you can have a great idea and you can say, “We’re going to do this,” but you have to show them the money. You’ve got to put the money on the table and you’ve got to build the spaces, because they don’t come out of thin air. But of course, this Liberal government very much believes that child care is a business.", "When we were developing our early learning and child care plan, we went back to the Ontario Coalition for Better Child Care and said, “If you were to develop one right from the very beginning—your dream plan—what would underpin it, from a principle perspective?” They said, “Listen, you have to make it affordable. You have to include a sliding fee scale. These are some of the core principles.” We have the highest child care fees in Canada and we have a long waiting list for fee subsidies. So you can have a great fee subsidy, but there’s still a wait-list for it: “It’s time for something better. The solution to the challenge of affordability is operational funding for programs and setting an affordable, geared-to-income, sliding-fee scale with a cap,” which we did.", "The second part was: “Decent work and professional pay for educators.” Educators are the key to quality programs for our children. Recruiting and retaining the best staff requires professional pay and decent work. To achieve this, a provincial wage scale recognizing the level of education and experience must start at a certain level and with registered early childhood educators. So operational funding has to be part of it, and you have to pay the people who are doing the work—and these are primarily women.", "This is still very much a female-dominated field. You have known this for 15 years. You have known this since 2007, since your own report. Your own committee told you that if you wanted to lift women up and build stronger communities, then you invest in the people who are doing the work. No plan will be successful in rebuilding child care in this province and undoing the damage of this government unless you invest in the people who are doing the work: the early childhood educators. That is a core principle of our plan.", "The expansion of public and non-profit child care: This government will know that I brought a motion to the table to grandfather, going forward, that all investment not go to profits, not go to the shareholders, not be negotiated on the Toronto Stock Exchange. We are trading shares in child care in the province of Ontario at the Toronto Stock Exchange. Who would ever have thought that this government, this Liberal government, would accelerate to the degree that they have and double-down on privatization? Nobody bought that. Neoliberalism was a grain of salt at one point. It was a seed. They planted it and it grew, and now we have huge, corporate, big-box child care in the province of Ontario. There are good people in that system, but not all of the funding is going to the children. It’s not going to the nutrition, and it’s not going to the professional development. It is going to the profit margin. That’s where your tax dollars are going. If you want to build the system up, then invest the money strategically, with children at the centre. I could say that about almost every other file.", "Those are our key principles: the not-for-profit, the affordability, the sliding scale, and, of course, valuing the very people who do the work in our child care centres.", "This research has been here for years. You commissioned this research. Had you acted, we would not be in the state where people pay between $9,000 and $20,000 in annual fees, which are amongst the highest in Canada. That’s higher than post-secondary education. In some instances, that’s higher than mortgage payments.", "How can you build an economy up? How can you say that you value equality and equity, when you’ve had the tools at your disposal for 15 years to change the system and you failed to do so?", "You can’t really question the anger of people at the doors when they say, “What have you done to improve the lives of women and children in the province of Ontario?”", "When you drop a budget like that and you call it “better than free,” you have no credibility. It is just a fact. This government has no credibility, because they have burned the trust of the people of this province on several issues—and I want to touch on a couple of other ones.", "This past week, I had a transit town hall. In 2014, the then Minister of Transportation, Glen Murray, came to Kitchener-Waterloo and he promised us two-way, all-day GO trains every 15 minutes for $10. Then he doubled down and said, “Not only that, but we’re going to get you a bullet train. We’re going to get you a high-speed train that will supersede the GO train.” I don’t know where it was going to go—if it was going to go over the GO trains or if it was going to go through the GO train—" ],

We can agree that this is not acceptable; right? In 2018, in the smartest community, the most intelligent community in Ontario, the Waterloo region, we should be able to figure out how to get that train faster than two and a half hours. I hope that we can agree on that.", "But ahead of an environmental assessment, to already say that you’re going to build the high-speed rail without doing the due diligence, without doing the consultation, without having an inclusive process actually dooms that whole project, and I’m going to tell you why. The communities across rural Ontario are already gearing up to fight the train. If you want high-speed rail to be successful, then you have to bring everyone along for the ride. They have to see the benefit in it for them.", "At the transit town hall, we basically spent most of the time saying, “How can we work together to make two-way, all-day GO a reality?” That means a train from Toronto to Kitchener-Waterloo in the morning, because 25,000 people commute into our region.", "I don’t know where the funding went from the sell-off of Hydro One, but when I look at the public accounts for the last four years, this government had allocated infrastructure funding; they had allocated it for transit and for roads and for rail. However, they didn’t spend it. So this leaves a big question mark as to whether or not they are serious, because I still don’t have that commitment from the motion that I brought forward to the floor of this Legislature, which the Liberal government voted for, which said that we would have a timeline and a budgetary figure that would actually align with the project, with building two-way, all-day GO. I’m still waiting for that.", "But suffice it to say, there is great interest in getting people from KW to Toronto, but also great interest in getting people from Toronto to KW. I want to give a shout-out to the three senior ladies who came out. They’ve been advocating for a faster train since 1982, and they had the report to show it. They’re interested in coming to Toronto because they have medical appointments here and they have family here. They came as well.", "The issue of health care has to be one of the more dominant issues that I hear at the door. I’m sure other people do as well. The issue of having seniors in our hospitals with no place to go is a very real issue, because there hasn’t been that investment in long-term care. There was a big number in this budget, but it has taken a long time to get to that number. I have to say, without the initial investment and without a quality home care program that isn’t contracted out to every business available to do personal support worker work, it seems to me that several balls have been dropped on the health care model, including the transformation of the hospital funding model, which happened in 2011 and which was supposed to fix the problem. It was supposed to take into account rates of inflation. It was supposed to take into account the fact that innovation should be incorporated into the budgetary process. It was supposed to take into account regional pressures, actually, which one of our hospitals, St. Mary’s, feels on a regular basis, particularly in their cardiac program. And it does not. Those five years where the health care budget was frozen were not helpful, because it really diminished the level of services and compromised that morale that is so important in our hospitals.", "I don’t know if you’ve seen that commercial. The SEIU, Unifor and I believe it’s ONA—those three unions have come together and said, “Listen, we are at the tipping point. We are doing our best, but we need the Ontario government to recognize that hallway medicine and hospital care is at a crisis point.” I’ve never seen this: three unions come together, pool their resources and fight together for change in hospitals." ],

In our budget, our government is making high-quality, licensed child care free to preschool children between the ages of two and a half to full-day kindergarten starting in 2020. Before that, from zero to two and a half, 60% of the spots are subsidized.

My comments will be about how it reflects the current situation and, more importantly, where we want to go as Ontario.", "As you know, Ontario’s economy has the lowest unemployment rate in 18 years. It has a growth unparalleled in Canada. It has a growth that is better than the G7 nations. And all of this growth presents a choice for government. It could decide to just keep going, to keep the status quo and not invest further in social programs. It could recognize the work that has been done and just keep on going. But that’s not what this budget is all about.", "This budget recognizes that the great growth in Ontario’s economy has not benefited everyone, and indeed this budget is about confronting systemic inequalities that exist in Ontario, and that’s why I’m proud of it. I’m a new politician and I am here because I want to create the institutional instruments that are necessary for Ontarians and Ontario to be ready for the challenges ahead. That’s what this budget is all about.", "Let me talk about a few things that this budget has that are future-oriented. The work that is being done in this budget is certainly to reduce the gap between the rich and the poor. If we do nothing, this economy will continue to grow, maybe, but certainly it will not continue to benefit and will not benefit people who are the lowest and the most vulnerable in our society.", "In the budget, we recognize that something needs to be done. The market by itself does not redistribute wealth. You need actions from government, and this is what this budget does.", "If the Conservatives got their way, they would simply continue to make cuts in government and not actually invest in what is needed to ensure that we are there to continue to have a population that benefits—that all of us benefit—from the growth in the economy.", "This budget speaks to inequality in several ways. First of all, it does upgrade some of the rates for our lowest people in Ontario—ODSP and people on Ontario Works. It does provide some relief in affordability for the middle class, particularly when they don’t have access to a plan to support pharmacare or dental care. That’s an important aspect of this budget, Mr. Speaker, because it reflects the fact that the new jobs of the future will be jobs that will require that people reinvent themselves often. There will be less stability so we need to create within our population the capacity to be resilient and to be innovative. Again, if you look in the budget, there is significant investment in infrastructure that creates jobs, that creates the opportunity to continue to have the ability to invest in what we need to grow.", "It also has significant investment in the ability to create jobs in new sectors—the agrifood sector and new technology. It increases broadband access for rural and northern Ontario. That’s designed to enable everyone to be participating in a technology-driven economy. This is what we’re talking about. What do we need to invest now in our population so that we are ready in the future? I think that’s what this budget is all about.", "It also recognizes that we have to have significant investment in mental health, so that we build resilience within the population. A population that is not able to take the buffers is not able to innovate, is not able to actually take up the challenges that are ahead.", "I’m very proud to see the way in which we confront the systemic inequalities in our society, and I see the investment in child care in that vein as well. It is about ensuring that all children can access a very good child care education, to prepare them well to succeed in school. It’s about allowing women to participate fully in the workforce, but also, it’s a great equalizer for our society.", "I am very proud of this budget, and I was disappointed to hear that people are not going to support it." ],

I want to use my time to highlight budget items that are tied to my Ministry of Tourism, Culture and Sport, where I now have the honour to serve.", "Speaker, let me tell you a story about what happened to me, literally right after being sworn in.", "The swearing-in happened on January 17. About two minutes later, as I stepped out into the hallway outside the Lieutenant Governor’s office, where the swearing-in ceremony took place, a gentleman came up to me and—I’m not going to say that he pounced, but he was very strident. He introduced himself as being an advocate on behalf of the library sector, and he wanted to talk about funding for his sector.", "He shared that their operating funds had been frozen by the Mike Harris government, by the Conservatives, in the late 1990s, and he was very distressed about this.", "You heard my colleague the member for St. Catharines quote the Leader of the Opposition, Doug Ford, saying that there are too many libraries in his part of Toronto, in Etobicoke. In fact, I think he said that there were more libraries in his neighbourhood than there were Tim Hortons, which of course is factually untrue. He said that he could shut down libraries in a heartbeat. He even said that he had no idea who Margaret Atwood was. He had never heard of her, and this is after she got involved in the debate.", "Well, suffice it to say, Speaker, we know that libraries promote literacy. Libraries are community hubs; they’re a place for learning and discovery. We’re asking this question: Why are the Conservatives against literacy? Why are they against learning and discovery?", "Soon after being appointed to this position, there were a number of other library sector stakeholders who came to see me. I sat down with them, along with my staff, and we listened to them. We listened to their desire to have an increase to their operating funds.", "I also received a motion that was signed by my mayor, Berry Vrbanovic, in Kitchener, along with the entire council. They were asking for an increase in operating funds for our local library. I will share with you that we also received similar motions that came to us from other municipalities right across Ontario.", "So I was very delighted to see that in our 2018 budget, we are increasing operating funds for Ontario libraries, and I’ll tell you how much: $51 million for the next three years. There you go.", "We’re also going to be investing $28 million in creating what we are calling “the digital public library.” What is that? The digital public library is going to build a digital library for access by people right across Ontario to things like e-books, music and audio books.", "Speaker, this is especially important for small libraries, remote libraries and libraries in rural areas, where oftentimes they don’t have the funding that allows them to purchase new materials. This is going to be completely free. We are very pleased to be supporting this.", "I know that people in my community, my municipal leaders, people in the library sector and the general public are going to be watching very closely to see who in this House is going to be supporting the budget—who is going to be voting for and against. They want to see support, and you’re—" ],

This is a turning point for the province where, after nine years of paying down the recession deficits—a recession that didn’t start here, but a recession in which Ontario came out stronger than it was when it went in, and came out with a stronger GDP and a much more diversified province.", "I want to talk about one aspect of what Ontario gained in coming out of the recession. When I was elected in 2003, our commuters on the Milton line had five trains in the morning and five trains in the afternoon, each pulling 10 cars. They were packed, crowded beyond belief. Today, we have 10 trains going eastbound and we have 10 trains going westbound, each one of which pulls 12 cars. Since then, and during the recession, it’s been that capital investment that the province has made—using borrowed money—that has more than doubled our GO train service. That has made a big difference. You can now get a seat on the GO train. That’s important for people who need to connect between Mississauga and Toronto.", "As well, some things that didn’t exist: There’s a new bus repair depot where GO buses can start and finish their run in the Mississauga area and it’s located in Streetsville. It employs nearly 200 people. GO buses connect frequently to Toronto and to other points regularly during the day, and they have ample capacity for passenger demand. More importantly, you can use your Presto card, another innovation that occurred during that period where Ontario was coming out of the recession. It’s the best system in the world now. There’s a new GO train station in Lisgar, which opened in 2007 ahead of schedule and under budget. It was the first new GO train station built in the city of Mississauga in more than a quarter of a century.", "All of our western Mississauga GO stations have been upgraded. All of their platforms have been lengthened. There’s free WiFi in each station. The Presto card, which I mentioned earlier, has replaced coming downtown—which you used to have to do this way: cash fare for the MiWay bus, a 10-ride ticket for the GO train and tokens for the TTC. Now, with a single card, we can touch the card on the MiWay bus, touch it again at the GO station and touch it again to ride the TTC. That has replaced three different means of payment to three separate companies.", "As well, there’s a modern, mid-platform tunnel that connects the platform at the Streetsville GO station. Parking has been greatly expanded. There have been three—and soon to be four—extensions of parking at Streetsville. There have been two extensions of parking at Meadowvale. Meadowvale is going to get a brand-spanking-new station. Lisgar has been kept up to date. When it comes to transit, Ontario has done something.", "I would like to just quote briefly from a report tabled in late 2017 from our neighbours to the south. This is the American Society of Civil Engineers. The American Society of Civil Engineers are the people who build infrastructure. In contrast to the work that Ontario has done, the American Society of Civil Engineers says this about the United States: “America’s infrastructure bill is long overdue. Every four years, ASCE estimates the investment needed in each infrastructure category to maintain a state of good repair and earn a grade of B.” Most recently, the US in almost every facet has earned a grade of D.", "They continue to say, “Even though the US Congress in some states have recently made efforts to invest more in infrastructure, these efforts do not come close to the $2 trillion in needs.” The American Society of Civil Engineers says that “to raise the overall infrastructure grade and maintain” US “global competitiveness”—this is how far they’re behind; this is their infrastructure deficit—“an additional $206 billion each year.”", "They conclude by saying—here are the consequences to America:", "“—$3.9 trillion in losses to the US GDP by 2025;", "“—$7 trillion in lost business sales....; and", "“—2.5 million lost American jobs....", "“On top of these costs, hard-working American families will lose upwards of $3,400 in disposable income each year....”", "These are mistakes Ontario avoided through investment in the last nine years." ],

The polling shows that 81% of the province does not want this government to win.", "One of the members talked about listening to the American Society of Civil Engineers. I’m an engineer myself, and I think that we have to give them some credibility. But this government did not listen to the Ontario association of professional engineers back in 2011 when they talked about the problems that they were creating with the Green Energy Act and about how our system would not accept the power because they were adding in these inflexible systems. Of course, history proved them right, as we have the most expensive power in North America. That’s mainly because—not because Hydro One was sold, which was a mistake, but because of the Green Energy Act. This government just moved ahead on that.", "While we’re reading quotes, I have this article about “Ontario’s lost decade.” It’s interesting. It says, “Even if the Progressive Conservatives under Doug Ford, or the NDP under Andrea Horwath, win the June 7 election, no political party will be able to eliminate Ontario’s chronic deficits and runaway debt immediately, assuming they want to”— of course, we know the NDP doesn’t want to—“because of the enormous economic damage the Liberals have already caused” to our economy.", "That’s why people are frightened about another term.

This year’s budget for northern highways, once again, just blows that out of the water. There’s about $600 million to $650 million in this year’s budget for northern highways, which continues a pattern of major investments in northern highways right across the province.", "People will see the evidence very clearly, Speaker: four-laning from Toronto to North Bay on Highway 11; four-laning from Toronto to Sudbury, much of that project under way or completed, on Highway 69; and four-laning from Thunder Bay east to Nipigon, about a 60-mile roadway, with half to two thirds of that work concluded. So major investments in northern highways are continuing in this budget.", "Speaker, on Friday of last week, I had an opportunity to go out to a little rural village in my riding of Thunder Bay–Atikokan called Nolalu. I met with about 15 people out there. One of the questions I was asked was about broadband expansion. I took the opportunity to talk to them, that we, as a government, have already—this budget was not a starting point—invested through ministries and/or the Northern Ontario Heritage Fund, along with partnering companies, in a number of projects expanding broadband in rural Ontario.", "I also took the opportunity to remind them and to point out that this budget, which will be voted on very soon in the Legislature, has an additional $500 million in it over three years for northern and rural communities only. Speaker, it’s a major investment. We continue to recognize the needs of northern and rural Ontario. There’s a longer list of items I could list here; time does not allow.

We saw the same shtick before the last election, when the Liberals promised to lower insurance rates by 15% by 2015. Well, here we are in 2018 and rates are down about 3.3%. That was a central campaign promise the last time around, even if after the election the Premier tried to spin it by calling the promise a “stretch goal.” That is certainly not what they were saying before election day, and it’s certainly not what the people of Ontario voted for, which begs the question: Why should anyone trust what this government has to say now that another election has rolled around? They have proven themselves unwilling or unable to deliver for families in the province of Ontario.", "We can talk about what’s in this budget, which is supposed to be the Liberal plan for the future of our province, but what we can’t debate is all that they intend but won’t reveal. In the last election, the Liberals did not campaign on a carbon tax and selling off Hydro One. They didn’t tell voters that was what they would get with a Liberal government, and yet those major policy choices came to pass with no real consultation and no approval from the people of Ontario, which begs the question of what else they might be hiding.", "Similar concerns about what the Liberal government may be concealing were recently voiced by the Auditor General in the recent article in the Globe and Mail that delved into the questionable accounting practices the government adopted to keep the cost of the fair hydro plan off the book. The article quoted the AG extensively.", "“In order for that to not show up on the bottom line, they created creative accounting to take it off the government’s statements,” the Auditor General said.", "“If you get away with doing something that’s inappropriate accounting, the next time you’ll do it again and you’ll do it again,” she said. “Pretty soon they won’t have any numbers that will have any integrity behind them.”", "The average person may not appreciate how harsh the condemnation is, coming as it is from our Auditor General. I’ve heard other people, unrestrained by official titles, referring to this “creative accounting” as “Enron-style accounting,” and that’s not far off the mark. Enron did its best to keep assets off the books, to limit their own liability and to put the best face possible on things for investors. That’s exactly what we’re seeing here in Ontario. The government has set aside government accounting standards in order to artificially improve their budget numbers.", "The so-called fair hydro plan is a big, brazen example of the duplicity of this government. Another would be the changes they made to the rules around government advertising, freeing them from the oversight of the Auditor General.", "Then there was the sale of Hydro One, which eight of Ontario’s watchdogs condemned as it removed public oversight. That criticism came from our Auditor General, the Ombudsman, the Integrity Commissioner, the French Language Services Commissioner, the Environmental Commissioner, the Provincial Advocate for Children and Youth, the Information and Privacy Commissioner, and the Financial Accountability Officer.", "Speaker, it’s impossible to say what other schemes have been employed over the last 15 years to preserve political advantage, which is why the third-party audit that Doug Ford has committed to undertaking is so important.

The cost of living has gone up, thanks to rising taxes, fees, hydro, gasoline, natural gas, car insurance, tuition, housing and rent—all things that this government has either caused or ignored. If they wanted to improve any of these things, they have had 15 years to do it and they have chosen not to. Clearly, the commitment is not there. They don’t care about how unaffordable life has become for the average person in Ontario.", "The truth is that Liberal politicians and the elites they govern aren’t people who have to check their balance before they make a withdrawal. They wave off an extra $5 here or an extra $30 there, saying, “It’s no big deal.”", "Cap-and-trade, Drive Clean, higher licence fees, higher taxes on alcohol and the death tax: It all adds up to a very big deal for a lot of families in this province when the price of absolutely everything seems to be on the rise.", "Last week, I was asking the government about the rising price of gasoline, which is set to hit the highest price in a decade over the coming summer. Two ministers took turns shrugging that off, with no apparent concern for how it is impacting the cost of living and no willingness to take responsibility for driving the price even higher with cap-and-trade.", "As a result of all of this, levels of household debt in this province have ballooned.

In 2016, the average debt accumulated by each household was $154,000.", "When you go out and talk to people with young families—two-income families—this debt isn’t coming from extravagant trips or fancy technology.

These are families who, frankly, deserve a lot more respect from this government.", "Funding more programs is not the answer here. It’s leading to taking money from one pocket just to put a little back in another. That’s not helpful for a family’s bottom lines.

A little over a week ago, Maclean’s published a piece that said, “EKOS’ most recent results show the Wynne Liberals lead only among upper class Ontarians. Support drops by half with working class voters, then by a third among poor voters. Liberals may not know it—and probably don’t understand why—but they are the party of class privilege.", "“And in this economy, that’s a shrinking electoral segment.”", "The provincial debt and the household debt are both at extraordinary highs. When interest rates go up, the implications for our economy are extremely worrying. Consumer spending will drop and government revenue will fall at the same time as the payments due on the provincial debt rise. As it is, over $12 billion is being spent every year just to service Ontario’s debt. That’s $12 billion of taxpayers’ hard-earned money that isn’t going towards health care, education or poverty reduction. We are less able to reliably fund all the things that this government claims to care about, because of their fiscal choices. The same can be said about the NDP, who have come forward with a plan for nothing but more deficit spending.", "Just today, we heard from the federal Parliamentary Budget Officer about how detrimental the carbon tax, supported in Ontario by the Liberals and NDP, will be to Canada’s economy.

This amounts to $10 billion in 2022.”", "Federally and provincially, Liberals are keeping families and businesses in the dark about the true cost of the carbon tax. My private member’s bill, the Transparency in Gas Pricing Act, passed second reading last year but was never called to committee. That bill would have at least brought some transparency to how much natural gas users are paying for cap-and-trade, the cost of which is currently buried in their bills.", "I would also just like to take this opportunity to remind the Liberal government of all the taxes that they are already collecting besides the carbon tax. We have many taxes, and I’m going to list, I guess, a few of them.

We know by being here for a number of years that there’s one thing the Liberals and NDP like, and that is taxing.", "The deficit has not gone down, but our credit rating has. And yet we keep seeing shortfall after shortfall, with no indication that spending is being brought under control, which is a big problem for a province that is the largest subnational borrower in the world. As the spending continues, more money will ultimately have to come from somewhere, so before this government goes looking for other ways to squeeze money from taxpayers, they need to look at what they’re taxing right now. Before this government goes looking for more new revenue tools, as they like to call them, I would suggest they look at the many, many, many such taxes they already have in place.", "It’s not just with economic issues that this government has let families down. In my riding of Lambton–Kent–Middlesex, there are families that are incredibly frustrated with this government because their water wells have become contaminated. They never had any issue with drawing clean, clear water from their wells until wind turbine construction began in the area thanks to the Liberals’ and the NDP’s Green Energy Act. This construction involved pile-driving into the black shale bedrock that carries the water of the aquifer. Where is the accountability? These families are looking to government to stand up for them and hold the wind company to account. Instead, my repeated calls on their behalf for a health hazard investigation have been ignored, and the government has chosen to accept the word of Samsung that their turbines and construction practices aren’t the cause of this contamination in spite of the empirical evidence.", "The bottom line is that we can’t trust anything in this budget.

Already last week, this budget prompted Moody’s Investors Service to downgrade Ontario’s economic outlook from stable to negative.", "I would like to take a moment to go over the rationale given by Moody’s for their downgrade because it offers a pretty objective assessment of how the Liberals are managing Ontario’s economy:", "“The outlook change to negative from stable on Ontario’s ratings reflects Moody’s expectations that spending pressure will challenge the province’s ability to sustain balanced fiscal results across multiple years. Furthermore Moody’s assumes that the financing requirements will be larger than previously assumed leading to an upward trend in the debt burden and a faster rise in interest expense than previously anticipated.", "“With an election set for 7 June, the government released a 2018 budget that introduces a number of new spending initiatives and materially increases the capital infrastructure spending relative to previous plans. While this budget may not be implemented post-election, in Moody’s opinion it highlights growing spending pressure that will need to be addressed in the near future. As the economy is expected to slow, with real GDP growth forecasted to fall from 2.7% in 2017 to 1.7% by 2021, revenue generation will be slower than previously recorded, limiting the province’s ability to rely on revenue growth to balance the spending pressure. Downward pressure on revenue generation would be amplified if the province were to face unexpected negative economic shocks. Furthermore, as sustained low interest rates have pushed consumer debt to record levels over the past decade, the province will likely face increased challenges to introduce new revenue measures despite a high level of policy flexibility.", "“The province’s debt is expected to measure 233% of revenues in 2017-18, up from Moody’s previous estimate of 227%. Financing to fund deficits and capital spending will continue to push the debt burden higher, with Moody’s expectations that it could exceed 240% by 2021-22. Moody’s assesses this level of debt to be elevated compared to similar rated peers. Increased debt financing will also occur during a time of rising interest rates, which will accelerate the increase of the province’s interest expense. Measuring an anticipated 8.3% of revenues in 2017-18, which is already the highest measure of Aa2 rated Canadian provinces, interest expense could consume 9% of revenue in 2020-21 and continue to increase thereafter as interest rates are expected to rise. An increasing interest expense is expected to further challenge the budget planning of the province.”", "Speaker, as I said, that was from Moody’s. Moody’s can see the writing on the wall, even if this Liberal government wants to keep their heads in the sand. Their spending habits are out of control and the burdens they placed on our private sector are taking a serious toll on our economy. It’s clear that this government is selfishly and irresponsibly willing to put the good of the Liberal Party and their election chances ahead of what is good for the people of this province.", "I know we all hear it here, whether we’re meeting with families in our ridings, whether we’re meeting with small businesses, farmers, medium and large businesses: Everyone is deeply concerned about the direction of Ontario. When we have a debt level in the province of Ontario where every man, woman and child in this province owes $23,000, that just speaks to 15 years of what this Liberal government has done to the province of Ontario." ],

Do you know who that would benefit, Speaker? That would benefit Doug Ford. He wants to give himself a tax break, and while he’s giving himself a tax break, he opposes taking the minimum wage to $15 an hour. Instead, he says he’s going to give them a tax credit, I believe it was. Do you know what that tax credit will do if you keep them at $14 and don’t take it to $15? You’re taking $1,000 out of the pockets of hard-working Ontarians. Shame on them." ],

Doug Ford, if he’s Premier, is going to put a stop to any further green energy programs in Ontario when we win, and we’re going to put an end to the expansion of any further green energy. I know the NDP will be disappointed in that because they supported the Liberal government. I remember in 2009 when they voted for it. In 2011, we could have driven a stake through the heart of the green energy program, and they were supported by the NDP at the time.

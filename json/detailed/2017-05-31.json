  "text" : [ "It’s interesting the way that the morning has started off already.", "We’ve been talking about electricity for about the last six years that I’ve been here, certainly, in this Legislature, and the mess that the Liberal government has made in the electricity sector. They’ve been scrambling over the last several months to try and make up for the mess that they’ve made in the electricity sector. Previously, on “As the Grid Burns,” we had a government that had overseen hydro increases in some parts of the province that were well over 300% since they had taken power.", "Better than 70% of what the government has spent on energy since taking power in 2003 has been on new generation. Coal was replaced by natural gas. While my colleagues on the opposite side of the House like to think that coal was replaced by wind and solar, it simply wasn’t. First, as the Minister of Energy said just yesterday at the National Energy Roundtable conference, coal was 25% of the supply mix. On a given year, wind is about 5% and solar is about 1%.", "They also can’t do things, from a technical perspective, that coal was doing in the system. That’s another reason that coal was replaced by natural gas. You can’t replace a technology capable of doing voltage control or load-following with technologies that can’t—and wind and solar can’t do those things.", "The more than 70% of new generation that the government put on the grid has already cost us $37 billion above market value, and is going to cost us $133 billion more by the time these contracts are over. By the way, we actually told the government at the time that this was going to happen, only to have the Minister of Energy at the time tell us that the increases were only going to be 1% per year, Mr. Speaker. I’ve already indicated it’s been 300% in some parts of the province. We’re going to call that the first time that the Tories were right, because it starts a trend.", "So the government made electricity really expensive, and then came up with two bills to try to mitigate that. This House unanimously passed the HST rebate last year, after the Liberals spent years railing against it when it was first introduced in November 2011. I can remember in my first election we had members who are still ministers in this government telling us why we couldn’t take the HST off hydro bills. Now we’re doing it. That’s the second time that the Tories were right, Mr. Speaker.", "In front of us, we have Bill 132, the unfair Liberal hydro scheme. When the bill was introduced, the House was provided with a cabinet document that was leaked by a whistle-blower who was concerned about the long-term costs of the plan. The government first said that the document was wrong. It then said that the document was old. When the Financial Accountability Officer issued his report, we found out that the document was right. I’m going to call that the third time that the Tories were right on this issue.", "Now, here’s the thing: I don’t want to be proven right in the long gaze of history a fourth time when it comes to the electricity sector. I’d really rather just be listened to right now. I’d rather the Financial Accountable Officer be listened to right now. I’d rather that the Auditor General be listened to right now.", "Last week alone, we heard from the province’s two fiscal legislative officers about their concerns about the financial structure of this bill. One confirmed the fact that it’s the government’s intent to bring in a debt retirement charge—under a different name, of course; they wouldn’t want to call it the “debt retirement charge.” But this debt retirement charge is actually going to be four times the size of the old debt retirement charge. It’s the debt retirement charge coming back on steroids.", "The Auditor General confirmed something that I actually said in my leadoff speech on the bill, which is that the only reason that this new debt entity was created over at OPG as a result of this bill, Bill 132, is to keep all of that debt off the government’s books. That’s a manoeuvre that caused members of the opposing benches to howl the last time that something even similar was proposed.", "Yet at every opportunity to introduce more oversight at committee and give these legislative officers a greater role in making sure this legislation was transparent, guess what the government members did at committee? They shot it down every time. It didn’t matter if we were trying to bring in Auditor General oversight or not, transparency to the system, to the bill, to this government’s inner workings: They shot it down every time, at least two opposition motions for unanimous consent just to give the Auditor General increased oversight authority. When this much money changes hands, we’re denied by government members, because, hey, they’ve got their marching orders. We haven’t even talked yet about how much money we’re dealing with. We’ll get to that in a minute.", "The Financial Accountability Officer’s projections were based on two things happening that have never happened in Ontario’s history: We would have to balance the budget for 29 consecutive years and interest rates would never rise over that time. If those two things don’t happen at the same time, for exactly that long, then the cost of this plan could end up anywhere between $68 billion and $93 billion—$68 billion and $93 billion—just to get the Liberals through the next election campaign without electricity prices being at the top of people’s minds.", "I don’t think it’s going to work, Mr. Speaker. I think people are still going to be upset about the increased cost of electricity, because as I mentioned earlier, in many parts of the province, electricity prices are 300% higher than they were when this Liberal government took power.", "Of course, the government believes that a potential cost of $68 billion to $93 billion deserves 10 minutes of debate in the Legislature this morning: 10 minutes from me, 10 minutes from my friend from the NDP and 10 minutes from, I’m assuming, the Minister of Energy. I have no confidence that the ministry has any appreciation of what it has actually done here.", "In my speech to this bill at second reading, I mentioned the fact that from 1997 until 2013, a grand total of $50 billion in these types of bonds had been issued in all of the United States, according to Moody’s—$50 billion. With the figures we have from the Financial Accountability Officer, we now know that this potential debt bond that’s being created here in Ontario is $45 billion. I want members to think about that. Over 16 years, the entire United States posted only $50 billion in this type of debt. In 20 days, this government will almost equal that. As I said, I have no confidence that the ministry has any appreciation of what’s being done here. As a matter of fact, the Globe said it perfectly this morning: “Liberal political expedience never” changes.", "What information we’ve received from the ministry through official channels has been at best incomplete and sometimes not even that. I take some comfort in the fact that in meetings with Ontario Power Generation, they seem to know what they’re doing. However, I’m reminded that, at committee, the government gave itself the power to remove OPG as the financial services manager if OPG became unwilling to do what it’s told by this government. We tried to get the government to change this, but guess what the government members at committee did, Speaker? They said no.", "So, in other words—I just want to explain that further—if OPG thought that the government was trying to pay for things with this debt issue that shouldn’t go into it, the government could deem OPG to be unwilling, under this legislation, and simply replace it as the financial services manager. There’s no further impediment to this becoming a place where the government can bury any off-book costs that it wants to—none. There’s even a clause for it in section 1. It reads, “such other costs ... as may be prescribed.” That gives the minister the opportunity to throw everything but the kitchen sink over into this new debt entity at OPG. He can throw the kitchen sink in, too, if he wants. It’s a chef’s dream, if you’re the Minister of Finance, to be able to throw whatever you want into this concoction that you’re cooking up.", "You can hide anything from the auditor in it, because as I mentioned earlier, the government kept us from adding any oversight. You can violate public sector accounting standards, you can bury people in debt, you can do it all in 20 days, and you can expect to be thanked for it. You can actually run ads using electricity customers’ own money to congratulate yourself for doing this. You can purchase millions of dollars in radio ads to pat yourself on the back for creating, potentially, a $93-billion debt entity.", "In closing, I want to paraphrase the American playwright Peter Stone, who wrote that, “One useless man is called a disgrace; that two are called a law firm; and that three or more become a” government. Mr. Speaker, the Ontario people have had enough of this government. They won’t be fooled again." ],

  "text" : [ "I appreciate the opportunity to talk this morning, even if it’s so very briefly.", "We’re about to decide—this chamber is about to vote on—a bill that will add $45 billion or more to people’s hydro bills. Thirty minutes of debate: That’s extraordinary, and it’s not because the matter before us is minor, but because this government doesn’t want this bill debated in public. It wants to have electricity customers pay for advertising promoting its profile, promoting what it sees as a wonderful decision, but they don’t actually want the substance debated. And that’s why we’ve gone through a process, as my colleague from the official opposition said, of very, very brief debate—at every point this government jamming it through—because it doesn’t want this discussed.", "Speaker, people need to understand that inside this cream puff of a bill, this tasty morsel of reduced hydro prices for the next little while—most particularly leading up to the election—there is a fish hook. People will have their bills cut for a few years. They will get Liberal advertising in their hydro bills. The election will come and the Liberals hope—hope—that people will have moved off the hydro issue as something that they’re upset with the government about. Who knows? They may be right. I have real doubts; it’s not what I’m picking up at the door. I have people here in Toronto who tell me and people in Sault Ste. Marie who told me that they understood entirely what was going on: that they were going to get a break on their bill for a short period and then they were going to have their wallets and purses raided.", "So in a few years, that hook in this bill will catch, and people will see their bills go up by at least 7% a year just from the cost of repaying this $45 billion—and they will notice; have no doubt, Speaker, they will notice, because that increase doesn’t include all the other cost pressures in the system. All of the other factors that will be driving up the price will be on top of that 7%.", "As you may be aware, Speaker, Darlington nuclear power plant, which provides somewhere in the range of 20% to 25% of the power in this province, is going to see its rates go up from about six cents per kilowatt hour to 16 cents per kilowatt hour, almost tripling. It’s a major contributor to the electricity grid, and people will notice that rise in cost. With the Bruce nuclear refurbishment, I’m assuming that the numbers will be very similar, so for the bulk of power generation in this province we’re going to see the cost almost triple at the same time as the Liberals have set up this financial trap which will crank up the rates about 7% a year, and then leave us with rates higher than we have ever had.", "The cost pressures won’t just be from the nuclear refurbishment, not just from repayment of this pre-election goodie, but we will also be paying for surplus power that we will be exporting to the United States at dimes on the dollar. And I expect that we will see more surplus power because prices are high enough now that it’s economic for people to bail out of the system, and they are—they are. It isn’t just that they’re conserving, but people are substantially cutting their reliance on this electricity system. As they do, those who are left behind face higher bills. This bill sets the stage for destabilization of the hydro system. No one can predict how that will turn out, except likely with a lot of tears.", "Let’s review again: The Liberals in their 14 years in office have abandoned their commitment to public ownership of the hydro system; they’ve decided that putting profits on top of people’s hydro costs is something that they were entirely happy with. We didn’t have to pay profits on top of our hydro bills back when the system was publicly owned, but we do now with this government.", "This privatized system produces more power than we need or can consume, which means we’re paying for power we can’t use—power that we have to dump in neighbouring jurisdictions, power that we sometimes have to pay people to take. That’s the logic of the privatized system set up by the Liberals. This is a government that doesn’t want to make conservation its first choice when it makes investments in the system because that would deprive powerful owners of generating capacity from the profits they get from selling power, whether we need it or not.", "So we are faced with soaring hydro prices and the Liberals are faced with an election conundrum of how to deal with this; how to cover over the mess they’ve created in the 14 years they’ve been in power—an approach that they inherited from the Conservatives and one that they have joyfully, even gleefully, continued on.", "They’re going to set us up to be in a position to pay back that $45 billion—or more, depending on interest rates; we could be talking as high as $93 billion. Once they get through the election, frankly, that isn’t something that they are concerned about. Really, their universe ends when the last ballots are cast in the next election. After that, they really don’t care what the consequences are.", "That was pretty much at the heart of the gas plant scandal: They were facing a tough election; they had seats that were at risk. They were willing to blow a billion dollars to save four seats. This time, they’re willing to put ratepayers in this province at risk for $45 billion to $90 billion to get through an election. Speaker, one always has to leave reserves for an extraordinary cynicism when it comes to this government, because if you aren’t extraordinarily cynical, you can’t understand how they operate; you get confused.", "In order to make all of this work, the Liberals had to go through committee. They had to put forward amendments to the bill. We put forward amendments: for transparency, for regulation, for some sort of public control and oversight, but those didn’t satisfy this government.", "Interestingly, one of the amendments they brought forward was to give them the power to ditch OPG as the financial services manager of this whole scheme for whatever reasons occurred to them. We had questions. Legal counsel from the Ministry of Energy was summoned before the committee. We got to ask a few questions, and then I posed the question: Is this being set up so that if OPG is privatized, they can move the financial services manager to another body? At that point the lawyer was shut down; questions were blocked.", "This government doesn’t believe in the idea of a government running things, providing infrastructure. They believe in selling off what we own. So it was entirely logical to assume, given they sold off Hydro One, they privatized new power generation, that they would be considering the sale of Ontario Power Generation and would react sharply to any question that raised that in committee. Any such question is not allowed, it’s blocked, it’s shut down. Any attempt to give the Ontario Energy Board some regulatory power, some oversight, was blocked by this government.", "Speaker, 14 years of Liberal government have given us an unmanageable and unaffordable electricity system. The waters are being calmed by the applications of large amounts of dollars, but, in the end, those dollars will get soggy, they will sink, and the mess that we’re in will become entirely apparent again to people who will have to pick up the tab.", "This government does not care what happens to the people of Ontario. The only thing they care about is getting elected in the election next year." ],

Si elle est adoptée, cette loi réduirait les factures d’électricité de 25 % en moyenne pour les consommateurs résidentiels dès cet été.

Monsieur le Président, permettez-moi de m’expliquer.", "Tout d’abord, le Programme de protection des tarifs d’électricité dans les régions rurales et éloignées, ou le PPTERRE, serait élargi pour fournir un nouveau programme de protection des taux de livraison qui donnerait un redressement des frais de livraison par les sociétés de distribution locales ayant les tarifs les plus élevés. Cette modification permettrait à environ 800 000 abonnés de bénéficier du programme, contre 350 000 aujourd’hui.", "À titre d’exemple, un abonné à faible densité d’Hydro One qui se chauffe à l’électricité et qui consomme 2 500 kilowattheures par mois verra une réduction de son tarif de distribution d’environ 75 $ par mois, soit une économie totale de 135 $ si l’on tient entièrement compte du PPTERRE.", "mai 2017.", "janvier 2016, le POAFE a approuvé plus de 192 000 ménages à faible revenu qui recevront des crédits mensuels sur leur facture. Nous travaillons également avec le ministère des Services sociaux et communautaires pour accroître la participation au POAFE de clients déjà inscrits dans d’autres programmes provinciaux d’aide sociale.", "Prenant la parole sur le Plan ontarien pour des frais d’électricité équitables après son annonce au début de mars, M. Alan Spacek, maire de Kapuskasing et président actuel de la Fédération des municipalités du Nord de l’Ontario, a déclaré ceci : « Nous sommes ravis que les abonnés puissent voir les résultats positifs du [plan] dans un proche avenir, avec l’engagement que les tarifs n’augmenteront pas au-delà du taux d’inflation pendant les quatre prochaines années. » Puisque je suis moi-même du Nord, j’apprécie ses commentaires favorables.", "Troisièmement, si elle est adoptée, la loi éliminerait les frais de livraison pour tous les clients résidentiels des Premières Nations dans les réserves grâce à un nouveau crédit de livraison. La Commission de l’énergie de l’Ontario estime que cela fournirait aux clients admissibles une économie mensuelle moyenne de 85 $, soit plus de 1 000 $ par année. De plus, les clients résidentiels des Premières Nations dans les réserves sont automatiquement admissibles. Cela représente quelque 21 500 clients au total.", "Nous aidons également à faciliter de meilleurs échanges d’information entre les distributeurs et les conseils de bande pour mieux identifier tous les clients des Premières Nations dans les réserves. Cette mesure proposée a été bien accueillie par les dirigeants des Premières Nations et leurs communautés. Parmi eux, le chef régional de l’Ontario, Isadore Day, a déclaré que le crédit sur les lignes d’approvisionnement permettrait de « réduire la pauvreté énergétique » dans les collectivités des Premières Nations. Cela ouvre la voie vers une meilleure qualité de vie pour les Premières Nations de l’Ontario.", "Donc, je suis convaincu que, si elle est adoptée, la Loi pour des frais d’électricité équitables permettrait de réduire les tarifs d’électricité et de profiter à tous les abonnés résidentiels et à peut-être un demi-million de petites entreprises à travers la province.

It’s called Nepean–Carleton. It is the largest geographic and population-based riding in Ottawa. It has the largest population and most diverse in all of eastern Ontario.", "As I go to events throughout the region, particularly now because of the high growth, I do a lot of community events in downtown Ottawa. In fact, Speaker, I can tell you something: On Saturday, I could spend my morning in the most rural part of Ottawa, in a community called Vernon and I could be at a farmers’ market in North Gower, and then in the evening I could be at a wonderful event celebrating Indo-Canadian culture with the high commissioner. And I can go to an event that is designed for the African Canadian community, which I did last week at Aberdeen Pavilion, or I could be at the mosque or at the synagogue. This is important to me, because as I get to know the people whom I represent, and I have over the past 11 years, I realize that together we are a stronger community. It makes me very proud after having grown up in a very small, largely homogeneous community in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia, where I’m very proud to be from, but it makes me understand that there is a big world out there.", "I used to have a dream, as a young girl, that I would know at least one person from every province in Canada. I’ve exceeded that, Speaker, but the wonderful thing today is that I now have a dream for my own daughter, that not only does she know people from the rest of her country and the rest of her province, but that she understands, accepts and embraces the diversity that we have in Nepean–Carleton, in the communities of Barrhaven, Findlay Creek, Riverside South, Manotick, Bells Corners, Trend-Arlington and Craig Henry.", "When I approach this position as the anti-racism critic—and I was just given this role a few months back by my leader; this is my first bill, my first opportunity to engage with the stakeholders in this portfolio—I must say it’s become an exciting one. It’s become exciting for me because I’ve gotten to see some of the challenges that people have faced through systemic racism in the province of Ontario, but I was able to listen to them to find out how we can change that and solve the problems.", "Throughout this debate, I’ve had the opportunity to meet with some very interesting people. I was very forceful, Speaker, as you know, in trying to ensure that anti-Semitism found its way into this legislation. I’m pleased to say that at committee on Monday, when we met for clause-by-clause, the government accepted my premise that anti-Semitism should be included in the legislation.

It came to light just a few months ago that the first woman ever to be put on Canadian currency, outside of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, would be a young lady called Viola Desmond. Now, Viola has passed away, but I’m going to share with everybody in this Legislature a story because I knew who Viola Desmond was before I was the age of these pages who are here in this House. This is a good story for them because I don’t know if you’ve ever heard of Viola Desmond. I’m going to actually speak to the pages for a moment, Speaker, if that’s okay, if you’ll indulge me.", "Viola Desmond was a young woman from Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. She was travelling. She defies all odds of being on the currency and I’m going to tell you why. She was about 16 years old. She owned her own company. She grew up in rural Nova Scotia and she was a black woman.", "One day, she wanted to go to the Roseland Theatre. I want the pages to look around here. See the galleries? The Roseland Theatre, which is still there today, was a place where I would go when I was your age. There was a gallery, much like this, where people would sit, and then there was a gallery up at the top. Back then, in those early days, in the 1940s and 1950s, there was still racial segregation. It meant that the people who were watching movies on the ground floor were white and the people who were watching from the gallery were black.", "Viola Desmond, at about 16 years old, decided enough was enough. She decided to challenge that. What Viola Desmond did is she walked right down and she plunked herself right where she wanted to, where it was most comfortable. She took off her shoes and she sat with the white men. For that, she was charged, and she was taken out of that movie theatre.", "Now, by today’s standards we think that’s wrong, don’t we? That’s completely wrong and unacceptable. But she was a civil rights leader before there were civil rights leaders in the United States. She was the first to take a stand in North America that way. We’ve all heard of Rosa Parks. She was Rosa Parks before there was a Rosa Parks. It wasn’t until the late 1960s I think when the province of Nova Scotia understood that this was wrong and started to restore her. She died before she ever got an apology from the province of Nova Scotia.", "But I’ll tell you something: This is instructive of what it means to be a Canadian, and I’ll tell you why. She has defied all odds—rural, Maritimer, young, woman, black—and she’s the first female in Canadian history, outside of Queen Elizabeth II, to grace our currency. She was the underdog of all underdogs. I had the pleasure of speaking and rising in this House to announce that, because what could be considered a very black mark on the community I grew up in—they understood after that incident that that was wrong. So the community I grew up in has embraced Viola Desmond.", "We had a wonderful civil rights leader who came after her, Dr. Carrie Best. My parents made sure I knew who both of them were. There is a plaque on a monument in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia, where we have taken my daughter so she has gotten to see this very important piece of Canadian history.", "What does that have to do with the legislation, Speaker? It has everything to do with the legislation because today not only do we have to fight anti-black racism; we know that for decades, for centuries, there have been systemic challenges faced by our indigenous population, but more and more today we see anti-Muslim bigotry, we see anti-Semitism—it’s reported almost weekly. All of this will be addressed in this piece of legislation.", "More than that, as our country grows, as we understand and recognize that 60% of Ontarians are either first- or second-generation Canadian, we’re not the same as we were 10 or 20 years ago. As we see around the world, people are inflaming differences rather than seeing what unites us, and what unites us are our core democratic values, the values that we share: peace, order, good governance. We share those values. That’s why people come from all around the world to live here.", "But we must make sure that the children who are growing up today don’t see physical differences. That’s what our job is in this Legislature. It’s my job as a mother. It’s my job as a legislator to ensure that people are treated equally under the law regardless of who they love, what they look like or how they pray.", "That has become increasingly important to me as I see the growth in my own constituency of Nepean–Carleton. I’m very, very proud to represent a riding inside the city of Ottawa. Nepean–Carleton will split into two and a half ridings in the next election; some will go to Orléans and will be represented by the member from Orléans. It’s interesting to see that because I’ve always had to have that balance of managing rapid growth and expansion, and at the same time protecting the rural agrarian roots of some of the villages in the old Carleton county.", "What I’ve noticed in the past 11 years that I’ve been here is the welcoming atmosphere of not only my community but this entire province in embracing people and diversity. I’ve spoken many times about my community—hopefully, God willing, I will be back here after 2018 to represent Nepean, where I live. I’ve talked many times about our cultural communities and the sheer fascination I have. For example, last weekend I was at the Chinese newcomers’ event in Ottawa. A lot of these cultural communities actually will have events in my community or I’ll be invited to go to downtown Ottawa. I’ll sometimes see the members from the government side who are largely from Ottawa as well, and we’ll go to these wonderful events.", "I’ll just give you an example of my weekend. I told you I went to a farmers’ market. I then went to a Top Shelf hockey game. I saw little girls and little boys playing hockey, and had a little barbeque there. I had people come from everywhere—and they literally did come from everywhere.", "After that we went to an event with the Kerala community, as I mentioned, with the Indian high commissioner. I had an opportunity to speak to people and tell them about my trip to India. What’s very interesting, of course, is that the Indian high commissioner actually said that India is the largest democracy in the world, and so is Canada. You’re going to say, “How does that even make sense?” India is the largest population that shares our democratic values and we have the largest country geographically.", "So it was interesting and fascinating, because when you look at India, for example, they have multiple ethnicities, multiple languages. It is a very large place. What was wonderful about this particular event celebrating the Kerala region is that they actually brought people from the Gujaratis, from different parts of India that have their own different organizations. That was really wonderful. Then, of course, I went to this wonderful Chinese event. I had an opportunity to speak and to talk to people. Oftentimes I run into a former member of this place, who is the current mayor of Ottawa, Jim Watson, who is doing a lot of cultural outreach as well.", "And so it’s really important for me when I go to these events to make sure that my constituents know that their province, that their country, does not want to see systemic racism and wants to ensure that they feel comfortable and know that they will not be judged based on how they look, how they pray or who they love, which brings me to an event that I’ve spoken about many times in this House and makes me very, very proud. I started to get bothered after the American election with all of the negative rhetoric. I wanted to do something in my area to bring together the Christian, Jewish and Muslim faiths, as well as those in society who may feel marginalized because of their different cultural or ethnic background. So we had a Day of Humanity, Inclusion and Acceptance. We held it at our local synagogue, the Ottawa Torah Centre.", "Speaker, I’m going to go through the day because it was so uplifting. It was one of the most amazing days. I think it could be a model and a template for every member here. What we effectively did is we had the Ottawa Local Immigration Partnership come in and talk about the changing demographics of Ottawa. People think that in Ottawa we’re all a bunch of civil servants and we all look the same. We don’t; we’re different people. We’re a big city; we’re the second-largest in Ontario; we are the fifth-largest in Canada. We can actually fit the cities of Montreal, Toronto, Calgary, Edmonton and Vancouver inside of our city boundaries because we are the largest agricultural city in the world. We are big.", "But we’re also growing. We are almost one million people, and those one million people are coming from different places. About 50% of our population is diverse. I think they almost mentioned that about 70% were racialized. So I think what was important for me was to bring all of those communities together.", "So we had that conversation with the Ottawa immigration partnership. Then we moved in to what I thought was a very fun exercise. A lot of us participated, including our local city councillor, Jan Harder, who has ushered in most of the growth inside the city of Ottawa. What we did then was, we had my rabbi, Rabbi Blum. I call him my rabbi. I also have an imam. I also have a minister. I think that’s just fantastic; everybody should, because you should have relationships with lots of different people.", "In any event, Rabbi Blum and his friend Dr. Aisha Sherazi—she’s a young hijabi mother and he is a rabbi—walk in and they try to strip down the differences and the preconceived notions that we all have. It became a very fun and interactive process for us to go through. When we finished that, Speaker, the rabbi left his pulpit to our local imam, Zijad Delic. Imam Delic is a wonderful man. He talked about what it means to be a Canadian—very passionate, very forceful.", "We started to notice, at the beginning of the day, maybe being afraid of change and all of that, to actually confronting maybe some of our own internal biases and then realizing that people are beyond just what they look like. We moved in to what it meant to be a Canadian.", "Then we had Brian Lee Cowley, who runs the Macdonald-Laurier Institute. He talked about what makes Canada great. And as our passion, our pride and our patriotism rose, we then brought in four Canadians who were survivors of genocide—in the Holocaust, Rwanda, Armenia and the recent crisis the Yazidis are facing in Syria and Iran. They talked about why they wanted to come to Canada after they had survived such horrors, why they wanted to be Canadians. It wasn’t just for their safety; it was for their values.", "One that I want to leave you with, one experience, was the survivor of the Rwandan genocide. She watched her family be murdered. She was shot multiple times. Can you imagine that trauma? They sent her to Canada all by herself. She spoke to us about longing to go back to Rwanda to see if she could find at least one of her siblings. She needed closure in Rwanda. So she went back and she found a younger sister. They built a monument to their family and to their community after they had been killed in a genocide. Then she wanted to come back to Canada. Now she lives in the city of Ottawa; she lives in Orleans.", "These are important stories, and I’m going to finish with this one last one. I talk about my daughter all the time. Hopefully next year, she’s going to be a page. She goes to Manordale Public School, and they have about 50 or 60 young Syrian refugees. I’ve been worried about their mental health, as I have been an advocate of mental health. I worry about the kids having sufficient language resources, and their parents.", "I was talking two weeks ago about some of their experiences, and I just asked around in the community. One particular young fellow was a bit aggressive, and I said, “So, how does that work?” Through a translator, the father told my friend, “My boy was a good boy, but he saw his family being murdered by ISIS and he’s never quite been the same.”", "If we think we’re all the same, at the end of the day, we do have similarities, what’s inside. So I beg of everybody in this assembly to look beyond physical appearance, look beyond how people dress, look beyond how people pray, look beyond who people love, and think of those little boys and girls who come to this country for a better life. It’s important that we ensure that they feel safe and comfortable, and that they feel that their province will stand up against any discrimination they may face.", "With that, I appreciate the opportunity to rise here today in support of this bill on behalf of Patrick Brown and the entire Progressive Conservative caucus.", "I will say this one other thing; I haven’t had an opportunity to speak to it. On Sunday, a video arose that was very anti-francophone. My leader, Patrick Brown, acted swiftly and moved and removed a member of our caucus.", "Interjections." ],

  "text" : [ "I rise today on behalf of the Ontario NDP caucus to speak to Bill 114, the Anti-Racism Act, during third reading debate.", "I have to say, Speaker, that I rise with somewhat mixed emotions this morning. This is a day that should truly be a day of celebration in this province. It is a day when we come together in this Legislature to demonstrate unity, to show our shared resolve, our strong commitment to dealing with racial injustice in this province, to advancing racial equity, to eliminating systemic racism, to addressing the deeply entrenched—embedded—barriers that black communities and indigenous communities have experienced for decades, the hate-motivated attacks against Jewish communities and Muslim communities that have only grown more frequent in the recent past.", "We have before us a piece of legislation that is taking very strong and important steps to dealing with that completely unacceptable issue in our province. Yet, in the face of this third reading debate that we are having today, I have to reflect on the process that led to this third reading version of the bill, the process that took us through the clause-by-clause debate on this legislation just a couple of days ago, on Monday of this week.", "We’ve heard a lot from this government throughout the announcement of the anti-racism strategy, throughout the bringing forward of this bill, that collaboration is absolutely essential if we are to effectively deal with systemic racism. We agree, and yet that process that took us through the clause-by-clause analysis of this bill on Monday was not collaborative, Speaker. Sadly, it showed a pettiness on behalf of the government that I found, quite frankly, unacceptable. I saw the government playing games with the time allocation motion that the government itself had written.", "Let’s remember: This Liberal government has a majority. They have complete control over the contents of their time allocation motion. They have complete control over how long they will allocate to debate on a bill, over the deadlines by which amendments have to be submitted, over the length of debate that is going to take place during this third reading process. The government’s time allocation motion on this bill set a specific time deadline for amendments to be submitted, and so one would have expected that the government would honour that deadline, that the government would be prepared to review amendments that were received in advance of that deadline. Otherwise, why would they have set that deadline? They should have been staffed up, ready to review amendments and to consider the impact of those amendments on this legislation.", "Instead, what we saw on Monday was that every single amendment that was submitted by the NDP caucus within the deadline that had been determined in the time allocation motion was rejected by this government under the rationale that the government had not had time to review the NDP amendments. These were amendments that were submitted within the process that the government itself created, and yet the government showed no willingness, no interest whatsoever to consider the amendments that the NDP put forward. One wonders why this government created a timeline that they were not in any way prepared to respect in dealing with this bill.", "If we were engaged in a process of collective bargaining, this would be called bad-faith bargaining, Speaker. It did not show good faith on behalf of this government. It did not show a willingness to collaborate, a willingness to listen to all sides and strengthen the legislation that was before us and move forward in the interests of the people of this province on an issue that must be addressed, on an issue that has a profound impact on black Ontarians, on our Muslim communities, on our Jewish communities, on our indigenous first peoples in this province. Yet we saw the government completely unwilling to even review the amendments that the NDP put forward.", "I have to say, Speaker, that what was particularly galling for me as the NDP representative during that clause-by-clause process was that the government kept telling me that the NDP had declined the government’s outreach to engage in a conversation about amendments. I have to say that my office received a single email from the minister’s office on Friday at 2:30 in the afternoon—a Friday of a constituency week, when MPPs were not here at Queen’s Park—inviting me to a conversation about the amendments. This was on Friday, when the amendments were being considered on Monday", "I do not consider that a good-faith openness to having an honest conversation, a genuine conversation about amendments. In fact, what it turned out to be was to provide the government an excuse to dismiss all NDP amendments that were submitted during clause-by-clause, to reject every single NDP amendment on the grounds that the amendments were received too late, when they were received well within the timeline that the government had set in its time allocation motion.", "The effect of this, Speaker, was that it prevented any substantive debate on the amendments that the NDP proposed that spoke directly to the input that was received during public input on this bill. It allowed the government to evade going on the record in any way to try to explain their refusal to listen to the input that had been heard, and to incorporate some of the very legitimate concerns that had been brought forward by the deputants who spoke to the committee.", "I’m going to speak at length to a couple of the amendments that the NDP had brought forward that were dismissed by the government without any kind of explanation as to why they would not support them, except to say that they were received too late, when they were received well within the deadline that had been set in the government’s time allocation motion. But before I do that, Speaker, I do want to make absolutely clear that the NDP caucus fully supports this bill. We agree that the amendments that were made during the committee process have strengthened this bill, and that, in many ways, they speak to the input that was received during the public input.", "In particular, I want to acknowledge the changes that were made to explicitly name anti-Semitism and Islamophobia in this bill. This was very, very important to many of the presenters who came before the committee, and the new language that is included in this bill, I think, goes a long way to addressing the concerns that were raised. Most importantly, it does that in a way that does not diminish the historic marginalization, the ongoing exclusion and the displacement of black communities and indigenous communities in this province.", "So, Speaker, the amendments that have been included are unquestionably constructive. They are positive and I think they are helpful in moving us forward collectively as a province to eliminate systemic racism in Ontario.", "Unfortunately, the same kind of openness and the same kind of respect was not demonstrated by the government in its response to concerns that were raised by multiple deputants to the committee about the exclusion of health information custodians from the data collection requirements of the bill. Currently, section 6 of the bill excludes health information custodians from having to engage in the collection of data and the analysis of data that is just so critical to ensuring the success of Ontario’s anti-racism initiatives.", "During the public input, we heard from the Association of Ontario Health Centres, we heard from Colour of Poverty—Colour of Change, we heard from the Metro Toronto Chinese and Southeast Asian Legal Clinic, we heard from the Ontario Council of Agencies Serving Immigrants that the exclusion of health information custodians is going to undermine the effectiveness of this bill in understanding the impact of systemic racism, in actually moving forward with effective strategies to address that systemic racism.", "I’m going to read at some length from some of the comments that were made during clause-by-clause about the exclusion of health information custodians.", "The Association of Ontario Health Centres noted that, “If Bill 114 excludes health service providers from the requirement to collect data that can help identify and monitor systemic racism and racial disparities in Ontario, then the broad goal of a health equity approach to planning as set out in the government’s Patients First Act cannot be achieved effectively.", "“We know that racism is one of the determinants of health. It’s well documented that indigenous populations, as well as black communities, experience the worst health outcomes in Ontario. This is entrenched through systemic racism, but it is virtually impossible to address systemic racism, in particular anti-indigenous and anti-black racism as described in the preamble of Bill 114, without collecting race-based data. Excluding health service providers from the requirement to collect data, including race-based data, is inconsistent with the province’s own health equity mandate and indeed works to ensure ongoing inequity and entrenchment of systemic racism.”", "The Association of Ontario Health Centres goes on to say, “It’s not clear what rationale there is for excluding health service providers from this requirement to collect data, including personal information. Community health centres, our members, are health information custodians and have been collecting race-based and socio-demographic data for years, often with the most vulnerable populations who they serve. Indeed, in the last few years the Toronto Central Local Health Integration Network has mandated all health service providers to collect socio-demographic data, including race-based data, so we know that it is possible for health service providers to collect personal information without contravening privacy laws.”", "When the NDP brought forward a motion to address this very concern, a concern that was repeated in multiple deputations during public input, instead of the government explaining why they were rejecting the amendment that the NDP had brought forward so that the legislation would cover health information custodians, the government dismissed the NDP’s amendment without any kind of substantive debate at all.", "This is a disservice to the people who came and presented to the committee, to the organizations that had surveyed their members, to the organizations that are dealing with the impact of systemic racism on the front lines on a daily basis, to the organizations that include people with lived experience of racism, who understand what the impact is and, in particular, the impact on health outcomes. The government gave no explanation as to why the legislation could not be amended to address this concern.", "Having made my concern clear about the process that led to this third reading version of the bill, I do want to say that New Democrats recognize how vital it is to collect data, to create an impact assessment framework that would help us understand the systemic exclusion, the systemic discrimination that is experienced by racialized communities, black communities, indigenous communities, Jewish and Muslim communities across this province. We know the benefits of collecting that data and understanding that data. We’ve seen it in policing, in education, in child welfare.", "Legal Aid Ontario has done a really useful infographic about carding: statistics on carding in various communities and how they shine a light on the systemic biases that exist in policing, that result in visible minority communities and black communities and middle eastern communities and indigenous communities being carded at a much higher rate—double the rate—than their actual representation within the population.", "We saw just last month, in a report from York University called Towards Race Equity in Education, how systemic barriers are reflected in public education in this province. We learned that in the Toronto District School Board black students are twice as likely to be enrolled in applied courses instead of academic courses compared to their counterparts from other racial backgrounds, and they are more than twice as likely to have been suspended from school at least once during high school.", "Data can shed a light on some of these practices and help us understand what changes have to be made to eliminate those barriers and improve equity for all racialized communities in this province.", "I want to acknowledge the work of my colleague the member for Hamilton Mountain and the concerns that she has consistently raised about the overrepresentation of black children and indigenous children in the child welfare system. Again, the data confirm this. We see that in Toronto 8% of young people under the age of 18 are black, and yet 42% of children in care have at least one black parent—five times their representation in the general population.", "So, Speaker, understanding the impact of race in terms of access to services in Ontario is vital if we are going to ensure a province that is fair, that provides opportunity for everyone and that enables all citizens to achieve their full potential.", "Before I conclude, I wanted to mention one other amendment that was proposed during the public input process. Again, multiple presenters talked about the need to establish an anti-racism secretariat and a disability rights secretariat to complement the work of the Anti-Racism Directorate. I was pleased to hear that and I actually asked the people who had made this recommendation in their submissions how they saw the work of an anti-racism secretariat as distinct from the Anti-Racism Directorate. They talked about the need to have a completely independent, arm’s-length body that is not answerable to the minister, that is not susceptible to the political whims of the day, to do this fundamentally important work. This was a recommendation from Colour of Poverty—Colour of Change, from the Metro Toronto Chinese and Southeast Asian Legal Clinic, from the Ontario Council of Agencies Serving Immigrants, from the Ontario Federation of Labour.", "Speaker, I have to reflect on the fact that the Anti-Racism Secretariat was an initiative long ago of a previous NDP government in this province. It was a body that was created and that was embarking on this important work and was disbanded by the Conservatives when they took power.", "This is something that we must move forward with. Whatever we do, we’re not going to have an impact unless there is sustained political will, regardless of who is in government. We need to ensure that there is a shared commitment to moving forward on this critical work to ensure a province that is fair to all Ontarians." ],

With the Stronger, Healthier Ontario Act, we made a commitment to bring stability to our housing market and to provide more support for our seniors. We know these are vital issues for the people of Ontario. Ontarians’ priorities are also this government’s priorities.", "Mr. Speaker, during this year’s pre-budget consultations, we heard about how frustrated people were with the housing market and about how important it is for seniors to lead active and fulfilling lives. The 2017 pre-budget consultations engaged more than 80,000 people, a record number of participants. Together with the innovative budget talks online, it allowed the public to help shape policies and programs that will be part of Ontario’s future.", "Bill 134 reflects that input. That’s why we owe it to every young family looking to buy their first home and raise their kids, and to every senior looking to maintain their independence and participate in their community, to make passing Bill 134 a key priority.", "Bill 134 introduces an additional 15% non-residential speculation tax, also known as the NRST, on the purchase price of a residential property in the greater Golden Horseshoe by non-Canadian citizens, non-permanent residents of Canada or non-Canadian corporations and taxable trustees.", "As you know, the cost of living has increased as our economy grows. For example, our strong housing market reflects Ontario’s strong economy. Housing is essential. Everyone deserves housing choices that are affordable. Yet the rising costs of renting or buying are creating significant barriers for too many people and their families.", "Bill 134 supports our Fair Housing Plan, a plan that features 16 comprehensive measures that would help more people find affordable homes in the province, increase supply, protect buyers and renters, and bring stability to the real estate market so that the people of Ontario can continue to put down roots in communities they love.", "The NRST would directly address foreign speculation in our housing market. This proposed tax is about discouraging those who are capitalizing on the speculation on homes, driving up prices, creating vacant homes and crowding out families looking to buy. If passed, the NRST would apply in addition to the Ontario general land transfer tax, and it would be effective retroactive to April 21, 2017. This means that if a binding agreement was signed on or before April 20, 2017, it would not be subject to the additional 15% tax.", "We want to make sure that Ontarians have access to these important improvements as soon as possible. We can’t afford to delay. To delay passing Bill 134 would mean further delaying housing market stability, creating even greater uncertainty at a time when certainty is sorely needed.", "Measures in this bill focus on making everyday life easier and more affordable for the people of Ontario. It’s unfortunate that the opposition decided to put forward a reasoned amendment to delay debate of this critical piece of legislation. While the opposition focuses on playing games on this issue, on this side of the House we’re taking action.", "Bill 134 also seeks to amend the Taxation Act, 2007, to bring in a new Ontario Seniors’ Public Transit Tax Credit aimed at better supporting our seniors. Our government has a tremendous amount of respect for our seniors. They have played an instrumental role in making Ontario the great province it is today. It’s why we want to do everything possible to help them lead full and enriching lives. One of the ways we plan to provide that is to make public transit more affordable.", "The credit would be set out in the proposed new section 103.0.1 of the Taxation Act, 2007. It would be available to all Ontarians aged 65 and older. It would provide a refundable tax credit equal to 15% of eligible public transit costs for seniors, starting July 1 of this year. This tax credit is about making it easier for seniors to get out of their communities and to stay active and independent.", "Right across the province today, seniors’ transit fares are already discounted by many transit agencies, including GO Transit. We want to ensure that money isn’t an obstacle for our seniors to get to where they want to go and to maintain healthy, active lives.", "The number of seniors in Ontario will continue to grow. The demographics are clear. For example, as of 2015, more Ontarians turn 65 each year than turn 15. By 2040, that number is expected to double, to about 4.5 million.", "That’s why, with the 2017 Ontario budget, our government is supporting our seniors with funding for programs and initiatives like the Ontario Seniors’ Public Transit Tax Credit, the Seniors Community Grant Program, Ontario’s new dementia strategy, and greater access to affordable drugs. Helping our seniors stay active, engaged and involved in their communities is part of our plan to build a stronger and healthier Ontario.", "However, Mr. Speaker—", "Interjections." ],

Homeless shelters are full. The wait-list for social housing is 171,000 families, an increase of 45,000 families since this government was elected.", "Housing prices across southern Ontario have jumped by 20%, 30%, 40% over the last year. In April, it was announced that prices in the GTA have increased by 34%. Earlier this month, it was announced that average Toronto housing prices increased another $44,000 since that 34%.", "Multiple communities have vacancy rates of 1%. Developers say they are re-evaluating or halting rental projects because of the government’s legislation.", "Mr. Speaker, this crisis didn’t develop overnight. It took years of bad decisions by this government. It was decision after decision that added red tape and restrictions to the building process, slowing down the supply and adding to the carrying costs.", "It was decision after decision to add additional costs onto new homeowners, from increased development charges to inclusionary zoning, and most recently, an electric charging station.", "It was decision after decision to implement policies without doing the proper research, and each time, it made the problem worse. They had time to collect the data to allow informed, evidence-based decisions but, again, they failed.", "Maybe the time allocation motion is to stop us from talking about those bad decisions.", "They put forward a proposal for a foreign homebuyers’ tax despite the fact that they don’t know how many foreign homebuyers there are in Ontario.", "During the scrum at the housing announcement, the Minister of Finance said, “We know that the degree of non-resident investment in Ontario, or in this region, hovers around 8%” But the next day, when he was asked how many foreign homebuyers there were, he said 5%.", "The Toronto Real Estate Board now says that less than 1% of homebuyers have a mailing address outside of Canada. It’s clear that the Minister of Finance doesn’t know how many foreign homebuyers there are in Ontario and doesn’t want to talk about it.", "Maclean’s said in an article, “As for the underlying data guiding these policy decisions? About that, the government is less confident.”", "We believe in the importance of data and evidence-based decision-making, so I filed an order paper question asking the Minister of Finance for data relating to foreign homebuyers. The first asked for “precise data on the number of foreign homebuyers in Ontario each year for the past 10 years and the definition used to classify them.” I received a response from the minister, but it didn’t contain a single number. It didn’t explain the minister’s claim that it was 8% of the market, or his claim that it was 5%. It didn’t even contain the definition of foreign homebuyers that we asked for.", "I also filed an order paper question that asked for “all modelling and projections prepared during the last three years by the ministry or a consultant hired by the ministry of the impact of adding additional taxes on the sale and purchase of homes, including the impact on prices and volumes.” Again, I received a response that didn’t answer the question. I did not get a single projection or model. Does this mean that the Minister of Finance introduced new tax measures without doing any research at all, or does it mean that he has so little respect for the Legislature that he couldn’t be bothered to answer the order paper question as required?", "The answer referred to the land transfer tax rebate they implemented last fall but didn’t provide studies for that either. Does that mean the Minister of Finance didn’t bother to look at the impact before he announced it?", "Mr. Speaker, there have been a number of indications that the government now considers this measure to be a mistake. The Premier said that if she had a crystal ball, she might have done something different.", "After the provincial Minister of Finance, the federal Minister of Finance and the mayor of Toronto met, they came out united that they would not implement any measures that would boost demand. In other words, they agreed that measures similar to what the government implemented last fall with the land transfer tax were the wrong approach. It is apparent that this government is managing crisis to crisis, and the people of Ontario are paying the price.", "The minister also seemed to be confused on the funding for this plan. At the announcement, the minister was asked about the funding for the housing plan, which included $125 million for development of rental units. He said that the plan was revenue-neutral. The next day, his office was asked, and they said that the new tax is expected to be revenue-neutral, and that the money coming in would be used to offset the decrease in revenue from the land transfer tax. There was no explanation of where the $125 million was coming from.", "A few days later, they released the budget, which showed the land transfer tax increasing, not decreasing. This is important, Mr. Speaker. The government is forecasting that housing prices will increase so much that next year, the government will earn an extra $451 million on land transfer tax. That’s not far off from the $570-million increase last year when housing prices were increasing to crisis levels. That means that either the government doesn’t expect their housing plan to work or the government has a $451-million hole in their budget.

No wonder they don’t want to talk about it.", "Since the government doesn’t seem to have done any research about implementing this new tax, perhaps we should look at the Vancouver example. According to a May 2 news release from the greater Vancouver real estate board, the home price index benchmark for all residential properties in metro Vancouver is now $941,100, an 11.4% increase over last year, 5% of which is in the last three months. That means that even after implementing the foreign homebuyer tax, prices are still going up.", "Over the last three months, the price of condominiums has seen the largest increase at 8.2%, followed by townhouses at 5.3%. The average price of an attached unit is over $700,000, a 15% increase over last year. Clearly the foreign homebuyers tax has not had the expected effect on the Vancouver real estate market, and that’s in an area where people believed that the percentage of foreign homebuyers was higher.", "The government also should have looked at the fact that the BC government is facing a lawsuit over the foreign homebuyers tax. According to the media report, the lawsuit says that the foreign homebuyers tax is unconstitutional because it violates equality rights by making an arbitrary distinction between those who are citizens and permanent residents of Canada and those who are not. It states that the tax “perpetuates prejudice and stereotyping on the basis of national origin.” If the government proceeds with this tax, particularly with no research, what is to stop Ontario from being hit with the same lawsuit? The government doesn’t want to talk about it.", "I also want to point out that in British Columbia the government has allocated revenue from the foreign homebuyers tax to affordable housing. As the Co-operative Housing Federation of Canada said in a recent release, “By directing any revenues generated from the speculators tax to the affordable rental housing supply, we can go even further to help those that are truly struggling to make ends meet.”", "Mayor Bonnie Crombie said, “In the interest of accountability and transparency, I strongly believe any and all revenue generated by new tax measures must go directly toward creating more affordable housing options and the building of transit, so we can build critically needed housing and allow people to more easily get to and from home.” Apparently the government doesn’t want to hear from people like them.", "Clearly we have an affordable housing problem in Ontario. We have 170,000 families on the waiting list. Toronto Community Housing is closing an average of a unit a day because they can’t afford to repair them. Instead of taking real action to address the problem, this government is taxing an unknown number of people, which will generate an unknown amount of money that will be used for unknown purposes.", "In fact, really, in this bill there are a lot more unknowns. This bill adds a foreign homebuyers tax in the Golden Horseshoe unless the minister adds or removes areas by regulation, meaning that the area that is impacted is unknown. The bill adds a 15% tax unless the minister, by regulation, changes the percentages, in which case the amount of the tax is unknown. The bill adds a tax on property purchased by a foreign national or a foreign corporation unless the minister, by regulation, creates an exemption, and those exemptions are unknown.", "The government announced a number of exemptions that they are intending to include, but not one of them actually appears in the bill. Let’s be clear: There is nothing in this bill that exempts foreign nationals who are coming to Ontario under the Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program because they have a full-time job here. Nothing in this act exempts refugees. There is nothing in this legislation that rebates the tax to foreign students or people who become a permanent resident or a Canadian citizen, nothing that says that the tax will be rebated to people who work full-time in Ontario for one year. It may appear in government press releases, but it doesn’t appear in this bill.", "It has been a busy session, with this government ramming through legislation like this with time allocation motions, but members need to read the actual bill. Already we’ve seen a press release from one of the government members that is misleading. I don’t believe it was on purpose, but they need to understand how little is actually in this bill. As it is written, this tax may apply to people who are living in their riding, and now these people won’t even have a say.", "Mr. Speaker, there should have been proper consultation on this bill, especially because the government has not done sufficient research before introducing it. There are a number of people and groups that have expressed concerns about a foreign buyers tax. They should get to speak to this bill at committee.", "Look at the example of the city of Victoria, which passed a motion calling on their provincial government to include them in the foreign homebuyers tax. Then they held public meetings on the issue and reversed their position. Clearly public input on this issue is important.", "The government announced this bill on April 20, almost seven weeks ago. They waited weeks and weeks to introduce it. People who will be impacted by this bill should not be denied the right to speak to it because the government waited until the last week before the summer.", "Although there are no actual people exempted in this bill, the government provided some background information which makes it appear that people who are already permanent residents may still be impacted in some circumstances. For instance, if a permanent resident needs help with the cost of their home and buys it jointly with their parent who has not moved to Canada, the entire cost of the home will now be subject to the tax. Those people should get a chance to speak.", "A real estate blog already raised concerns about cases where lenders require a parent to co-sign a mortgage and take a small percentage of the title, even 1%, to do so. It will make the entire home subject to the tax. This would create challenges for young people who don’t have sufficient income to get a mortgage without help. The blog describes it as a “disaster.”", "That leads to another concern regarding the lack of data. The government is trying to point to foreign homebuyers as the cause of our housing crisis, saying that our housing shortage is the result of empty units that they have purchased, but there just isn’t data to back that up. One study showed that only 10% of homes purchased by foreign homebuyers are actually vacant; 90% are occupied by the purchaser, family members including foreign students, or renters. By those estimates the number of vacant units purchased by foreign homebuyers is around 0.1% of the real estate market.", "Frank Scarpitti, the mayor of Markham, raised similar concerns about the fact that this tax will not solve the problem. He said that he had not seen signs that vacant homes were a significant problem in Markham, and that a tax on foreign buyers won’t necessarily cool the region’s real estate market.", "What we do have evidence of is that this government owns residential properties in the greater Toronto and Hamilton area that are currently sitting vacant. The Ministry of Housing and the Ministry of Infrastructure both admitted they own vacant residential properties; the Minister of Finance and the Attorney General, who is responsible for the Office of the Public Guardian and Trustee, refused to disclose whether they own any. The government should have an accurate count of their own vacant residential properties but, once again, we’re missing the data—another thing they don’t want to discuss. This should have been a first step, especially given all the experts who agree the issue is the lack of supply. The number of people coming into the region is greater than the number of new units we are building.", "At the same time, a recent study by the Canadian Centre for Economic Analysis found that families are getting smaller, meaning that the average number of people per household is decreasing and we need more units to house the same number of people. If we want to address the housing affordability crisis in the long term, we need to address the supply, including the red tape in the building process.", "We’ve heard over and over that the approval process for new housing in Ontario now takes many years, so recently we put forward an amendment to Bill 68 which would have shortened the planning timelines to what they were before this government lengthened them. It would have saved months of approval time and reduced the cost of new homes by thousands.", "We asked an industry expert to review this amendment before introducing it and he said, “These are the type of amendments that would help facilitate bringing supply to the market more expediently and putting some more tension in the planning system to get discussions and negotiations moving more quickly.” But the government voted down the amendment. In their housing announcement, the government talked about cutting red tape, but when we gave them the opportunity, they blocked it.", "Mr. Speaker, year after year, this government has made decisions that have created the housing crisis that Ontario is facing today. Their solution is to slap another tax on housing—a tax that may or may not be limited to the greater Golden Horseshoe, that may or may not be set at 15%, that may or may not apply to all foreign nationals and corporations. The government doesn’t know what percentage of the market it will impact or what the revenues will be.", "Based on what we’ve heard, it seems that confusion may now be impacting the real estate market. That is not a responsible long-term solution; confusing the market doesn’t address the fundamental problems and it doesn’t provide a lasting solution. They either have done no studies on the impact of this tax or have so little respect for the Legislature that they didn’t bother to properly answer the written order paper question.", "The government needs to stop managing from photo op to photo op. They need to actually do the research and base policies on data and evidence, and they need to stop ramming through legislation without listening to the people they are impacting; otherwise the people of Ontario will continue paying the price." ],

The first portion is, it’s proposing a 15% tax on the sale of housing to foreign buyers, whether they be companies or individuals. The purpose behind this is to hopefully stop speculation by foreign buyers and then put some downward pressure on the housing market. There’s no real data that shows this is going to work. There is also a large question on whether there’s a difference between foreign speculation and domestic speculation. There are a lot of questions about this bill. That’s the first part.", "The second part is, there’s a 15% tax credit on transit for seniors, and I don’t think that’s a bad thing. We are actually in favour of many of the principles of this bill. That’s why it’s quite disturbing that we’re talking here about time allocation.", "This time allocation—I have never seen this one before. The way bills are supposed to work: At first reading, we get to look at the bill; at second reading, we debate it in the House; and then—it was actually voted on this morning—it’s directed to a committee where people usually come and make depositions. Then, after that period is over, the committee looks at it and the legislators make amendments to try to make the bill better. Then the bill comes for third reading and it passes. That’s how it’s supposed to work.", "With time allocation, what we’ve seen before is that they shorten this process. Now, Speaker, with this motion there’s not going to be any committee. There are not going to be any amendments or any third reading debate. With this bill, you cannot call this the democratic process anymore. The government thought up the idea—that’s their prerogative. They have a majority government. They thought up the idea and now they’re using legislative tactics to just take their idea without any input from anybody else and they’re just going to put it through.", "And why that’s tragic, and truly tragic—again, the NDP supports the principles of the bill, but there are things in the bill that are completely and totally—I was going to use a big word like “egregious.” I don’t use big words very often, but they have completely forgotten parts of the province.

That’s their right. We’ve not out to stop that.", "But they also have the responsibility to make sure that legislation is thought through, and how that has been done for a very long time in our parliamentary tradition is to bring it to the Parliament to do the first reading, the second reading, go to committee and then go to deputations. Then the parties make amendments and bring it back to the Legislature. Yes, there’s political wrangling involved, but that is the way it’s done. It’s not done like this.", "This morning, after the bill was passed in this House on second reading, the minister directed it to a committee. That was at about noon today. The Minister of Finance directed it to, I believe, economic affairs, right? That’s the way it should be done.", "Then the committee could hold hearings, and I’m sure people involved in the real estate market would want to have their say. Homeowners, and young people who are looking to buy their first home, would like to have their say: “Here’s what we think you could do to make this legislation better.” They would like to have their say.", "I’m sure that seniors in northern Ontario or seniors’ groups that represent people in northern Ontario or rural Ontario—we mentioned it because I know where I’m from, but I’m sure this is happening other parts of the province—would have loved to have their say. Yet, for some reason—I can’t think of any other reason beyond arrogance. I hate to say that because I have a very good working relationship with the ministers and with the members, but with this move to have a time allocation motion with no committee, no debate on third reading and no chance for amendments, the government is saying to me that “We are so good at this that we can create legislation the first time and it’s going to work.”", "Now, either they think they’re so good at this or perhaps—I’m speculating here because I’ve got no other tool but speculation in the few minutes I’ve got left—they don’t really care if this is going to work for the whole province. Perhaps they just want to get the 15% speculation tax out there so that they can say they passed it; and they can get a 15% tax rebate for seniors so that they can say they passed it. That will be good for votes in the next election, but they don’t really, deep down, care if the details work—because that’s what committee is about: making sure the details work. It seems that this government has lost their way on that.", "I can understand we’re getting close to the end of the session and they want to get their agenda passed. I can understand that. I can’t understand, I can’t fathom that you can introduce legislation with no ability for amendment, even by yourselves. As the member from Hamilton Mountain has said a couple of times, on other bills, the government introduces many amendments themselves. That actually, technically, in reality, isn’t a bad thing, because there’s no shame in making amendments. There’s no shame because government—it takes a while to get things right. That’s why we always have to have governments. If the government a hundred years ago had gotten everything right, we wouldn’t need to sit anymore, right? That’s why we do sit, so we can all play our roles to make sure that the people of Ontario, across the province of Ontario, have the best legislation that we can create.", "We might disagree on philosophy. We might disagree on how it’s done. That’s why we have elections: to put forward our platforms and allow the people to decide. The people decided, three years ago, to have this government. The people did not decide to eliminate our parliamentary process, and that is what is being done with this bill.", "Speaker, it sets an incredibly dangerous precedent because, if they do it once, what’s to stop them from doing it again? In the budget process, on the budget bill—the member from Nipissing went through this as well, and I’m sure he will correct me if I get it wrong; I’m just doing it off the top of my head—we had the vote. Then we had committee hearings right after the vote—an hour after the vote—and then the amendments had to be in an hour after the committee hearings. So in reality, the people who made deputations—there was no way to get their views into the amendments.", "We raised quite a ruckus over that—quite a big stink—because obviously the people of the province who made the trek weren’t being respected. Why we raised that ruckus was so the government would back off and actually do things correctly and allow time so that the committee members and their various caucus colleagues could actually look at the deputations and make amendments to the process.", "Instead of actually slowing down and looking at how to make the process work better, the government has gone the other way and said, “You know what? The way we were doing it before”—the way the Liberals were doing it before—“it was kind of a charade, to have people come and then an hour later have to make amendments, so let’s just drop the charade and forget about listening; just show people that we’re not going to listen to anybody else—just show them.” That’s what they’re doing here. They’re so arrogant that they have just basically eliminated the process.", "A few ministers and a few people behind the scenes come up with this stuff. The rest of the process—at least in this bill, Speaker—is just for show. This day, in my five years here—and I’ve talked to members who have been here a lot longer—it’s unprecedented. People outside this House might not be excited, but it is our job to be excited and it’s our job to hold the government to account. What this government has done, a step-by-step process, in the last three years—particularly since Premier Wynne has been elected—they talk about being open and transparent, and this government has, step by step by step, been exactly the opposite.", "I’m going to close, Speaker, with a quote. People quote people they really respect. I’ve quoted him before, and no one else quotes him—not Mr. Smith—because no one has spent as much time around him as I did: my father. My father was an immigrant who came here after World War II. He started from nothing, and he was very proud of everything he built. He taught me a lot of things. My father said, “If someone has to tell you they’re honest, watch out for them. Because honest people don’t tell you they’re honest; they just act honestly.”", "People who are truly open and transparent don’t have to tell you they’re open and transparent, and this is proof that my dad was right." ],

So, Speaker, I say that that’s why they’ve cut off debate. They don’t want us debating the budget measures. What we’re talking about today is closure on An Act to implement 2017 Budget measures. As I said, this budget is anything but balanced. We have said it. Our leader, Patrick Brown, has stood and said this. The day the budget was announced, we talked about this $5-billion hole in the budget.", "Our leader, Patrick Brown, went through all of the details.

Five billion dollars? You’re wrong. You’re wrong.” Well, the Financial Accountability Office this morning presented the economic and fiscal outlook.", "Now, lo and behold, we just got back a few minutes ago from the briefing.

On page 19 in his book, which was released to the Legislature this afternoon—the government will use temporary revenue, one-time revenue.", "Federal transfers: $1.5 billion.

They’re going to have asset sales of $1 billion.", "They’re going to sell Hydro One and put that money in the operating budget. What did Patrick Brown say? They’re going to sell Hydro and put that money in the operating budget.", "And they’re going to put the cap-and-trade money in the operating budget. In fact, they’re putting $400 million more this year than next.", "That’s why the Financial Accountability Officer came up with the number—this is before other one-time funds—of $3 billion, just on page 19.", "You put it all together, and you have got exactly the same hole in the budget that our leader talked about. It’s shocking. Speaker, it’s actually kind of upsetting to one’s stomach to know the predicament.", "Do you know what he told us? He told us today that we are going to add $76 billion more to our debt over the next five years—$76 billion, in just five years.", "When this government took office 13 years ago, our debt was $139 billion. It took 137 years to get it there. Now it is $312 billion, under the Liberals, and just in the next five years—remember, it took 137 years to get to $139 billion. In the next five years alone, they’re adding $76 billion more to our debt.", "But it’s going to get worse. I’ll tell you about that in a moment.", "Now we’re at $390 billion—$390 billion is what the Financial Accountability Officer tells us—that this government is going to bury us.", "I asked a question in the technical briefing. I said to the Financial Accountability Officer’s team, “Just a few days ago, you came out with your commentary on Kathleen Wynne and what the Liberal government called a fair hydro plan. You came out with a commentary on that, and you told us that in the best-case scenario, this government will add a further $45 billion in debt, to save $24 billion.”", "I don’t know which business or which family member would spend 45 bucks to get 24 back. There’s nobody I know that would do that, but the Liberals are going to be doing that.", "I asked if that money is included in this summary. Is that money included in the $390 billion? The answer from the Financial Accountability Officer was no. The so-called fair hydro plan debt is not included in this summary, because of when it was produced—a few days ago.", "What has happened in those few days is, the Auditor General attended the fair hydro plan committee meetings, the hearings, and said, “Hang on a second here. You’re adding all this debt”—from the Financial Accountability Officer, the low end of $45 billion. If we have to borrow money—if we go into deficit and borrow money—it could be as high as $93 billion, by the way, that they’ll pay to save $24 billion. If they have to borrow, it’s now $93 billion.", "The Auditor General said that regardless of whether it’s $45 billion or $93 billion, right now, what you’ve tried to do is put this debt on Ontario Power Generation’s bill—OPG. You’ve put this debt on their bill. You’ve used them as the financing arm.", "We disclosed this two or three weeks ago. We said that this smells. I stood right at this seat, and in question period, I said that this smells. You have co-opted OPG into your scheme.", "There’s only one reason why they would do that, and that’s because OPG’s books are separate from the province’s books. They’re not in what we call the consolidated financials of the province. They’re not consolidated; they’re not in the same pot as the province’s finances. They stay across the street, in a separate set of books unrelated to the province. They’re putting all this debt on their books.", "We exposed that two or three weeks ago, much to the surprise of a lot of people in the financial world: Were they allowed to do that? Is that legal in Canada? Can you do that in Ontario? You could imagine Third World countries trying to pull a fast one like that.", "I stood in this Legislature and said this morning that any business that would try to do that would never get away with it with their shareholders.

The refinancing—these are their words—now is still off-book. That means we still owe between $45 billion and $93 billion more, which will be added to that debt.", "Speaker, just think of this now, one more little thing: The fact now that they have to add that—we know that’s $2.5 billion a year of deficit and $26 billion that they need to add, minimum, on their debt. I know it’s complicated, Speaker; hang with me. What I’m trying to say is, we now know the government will be in a deficit. I realize the members here on the side of the government have (a) either no idea of what this refers to or (b) have known about it and prefer to continue to tell the people of Ontario one thing when the complete opposite is true.", "According to the Financial Accountability Officer, we are going to have a deficit this year of $2.9 billion. It grows every year until 2021-22, when it hits $6.5 billion; that’s just added deficit. So, now, tie that into his earlier report that said that if you’re in a deficit, that debt from hydro comes to $93 billion because you have to borrow. According to the FAO, our deficit gets bigger every year. That means we now have to borrow to pay that hydro debt, so it’s not $45 billion anymore; it will be $93 billion. The Auditor General has told OPG across the street, “No, no, no. You don’t get to bury this debt in OPG’s books. You have to record that debt.”", "We’re at $390 billion in debt in five years.

Number one, he acknowledges we’re in deficit. He does not buy what these guys are selling. They’re telling the people of Ontario one thing—“We balanced the budget”—when all of the documentation from all of the officers and all of the people in the financial sector is acknowledging that we’ve got a fake budget here. It’s only because of one-time revenue. His own press release, his own news release, should tell you.", "If you can choke back through the headline that tells you we’re deteriorating, then get into the body of his note. He talks about how it’s a steady deterioration. This isn’t just something new that’s one-time. The revenue is one-time, but the deterioration is steady. It’s ongoing. He says the balance is due to one-time revenues, which we have been saying year after year after year. And he says that “without significant fiscal policy adjustments,” this is all going to continue.", "As I said, he tells us we’re going to hit more than $390 billion by 2021-22. It results in “ongoing deficits”—which they say don’t happen—“capital spending, and the AG’s recommended accounting treatment for pension assets.” That’s a whole other topic that they don’t want to talk about. They have an ongoing argument with the Auditor General of Ontario, the independent officer. She tells us one thing; they say, “No, we don’t like that. We think it’s something different.”", "That brings us to what we call our debt to GDP. Now, when this government took office, debt to GDP was a respectable 27%. Today it hovers around 40%. This government tells you they’ve got a great plan to bring it down, but on the pace that they have brought it down, from a little over 40% to just a little under 40%, it would take about 50 years to get it back to where it was when they took over office. The Financial Accountability Of-ficer says now we’re going the wrong way, now it will edge back above 40%. It’s unbelievable that that is the damage that this government is going to continue to do to our economy.", "Why should that matter to people, Speaker? What would somebody care if our debt to GDP was 40% instead of 27%? This is what this means to you. They know they need to get the debt in a manageable position. They know that it’s based on (a) how your economy is growing and (b) how high your debt is. You put them together and you have a debt to GDP. That’s how you come up with that. When it’s not a good number and your debt is high and you’ve got deficits like they have, they start to try to look at areas they can control. That is exactly why they’ve cut 1,600 nursing jobs in Ontario, including 100 in my hometown of North Bay. So when you wonder, “What does this debt to GDP have to do with me? Why do I care what the debt or the deficit is in Ontario?”, it’s because they fired 1,600 nurses to try to balance their budget. When that didn’t work, then they closed schools.", "Speaker, do you realize that this government and Kathleen Wynne have closed more schools in Ontario than any other government in the history of our province?

  "text" : [ "This has been occupying a lot of our time. I know the parliamentary assistant has been very involved in everything to do with this bill as well. We’re speaking today on Bill 89. It’s basically an overhaul of the child welfare system in Ontario for the first time in 32 years. That’s a long time, Mr. Speaker, to not really look at and overhaul the entire scope of what we do for children.", "I want to start off by saying that, speaking of children, my youngest child of four is here today in the members’ gallery: Jennifer—we call her Jennie—Martow. I want to thank her for being here today. She was downtown and decided to come by and pay us a visit.", "First of all, just to give some facts and figures on child welfare here in Ontario: We have 47 designated children’s aid societies. Nine children’s aid societies are aboriginal, indigenous agencies, and three are religious. Two of them are Catholic and one is Jewish Family and Child Service, which I know very well.", "In the fiscal year of 2014-15—I don’t have more recent data, but I’m sure that we can correlate it—there were over 8,600 full-time-equivalent staff in children’s aid societies across Ontario. The highest number of referrals, in order, were from law enforcement; schools; other children’s aid societies, because they do refer to each other between regions and jurisdictions; the family unit—somebody from the family unit, the mother, father or the child; and community caregiver professionals.", "The top five reasons for children and families becoming involved with children’s aid, also in order, are: requests for assistance from the family, child exposure to partner violence, a caregiver with a problem, physical force and/or maltreatment, and inadequate supervision.", "More than 171,600 calls were made during that time period of 2014-15. There were calls and referrals made, 80,813 of which required investigations.", "The biggest point that I wanted to make is that the youth who came and presented at committee overwhelmingly preferred foster homes to group homes. There are different reasons why children and youth are sometimes placed in group homes, but it is becoming a bit of a crisis in Ontario. The government didn’t believe it when the foster families association told all of us at committee that in the last 10 years they’ve seen the number of homes willing to foster children in care decrease by approximately one half—between 40% and one half. That’s shocking, Mr. Speaker, because we’re taking more kids into care, partly because the population is increasing, but also partly because there are just more problems overall, for many reasons.", "Also a big part of the bill, which is why we were so excited in the PC caucus to see it being presented, is that it’s going to allow 16- and 17-year-olds who have never been involved in the child welfare system, to now—", "Interjection." ],

  "text" : [ "That was my colleague right next to me, the member from Stormont–Dundas–South Glengarry. He had a private member’s bill, as did a previous member of our caucus, to address exactly that: to allow 16- and 17-year-olds to go into care. It is a big part of the bill, but—and I’m going to go into that further—it’s problematic. It’s problematic for many reasons, Mr. Speaker. For monetary reasons—this is actually an expensive cohort, even though for most families, they can’t wait till their children turn 16 and they’re at an age when they don’t need, hopefully, as much supervision. Children in care of that age are an expensive age group to deal with when they have a lot of problems, and often they do have problems.", "The last point I want to make on the child welfare facts is that 36% of adoptions were by the foster family the child had been living with. This is one of the things that really bothers me about the lack of foster homes, because if kids aren’t placed in foster homes, that means that that potential to be adopted by that family does not exist. A group of children in a group home are not really being parented. The expression that one of the youth who had aged out of care said in committee is, “We’re being kept alive. We’re being fed, we’re being housed, we’re being shipped off to school and sent to some doctors’ appointments and things like that, but we feel that we’re just being kept alive.”", "That is no way to raise the next generation in Ontario. We all know that there’s much more to children and youth than just being kept alive. That might work for a week or two, Mr. Speaker, but it shouldn’t be our long-term plan. A group home is not the same as parenting; it’s absolutely not. It’s workers coming in—and I know they’re doing their best. The member opposite who has worked in child welfare is nodding. They come in on a rotating basis, around the clock. We all know that a caregiver for an aging parent is not the same as having a daughter or a sibling visiting and taking care of you and advocating on your behalf.", "We heard in the committee from the Ontario Association of Children’s Aid Societies. Again, I want to commend the workers in our children’s aid societies who work so hard under often very difficult circumstances. In their report this past year that I have and that they had given to us, they spoke about increasing the overall child welfare funding envelope. They feel that additional demands from government on CASs through new rules and regulations—because that’s what this bill is. It’s telling CASs that they now have to take in a cohort of 16- and 17–year-olds—of course, on a voluntary basis but sometimes court-ordered as well. They must provide a service, yet there’s no mention in the budget—and we just heard the member from Nipissing saying how the budget isn’t properly balanced, and this is one of the reasons why the budget isn’t balanced, in a way. They knew this bill was coming forward at the exact same—look at that: Back to back, we’re debating the budget and this bill, and there’s still no line in the budget for extra funding for the 16- to 17-year-old cohort.", "The CPIN, Child Protection Information Network, costs for implementation were significantly higher than predicted. While some funding was given by the Ministry of Children and Youth Services to the CASs—I think $220,000 is what it said in their report, per agency—for deployment and to cover the costs associated with CPIN, they have spent as much $4.5 million on deployment. Where does that extra money come from? Obviously, it comes from programming. Foster parents are able to apply to the worker—I know that they have workers who advocate on behalf of foster parents themselves. They’re able to apply for special monetary compensation if they want to have the foster child, say, play hockey or needs equipment to play hockey. Obviously, they are hearing a lot more noes than they used to if the money is being spent implementing CPIN.", "The agencies also spoke about support for indigenous CASs, which we heard from as well at committee. Indigenous, Métis and Inuit communities want to be far more involved in the child welfare system and to administer their own policies, with the support of the government.", "Then there was the issue, which I never really got a clear answer on from the government, of how they’re going to be on the CPIN network when they don’t have proper Internet infrastructure in their communities in a lot of parts of Ontario. I think that’s one of the things that is hard for us to realize downtown in Toronto, when people are upset and saying that they don’t have a good signal and they have to go to a window. They’re so frustrated that they don’t have a good signal. Well, you can go to every window in every building in some of these communities further north in Ontario; you’re not going to get a signal just because you walked over to a window.", "They spoke about needing resources to support the wider children’s services sector, including children’s mental health, adult mental health, and domestic violence and addictions treatment, which are all essential. That’s really a big part, a big hole, that’s missing in this legislation—something creative. I think I spoke about it while speaking about another bill in the Legislature—a fantastic system that they have in the country of Israel, which I have visited quite a few times. They have the Na’amat centres. It’s an organization that has chapters right here in Ontario that they raise money for. Basically what it is: Instead of just taking a child who’s in a home situation that is maybe a six out of 10—I don’t know how exactly they rate and decide who should be taken into care, but they recognize that it’s not an ideal situation in the home. In Canada, that child would be placed in care. They recognize that there’s that middle grey area where, if they provide support, services, training and treatment and the parents co-operate and bring the child to Na’amat centre, half the children are in need of this extra supervision and half are just paying full daycare costs and come for regular daycare hours.", "The kids who need to be part of this bridge system come in at 7 in the morning in their pyjamas. They’re bathed; they keep clothes there; they’re fed three meals a day. The parents have to come for all kinds of training, programming and support, and support for the child as well. They have therapy rooms.", "They say that about half of the children who go into the program are able to go back to their families in a safe and supportive manner, instead of being permanently taken into care, the way we do here in Canada.", "There are other programs across the world as well. I didn’t hear that they were given the support that maybe they should have been. There are a lot of organizations that would love to help and support in our communities, and they certainly aren’t being consulted enough, in my opinion.", "I want to talk about little bit about the fact that our caucus put forward about 40 amendments, none of which were accepted by the government. I’m not going to talk about all of them, but I am going to highlight a couple.", "One is that we wanted to give more teeth to the provincial advocate because, while this bill is giving more power to the ministry to oversee the children’s aid societies—and many of them have concerns about what exactly that is going to entail—we felt that there needed to be sort of a balancing act with the provincial advocate.", "He is very well loved by the youth we saw who had aged out of care. Wow, is he ever well known. He really works well with youth, and I really trust his opinion on a lot of things to do with youth in care and aging out of care.", "He would like to have—and should have, in my opinion and in our opinion—the ability to oversee the ministry overseeing the children’s aid societies.", "It’s like the Auditor General here, that we talk about overseeing what the government is doing. It’s supposed to be a non-partisan agency and an expert. Unfortunately, we often see reports that then get ignored. We can’t just talk about transparency and accountability. We have to actually implement what we are mandating.", "We know that Katelynn’s Principle—the member from the NDP, from Hamilton Mountain, worked very hard to promote the voice of children and youth involved in care. I think it was telling that there was no mention of Katelynn Sampson’s name anywhere in the bill initially, although the preamble did talk about giving youth and children a voice.", "The big problem with this bill—and I think the member would agree with me—is that the preamble did not match the actual bill. I spoke on that when we spoke on time allocation for this bill just a couple of days ago, which means that we’re actually debating less than we would normally on a bill. But it’s a majority government, and they’re able to pass time allocation bills. We spent three days in committee, pretty much going through amendments. Again, my colleague next to me was there." ],

  "text" : [ "Two hundred amendments from the government—basically, we were writing this bill with the government in committee.", "I asked the question, and I was told by one of the Clerks that the government could have recognized, after the committee hearings, that the bill did not reflect what it was supposed to reflect.", "I could see that you have two different offices, and you have one group—it’s possibly even the parliamentary assistant—working on the preamble and what the bill should do. Everybody reads it and supports it at second reading. Then we come down to actually read the bill and hear from the experts, and we find out that this bill does not reflect what’s in the preamble. Therefore, there were 200 government amendments, and about 70 from the third party, and we had about 40. None of ours were accepted.", "The other point that we tried to make was that we needed better protection in this bill to prevent the sexual exploitation of children and youth and the human trafficking of children and youth in care, specifically, and to not just ignore the fact that there are human traffickers hanging out outside the group homes, knowing that there are very vulnerable youth living there and it’s just easy pickings for them. There was nothing reflected in this bill to deal with that, and our amendments to strengthen protection for children and youth against child pornography were ignored when we went through amendments at the committee.", "We heard a lot about youth being put in isolation by the child care workers when they’re being too difficult to handle. We all supported—all three parties—a maximum of 24 hours in isolation. It’s really quite shocking when you imagine that, up until now, youth might be placed in isolation for 48 hours. They’re not criminals.", "A lot of times, I have a feeling they’re in isolation because they’re not getting mental health support. There is nothing in this bill to talk about some kind of system directed for youth in care and children in care for the mental health support that we know most of them need. There’s no recognition that any child or youth taken into care right away is obviously experiencing some kind of emotional trauma. There’s nothing in here, in this bill, about better training for child care workers in dealing with mental health episodes. Maybe in the preamble, touching on it, but there certainly isn’t a system that the government is implementing where, if a foster parent or a group home worker takes a child who is in care to a hospital or calls a mental health crisis centre or calls the police, they are somehow treated in, maybe, a bit of a special manner.", "I would have liked to have heard from experts what could be done to provide better support, because too often we hear that until there is a crisis—even a suicide attempt isn’t enough to get them the help they need. What I’m hearing in some of the communities is that unless a youth commits a criminal act, gets put in jail, gets apprehended—because now they’re in the justice system, they get apprehended. Because now they’re labelled a criminal, that’s when they get the mental health support they need, when they’re in a detention centre, in a jail.", "Isn’t that horrific? What kind of system is that? We recognize that the majority of youth and children in care need mental health support. Instead of giving them the support, we’re allowing workers to get assaulted, children and youth to assault each other, self-inflicted injuries—all kinds of things go on which I think in the long run cost the taxpayers of Ontario more than if we just dealt with the problem in the first place. It’s frustrating.", "I mentioned previously Jane Kovarikova’s report that she gave all of us, Exploring Youth Outcomes after Aging-Out of Care. Youth who age out of care have far worse outcomes than youth not in care. I bet that youth in foster homes probably do better than in group homes.", "I just want to end by saying a few things about the PC caucus. Actually, the member from the NDP had also joined me in requesting that the Minister of Children and Youth Services appear before the committee to answer a number of questions, and he refused. I found that very disappointing—32 years to overhaul the child welfare system and we weren’t able to directly ask the minister questions.", "Our caucus recognizes the challenges in raising physically and emotionally healthy, educated children. We all supported—from all parties—the need to respect children’s—not just their voice, but their culture, their family, their environment, their religion. Also, as the francophone critic, I have to mention their right to francophone services and workers and foster parents.", "We want all children to grow up to be the best they can be, to be contributing members of society. I’m hoping that the government will do a study and monitor, because if we don’t monitor the outcomes, we’re never going to be able to get this right." ],

I want them to know that without them, without their voices, beginning with the Youth Leaving Care Hearings, none of this would be happening today.", "I know that many of them were hoping for better results, but they can be proud of what they have achieved. I encourage them to continue to do the work and continue to advocate for real change to the system that one day will make a difference. I am so proud, and I am inspired by each and every one of you every single day.", "Speaker, during second reading debate, I noted that I supported the direction that this new bill was taking, but also that I was concerned that it didn’t go far enough and that the principles outlined in the preamble were not reflected in the wording of the actual legislation. This was echoed by many who were intimately involved in the system.", "Katelynn’s Principle, as presented in the jury’s recommendations from the coroner’s inquest into the death of Katelynn Sampson, offered a template for what this bill should include. To an extent, it was reflected in the preamble of the act, which says, “The government of Ontario acknowledges that children are individuals with rights to be respected and voices to be heard.... Services provided to children and families should be child-centred.”", "Another recommendation from that jury was that the Premier champion the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The UNCRC also got a mention in the preamble, but we needed to ensure that those principles were reinforced throughout the act with actual legislation. I have to say, I regret to report that while some of those changes were made, it still falls very short.", "Sparrow Garlow presented to committee. She is 14 years old. She is a First Nations youth and identified herself as a crown ward. She freely admitted that she hadn’t read the bill, but she did have life experience and she knew that she wanted to tell her story. She wondered aloud if this legislation was going to help other children and youth not to have the experience that she did.", "Before she was 13, she was placed in a group home with other girls between the ages of 16 and 19, where she stayed, despite her requests to move, for 15 months. Here’s some of what Sparrow said:", "“This is what it’s like to live in a group home: Being constantly watched—they wrote down logs that listed when I got up, if I left, what I ate, what I watched, who I talked to and if I completed my daily expectations. At the end of the day, they decided if I moved up a level and kept my privileges, or dropped a level and lost my privileges.", "“I needed to ask for mouthwash, shampoo and hygiene products. They wrote down when I showered and when I brushed my teeth.”", "The experience that Sparrow describes sounds more like she was being detained rather than given a home. As an Ojibway youth, she feels more effort should have been made to get her out of the institutional setting and into a home. Thanks to her own initiative, she made a video and she finally got a placement in a foster home. She described to us what that was like:", "“Being a foster kid means having a lot of meetings, and I have no control over who attends these meetings. I just show up, and there are random people there. They could be social work students, coverage workers or whoever wants to be there. No one asks my permission. They openly discuss me and my experiences, even though I am not comfortable.”", "Sparrow feels strongly that she was never listened to and her own Ojibway heritage was never properly recognized or supported. Against her wishes, a court order was signed giving her father access if she consented. She had to fight for an access order with her mother, who lives on reserve.", "Records with children’s aid are inconsistent regarding her heritage. “No one asked me what I am,” Sparrow told us. “They asked my dad and believed him, even though he is not First Nation and has never supported my culture.... I am hoping no one else has to face these challenges when they ask for help.”", "Speaker, I wanted to share some of Sparrow’s words because they display so clearly some of the problems in this system and why it is so important that we get this right. She has shown great courage, not just in coming before the committee but through her time in care. Not every child in care would have Sparrow’s spirit and determination. Her resilience, I think and I hope, will see her through. But children and youth in care shouldn’t have to be exceptional to survive or succeed. We should make it possible for them all to succeed.", "I don’t doubt that if we would have heard from many others, if we had taken a bit more time and if the committee had travelled the province, I think it would have been time well spent. This is a huge bill that rewrites the Child and Family Services Act, the act that puts in writing how the government of Ontario and agencies working on its behalf conduct themselves as guardians and protectors of our most valuable resource, our children and our youth. The importance of this bill cannot be underestimated. It is arguably the most important legislation that we can deal with. It deserved to be given adequate time to fully digest it, to fully understand its implications and the impact that it would have on children and youth, who will be and are our future.", "We needed to hear from those people whose lives are affected every day by the words that we pass into law. We had an opportunity with this bill to build a system that truly meets the needs of children, youth, their families and our entire society. The “biggest game-changer ... in decades,” the minister called it. The Premier stated previously that maybe we should blow up the whole system. So we had an opportunity to be bold, to write a piece of legislation that was consistent with what we have learned over the past number of years, up to and including what we heard at committee.", "As I look at what we have before us now, I think that we have moved in the right direction, but I can’t help but know that this is an opportunity missed. We had an opportunity to put rules in place to fully respect the rights of a child, the opportunity to establish accountability measures that could build confidence in families, an opportunity to overhaul residential services and ensure children and youth got the care and treatment they needed. We could have legislated programs and policies that would properly address the evident overrepresentation of First Nations and black youth—a missed opportunity to remove the inequity in youth justice that allows two systems with different standards to run side by side, treating the exact same kids. But we failed.", "While I welcome the changes that are being made, I say again that I believe we have missed an opportunity to do so much more. The fact that the government brought forward 150 amendments suggests it was rushed through the drafting stage. The government says they responded to what they heard, but let’s be honest: Many other amendments were written before we even started the hearings.", "What about the opportunity that the public had to read and take in what this bill would actually do to the delivery of services? Again, this a huge bill. In many places, it pulls language from the existing Child and Family Services Act with no or only minor changes. In many other places, it had more significant changes. Due to reordering of various components of the act, comparison with the existing act was difficult.", "My point here is that understanding this legislation was a challenging project, even for those of us who work with it every single day. Legislation is not written in a way that is accessible or in plain language to children, youth and families who are going to need to be able to read and understand this legislation. Children and youth who will be directly affected by these changes that we make are the very people that we needed to hear from. But it was made difficult when time was severely limited—no time to organize their thoughts and work out how best they might get important points across.", "This is also true for those who work in the field. They are exceptionally busy people, pulled in all different directions, with very limited resources that they have to work with. The time between the end of submissions and the preparation of amendments was terribly inadequate to be able to do the job that needed to be done.", "I don’t know why the government insisted on putting these constraints on time, but I do know that the quality of legislation before us has suffered as a result. This bill could easily have been split in two: one bill to amend the existing CFSA to provide protection to 16- and 17-year-olds, and another bill to enact the new Child, Youth and Family Services Act. The bill was already designed to enact these two different sections at different times, with the government not planning to bring the CYFSA into force until several months down the road.", "Interjections." ],

In fact, some of the amendments were ones that we in the NDP had proposed as well.", "Children and youth have been given the right not just to be consulted but also to participate in decisions affecting them. They will also now have a right to receive a response to concerns they raise. Physical restraints have been defined and restricted. There is consideration of the importance of extended family to a child or youth receiving services. Language has been further updated to remove terms like “apprehended.”", "Those are just a few examples. But as I said at second reading, I am concerned that this bill lacks teeth in the provisions to enforce the principles set out in the preamble.", "In many cases, Speaker, amendments went in a similar direction, but the government members invariably chose to go with what I consider to be the weaker version. They chose to give the bill a few more teeth but not a full set—far from it.", "I raised concerns that the bill was not robust enough, that it allowed the minister discretion in too many areas. Too often, the bill states that the minister “may” take a particular action. While a few of those “mays” have been changed to “shalls,” there are still too many instances where there is no specific requirement of the minister to act.", "I had also pointed out that there were too many provisions of the bill where the details were missing. They’d been pushed off to be governed by regulations. Of course, those regulations will never get discussed in this chamber, nor will the public ever have the opportunity to have input. This is a serious flaw of this bill, and it doesn’t appear to have been corrected.", "If you look at part XII of the bill, the part that deals with regulations, you can see that only one regulation has been deleted. The regulation that prescribed the standards and procedures for the use of physical restraints is now reflected directly in the act—a good move, no doubt, but it was a lonely journey as it made its way, alone, from regulation to legislation.", "We could have done so much more to provide the details right in the legislation. Instead, we’re not sure what this is going to look like after the regulations are written.", "Let’s take a look at a few recommendations that the government members rejected. One made reference to Katelynn’s Principle—the right to be heard. While this act was described at its introduction as being consistent with Katelynn’s Principle, nowhere in the act is Katelynn’s Principle mentioned. I, as well as others, thought it would have driven home what we wanted to achieve with this act: that the voice, views and wishes of the child must be given due consideration.", "Think back to the sad case of Katelynn Sampson, think back to the words of Sparrow, and consider the difference this would have made to their experience.", "We heard from presenters, and we know from studies, that there are a number of factors that impact the likelihood of a child going into care. We know that a child will thrive better with their family, and we should provide supports to make that possible. That’s why I brought forward an amendment that would require the minister to make resources available to support families and to ensure children are not separated from them or their community because of disability, lack of health care, educational needs, inadequate shelter or financial hardship. It would also have ensured that funding and support for First Nations, Inuit and Métis children would be comparable in quality and accessibility to that for other children. We heard all about “an ounce of prevention,” but none of that is happening right now. This amendment could have done that. We could have done more to help families who are caught up in the system.", "I suggested a system of independent family navigators to help families work within it, to benefit their child and their family.", "We heard from representatives from a number of First Nations communities and groups. If it wasn’t clear before, those groups certainly made us aware of the deep challenges that exist as we try to ensure adequate child welfare for First Nations, Inuit and Métis children and families.", "Let’s remember what the preamble says: “The government of Ontario is committed, in the spirit of reconciliation, to working with First Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples to help ensure that wherever possible, they care for their children in accordance with their distinct cultures, heritages and traditions.” Sadly, the provisions of the bill do little to enforce or reinforce this statement.", "The part of the bill specifically dealing with First Nations, Inuit and Métis child and family services, part IV, is a tiny part of this bill, as it was before in the CFSA. After our hearings, there were two small amendments made: one to allow for funding for “persons or entities” and the other an update of language, the same as was done in other parts.", "We have to do better, Speaker. Aboriginal youth are overrepresented, dramatically, in our child welfare system. We’ve heard over and over that our system is letting them down.", "It hasn’t been done with this bill. We must put a clear focus on our First Nations communities and assist them to build a system that works for them.", "The African Canadian community is also grossly overrepresented. Their populations are way out of control when it comes to the number of children in the system, but we did nothing to address it at all. That’s a huge inequity in this bill.", "The work around this bill has been extremely frustrating for all involved. I met with those groups. They came to me. By the time they got to me, it was too late in the process; there was no way I could put amendments forward for them. They didn’t know the system. They don’t know how it works around here. And when it’s time-allocated, they don’t even have a chance.", "Speaker, I’m running out of time as quickly as possibly can happen, and I want to make sure I hit some really important pieces.", "I need to address the act on personal information. The Information and Privacy Commissioner made an extensive presentation to committee. He commended the government for introducing the privacy protection for individuals who are involved, but unfortunately, none of that was covered. So what did the government have to do? Rewrite the entire legislation with about 45 amendments that were pages long to include what he needed to say.", "Then I asked for the commissioner to come back to committee. The government denied the opportunity. I want to hear from the experts. There’s no way I’m going to listen to the government say, “Trust me. This is what he wants.” If they had listened to him in the first place, there’s no way that he would have been left out the way he was. But, unfortunately, they did not let that happen.", "In the last few minutes, I want to talk about funding. If we do not put the funding into the system, then this is all a shell game. Everything that we have done, everything that we have gone through and everything that people have put their hearts and souls into for this last probably year of extensive work and thought is all going to be for naught if the funding does not follow this legislation.", "Once again, I’m totally disheartened by this process, and it’s unfortunate that the government thought that the right thing to do was to ram this through—because it does not make it right." ],

  "text" : [ "I would like to start by acknowledging that we are gathered on the traditional territory of the indigenous nations, and I would like to pay special recognition to the Mississaugas of the New Credit. I also want to recognize the long histories and significant contributions of First Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples to this city and to this province.", "I’m proud to speak to the proposed Supporting Children, Youth and Families Act, which I will refer to moving forward as Bill 89. This bill focuses our attention as a province on children and youth: on their voices, their opinions, their goals, and not just the issues that they are facing. If passed, this legislation will set the course for bold system change to a range of Ontario’s children and youth services. It will strengthen young people’s rights so that they have a voice in the decisions that affect them.", "As the MPP for Kingston and the Islands and as the parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Children and Youth Services, it’s important to me that we do everything possible to empower and support children and youth, especially the most vulnerable. They must reach their fullest potential.", "We are committed to transforming the child welfare sector and to changing the culture within it. We’re committed to giving children the best possible start in life. We’re committed to helping our youth as they prepare for the often challenging transition into adulthood, to ensuring children, youth and families have access to the services and supports that they need. We take these commitments very seriously.", "Promoting the protection and well-being of children and youth is not just our obligation as leaders entrusted to shape the future of this great province, but it is our duty and our privilege. That is why we have introduced this legislation, and that is why this legislation reflects the insight and calls to action that we heard from our valued partners—including children, youth and their families— during the consultation and public hearings process.", "If passed and proclaimed, the Child, Youth and Family Services Act, or CYFSA, will replace the Child and Family Services Act, the legislative framework enacted more than three decades ago that currently governs many of the province’s programs and services for our children and youth. This bill includes child welfare, youth justice, treatment programs, developmental services, residential services, community support, indigenous child and family services, and, of course, adoption.", "The proposed legislation better reflects our society’s values, diversity, and the needs of the children and youth of today and tomorrow.", "We want to thank the Provincial Advocate for Children and Youth, Irwin Elman, and the Ontario Association of Children’s Aid Societies, as well as First Nations, Inuit, Métis and urban indigenous partner agencies for the incredible work that they do on the ground supporting our children and youth in care. We want to thank our indigenous leaders and community organizations for their powerful advocacy and support of indigenous children and youth.", "We have listened to families and leaders from indigenous communities across Ontario, and we understand that while we have come very far, we still have a long way to go. We’re committed to reconciliation and to ensuring indigenous communities are respected and have greater control over the care that their children and youth receive.", "I want to thank the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner, the Ontario Association of Residences Treating Youth, the Ontario Residential Care Association, Children’s Mental Health Ontario, the Canadian Union of Public Employees and UNICEF Canada for working with our government on this important legislation. I also want to thank the front-line support workers who have dedicated their careers to supporting and empowering our province’s children and youth. I also want to thank the hundreds of other organizations across this province that work in the child welfare space and advocate for children and for reform, and have travelled great distances to share their perspectives during the committee process.", "Mr. Speaker, I’m inspired by the tireless efforts of the many community agencies, advocates and front-line workers across this province who work diligently each and every day to improve the outcomes for children, youth and families in Ontario. We thank them for compassionately and expertly guiding young people on their journeys to adulthood, and we thank them for helping to build stronger communities.", "Most importantly, I also want to thank the children and youth with lived experience who courageously and articulately shared their thoughts and goals with us—youth like the 25-year-old man who spoke to our committee and shared his lived experience as a child who first came into care when he was only nine years old. He said that this legislation is not about the men and women who were in the room; it’s about young people like him. “We have such an important mission ... a responsibility ... to youth and young people that this province of ours services.... It’s so important we get it right”—and he was absolutely right.", "This legislation will give our youth greater support and better outcomes. While this particular young man is no longer in care and does exceptional work supporting youth in care today, I know that this legislation is an important step forward for the children that we are responsible for today. We have a responsibility and a duty to protect, support and provide an environment where our children and youth like him can thrive.", "The CYFSA will, if passed and proclaimed, put the focus where it belongs: on our children and youth. This government is taking bold action, and this is why we proposed Bill 89. The children and youth of this province have been waiting for these changes for many years.", "If passed, this legislation will put children and youth at the heart of decision-making—with Katelynn’s Principle, a principle strongly advocated by children and youth across Ontario and by the Provincial Advocate for Children and Youth. It will strengthen the requirement in law to give young people a voice in the decisions about their care and protection.", "Under the proposed CYFSA, children and youth receiving services have the right to express their views freely and safely about matters that affect them. They have the right to have their views given due weight, in accordance with their age and maturity. They will be consulted on the nature of services they are receiving, and advised of the decisions made. They can raise concerns or recommend changes about the services that they’re receiving, without fear of coercion, discrimination or reprisal. They will be informed of these rights and about the services provided by the Provincial Advocate for Children and Youth and the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario.", "While our focus is on the future, our proposed legislation builds on the work of the past. Together with the support of our partners, we have implemented a number of incremental, beneficial changes that have made child and youth services stronger, more responsive to individual family needs and more accountable to the public. Today, fewer children and youth are coming into care, and youth have more supports when transitioning into adulthood.", "While we are proud of our accomplishments, we know we must keep raising the bar for our children and youth, and that’s what the CYFSA does. During our consultations, young people told us that we need to do a better job of listening. I know I told my own parents that. They told us they want us to better understand their rights, and they told us that they want their perspectives to be respected.", "We heard from indigenous partners about the essential importance of respecting their autonomy and their own approaches to supporting their children and families in their communities and in a culturally appropriate manner.", "We heard that the current legislation does not reflect the diversity of Ontario, and that services must be more inclusive and culturally appropriate for children and youth of all backgrounds and identities. We listened carefully, and we are taking action.", "The proposed CYFSA aims to be consistent with and build upon the principles of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. It recognizes the importance of diversity and inclusion, consistent with the Human Rights Code and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It also recognizes the need to address systemic racism.", "It introduces a number of changes focused on increasing transparency and accountability, and improving service quality across a wide range of child and youth services. It builds on the goals of Katelynn’s Principle, which holds that every child needs to be seen, heard and respected. It empowers children and families, and it ensures that services are provided in a way that is child-centred for every child and young person receiving services.", "Mr. Speaker, we are backing up our words with action. In the proposed budget, our government has committed an additional $134 million over four years to support new initiatives in the child welfare sector. Supporting children and youth, helping them reach their full potential, is a critical part of our plan to build a stronger and healthier Ontario. I am proud that we have made a significant investment in this year’s budget to help put our plan into action.", "The CYFSA has numerous goals. Rights of children and youth need to be observed; they need to be listened to. We need to support First Nations, Inuit and Métis children, youth and families, and respect their cultures, knowledge and traditions as well as their autonomy.", "Our children’s aid and indigenous child well-being societies are not currently allowed to deliver protection and other services to many vulnerable 16- and 17-year-olds. We know that older youth have been abused or neglected, and have an increased risk of experiencing homelessness, mental health issues, substance abuse, human trafficking and decreased employment prospects. We can’t, as a province, afford to ignore these issues.", "The proposed CYFSA raises the age of protection to 18, extending access to the existing range of child protection services to 16- and 17-year-olds and their families. If passed, this provision would bring Ontario in line with many other provinces and territories across Canada. This is the right thing to do.", "The CYFSA affirms Ontario’s commitment to diversity and inclusion, and to providing culturally appropriate services. It recognizes the need to address systemic racism and the challenges it creates for children, youth and families receiving the services. It paves the way for services that provide the best possible support to children and youth. It focuses on quality improvement.", "The proposed legislation will provide new rights for children, youth and families, including the right to access their personal information from service providers. There will be new rules about privacy, protection and information-sharing between service providers, that are being proposed in order to help families, so that they only have to tell their story once.", "Our government wants to improve the delivery of adoption services. We want children to find stability through permanent homes and through relationships that are meaningful to them.", "If passed, the proposed legislation will give children a stronger voice in decisions about their relationships with their birth families.", "To the members of this House: I ask that each of you provide all-party support for this important legislation, so that we can empower and support our children and youth. We want to help children reach their fullest potential to succeed. The children and the youth are at the heart of this legislation and continue to be at the heart of our actions, moving forward." ],

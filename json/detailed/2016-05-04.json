This is a necessary piece of legislation that will help close the retirement savings gap for the two thirds of Ontario employees who do not have a workplace pension plan.", "This gap is even worse for younger people. Three quarters of Ontario workers aged 25 to 34 do not have a workplace pension plan. Speaker, that’s something I can speak to, not that I’m not in that language, but I started my working life, obviously, in that age group and I’ve never had a workplace pension plan. I know that for a lot of people within my circle of friends this is a very active conversation as to the retirement income security of individuals who work extremely hard, and we know that CPP is not sufficient.", "That’s why our government made the Ontario Retirement Pension plan, or ORPP, one of the pillars of our economic plan. We believe that every worker deserves to have a secure retirement. Bill 186 enshrines the key plan design details of the ORPP in legislation. This bill also provides employers and employees with the time and the clarity they need to prepare for the launch of the ORPP, with enrolment starting in January 2017, and the collection of contributions phased in starting January 1, 2018.", "Passing this bill will bring us one step closer to our government’s goal that all Ontario workers are either enrolled in the ORPP or in a comparable workplace pension plan by 2020.", "Speaker, as I’m sure you are aware, the government has carried out extensive consultations on the ORPP. In 2014, the Associate Minister of Finance led a province-wide consultation to provide an overview of the government’s plan to enhance retirement security. This included 13 consultations; visits to over 10 communities; engaging with businesses, associations, non-profit organizations, labour, individuals and families; and, in addition, speaking with hundreds of Ontarians.", "In 2015, the Associate Minister of Finance led a second province-wide consultation to discuss the plan. That particular consultation included 15 consultations; visits to over 12 communities, including northern, rural and urban communities; engaging with businesses, associations, the self-employed, young professionals, social advocates, non-profit organizations, labour, individuals and families; and speaking with hundreds of Ontarians.", "Speaker, I can personally attest, because I know that the minister came to my community in Ottawa on several occasions holding these meetings and consultations, and they were very well attended, with diverse perspectives being presented from my community of Ottawa Centre, of course, and the city of Ottawa that I live in.", "Speaker, the ministry has also received over 1,000 written submissions to the ORPP consultation.", "This is the third piece of legislation related to the ORPP that our government has introduced. The first was Bill 56, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Act, which went through the Standing Committee on Social Policy, where we heard from 40 deputants.", "The second bill, Bill 91, the Building Ontario Up Act, which established the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Administration Corp., went through the Standing Committee on Finance and Economic Affairs and heard from over 50 deputants.", "Now, there’s this particular bill, Bill 186, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Act, which this House has debated for over seven hours already.", "Speaker, it’s important that we move forward with Bill 186 and bring it before the committee. In the last Parliament, this Legislature was ground to a halt and was unable to move forward. Only 39% of government bills were passed in the last minority government, unfortunately, compared to more than three quarters of bills that were passed going back to 1990.", "The voters of Ontario sent a clear message in 2014, no ifs and buts about it: They want our government to provide Ontario workers with a predictable stream of income paid for life in retirement. We cannot afford to have the opposition recklessly hold up this important piece of legislation with procedural trickery and needless filibustering. We need to move this legislation forward in a timely manner so that employers can prepare for the launch of the ORPP.", "It is time that we end second reading and refer the bill to committee. In committee, of course, stakeholders will present their views. We will be able to hear directly from the public on their thoughts on this bill, as we’ve been doing through the consultation process and, of course, the consultation in committee on the last two bills as well. Also, as we all know, committee members will have an opportunity to move amendments to the bill as well.", "At the same time, Speaker, this House can move to substantive debate on other very important matters. There are a number of important pieces of legislation that have already been introduced, which the government would like to debate in the House and move through the legislative process; for example, Bill 119, which is the Health Information Protection Act; Bill 135, which is the Energy Statute Law Amendment Act; Bill 156, which is the Alternative Financial Services Statute Law Amendment Act; and, very important, Bill 172, which is the Climate Change Mitigation and Low-carbon Economy Act.", "Speaker, we would like to spend time debating some of the other important pieces of legislation currently before the House; we cannot wait until Bill 186 is dealt with. That is why I have moved this motion. I urge all members to support this motion. Bill 186 is a very important piece of legislation. It succeeds two other pieces of legislation and completes the work of establishing the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan, which is going to be a cornerstone ensuring that we have retirement income security for Ontarians, especially young Ontarians, so that for the hard work they do they are able to save money and will be able to live with safety and security in their retirement. Of course, Speaker, that is a huge boon to our economy as well, because when people retire and have a predictable income, that money is invested back in our local economy, which is also very important.", "Speaker, I end my debate now and urge all members to support this motion." ],

It’s nearly getting to the point where I can start each of my speeches this way. It appears that the ORPP ‘scheme-boat’ is moving full speed ahead. A lot of people are really wondering why the Ontario Liberals want to rush this thing through the House without more debate. When looking over the timeline of events that led to this point, it’s not the first questionable act by the government when it comes to this issue.", "How did it all begin in the first place? Well, I’m glad you asked that question, Mr. Speaker. Years ago, the Premier said she needed to create her own pension scheme because Ottawa was refusing to expand the Canada Pension Plan. Perhaps if she had tried to offer a handshake instead of throwing elbows, there would have been more co-operation between levels of government. She reiterated this last year while taking time away from her office to campaign for candidates at another level of government, starkly breaking away from the long-standing tradition of Premiers staying objective during elections and focusing on governing.", "The Premier stated that the only reason the province needed the ORPP was because Prime Minister Stephen Harper would not expand the Canada Pension Plan. She then said that if people voted for Justin Trudeau’s Liberals, she wouldn’t need to implement a costly duplicate program here in Ontario, because she would finally have a partner she was willing to try to work with. That was the Premier’s argument on October 13 last year; the dates matter because it is difficult to keep up with flip-flops.", "On October 13, 2015, an article appeared in the National Post with the following headline: “Wynne Says Ontario Would Drop Pension Plan if a Federal Liberal Government Expands CPP.” The article explains the Premier’s now-abandoned position:", "“Wynne says she couldn’t convince the Harper government to enhance the Canada Pension Plan, so her government introduced an Ontario Retirement Pension Plan that would mirror the CPP, essentially doubling deductions and benefits.", "“She says if Trudeau wins the Oct. 19 federal election and is willing to improve the CPP, that would be ‘the solution’ to her concerns....”", "Well, the Liberals won the election, so there should be no reason now for the redundant ORPP scheme to be implemented, right? Wrong. Well, not so fast. It turns out that the Premier quickly reversed this position as soon as the election was over. Isn’t that convenient?", "A little over a month later, the Premier clarified her comments by saying she actually meant the exact opposite of what she said before the election. The Liberals then made the questionable claim that they could simply roll the redundant ORPP into the CPP later. That certainly sounds quite complicated and costly, but the Liberals said it is so, so it must be true. But is that accurate?", "On January 13, a National Post article threw doubt on such a complicated plan. The headline stated, “Despite What the Premier Says, Ontario’s Pension Plan Can’t Simply Be Rolled into an Expanded CPP.” Mike Moffat, an assistant professor of economics at the Richard Ivey School of Business in London, stated, “I’m not entirely sure how they would pull that off, because they’re quite a bit different.” He goes on to say, “Let’s say this thing exists for three or four or five years, and then to fold it back into CPP, I’m not sure how that would work, to be quite honest.” The professor went on to say that while rolling the ORPP into the CPP could technically be done, the cost of doing this would be astronomical. That’s another alarm bell ringing loud and clear.", "With citizens seeing alarming trends from this government such as fundraising quotas being placed on ministers of the crown and billions of dollars handed out to secret Liberal friends with no public records of who got the money or how many jobs it created, they start to ask pretty tough questions about potential corruption.", "Now Premier Wynne wants to reach into your pocket to pull out money for her pension plan. It kind of reminds me of a commercial I used to see a long time ago: Hands in my Pockets. Well, you know what? She wants to reach into your pocket and pull out money for her pension scheme, after she herself said that the only reason for the scheme was that Prime Minister Harper would not expand CPP and that she would drop the redundant program if the Liberals were elected. Well, the ground the Premier stood on to argue for the ORPP disappeared from under her feet, but she plowed ahead anyway.", "Does anyone in Ontario actually trust the Premier with their pension money? Why do we need to set up an entirely new program with its own administrative costs to do something the federal government already does successfully? Why is the Ontario Liberal government so obsessed with getting our pension dollars in their hands? I have a few thoughts on that, but I may be asked to withdraw so I won’t say them.", "There is intense resistance to the Wynne Liberal pension scheme right across the political spectrum from—get this—the Fraser Institute to CUPE. When was the last time they agreed on anything? That ought to send a clear message to the government: Nobody, other than the Ontario Liberals, thinks that the ORPP is the way to go.", "Is it because their focus isn’t really on retirement security and pensions at all? Any program of this size has the potential to make those who are tasked with running it a lot of money. A line in the recent budget stated that through the ORPP “new pools of capital would be available for Ontario-based projects.” If you’re a fisherman, something smells fishy here.", "One wonders why a government that handed out $163 million to its biggest donor would want to spend pension money on things other than pensions. The ORPP bill, as it’s written, leaves a massive loophole for pension funds to be spent on a wide variety of different things. The pension administration corporation, which will be appointed by the Liberals, would be left to determine where to spend the money for “the benefit of members and other beneficiaries.” Would those “other beneficiaries” be friends of the Wynne Liberals in the private sector?", "We’ve seen incredibly worrisome acts from the Liberal government, but they have increased dramatically after this Premier came to power. They’re giving government grants to friends and generous donors off the public record. There’s also the curious trend of Ontario Liberals becoming filthy rich once they leave Queen’s Park, free to negotiate secret, million-dollar deals with the government they just worked for. That is why a public inquiry is needed to restore trust in the public that its government is not becoming a for-profit business.", "Now the Wynne Liberals want to set up another massive pool of money to play in. They say it’s for pensions, but it can actually be spent on other things. By the way, this is a government that is currently facing—count them—five OPP investigations." ],

No more flip-flopping. In this case, if she flip-flops and she has to do a backflip, it would be called a flop-flip.", "We’re being asked to support a program with unknown costs and unknown benefits, and the very reason for this program in the first place no longer exists. What’s worse, we’re now being told that we cannot ask any more questions or raise any other criticisms of this redundant and expensive pension plan scheme here in the Legislature. Once again, the Ontario Liberals are running from a debate.", "Mr. Speaker, I know you’ll be happy to hear this: If elected, Patrick Brown and the PCs would remove and refund the redundant ORPP and ensure that no more taxpayer dollars end up in the pockets of friends of the Ontario Liberals who are becoming filthy rich while the rest of the province tries to keep up with the rising cost of living in the Wynne Liberals’ Ontario." ],

Are they afraid to have debate on a bill that they feel proud about? There is a right of members to be able to express their views for or against a particular initiative of this Legislature.", "It is clear in the Legislature that the Liberals’ ORPP is somewhat supported by New Democrats. We’re in favour of the principle. We think there are some changes that need to be made because there are some exclusions; I’ll let other people speak to that. But the other party here, the Conservative Party, have, in their view, legitimate issues that they feel need to be put on the record in order to deal with what they see is a plan that they can’t support. I don’t understand why a government is afraid to hear from an opposition party, in this case the Conservatives, speaking against their initiative. If the initiative is so good, their arguments will prevail and the public will support them; if the Tory arguments are bad, it actually works against the Tories.", "I don’t understand politically, first of all, why they wouldn’t allow debate, but the more important question is: This place is supposed to be about making sure that the voices of everyone in this Legislature are heard. These are all representatives of the people. We all ran and got elected in our individual ridings as New Democrats, Conservatives or Liberals to represent the people in our constituencies and, yes, to represent our political views of our own political philosophy as New Democrats, Conservatives or Liberals. When a member of this assembly who is duly elected by the public doesn’t have an ability to be heard because the government decides by fiat that it’s going to truncate a debate by way of time allocation, I think it’s an affront to our democracy and, quite frankly, an affront to this institution.", "The Legislature, until 1992, didn’t have time allocation. The only thing you were able to do was to call the question, and the threshold by which you were allowed to call the question and it being called was a lot higher than it is now. Now, because there’s time allocation in the standing orders after seven and a half hours, calling the question probably only needs about eight or nine hours for the question to be called. There was a time that there wasn’t any time allocation and the threshold for calling the question was much higher. And guess what happened? The political parties actually had to work together. Why? Because the government of the day, whoever it might be, wanted to pass a particular initiative, whatever it was, an opposition party or two opposition parties may be opposed, and then you picked your fights. You fought on the things that you really cared about and then you traded off on the other things that you could support and then you would get something in exchange.", "For an example, in this particular fight that the Conservatives are having on the ORPP, they may have demanded, “Listen, we want more hearings. We want an ability for the bill to travel.” Well, how is that a bad thing for the people we represent, number one? I don’t see it as a bad thing. I see it as a service to democracy.", "How is it bad for the government—if they have an initiative that they think is good and is worthy of support, well, then, you should be okay with travelling your own bill and having the opposition speak against it; it’ll serve your political need.", "The only reason that they do time allocation now is because, quite frankly, the government has gotten lazy. It’s gotten lazy with democracy. It’s gotten lazy in having to listen to the voices of the duly elected members. It’s gotten lazy in having to listen to the people who want to say something on this, who want to come to our committees to be heard. As you know, Mr. Speaker, once this bill is finished second reading, it is ordered to committee. And when it’s in committee and if there isn’t time allocation—in the old days, you would travel the bill somewhere in Ontario so people could be heard. Imagine that. Imagine a Legislature that allows the people to be heard: Oh, my God, how awful that would be.", "That’s what the government is saying by way of this motion. They’re saying that giving members the ability to use their voice in the Legislature, which they were democratically elected to do, shouldn’t be done; and they’re saying the people who want to speak to this particular bill in committee, at either Toronto or other places in Ontario as the committee travels, don’t have to be heard. And I say, shame on the government House leader, shame on the Premier, and shame on the government for utilizing time allocation.", "There are bills in this House—and if you look at this order paper, Mr. Speaker, it’s a pretty thin order paper. This isn’t a prop; this is our order paper. And if you look at the order paper, it’s pretty thin. There’s not a lot of legislation left. Why? Because, quite frankly, the opposition has agreed with quite a few of the bills that the government has put forward. We’ve raised some concerns, we’ve allowed the bills to go to committee, and then we make changes.", "But every now and then, there comes a bill where there’s a more principled view on the part of the party for or against the bill. For the Tories on the ORPP—and I don’t agree with them, by the way; I think the position the Conservatives are taking on the ORPP is wrong. I believe that people should have pensions and I’ll speak to that in a second. They have an obligation to do what they think is right as Conservatives and as representatives of the people of their ridings. They have a right to be able to stand in this Legislature to be heard. When a government shuts them down because it’s decided by fiat, by order of the Premier’s office, utilizing the government House leader’s office to bring a motion to censure the opposition, I say it’s a bad thing.", "Now, do most people out in Ontario care?

If you’re 65 years old and you retire and the only thing you have is the old age pension and CPP, it’s going to be a pretty thin budget you live on.

You know how much you’re going to get every month, and you can get on with your life and you can figure out what you’re going to do in your retirement.

They represent people in this assembly, as I do and other members of the assembly do. We have different points of view, but they need to be heard. If you’re not going to allow it—I don’t mean you, Mr. Speaker, because you’re not the one who brought the time allocation. But if the government is going to bring time allocation as a way of shutting down the voices, I think it’s a disservice not only to the members who are being affected, but I think it’s a disservice to the process of this Legislature and it’s a disservice to the people of Ontario and the democracy we’re here to enact." ],

Speaker, this is their own research. Large businesses would consider lay-offs as well as cancelling existing pension plans. This is what they were told through their own research. Small businesses told them that they would redefine employees from full-time to contract workers to avoid the ORPP. In total, they were told 60% of businesses expect to be hurt by the ORPP. This information only came to light because the Canadian Taxpayers Federation filed a freedom of information request. In fact, the Canadian Taxpayers Federation concluded, “It’s remarkable the Ontario government didn’t walk away from the ORPP when they saw this research. The ORPP is being sold as a benefit to Ontario employees, when in reality it will mean many of them will end up worse off.”", "Further, the government decided to do additional research and they did a cost-benefit analysis that was performed by the Conference Board of Canada. Again, this was commissioned by the government’s Ministry of Finance. In this report, it admitted it will take 20 years before the economy recovers from the shock of the ORPP. They calculated and told their client—the government of Ontario—the job losses, in their estimation, will peak at 23,000 in 2023. Real disposable income and consumption spending will remain lower until 2040. This will lead to a fall in real private investment that peaks at $939 million—so almost a billion dollars lost—and that will peak in 2024.", "And when does the report say the good news kicks in?

They were joined by 57 of Ontario’s local chambers of commerce and many associations throughout Ontario, all telling the government of Ontario that only 26% of their members can afford the increased cost of the ORPP and 44% of its members will reduce employees or hire fewer staff.", "The key to remember is that it’s impossible to save for retirement if you don’t have a job, and every one of these organizations is telling the government that jobs will be cut.

He’s talking North America-wide now. He’s talking about our skyrocketing hydro rates. He specifically brought up the ORPP. This is what’s happening. He also talked about the fact that because there will be job losses from this, there will be fewer people in a position to buy the cars he makes. This has got a downward spiral effect that is going to hurt families right across Ontario.", "The Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters, another group—with 750,000 employees—talked about how this ORPP tax will lead to more layoffs and wage freezes. A survey of their members says as many as 35% will lay off staff to cope with the additional costs associated with the ORPP tax. About 68% said they would eliminate wage increases or bonuses to pay for those additional costs.", "I can tell you, Speaker, when I was in London, Ontario, a little while ago, there was a businessperson there and we were talking about the cost of doing business in Ontario. What he told our group was that he’s got 15 employees, and he plans on firing one of them to use that salary to pay for his share of the other 14 ORPPs. And he knows his employees are not going to want to take a 1.9% reduction, because, don’t forget, this is not a government pension. This is not the government giving you a pension. This is your money; 1.9% of your salary, $1,643 every year, will come off your paycheque, and your employer must kick in the same amount. What he said is that he’s going to fire one employee and use that salary to pay for not only his share, but likely he’ll end up paying for his employees’ share as well, because they’re not going to want to take a haircut on their paycheque. That’s anecdotally what’s happening right across Ontario. That’s why all these companies are saying they’re going to have layoffs: because they need that money to pay for the additional costs coming from the ORPP.", "There’s lots of talk about whether this is actually yet another cash grab under the guise of infrastructure.

Referring to the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan, she states, ‘The government will not determine where and how contributions are invested and that the government is establishing an independent body to manage and administer the ORPP.’ That is not what the government told the Legislature. In the 2014 budget, it states, ‘By unlocking value from assets and encouraging more Ontarians to save through the new ORPP, new pools of capital would be available for projects such as roads, bridges and transit.’”", "I’m offended because what was presented to us in the Legislature is the complete opposite of what the public was being told, and that’s another reason why they want to shut down debate: because they don’t want us disclosing all of these things that are contrary to what we’re being told." ],

We want it for our children, our grandchildren and our neighbours. We want all Ontarians to prosper. Don’t forget, Speaker, that what is supposed to be on the table is what the Liberals started out saying would be their plan B—not the time allocation part, Speaker; the original bill was supposed to be their plan B, their backup plan, the one they would only turn to if they were unable to convince the federal government to augment the Canada Pension Plan, the CPP.", "The Ontario pension plan—the whole idea—started out when the Harper Conservatives were in power in Ottawa, and more on that in a moment. So when the Premier went out of her way to campaign so hard for Mr. Trudeau and defeat the Harper Conservatives, we all took it for granted and we all expected that part of her payback for helping with his success in Ontario would be that the Premier could count on his support for improving the CPP. That way, she said, she wouldn’t have to bring in an Ontario pension plan. Of course, she didn’t talk about time allocation back then either.", "By the way, Speaker, when the Premier talked openly about this idea back in August 2015, more than eight months ago, she said, “Our goal is for every employee in Ontario to be part of the ORPP or a comparable workplace pension plan by 2020.” She didn’t say, of course, “I’ll also time-allocate that bill if the opposition keeps finding little holes to pick away at.”", "A few months ago, in January of this year, that “every employee” in the first announcement had been watered down to every “eligible” Ontario employee. Initially, contributions to the new plan were to start in 2017, and now we’re told it will be 2018. Of course, I don’t know what’s going to happen now that the bill is time-allocated. Back in August, the calculation of pension benefits was to be based on a maximum of $90,000 in 2014 dollars. This chameleon of a bill has now been changed to $90,000 in 2017 dollars. The original formula would have seen pensionable earnings set at nearly $93,000 by 2017.

He must be a highly talented and capable manager as well as a Liberal insider to be hauling down more than half a million bucks on the pension file. I just wonder if he was the guy who told the Liberal House leader this morning to bring in time allocation because he’s getting tired of hearing all the bad things that people on this side of the House are saying about the plan that he’s going to get more than half a million dollars to introduce, to lay out—half a million bucks a year.", "As you know, Speaker, we have pensioners at US Steel Canada in Hamilton losing their health benefits, and scared to death they will be losing a good chunk of their pensions. That’s because this Liberal government and the Liberal government in Ottawa are not doing anything to bring in legislation that would protect workers’ rights when a company goes bankrupt. Why the heck wouldn’t a government that says they care about the people actually strengthen existing pension legislation before bringing in something new—or for that matter, instead of bringing in something called time allocation? Those Hamilton workers and workers right across this province deserve to get what’s coming to them after their 25 or 30 years or more of service to a company, companies that are supposed to set aside that money they owe to the employee pension plan.

Many of these big companies get government grants, they get government loans, yet the government doesn’t require them to protect the pension funds of their employees.", "The Canada Pension Plan is simply not good enough. I think we can all agree on that. So why has Prime Minister Trudeau yet to act on his campaign promise to enhance CPP benefits? Why has the Premier let him off the hook?

Has the minister thought this through? If so, perhaps we’ll be enlightened by someone on the government side in a few minutes, unless time allocation prevents them from doing that this morning. Inquiring minds would like to know.", "As we all know, even if you work for the provincial government, you don’t necessarily qualify for a government pension.

The dysfunctional group dynamics of the ‘in group’”—that would be the Liberals—“produces an ‘illusion of invulnerability,’ an inflated certainty that the right decision has been made.” That speaks to what they’re doing here with these time allocation motions, that they are right; they are the only ones who are right and they are the “in group.”", "It goes on: “Thus the ‘in group’ significantly overrates its own abilities in decision-making and significantly underrates the abilities of its opponents, the ‘out group.’” That’s us on this side, the out group. “Furthermore, groupthink can produce dehumanizing actions against the ‘out group.’” I think that is a real good summary of what we see happening with this Liberal government. They’re the smart ones; they’re the intelligent ones. They have an inflated sense of superiority: “We are not going to even let others speak.”", "But as you go through and look at this definition of groupthink, it says, “Antecedent factors such as group cohesiveness, faulty group structure, and situational context, such as community panic, play into the likelihood of whether or not groupthink will impact the decision-making process.” Clearly, once again, community panic is always a great thing for the Liberal government to close off debate on: “We must get this done before the sky falls, before the planet goes off its axis and stops turning.” The Liberal government will bring in legislation to do this, of course, but also group cohesiveness—and nobody will counter that; the Liberals are a very cohesive group—and, as we can see with the Premier’s office, a very faulty structure. So the present Liberal government satisfies each of those conditions to allow groupthink to take place. They do it quite well.", "There was a fellow who pioneered the research on groupthink. His name was Irving Janis. He coined the term “groupthink” along with “doublethink,” and you can see that comes out of that George Orwell novel 1984. But here I think he puts it in even greater clarity: “I use the term ‘groupthink’ as a quick and easy way to refer to the mode of thinking that persons engage in when concurrence-seeking becomes so dominant in a cohesive in-group that it tends to override realistic appraisal of alternative courses in action.”", "That says it all. It says it all. Concurrence-seeking is their dominant position, and it has overridden all realistic appraisal of what they do.", "Speaker, we’ve heard it from others: The pension plan has gone through and morphed through a number of different iterations. It has gone from “everybody” to “eligible.” It has gone from plan B to plan A to plan C. The member from Windsor–Tecumseh used the term “chameleon.” I think it’s a good term; it goes along with “lemmings.” It is a good term in that the Liberals continue to hide their true purposes and objectives with the bill. That’s the chameleon effect of this.", "Irving Janis went on to further say, “The main principle of groupthink, which I offer in the spirit of Parkinson’s law, is this: The more amiability and esprit de corps there is among the members of a policy-making in-group, the greater the danger that the independent critical thinking will be replaced by groupthink, which is likely to result in irrational and dehumanizing actions directed against” others.", "That’s really what we’re seeing. I can’t understand why each of these members on the Liberal side are subjecting themselves to such insignificance and unimportance in their role as legislators. Like those lemmings, they never see the leader at the front of the herd. They never see that fuzzy little one up at the front. They just follow; it doesn’t matter where they’re going. Even if they know they’re going off the cliff, they’re going to follow anyway because they are that cohesive group and irrational thinking is not part of the program.", "Time allocation, once again, Speaker, on a major plank of this Liberal government: It’s stifling debate, killing debate. There must be some Star Trek fans here in the Legislature, and I’m sure there are fans who are watching. Star Trek: The Next Generation with Captain Picard—we need a Captain Picard on that Liberal side of the bench, so when the Borg in the corner office says to all the members, “Resistance is futile,” we need a Liberal member over there to stand up and say, “No, it’s not. Resistance is not futile.” Why don’t you stand up, speak your mind and be a member of this Legislature?" ],

As some of you know, it’s on the road to Campbellford. Keith Brown, of course, was very interested in agriculture. He was a cheese maker by profession before he made the great move to the urban centre of Peterborough.", "Before I begin today, I want to welcome Mr. Brown’s daughters, who I know very well: Jewel Bennett, Janice Gorodzinsky and, of course, Rosemary Ramey. I’m truly glad that you could join us here today.", "In government, we really stand on the shoulders of others who come before us, and Keith Brown was no exception. He served ably as the Progressive Conservative member for Peterborough from 1959 to 1967. He was a witness to three individuals who were so significant in the lives of Ontario politics and, indeed, national politics. During his time he served with the Honourable Leslie Frost, affectionately known as Old Man Ontario. Then, of course, he served with the famous chairman of the board, the honourable John P. Robarts. In 1959—the class of ’59—he was elected with the person who would become affectionately known as “Brampton Billy,” the Honourable William Grenville Davis.", "He certainly worked closely with Premier Robarts and the Honourable William G. Davis, who was then the Minister of Education and Minister of University Affairs, because Keith helped to bring both Trent University and Fleming College to Peterborough. Like a great captain on a bridge of a ship, Keith could always see the next horizon. For him, that horizon was bringing post-secondary education to the sons and daughters of the people of Peterborough.", "Keith was a political champion, winning both the 1959 and 1963 elections with more than 50% of the vote. It was legendary in Peterborough that on election day he used to always loan cars to his opposition so they could get their voters to the polls. That really didn’t matter for Keith, when he won over 50% of the vote.", "He was elected in the class of 1959 that included Mr. Davis. For the longest period of time, Mr. Davis and Mr. Brown were the two remaining individuals of that particular class.", "Keith went on to serve. He didn’t serve in the Bill Davis government. He stepped down in 1967 in order to focus on his many businesses and his family. Keith was a very good politician and he was an excellent businessman. My friend from Timiskaming–Cochrane already told the story about me buying the 1988 Dodge Shadow from Keith. That’s a legendary story in Peterborough.", "Keith grew his business from a single car lot into two dealerships in Peterborough and Campbellford. He also went on to own a taxi fleet, a coach company and a garage, giving career opportunities to more than 400 people in my riding of Peterborough. His love of his community was exemplary, whether it was his lifelong involvement with the Mark Street United Church, his work with the Masonic Lodge or his support for the Community Living camp in Peterborough.", "The camp for Community Living Peterborough has a personal significance for my family, particularly my younger brother. There was a time when families in Peterborough—of course, they didn’t have the opportunity to access that camp to give these families that had sons and daughters with an intellectual disability a bit of respite over the summer. It was Keith Brown who provided a fleet of vehicles so those young children could get to that camp each and every day, something that we’ll always remember Keith Brown for.", "For his commitment to his community, Keith was recognized with the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal in 2012, and, of course, in the not-too-distant future, he will be inducted into the Peterborough Business Hall of Fame. He was also honoured at the 170th annual Peterborough Exhibition, of which he was a big supporter.", "Keith was a proud family man, raising his three daughters, Jewell, Janice and Rosemary, and, of course, somebody I got to know very well, who passed away in 2005, his beloved wife, Marjorie. There’s a lot of talk these days about people with sunny ways, but Marjorie Brown was one of the original people with sunny ways. She had a 100-watt smile. When she went into a room, it turned the room into a very positive experience.", "When she passed away in 2005, I saw Keith a short time after that and he had a very, very heavy heart, but then, of course, things changed. He was back, involved in many things in the city of Peterborough, and he was the real patriarch of that family. As has been mentioned, his current son-in-law, a good friend of mine, is doing an incredible job as the mayor of Peterborough, Daryl Bennett.", "Ladies and gentlemen, in many ways Keith Brown was larger than life itself. I want to share one of his stories from when he was the member for Peterborough. After he was elected in 1959, Leslie Frost, the Premier of the day, gave him some very good advice. He said, “Always remember, young man, that there are no votes here in Toronto and always pay attention to what’s going on in Peterborough.” To highlight that, I want to tell you the McCulloch chainsaw story.", "About two months after he was elected, Keith was paid a visit by the president of Outboard Marine Corp. and the head of the Steelworkers, who represented the hourly rated employees at Outboard Marine. At that particular time, provincial parks in the province of Ontario were using an American chainsaw, the McCulloch chainsaw. But mysteriously, about a month after that meeting, the McCulloch chainsaws in every provincial park across Ontario started to develop problems. There were problems with the carburetors. There were problems with the chains. A month after that, every provincial park had a Pioneer chainsaw made right in Peterborough. That’s how you make changes in politics.", "Keith was a good friend of mine. He provided me with a lot of good advice throughout my 30 years of public service in Peterborough. I remember when I got the privilege in 2003, we met shortly after that and he said, “Jeff, remember the advice that Leslie Frost gave to me, and it’s good advice I want to give to you.”", "It’s been an honour to follow in Keith Brown’s footsteps as the MPP for Peterborough, although they’ve been very big shoes to fill.", "In closing, Mr. Speaker, to my friend Keith, a fond farewell until we meet again. Thank you very much." ],

Keith is survived by his three daughters, who we certainly welcome here today in the Legislature. Jewell, Janice and Rosemary, thank you for being with us here today. He’s also survived by his three son-in-laws, his eight grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.", "As was mentioned, Keith was born in 1926 in the Marmora area, the son of a local cheese maker. In 1945, he married Marjorie Wallace, and they were married almost 60 years before Marjorie passed away in 2005. As described by his daughter Jewell, it was truly a lifelong love affair. Keith was always a “family first” kind of guy and was and still is adored by his family.", "In 1950, Keith started his own business selling cars at a single used car lot. He successfully grew that business into multiple dealerships, eventually founding the Liftlock Group of companies. His business operations provided employment for over 400 people in the community, and he was known, as was said, as the car king of the Kawarthas. Keith’s successful car dealerships served multiple generations of customers. He never forgot the name of a customer, and it was obvious that his customers never forgot him.", "Keith took a hiatus from his successful business career to run for the PC Party in 1959, for the government of Premier Leslie Frost, “Old Man Ontario,” who was from the neighbouring riding. Keith won the election easily and, in the general election of 1963, was re-elected under the leadership of Premier John Robarts with over 50% of the vote.", "During his tenure as MPP, Keith was committed to bringing growth and development to the Peterborough area, thereby benefitting his entire community. He was described by his family as a true-blue Conservative who was dedicated to serving the people of his Peterborough riding.", "Keith continued to be a public figure after his days as MPP. Myself, being the daughter of long-time PC member of Parliament Bill Scott, I remember meeting Keith at various political events and actually being nervous that I was in the presence of the legendary Keith Brown, the man with the car dealerships from Peterborough. I knew my father and my mother, Betty, always considered Keith and his beloved Marjorie to be good friends.", "As much as Keith enjoyed the political life, after two terms he decided it was time to return to the private sector. In 1967, he then went back to being the car king of the Kawarthas.", "We’ve heard about the member for Peterborough purchasing his first car from Keith in 1988, Keith suggesting that Jeff, the member from Peterborough, being a Liberal, should maybe get a certified cheque. I have to say, even when he was out of elected politics, Keith was still keenly aware of the financial risks associated with the Liberals in politics—clearly an astute man, ahead of his time." ],

Daryl is the mayor, but we know where he got his political skills from. Keith took a great deal of pride in Daryl’s success in Peterborough’s municipal politics.", "Following his passing, I was speaking with his daughter Jewell about some stories that she has heard about her dad. She received a number of letters from individuals expanding on the many things that her father did for the people he represented as a politician and for the customers he served in being a caring, community-minded businessman. Many of the tributes expressed in these letters were the first time the family had heard the stories.", "One particular story was from a woman whose uncle had once purchased a new car from Keith, only to have it stolen a few days later. When Keith heard about it, he gave the man a new car to drive until the police located his car. That same man died of Hodgkin’s in his mid-30s, leaving a widow and two very young daughters. Keith asked the widow to come and see him one day, and when she got there, he wrote “paid in full” on her husband’s car loan. Stories like this only serve to reinforce the image and affection which the family has long held for their beloved patriarch.", "Keith was a member of the Masonic Lodge for over 50 years and was a faithful member of the Shriners, serving these fraternal organizations with his leadership and support. He was also a devoted and generous lifelong member of the Mark Street United Church, holding various positions on the board of stewards, board of trustees and session. He was a valued friend, adviser and confidant to all the ministers who served the congregation over the years.", "In January of this year, the new Peterborough Business Hall of Fame announced that at its inaugural dinner in May, there would be a number of posthumous inductees into the hall and, not surprisingly, leading the list was Keith Brown. In announcing the criteria for consideration in the hall of fame, it was stated that a business person has to have displayed two definite traits: success in whatever their business endeavours were, and that they had been good to the community. Keith Brown not only met but exceeded these criteria, hands down.", "Until the time of his passing, Keith was healthy and remained very active in his community, including the political scene. I have to say he gave me lots of advice when I would see him out at events, which is quite tremendous. As you see the generations unfold, he was still there for us.", "His legendary storytelling, his tremendous wit and humour, and his keen business mind were in full evidence right up until the end. He has been referred to as a pillar of the community, a fine example of a person serving his family, his community and his customers.", "With the passing of Keith Brown, the province, and the Peterborough area in particular, lost a great man and a legend. We can only be thankful for that legacy that he left behind, and we thank the family for sharing him with us." ],

They are doing fantastic work, and I’m confident of their ability to transform our community-based mental health system for the better.", "Ils font un travail fantastique, et je suis sûre qu’ils pourront améliorer notre système communautaire de santé mentale.", "It’s also important that families whose son or daughter is having a mental health challenge find that information they need and get that quickly and easily. Our government’s latest effort to support young people with mental health concerns and their families is the launch of a child and youth mental health directory as part of Health Care Options/Ontario.ca. This directory helps young people and their parents find information on local, government-funded mental health services and supports, so they can take the first step they need in getting help.", "I’d also like to address what we’re doing for indigenous communities around the province. A few weeks ago, with my colleague Dr. Eric Hoskins, the Minister of Health and Long-Term Care, I travelled to Attawapiskat. While we were there, we spoke with community leaders and youth about the challenges they face and how we can support their mental and physical well-being. We are working urgently with indigenous communities and leadership on short-, medium- and long-term solutions to address the serious challenges facing indigenous communities and indigenous youth. Mental health workers are in the community right now, addressing immediate needs.", "We’re also investing in a youth regional coordination unit for Mushkegowuk Council, which will provide 24/7 mental health support and evening and night nursing clinical support.", "Mr. Speaker, as individuals, as families, as communities, we all need to keep talking openly about mental health, to change the conversation and eliminate the stigma associated with mental health issues.", "Our government will continue to work together with mental health workers, doctors, educators, indigenous communities, mental health associations, community leaders and so on, to make sure young people enjoy the bright futures they richly deserve." ],

  "text" : [ "It’s a pleasure to rise on behalf of my leader, Patrick Brown, and the PC caucus to recognize the first week of May as Children’s Mental Health Week, but I do so with a bit of a heavy heart. I don’t know how many of the members have read the Children’s Mental Health Ontario 2016 report card that just came out a couple of days ago, but it tells a pretty disturbing story about children’s mental health in the province of Ontario.", "One in four children will experience some form of mental illness before they turn 18—one in four. It’s critical that we identify the signs as soon as possible. I think some of the anti-stigma campaigns that we’ve all been involved in—Bell Let’s Talk, Walk so Kids Can Talk—are very important, but quite frankly, as stigma decreases, access to care is decreasing, and we need to do something about that.", "The report card said that since 2006-07, in the last 10 years, there has been a 54% increase in emergency department visits and a 60% increase in hospitalizations. I’m not sure how many of us have direct experience with individuals who have mental illness—I would suggest that many of us do—but emergency rooms are not where people need treatment and certainly are not where our children need to access treatment.", "The Children’s Mental Health Ontario report also talks about how there needs to be a comprehensive provincial plan for quality improvement within the children’s mental health system—and I would add to that, the mental health system.", "A number of us in this chamber sat on the Select Committee on Mental Health and Addictions, and the number one recommendation that we made was to have an overarching organization, similar to Cancer Care Ontario, that would allow people who are looking for service, who are looking for treatment, the ability to access it regardless of where they live in Ontario. We still have a very disjointed system, and we still have a system that is not serving our children well.", "I want members on all sides to read that report—because it’s not from the Tories, it’s not from the Liberals, it’s not from the NDP. This is an organization that is helping children across Ontario, and they have some very important statistics and issues that they want to bring forward. We need to take this kind of information and transfer it into action.", "There are a number of improvements. The demand for treatment centres has increased by 10% per year as mental health stigma falls. We’re doing a great job on talking about it. Now we need the action side of it.", "A youth’s mental state actually deteriorates while they wait on a waiting list, causing hospital visits to skyrocket. I don’t need to remind people that in the last number of weeks, we’ve been talking a lot about wait-lists; we’ve been talking a lot about access to care, and removing children over the age of five from access to IBI.", "There are so many things that we, as a government, can do to make the system better, and I would suggest to you that two reports we can start with are the Select Committee on Mental Health and Addictions—look at some of those all-party recommendations and start acting on them—and the Children’s Mental Health Ontario report that just came out two days ago, which talked about where we’re failing and where we can do so much better. It would take a long time to go over all of the recommendations that they’re making. The point is, we have the data, we have the information; now let’s act." ],

On Monday evening, along with other MPPs, I had the great pleasure to attend Change the View, at the Royal Ontario Museum, hosted by the Youth Action Committee of Children’s Mental Health Ontario.", "I want to take my hat off to those youth who produced the powerful videos we saw. Through their art, they demonstrated the excruciating pain of mental illness. But they also offered a strong message of hope and belief that things can get better; that things will get better.", "Conversations like this would never have happened when I was a teenager, but thankfully, we have a younger generation who are not afraid to speak the truth openly. Through their work, these youth are providing an invaluable service that breaks down the barriers. They set us loose from the stigma that has been historically attached to mental illness.", "I offer my thanks to the organizers of this inspiring event and congratulate the winners, as well as everyone who submitted a video.", "We should celebrate these achievements in Children’s Mental Health Week, but there is a bigger picture, and there remains very much to be done, as CMHO’s report makes very clear.", "One in four children will experience a mental health issue by the time they are 18. Last year, CMHO spoke about the growing wait-lists of our youth who are trying to access our mental health services. That problem hasn’t gone away, but this year, they put a different focus on their report, and it’s worth repeating today.", "Since 2006-07, there has been a 54% increase in emergency department visits and a 60% increase in hospitalizations for children and youth seeking treatment for mental health issues in Ontario. This is a startling figure for our health care system, which we constantly hear is unable to meet the needs of Ontarians: hospitals— feeling forced to make cuts because of budgets that have failed to keep up with the increasing costs of health care. But it doesn’t have to be this way.", "The report card points out that with the proper investment in community-based mental health treatment, we can redirect 40,000 children away from hospitals. In fact, $65 million put into community-based children’s mental health centres will reduce wait times and ensure that kids receive timely access to the treatment they need At the same time, this investment would save the province up to $145 million in hospital costs. That is a powerful statement, and I sincerely hope that the government and, in particular, the Minister of Health and the Minister of Children and Youth Services, are listening.", "The tragic circumstances in our First Nations communities are immensely disturbing and need to be addressed. Youth suicides and attempted suicides are of epidemic proportions. A recent newspaper article reported that governments are slow to respond when a state of emergency is declared, a situation that seems to be worse on reserves in Ontario.", "Currently, there are 28 active states of emergency in Ontario. One was declared by the tribal council for the Attawapiskat area on June 1, 2010, six years ago. The most recent state of emergency was also declared in Attawapiskat on April 9 this year, after a suicide pact involving 13 youth was thwarted.", "Vulnerable youth and children all across Ontario are in desperate need of help, and those who work for them are struggling to keep up. I constantly marvel at the work done by those who work with our children and youth struggling with mental illness.", "The demand on their services, coupled with the shortage of funding, makes each day a challenge that stretches their resourcefulness to its limits. But somehow their dedication to those kids allows them to pull off miracles.", "We can’t continue to rely on workers going way beyond what should be expected of anyone. It isn’t fair to them, and they are burning out. More importantly, it isn’t fair to our kids, who so badly need the care and treatment that will allow them to build healthy, fulfilling lives. They certainly deserve better." ],

They’re not Liberal dollars; those are taxpayers’ dollars that they’re using to talk about the ORPP, which is the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan.

The reason for that, the expert wrote, was that retirees would have lower expenses than they had when they were working. Retirees typically have paid off their mortgage, their kids have left home; and they’re not driving to work, which means they’re spending less money on gas.

As has been well documented throughout the debate on the ORPP previously, your pay is going to be docked by 1.9% in a time when electricity rates are rising through the roof. People need every last bit of their paycheques, because it’s getting more expensive to live in Ontario, thanks to this Liberal government.", "If you want that honest day’s pay, you’re more likely to get it at a small or medium-sized business than you are anywhere else. This bill is the greatest tool devised by this government to suppress the wages of people who work in small and medium-sized businesses.", "According to the Canada Revenue Agency, there were 11.7 million TFSA holders in Canada in 2014. That’s up from 4.8 million in 2009. We’re already seeing people taking control of their retirement future. All of these numbers, though, are inconvenient to this nanny state government that we have here in Ontario. I understand that.", "Here’s another one: 17% of Canadians with a TFSA max out their contributions. Among the income group making between $20,000 and $25,000 a year, over 124,000 of them are maxing out their contributions every year. That’s 30,000 more than max out their contributions in the $150,000-to-$300,000 income bracket.", "Some 60% of those who max out their TFSA make less than $60,000 a year. If you suppress their wages, they’ll stop saving to fund their own retirement, because they can’t afford it. If you suppress their wages, they’ll be unable to afford things that they need to live now, like hydro in their homes. They control how much they contribute to a TFSA, but the government controls how much they would contribute to the ORPP.", "I’m a Progressive Conservative member of provincial Parliament. That means that I understand that consumers and employees dictate the success of a company, not the boardroom.", "I know what this is going to do to the businesses who are pushing wage growth in this country. I know what this is going to do to employees who are already planning for their own retirement.", "I know that the government’s homework on this bill has been subpar—or, as we heard from the member from Nipissing earlier this morning, they’ve actually ignored their own studies that they’ve done into the effects of the ORPP, which indicate that they are going to be seeing job losses, in the area of 50,000 jobs lost.", "For that reason, as well as many others, I’m opposing time allocation on this bill. That’s why I’d like to move an amendment to the time allocation bill that we’re debating here today, Bill 186.", "I move that the section beginning, “That the Standing Committee on Social Policy be authorized to meet at its regularly scheduled times” be struck out and replaced by:", "That the Standing Committee on Social Policy be authorized to meet at its regularly scheduled times on Monday, May 16, 2016 and Tuesday, May 17, 2016, and on Monday, May 23, 2016 and Tuesday, May 24, 2016, Wednesday, May 25, 2016 and Thursday, May 26, 2016 in Thunder Bay, Sault Ste.

We’re in favour of stable pensions, but rushing this through—which is basically a long-term-planning exercise for people’s retirement—without listening to anyone, although it’s par for the course from this government, is just bad government. It’s completely bad governance.", "I certainly hope that this government has very little to do with actually designing this pension plan, because their governance standards are very, very low. And they’d better book an appointment with the OPP.", "We’ve had examples of this in the past. We were in favour of the Green Energy Act, the principle behind it. But a government like this rammed it through and voted against amendments that we put forward, and now we see the shambles that the Green Energy Act—not in principle, but the way it was implemented—has caused.", "One of the biggest issues with the Green Energy Act—we voted in principle for the Green Energy Act but our amendments were voted down. The biggest problem with the Green Energy Act is that it was allowed to supersede all other acts. Municipalities had no power over it, so basically these wind turbines and solar farms are plunked willy-nilly wherever this government sees fit.", "In the middle of the negotiations, all of a sudden this government sees that, whoa, this is maybe not a good idea for some of their friends, and they changed the game in the middle. This is a kind of game that we can’t play—we shouldn’t play it at all, but certainly not with people’s pensions.", "I always come back, whenever this government talks about pensions, to their ad, the ad with the guy who’s facing the stream and the bridge, and he has to jump for the bridge. Again, it’s a perfect picture for what they’re doing here, because instead of taking the time to actually build the legislative, regulatory bridge so people can actually bridge over to their pension years, this government is again pushing something through, and there is no guarantee that it’s actually going to work. That is an incredible shame. It’s a crime.", "We have the ability to do things right here. That government won a majority. They have the right to push forward their agenda, but there is the expectation that they push forward their agenda responsibly. There’s time allocation after time allocation after time allocation of bills of which there are parts that we can agree to and that we can work together on, but even when you try to work together with this government on issues where we could come to some agreement, it’s all for naught. That is the most egregious part of this whole thing.", "When people elected the Kathleen Wynne government, they were electing a Premier who they believed was progressive, transparent and open, and was going to govern in a different way. Actually, she fulfilled that promise: She’s governing in an even more tight-fisted way than Premier McGuinty ever did. But it wasn’t the difference that people voted for, and this is a prime example.", "She ran on pensions, something that should be done responsibly and that people could actually put their faith into. Again, they’re shutting the door on debate and shutting the door on working with people who actually study this stuff and actually know the pitfalls. They’re shutting the door.

This is a principle that our leader not only supports, but she has introduced legislation in favour of presenting or creating an Ontario-based pension plan. So, absolutely, we support the idea, but very much like the member from Timiskaming–Cochrane pointed out, this government has a very bad track record of rushing through legislation, not addressing serious concerns and creating additional problems. Closure motions and time allocation motions are not the appropriate way to govern. This government should learn.", "Today, we’ve learned that there is an additional OPP investigation of a government scandal, and it all points, again, to this government’s lack of thoughtful, principled and evidence-based due diligence with respect to making a decision. Instead, they make decisions based on their own self-interest.", "What do we find when a government makes decisions based on self-interest? In the case of the Liberal government, self-interest leads to police investigations. This is not the right way to govern. This is not an appropriate way to deal with legislation. This is not an appropriate way to deal with the honour and dignity of being the governing party of a province.", "Now, I would expect any governing party to understand that the majority that you have is something you wield with great care and diligence, and with great thoughtfulness when it comes to something as important as the ORPP.", "The government is going to claim there is a delay tactic here. First, let’s understand the fact that this implementation of the ORPP is not going to be within a couple of months; it’s not going to be within a year; it’s going to be many years in the future. So the process in and of itself, the way the government designed it, is going to take a long time. Any suggestion that additional hours of debate are going to delay a law which is already set to begin many years in the future is a very weak argument. It’s an argument that does not hold up to a logical scrutiny. So, first, that criticism is a bad criticism. It’s inherently flawed.", "When it comes to the benefit of debate, we know that this government has rushed through legislation. Very recently, I was the Chair of a committee where we were dealing with a government bill, and the government had introduced numerous amendments to address mistakes that they found in their own bill. I’m glad the government took the time to address those mistakes, but that’s the reason why you don’t rush through legislation. You can find mistakes before you rush it through to the next stage. Let’s take the time to make sure things are done in a thoughtful manner. And much like the Chair of committee had mentioned in the past, when other governments brought forward time allocation, time allocation is the ceasing or the stopping of democracy. It arrests democracy. It prevents discussion from happening in this chamber.", "It’s very curious that this same member is now saying, “No, time allocation is the way to go. It’s the appropriate way for us to deal with legislation. It’s the right way to govern,” but at another time it was considered very anti-democratic by the very same member. That’s very curious, Mr. Speaker. It causes one to wonder, maybe laws or rules are different when you’re in power and when you’re not in power. That is not a very principled way to conduct oneself. If that’s the belief of the member, I would say that is also not a very strong argument to make.", "I am proud to share my time with my colleague to very proudly indicate our intention to vote against time allocation on this bill." ],

Bill 119 follows up on a commitment that I made to the people of Ontario last June to protect the personal health information of patients while also increasing transparency and maintaining quality in Ontario’s health care system.", "The proposed legislation, if passed, will create stronger and more comprehensive protection of health information privacy, it will renew our provincial e-health privacy framework, it will provide for greater accountability and transparency in the health care system when it comes to privacy breaches and, finally, it will improve patient care and safety.", "Our government made a commitment to the people of Ontario through our Patients First: Action Plan for Health Care. We made a commitment to put people and patients first, and this bill is one more way we are keeping that commitment.", "Taken together, these legislative amendments would reinforce Ontario’s position as a leader in the protection of health information privacy. The old days of being able to lock away health records in a filing cabinet have long since passed. Increasingly, the health care system has been moving to electronic records, and for good reason. Electronic health records help us to modernize our health care system and lead to better care.", "Our current privacy laws have done a great job of protecting patient privacy, but as we enable the sharing of electronic health records between health providers in a patient’s circle of care, we need new rules in place to safeguard patient privacy. Quite simply, we need to update our health information privacy rules for the 21st century. This is what these proposed amendments will do. If passed, this bill would make it mandatory for health information custodians to report privacy breaches to the Information and Privacy Commissioner as well as to relevant regulatory colleges under certain circumstances.", "Ontarians want to know that their personal health records are private and safe, and it is my expectation that all health information custodians who are in possession of personal health information are doing everything they possibly can to ensure that that privacy is protected. By mandating that privacy breaches be reported to the Information and Privacy Commissioner and to regulatory colleges, the individual health information custodian, and indeed the entire health care system, will be able to benefit from the IPC’s review and recommendations for avoiding future breaches and identifying suspected privacy offences.", "We also need to ensure that we’re prepared to address the issue, should a breach of privacy offence occur. Currently, there is a six-month limitation period from when an offence is alleged to have taken place to when a prosecution must commence, which may prevent people from being charged for all the privacy offences they may have committed. That’s simply not right. The bill before us today proposes an amendment that, if passed, will completely remove that six-month limitation period.", "The Personal Health Information Protection Act, or PHIPA, would also be aligned with other provincial offence statutes that require the Attorney General to consent to the commencement of a PHIPA prosecution, rather than requiring the Attorney General to actually start the prosecution herself.", "Another way we propose to deter privacy offences is by strengthening the punishment for offenders. If passed, there’s an amendment that would double the maximum fines for PHIPA convictions from $50,000 to $100,000 for individuals and from $250,000 to $500,000 for organizations.", "Finally, we propose to reintroduce privacy protections for electronic health records, as were first proposed in 2013 as part of Bill 78. These proposed protections were endorsed by the Information and Privacy Commissioner, and we agree that they would help us further strengthen the protections that are already in place for the sake of all Ontarians.", "But privacy is just one side of the health information coin. The other side of that coin is how we go about ensuring transparency in the health care system itself. That means ensuring that key information should be appropriately shared with the people who matter most: the patients. For this reason, our government is proposing to replace the Quality of Care Information Protection Act, 2004, with a new act of the same name.", "The act as it exists right now was put in place to provide health care workers an opportunity to share information candidly regarding a critical incident and to promote continuous quality improvement. But we have come to understand that health care providers are often unsure as to what must be disclosed to patients and their loved ones following a critical incident review. There is also a lack of understanding as to when and how providers should apply QCIPA—the legislation—in those particular circumstances.", "It was for these reasons that I convened a QCIPA review committee and committed to implementing all of their recommendations. I recognized that all of the committee’s recommendations were intended to help ensure consistent, high-quality, safe and patient-centred care.", "Our government understands that it’s important that health care providers are able to review information following a critical incident for quality improvement purposes. But this should be done in a manner that respects the rights of patients and the rights of families to know about critical incidents in hospitals and other health care settings.", "The new QCIPA legislation, if passed, would maintain the existing quality information improvement framework, but, at the same time, would provide greater clarity and help encourage better communication with, and engagement of, patients during the investigation of a critical incident itself.", "If passed, the amended legislation would:", "—clarify the purpose of the legislation, of QCIPA, and reaffirm the right of patients to access information about their health care;", "—clarify that certain information and facts about critical incidents cannot be shielded from affected patients and their authorized representatives;", "—allow the Minister of Health and Long-Term Care to make additional regulations that would require health care organizations to adopt a uniform approach when using QCIPA to review critical incidents;", "—clarify that QCIPA does not interfere with health care facilities’ legal obligations to disclose information required by law, or to interview patients involved in a critical incident as part of an investigation; and finally,", "—require that the Minister of Health and Long-Term Care review this act every five years.", "If passed, Bill 119 will provide, on one hand, more security and protection for the personal health information of Ontarians and, on the other, ensure the necessary transparency and access to information that they deserve, and that we have the obligation to provide, to make the right decisions about their health care.", "Mr. Speaker, I call on all members to support our proposed amendments." ],

I want to start by thanking the minister for the opportunity to speak to this very important piece of legislation for the people of Ontario.", "Among the points I am going to speak to today is the importance of protecting patient privacy. A person’s personal health history is among the most personal information about them. It is of the utmost importance that we do everything we can to make sure that it is protected.", "As Minister Hoskins just outlined, one of the goals of the bill before us is to safeguard and protect the health information of Ontario patients. That is a direct reflection of the commitment our government has made to the people of Ontario to put patients first.", "We know that Ontarians expect their personal health information to remain private, and we believe that the privacy of personal health information is paramount to a high-quality health care system in which people are held accountable. There is a clear understanding between a patient and a doctor that the information they share is strictly confidential, and trust that the information will only be shared in accordance with the law and when it is in the best interests of the care of the patient.", "However, in recent years, we have seen instances where this has just simply not been the case. We have seen it happen that personal health information has been illegally breached for financial gain or, in some cases, just to satisfy someone’s personal curiosity. Regardless of the reason for the breach, it is unacceptable. Not only is it an invasion of privacy, but it’s scary what can be done with stolen medical information. It also jeopardizes the delicate balance of trust between a patient and their health care provider.", "Health care providers see patients when they are at their most vulnerable. Health care providers see patients when they’re in need of care for an injury, illness or disease, and health care providers see patients when they need a helping hand. I know that when I’m seeing my doctor, I need to be able to trust her, as well as her staff, in order to feel comfortable. All Ontario patients need to know that the information they share with their health care provider is going to be kept confidential and secure and will not be used inappropriately. I’m sure all of us here would be terribly upset to find out that our health care records, or those of our loved ones, became lost or stolen.", "The government is taking strong action to put an end to this possibility. Bill 119, as proposed, is intended to help protect the personal health information of patients. The Health Information Protection Act would amend the Personal Health Information Protection Act, 2004, and several other pieces of related legislation to strengthen and clarify the privacy rules that protect the personal health information of individuals. This includes amendments to the Regulated Health Professions Act, 1991; the Drug Interchangeability and Dispensing Fee Act; and the Narcotics Safety and Awareness Act, 2010.", "The amendments to these acts support the appropriate collection, use and disclosure of personal health information. They would enable the sharing of that information by means of the electronic health record, a province-wide system that allows certain information and health records to be shared among health information custodians. This would allow medical records to be shared between health care providers quickly and timely, but within a strictly controlled and secure system. An e-health record would definitely bring our health care system into the 21st century and make Ontario a leader in health technology and services.", "If passed, these amendments would make it mandatory to report certain privacy breaches to the Information and Privacy Commissioner and to the relevant regulatory college of the person responsible for the breach. It would also strengthen the process to prosecute offences under PHIPA by removing the requirement that prosecutions must be commenced within six months of when the alleged offence occurred. This allows more time for a proper investigation and closes a loophole that would have allowed those who commit a security breach to go unpunished.", "I spoke moments ago about the vulnerability of patients when their personal health information is breached. When that happens, it damages the trust that exists between the patient and their health care providers, and that is when the patient expects action to be taken. Failure to do so would only damage that relationship of trust and their faith in the health care system even further. We have a responsibility to take action to better protect patient privacy. These proposed amendments effectively give the government the tools to do just that.", "In my riding of Halton, the new state-of-the-art Oakville Trafalgar Memorial Hospital opened its doors just a few months ago. This amazing facility is able to provide care to as many as 180,000 people in Oakville and surrounding areas. That’s a lot of people, Mr. Speaker. And the changes the government is making to Bill 119 will allow me to assure them that their private information will, in fact, remain private.", "I’d like to point out that the Information and Privacy Commissioner was an essential partner in the development of these amendments. The commissioner fully supports the legislative changes to strengthen privacy protections and improve Ontario’s ability to pursue prosecution. In fact, the commissioner has stated that he is strongly in favour of the mandatory reporting of certain privacy breaches. He was also one of the key stakeholders that Minister Hoskins was referring to who were instrumental in helping us refine the proposed bill through the standing committee process. We thank him and his office for their valuable contributions and their continued support.", "We know many hospitals and other health care providers have voluntarily and proactively contacted the commissioner’s office when they discovered that a privacy breach has taken place in their organization. It speaks to how seriously hospitals and health care providers treat breaches. It also speaks to how important that relationship of trust is between a patient and their health care provider, and their commitment to putting patients first. Our government thanks them for their dedication to their patients and their privacy.", "But reporting is just the first step in protecting the private and personal health information of patients in Ontario. We need prevention measures. We need to actively discourage people from even considering violating the privacy of someone’s personal health information. That is why Bill 119 proposes to create stronger deterrents against the unauthorized protection, use or disclosure of personal health information.", "To do this, the amendments would double the maximum fines for offences under the Personal Health Information Protection Act. Penalties would increase from $50,000 to $100,000 for individuals and from $250,000 to $500,000 for an organization. By increasing the maximum fines, we are sending a clear message that it is unacceptable to unlawfully access anyone’s personal health information.", "We are also ensuring that those who are convicted of a privacy offence face significant consequences from the court for their actions.", "One of the key pieces of Bill 119 that I want to elaborate on today is that it proposes to reintroduce and update the electronic health record privacy framework, initially introduced in the Electronic Personal Health Information Protection Act, 2013, or EPHIPA. As many of us may recall, EPHIPA had reached second reading but had not passed when the Legislature was dissolved on May 2, 2014. This is our chance today, and we have an opportunity to finish what we have started.", "Not only does the proposed legislation incorporate the work begun on EPHIPA, but it also builds on its privacy protections to create a stronger and more comprehensive health information privacy framework. We know that most Ontarians who receive health services have some form of electronic medical record. In fact, over 12,000 health care providers either have implemented or are in the process of implementing electronic medical record systems for patient management. This includes 80% of Ontario’s family physicians, who represent over 10 million people. It encompasses many different types of medical records, including diagnostic types of images, immunization records, lab reports and hospital discharge reports. This will modernize health care and ensure that records are passed on to the appropriate people quickly and with security. It will help ensure that health care providers are fully informed so they can provide and give patients the best care possible.", "What Bill 119 proposes to do is build a strong foundation for enabling records to be shared among health care providers in a safe and secure fashion. It is something that the Information and Privacy Commissioner has endorsed, and it will help us to protect patients’ personal health information and preserve the relationship of trust. This is vital to good health care. Patients need to know that when their records are being shared, they are being done so in a way that does not place their personal privacy at risk. As Minister Hoskins mentioned earlier, the ability to share electronic health records plays a big role in helping to modernize our health care system, leading to better care for patients. It enables us to share information faster and help patients get the answers they need sooner, and leads to a better health care coordination and integration.", "That is why this bill also proposes to allow information about a patient’s narcotics and monitored-drug prescriptions to be available to their health care practitioner. This would help to ensure that health care providers have all the information they need about a patient so that they are fully informed as they work to provide the best care possible. It would improve patient safety by reducing negative drug interactions with monitored drugs and support more informed health care decisions. In addition, it could also reduce instances of patients obtaining multiple prescriptions for monitored drugs or multiple pharmacies filling the same prescription. I think that most Ontarians would agree that those are worthy goals.", "Our government is committed to taking action to protect the personal health information of Ontarians and to ensure that we have a safe and secure way of sharing that information to offer the best care possible to all patients. It is an important part of our commitment to transform our health care system into one that puts the needs of patients at its centre. People in Ontario deserve to know that they are protected by a health care system that is transparent and keeps their personal health information private.", "While the protection of health information is important, the aspect of privacy around personal health information is but one side of the coin when it comes to the proposed bill before us. The other side of the coin is how it speaks to the proposed health information act and how it would help us to make great strides in improving transparency and patient safety in Ontario’s health care system. The proposed legislation before us would enable us to do just that, while ensuring that we maintain the high quality of health care Ontarians have come to expect.", "In 2004, this Legislature passed the current Quality of Care Information Protection Act to encourage health care workers to share information candidly regarding a critical incident. The idea is to promote continuous quality improvement by encouraging health care workers to share their experiences with other providers and work together to improve patient care.", "The reason for the act is to encourage health care providers to be as forthcoming as possible when a critical incident occurs. It does this by ensuring that opinions, speculation and information specifically prepared for discussions about quality improvement, which may include information from investigating critical incidents, are protected from disclosure in legal proceedings. They would also be protected from most other disclosures—subject to appropriate exceptions—to ensure transparency to patients.", "Speaker, the proposed bill before us today seeks to replace the existing act with a new act of the same name. After all, it can sometimes be unclear to health care providers what they must disclose to the patient following a critical incident review, and when and how they should be applying QCIPA in these instances.", "Again, this speaks to this very important commitment that our government has made to the people of Ontario: our commitment to put patients first. We cannot meet that commitment if health care providers are unclear about what information they are required to share with patients.", "There is confusion among some health care providers about how to use QCIPA effectively. But there is also a lack of clarity about the greater need to share experiences and lessons learned about quality improvement opportunities across organizations. That is why it’s so important that we put in place this proposed new act. Not only will it provide greater clarity for health care providers, but it will also improve the sharing of information between those providers, so that we can, in turn, improve the quality of our health care system, because that is the ultimate goal: to provide better care to Ontario patients. So we need to get this right; in fact, we must get this right.", "If passed, the Health Information Protection Act will replace the existing QCIPA with a new act of the same name, which would clarify the purpose and appropriate application of this legislation. It would maintain the existing quality improvement framework, while providing greater clarity to health care providers. It would help to encourage better communication with, and engagement of, patients during the investigation of a critical incident. Just think about how important this is.", "It would also reaffirm the right of patients to access information about their own health care. It would make it clear that QCIPA cannot be misused to shield information from patients and their authorized representatives, by linking the act to proposed amendments to the Public Hospitals Act’s regulation 965. These proposed amendments, if approved, would spell out for everyone what information and facts about critical incidents in hospitals must be transparent and shared with affected patients and their authorized representatives.", "Our government believes that the default in our health care system with respect to critical incidents should be to disclose the essential information about the incident to the affected patient and their family. That includes the facts of what occurred, whether the causes were known and what steps are being taken to prevent such an incident from ever happening again.", "To our proposed amendments: This will help to make it clearer that QCIPA can never be a barrier to such disclosures. What the proposed new QCIPA legislation will do is clarify the purpose of QCIPA and reaffirm the right of patients to access information about their health care.", "Patients have a right to know about what happened, and this bill will clarify exactly what information and facts about critical incidents must be available to be shared with affected patients and their families. It will allow the Minister of Health and Long-Term Care to make regulations that will keep the approach to using QCIPA consistent across the provinces.", "These regulations would require health care facilities to adopt a uniform approach when using QCIPA to review critical incidents. Patients need to know that when a critical incident is under review, it is being done to the same high standards, regardless of where they live or where the facility is located.", "The proposed act will also facilitate the investigation of critical incidents that involve multiple health care facilities. It will clarify that QCIPA does not prevent health care facilities from properly disclosing information as required by law or from interviewing patients involved in a critical incident as part of an investigation.", "I want to point out that the proposed amendments are only part of the picture of how our government is taking steps to implement the recommendations of the QCIPA review committee. We are also proposing to amend the Public Hospitals Act, regulation 965, and we are working with the Ontario Hospital Association and Health Quality Ontario to provide guidance and training to health care facilities on reviewing critical incidents, including those under QCIPA.", "Our government is also working with Health Quality Ontario to create a way for public hospitals and health care facilities to share their experiences with critical incidents and improve learning to prevent future incidents.", "We are creating an additional way for patients to file complaints. This will be available through the office of Ontario’s first-ever Patient Ombudsman. Patients will be able to submit complaints about the health care received to the Patient Ombudsman.", "The proposed QCIPA amendments before us are just one part of our government’s commitment to address the recommendations, but they represent a significant improvement for patients in Ontario.", "Ontarians need to be able to trust their health care system. They need to know that it is working for them. That is why this proposed legislation is so important. It is a message to the people of Ontario that when you have questions related to the quality of the health care you are receiving, you can get answers. It is a message to patients and their families that they will be kept informed and have their voices heard when an investigation is required as a result of a critical incident. That’s what patients want. It is what they expect; it’s what they deserve.", "Today, I ask this House to pass this proposed legislation to help our government improve transparency and strengthen accountability in our health care system." ],

  "text" : [ "I’ll be splitting my time with the member from Oxford and the member from Lanark–Frontenac–Lennox and Addington. I got that one right; that’s great.", "I’m proud to stand up and give a little bit of discussion regarding Bill 119 during third reading today. Hopefully, my remarks will be listened to by the government. The member from Oxford and the member from Lanark will follow with some great remarks.", "What astounded me throughout this process of Bill 119 was that we brought forth amendments and had quite a bit of debate in this Legislature and at committee, raising red flags to fix gaps and/or problems that have arisen. We heard from many groups and stakeholders, who gave their insight into how they thought this bill could be improved. As members of the opposition, we brought forth those amendments in committee to be voted upon. In fact, there were 33 amendments brought forward during committee, which is a good number considering the average bill that I am a part of in discussing at committee. Fifteen of those passed.", "What’s discouraging is that the 15 that were passed were put forward by the government. Not a single opposition amendment was passed at all during the committee process. That’s quite discouraging, considering we’re trying to deal with the bill and ensure that the gaps are fixed so that we don’t have to come back and fix the bill again, like we’re having to do right now with Bill 178, the smoking legislation out there. The government missed a section of Bill 45 because they rushed through legislation. They didn’t seek the proper input and forgot a section that needed to be dealt with. It was going to turn into a problem throughout the province once Bill 45 was enacted, so they had to come forward with Bill 178.", "It’s concerning that this is typical of how this government is operating. They listen to themselves and that’s about it. They don’t listen to the opposition parties—their amendments brought forward. They’re not even listening to stakeholders who are at committee to make changes so we don’t have to return to this House and either fix this bill or replace it because of a court challenge or because they’re finding that what they’ve created is in itself causing many problems.", "We do so to ensure that the people of this province have trust in what this government, this body, is producing as legislation in the province. I heard that quite a bit in the discussions from the government side over trust in the system, trust with the doctors. It’s concerning that today they speak about building trust with the health care professionals, but two weeks ago, the health minister stood in front of many cameras and tried to erode that trust between patients and doctors by negotiating through the media over their impasse with regard to billings, and trying to either split the profession or put the profession in a poor light so that patients would, in fact, be less trustful of their doctor. That’s unacceptable behaviour, the fact that today they talk about trust and two weeks ago they didn’t talk about trust.", "In fact, we even could go even further down the road. I think we’re all in agreement with regard to the doctor who lost his licence due to his sexual abuse, sexual touching of patients and the fact that he’s going to get his licence back in six months, even though it was flagged by the government over a year ago that the College of Physicians and Surgeons wanted some legislative authority in order to deal with that situation so that doctor would never get his licence back. In 14 months—I understand they had a task force struck. I’m not sure what the mandate is, but it’s interesting that the government can act quickly when it feels like it and it’s a priority to them, but when it’s not, it’s not a priority for them. It’s the same issue with trust. Today they talk about the trust they have with patients with this bill; however, they challenged the trust of doctors two weeks ago.", "I don’t think that is the proper way to go forward as a government. I don’t think it’s the proper way to create legislation. The fact that not a single opposition amendment was given due consideration at the committee level speaks volumes that this government thinks that it got the legislation right. It would probably be one of the first times.", "We already heard about the Green Energy Act and the problems that that has caused with regard to rural Ontario. We’ve got wind turbines being set up throughout southwestern Ontario where, Mr. Speaker, you and I are from, and Lambton–Kent–Middlesex is from, and Sarnia–Lambton and Oxford. Municipalities are saying no to these wind turbines, but because of the act the government put forth without having true consultation or listening to the amendments—because the third party mentioned in their speech that they put forth amendments to the Green Energy Act, to make changes to ensure that what’s happening today wasn’t going to happen. I don’t know why they still voted for the Green Energy Act after the government said no to all of their amendments, but that’s something we can’t fix right now—possibly until a new government is in place to actually deal and bring back support to rural Ontario and incorporate them as part of Ontario in making decisions on legislation.", "While at committee, I found it was quite a frustrating process to hear the different groups come forward, first of all saying that they weren’t consulted in the first place in the drafting of this legislation, which I found very interesting, and then, after the drafting of the legislation, coming to committee, sharing their concerns, their points, and the government completely ignoring the fact that this is going to affect them in a negative light.", "This isn’t going to make the health care system operate any better than it is today. I also believe that this legislation, although they speak big on accountability and transparency, is not going to add the accountability that patients in our health care system are asking for today. Unfortunately, they had the opportunity to make the changes, make the amendments, and they didn’t listen to what the opposition parties were saying, let alone the stakeholders.", "I could go through a little bit of the amendments that we put forward, just to put on the table here in the Legislature; they are in Hansard and committee.", "Our first amendment that we brought forward dealt with HIPA. In the event of a breach, our amendment would have given a prescribed organization the responsibility to notify the individual if it happened at their level. The OMA brought that concern forward. They wanted to ensure that doctors and health care providers aren’t going to be the ones to have to notify patients of breaches that they didn’t have involvement in. If a breach happened elsewhere in the system, they wanted to ensure that it wasn’t the doctors who had to call up the patients and say, “Hey, look, there was a breach.” Even though they had nothing to do with it, they’re going to have to take the fall for it.", "I think that’s a valid point that the OMA brought forward. The comment from the government side is that the amendment wasn’t necessary, in their point of view, and, “Let’s move on,” and “We’re okay having the doctor make the phone call for someone else’s mistake down the road.” Our doctors, I think, are hard workers in this province. We want them to be seeing patients and dealing with health care services in this province. We don’t want them to become the secretaries for somebody down the road who has made a mistake with a breach of information. I don’t think they have the time of day to do that. If they made the mistake, if they had the breach, definitely, they need to make the call and tell the patient, but if it’s someone else in the system making that, I don’t believe the medical profession needs to do that.", "Just look at how privacy breaches are increasing: In 2014, there were 439 cases that were reported to the privacy commissioner. That doesn’t mean that’s all there were; those were the ones that got reported. As information technology continues, the ability to breach information is going to increase, and I imagine there will be more of an increase in the amount of breaches going forward.", "Our next amendment aimed at ensuring that the language in the bill is consistent with the reporting provisions in the Health Professions Procedural Code of the Registered Health Professions Act and the Public Hospitals Act. The College of Physicians and Surgeons brought this up, saying that we need the same language in this bill to match the other laws that are in place. It actually makes the workings of this legislation a little bit easier for the health care system, especially our colleges, as long as the wording is the same.", "However, the government, again, believes that they’re dealing with the situation without amending it and that it would interfere with the reporting of professional misconduct. If we have the College of Physicians and Surgeons concerned about this issue—they’re the ones that deal with professional misconduct, and deal with it day in and day out. The Ministry of Health doesn’t, and they’ll say so, day in and day out, that it’s a hands-off organization, which it should be, but they should also at the same time be listening to the concerns brought forward by that body who is dealing with it day in and day out.", "We had another amendment to ensure that a multidisciplinary advisory committee can raise issues from various aspects of the health care sector to ensure that, on changes of direction that the ministry may be headed in, it is hearing all sides of the story. It doesn’t make sense to keep coming back and fixing things. If the minister creates this advisory committee but only includes certain groups at the committee, they could be making regulations and changes to this law when it’s in place and having to come back because they missed a health care professional body that this negatively affects.", "The government’s comment was that it was vague and undefined—what our amendment was about. Our amendment spelled out “multidisciplinary,” but it was too vague. So we came back with another amendment, because we know they don’t listen to our amendments at all. We said, as a minimum, to have the College of Physicians and Surgeons, the College of Nurses, the OMA and members from the public, and then you could add whoever you want afterwards. At least that gave you a basis to cover. Then they said it was too specific and we’d left out groups. The government is obviously—their whole point at committee is finding the ways to argue against our amendments and not include them, instead of trying to make a stronger bill. Unfortunately, that’s not the way we need to go.", "One amendment we had put forward which we had concern with—the OMA flagged it for us, as well—was the fact that with the passage of this bill, the Ministry of Health bureaucrats, or whoever the Minister of Health decides, will have access to our personal health information. To me that’s a concern. I know they said it will be modified in a way so that you can’t connect the dots, but with computers today, I’m sure you could find a way to fix that.", "The privacy commissioner himself said he’s okay and he’s going to be part of the system, but he could not guarantee 100% that a breach would not occur. Our question is, why create that chance? We only have to look at what occurred—the access to health information is out there—with the late Rob Ford, who obviously had his personal medical information broken into.", "I’m not saying that anybody in the bureaucracy or the government here today is going to utilize that personal health information from any Ontarian that they can now get access to in a bad light, but we can’t guarantee that that’s never going to happen. I think that if the people of this province realized that government in general—especially this government—has access to your personal health information, that’s going to be a concern.", "The OMA’s point, which they clarified, is that that might deter someone from discussing their issue fully with the doctor. It should be in confidence, to ensure that their information is not shared. We only have to look at the stigma that’s out there for mental illness today. We’re trying to fight to end that stigma. We do not want any barriers put in place to people accessing the health and treatment that they need. There’s a trust between a doctor and a patient that this government is trying to erode, but there is no trust between government and patients with regard to medical health information.", "It’s a concern. There have to be other ways. There’s a lot of bureaucrats in the Ministry of Health; I’m sure they could probably come up with a different way to collect the information they need other than actually accessing the personal health information of somebody, and having that opened up in the bureaucracy of the Ministry of Health and/or whoever the minister appoints. We were quite concerned about that.", "When the government commented on that amendment, the government messed up their talking points and read us the wrong response. We know that they sit there and find ways to argue why we—the member from Lanark–Frontenac–Lennox and Addington was the one who called them out on it. They immediately backtracked and found the right page to read about why they won’t support that amendment. It’s very, very concerning.", "You’ll hear from this government that the privacy commissioner is on board, but as I said earlier, he cannot guarantee 100% that there will be no breaches or misuse of the information once the government has their hands on it.", "Another amendment we had was to add some oversight and to give the privacy commissioner some leeway in order to ensure that when they review any matter before them and decide to act on a possible contravention, a review can take place and those who have been involved are notified of what occurred during the decision related to the activities. It could undermine the trust in confidentiality.", "They just finished saying that patients are now going to have access to find out what’s going on and what’s wrong, but in actuality, they’re still going to be blocked. We had a member of the public come in who wanted access to medical information as to why their loved one died. They’re in the courts fighting it. This was an opportunity in this bill to allow them some more access than what they’re getting today. The government says that they’ve made that access, but in fact, they voted down the amendment that would have given that access to those family members.", "As I wrap up my comments and let my caucus mate speak: So many stakeholders came in to speak after the fact. Again, we have another bill brought forward from this government who didn’t pre-consult. We had at the table stakeholders who brought us well-thought-out amendments. The government rejected every single amendment from those stakeholders brought forth by the opposition members.", "It’s frustrating to go to committee when dealing with these members. We believe the amendments that we put forward would have strengthened the bill. We imagine that down the road either a court challenge will overturn this bill and/or we’ll be back to fix problems and gaps that this process created due to the lack of co-operation from this Liberal government." ],

When people go to their health care system for help, they should be confident that their information will be protected. Someone who is struggling with a major disease shouldn’t have an additional stress of worrying that their personal and private information could be released. People who need help shouldn’t avoid the health care system because they’re worried someone will find out there was a problem. But in Ontario, under this government’s watch, it is happening.", "This bill actually creates new opportunities for that to occur, Mr. Speaker. This bill will give the Minister of Health and the Ministry of Health access to our personal health information. The Information and Privacy Commissioner has already said that the safeguards they are proposing for this information may fail. Our caucus put forward a number of amendments in committee to make this bill better and ensure that personal health information was protected. We heard about a number of those amendments from my colleague the previous speaker. But the government voted down every single one. They also voted down every amendment put forward by the New Democratic Party. The people of Ontario want us to work together, but this government is more interested in politics than our ideas to make the health care system better.", "Privacy of medical information is a real issue in Ontario. In 2014, there were 439 cases of health information privacy breaches reported to the Information and Privacy Commissioner. And those are just the cases we know about, because it isn’t mandatory to report when there have been privacy breaches. This bill would amend the Personal Health Information Protection Act to require mandatory reporting. It is a change that has been needed for years. Ontario is one of the last provinces to update the legislation to require mandatory reporting of the breaches.", "In fact, the Information and Privacy Commissioner has been ringing alarm bells for years. Two years ago, he issued an order in response to two breaches of patient privacy involving allegations that hospital employees disclosed the personal health information of mothers for purposes of selling registered education savings plans. According to the articles, contact details for about 8,300 patients had been given to private companies to sell RESPs. In that order the Information and Privacy Commissioner said, “Personal health information is considered to be among the most sensitive types of personal information, deserving of the highest protection. Yet, in Ontario, we have seen a growing number of cases of agents inappropriately accessing the personal health information of individuals.” That was over two years ago. How many more people have had their information released since then?", "And that wasn’t the first warning sign. In 2011, Cancer Care Ontario had a number of packages containing personal test results go missing. In one office alone, the missing package contained personal information of almost 2,400 individuals. The doctor reported in April that they hadn’t received the packages, but it wasn’t until June that the privacy commissioner was informed.", "In 2008, health records were found on the street outside a medical centre which contained a medical laboratory. The pages contained names of patients and doctors, health cards and the results of laboratory tests. The Information and Privacy Commissioner was notified not by the laboratory who had the breach, but by a member of the media. It turned out that the records had been put in recycling instead of shredding and had then fallen out of the recycling truck when it was leaving the parking lot.", "Clearly, there’s a problem, and the government has been ignoring it for years. Over that time, thousands of Ontarians have had their personal medical information accessed inappropriately. In fact, when the government ignored all of the warnings last year, the Information and Privacy Commissioner launched his own campaign, called Is It Worth It?, aimed at educating health care professionals on the impact of privacy breaches.", "In the release, he said, “Whether out of curiosity, personal gain or simple concern about the health of friends and family, snooping through medical records can have devastating consequences for patients, health professionals and the health system as a whole.”", "Mandatory reporting should have been put in place years ago. It took thousands of breaches, warnings from two Information and Privacy Commissioners and a Toronto Star series to get the government to take action, a fact that was made clear in the newspaper article which said, “Following the series of Star investigations into PHIPA, Health Minister Dr. Eric Hoskins vowed sweeping changes to the act in June.”", "The government has consistently mismanaged the health care system, from people’s personal health information to the services they depend on. They need to act to put patients first when it comes to protecting their information and when it comes to providing quality care. Putting patients first means providing the services that are needed and ending the mismanagement that is draining dollars away from patient care.", "We need a system that is efficient, effective and focused on providing the best health care services when people need them. Part of having an efficient system is using updated technology. This bill not only updates the rules regarding privacy breaches for electronic records, it also contains changes to the electronic health record privacy framework.", "As we all know, eHealth is not an area that has been managed well by this government. In 2009, the Auditor General released a report that said $1 billion had been spent on eHealth and very little had been accomplished. It was said in earlier debates on this bill that the total is now up to $2 billion—$2 billion—and what do we have to show for it?", "In his report, the Auditor General found that millions had been paid out to consultants in questionable circumstances. One million dollars was paid to an external recruiting firm for help in filling 15 management positions. It was a sole-source contract given out by the CEO. Only five of the positions were filled when the contract was terminated, but the company still got paid the full $1 million. A consultant hired by the ministry was involved in giving $1.4 million in contracts to his own company. The ministry subdivided contracts to keep them below the level where they would have had to put them out to public tender.", "People may not remember this, but when eHealth was created in 2008, the agency’s mandate was to have electronic health records in place for Ontarians by 2015. Well, Speaker, it is now 2016, and eHealth progress reports make it clear that there are still many Ontarians who don’t have electronic health records.", "According to the eHealth Ontario website, “Eventually, EHRs will include data from hospital information systems, community care clinics and other providers as well”—eventually.", "We still don’t have the efficient system we were promised. I heard from one person recently who went to a hospital for a test. On her first visit, she provided her health card and all her information. They issued her a white hospital card. On the day of the test, she expected to check in and go quickly, since they already had all her information. Instead, it took 40 minutes because she was required to provide all the information again to get a blue hospital card in addition to the white hospital card and her health card. It took a health card, two cards from the same hospital and a hospital bracelet to track one patient who was in the hospital for three hours. That’s the reality in Ontario today, more than $1 billion later. People may not be able to comprehend $1 billion, but they understand the impact. They see the cuts to the services and health care. They know how long they and loved ones are waiting.", "I hear often from my constituents that the system just isn’t working. Necessary surgeries are being postponed because there isn’t enough funding to pay for them. Delays are having a real impact on people like the senior in my riding whose cataract surgery was delayed until four months after her driving test—obviously, she didn’t have her licence any more, Mr. Speaker—or the people in constant pain who are given the news just before Christmas that they would have to wait until April, because of the new fiscal year, before they could get their surgery. I’ve heard from qualified surgeons who are frustrated because state-of-the-art operating suites are sitting empty but they aren’t allowed to perform more surgeries.", "We need to do better to make the health care system work for the people of Ontario and to make sure that their information is protected. This government has had an opportunity to do that by supporting our amendments, and it is now an opportunity missed, to the detriment of the people of Ontario." ],

I don’t know how often he gets the pronunciation of that name incurrect, as well.", "But, anyway, it is nice to see that there was some sort of backhanded apology to the leader of the third party. I’m sure that she appreciates that. But I’ll have to go back and listen. I know that I saw the video. David Reevely, the reporter from the Ottawa Citizen, has a nice video clip on his Twitter feed—" ],

  "text" : [ "Thank you, Speaker. Your guidance is always appreciated and well-known and recognized in the House.", "Speaker, back to Bill 119: I listened to the Minister of Health and Long-Term Care in his 10-minute address. There is much of it that I agree with. I think that the government has made tremendous strides in one part of the bill, and that is on the privacy side of the bill. We know that there has been a host of breaches of privacy, especially with medical records, and it does need to be fixed up—of course, the big case with Rob Ford. But there have been many, many cases of a breach of private medical information. I think that they’ve done a pretty good job on that section of the bill.", "However, they—both the minister and the parliamentary assistant—like to use the term “the flip side of that coin.” They used the term “transparency.” I would say that it is better to use “determination of fact.” That is where they have missed out on this bill substantially. I know the parliamentary assistant, the member from Halton, was at the committee. She was the talking head for the Liberal Party on that committee and had her prep notes. But I know that she heard, significantly, from delegations to that committee about where the bill fails and where it will have negative consequences and, indeed, harmful ones, and that is on these critical incident review committees and the QCIPA, where patients, and the counsel for patients, will have difficulty getting information about a critical incident. It may be impossible to get.", "That’s the message we heard at the committee hearing—if the member from Halton remembers—that this will be a significant disadvantage for any individual who may unfortunately have a critical incident, an injury, during a medical procedure. Their ability to find out what actually happened has been prejudiced by Bill 119. Bill 119 is very much prejudicial to those people.", "I remember speaking at that committee hearing. The member for Beaches spoke out and said, “Go away, go away. This is all good. Don’t worry about it.”", "I said to him, “I hope nothing serious or detrimental ever happens to you or your family and you need to seek remedy through the courts for something that may happen.”", "The development of public policy and the drafting of law is serious business. It’s not just about talking points. It’s about people’s lives. It requires significant deliberations, significant and thoughtful conversations, and diligence and attention to detail, to get it right. If we don’t get it right, people get hurt. People get harmed. People are reduced, without remedies, for failings.", "That’s what we have seen time and time again with this government. They view the legislation, they view the law, as a photo op, as a plaything, something that they can just advance and talk about, and have somebody parrot a few lines, a few bullet points, a few slogans. But at the end of the day, it affects people, and we need to get it right.", "We saw, this morning, time allocation on the ORPP. We saw time allocation on cap-and-trade. We see time allocation all the time. We also see a refusal by this government to accept honest, forthright representations at committee.", "Our critic for health, Mr. Yurek, was speaking about the amendments that were advanced—amendments from the Ontario Medical Association, amendments from the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario, people whose business it is to conduct themselves under these laws. We heard their concerns. Amendments were drafted. Each and every amendment offered up and discussed was rejected out of hand once again by the Liberal government. If they don’t bring the amendment in, if they don’t bring the legislation in, it’s no good. It is irrelevant, it’s insignificant, it’s unimportant.", "We know that this bill, Bill 119, is the result of court decisions that said the existing legislation was faulty. It did not provide enough protection. We owe it to the courts, we owe it to the public and we owe it to ourselves to get it right so it doesn’t come back again and again and again for review, which we see so often.", "But this government seems to have this absolute fear of any scrutiny, and they miss scrutiny. Scrutiny provides understanding. That’s what it does: It provides knowledge and understanding of what the legislation means. They also have this absolute fear of criticism, but we know that no government succeeds—no democracy succeeds—without scrutiny, without criticism. That’s what makes us better. That’s what makes our legislation better. That’s what makes our laws better: criticism and scrutiny.", "We know what types of governments don’t like scrutiny. We know which governments don’t like criticism. We can’t allow that attitude and that culture to take root here in our province and here in our Legislature.", "Bill 119 has some good elements, but I do not feel comfortable supporting Bill 119, Speaker, because of the prejudicial aspects of it for those people who need remedy in the courts for a critical incident or a serious incident that happens to them in our health care system.", "There is much that needs to be fixed in health care. I fear that this one is just going to add another problem. It’s going to take one problem away and add another problem in. We’re going to see the courts come back and condemn some of the aspects, because that QCIPA aspect of this bill is contrary to what the courts are looking for. It’s absolutely contrary to where the courts are telling us that the law and justice are found.", "There needs to be transparency. There needs to be able to be a determination of fact. It can’t be shielded; it can’t be hidden. But Bill 119 will shield and hide facts from those who have been injured." ],

  "text" : [ "This is an incredibly important debate that we’re having here today. It may be eclipsed by some other drama in the House, but what we need to be focused on is that this piece of legislation, if we don’t get it right, will have a devastating impact on the people we’re elected to serve—in this case, those people who have to make use of our health care system.", "Our critic on this, the member from Nickel Belt, spoke at length about the importance of getting Bill 119 right. She made the strongest point around how this piece of legislation is connected to us. She said, “The problem is that each and every one of us will be impacted by this bill. We have to get it right. If we get it wrong, we will do immense damage to our health care system.”", "This all goes back to trust. It goes back to trust in the system in many respects, actually, for those of us who have been following the legislation. Its first reading was September 16, 2015, second reading was February 18, 2016, and its third reading is before us. The amendments put forward by both the NDP and the PC caucus were not received well by this government, which is disappointing, because there are long-standing issues around privacy in the health care system.", "It is important to do our due diligence and to craft a piece of legislation which is responsive to the needs of the population. We have many examples, actually, of not getting pieces of legislation right. In fact, the Smoke-Free Ontario Act has to come back to the floor of this Legislature because the government failed to put in four words. Those four words are “and other prescribed substances.” They didn’t do their due diligence, they didn’t do a thorough consultation, and it means that you crafted a flawed piece of legislation.", "It was disappointing that the amendments were not received as they should have been. I think in good faith that we’re trying to make sure that the interests of patients, the system as a whole and the integrity of the health care systems are maintained. This piece of legislation is playing catch-up, because right now the way that our Personal Health Information Protection Act is written is way back from 2004.", "In 2004, electronic health records were in their infancy. You could get your name, your OHIP number and your address electronically, but everything else was on paper. We’ve seen a massive change in the way that information is stored, the platforms information is stored on and the amount of personal information that is out there in the health care system. A lot of it is very personal. If you’ve ever experienced a breach of trust, a breach of information around your own personal health, it’s a complete violation for you, for your family and for your children.", "Here we are. We are in 2016 catching up from a very dated piece of legislation going back to 2004. We need to move forward; we need to get it right. What can we do to better protect the health information that is shared between patients, caregivers, clients and health providers, and how do we do that better? This act takes a number of steps to bring us there and it will talk about who is responsible for keeping the information safe, but how can we as clients, as patients, decide who has access and who does not have access? Quite honestly, I’ve heard from the government side of the House two of the speakers, including the minister, mention that information should be shared with people who matter most, and that would be the patient, the client of the system, if you will. Having access to this information is key to continuous improvement.", "We have so many examples. As I was researching to speak to Bill 119, I was genuinely surprised to see how many breaches of privacy have actually happened in the province of Ontario. Some of them have been well known. Former speakers have talked about the privacy commissioner calling for prosecution over the Rob Ford privacy breach; this is from the Toronto Star on March 25, just over a year ago. Obviously, it made the news because it was Rob Ford, but ultimately, at the time—this was a father. He was a husband. He was well known in the community, but he was a patient of the system and he had rights that were violated.", "Ontario’s privacy commissioner called for the two health professionals who had allegedly snooped into former mayor Rob Ford’s medical records to face prosecution. “If the duo is convicted, this would mark the first successful prosecution under the province’s health privacy law, which came into force more than a decade ago.” That’s the part that I want to focus on. It took 10 years to make a piece of outdated legislation actionable. Why was that?", "I think the weaknesses that were contained in the first QCIPA should resonate with all of us. Really, it’s a call to action. Let’s get this right.", "“The only other health privacy breach case to have reached the courts in Ontario’s history was effectively dismissed recently, after a judge ruled the delay getting to trial was unacceptable for the accused.” This was justice denied because it took so long to get to the court system.", "So you have breaches of privacy in the health care system; you have justice denied because it takes so long. It’s really interesting because the Ministry of the Attorney General, “the sole authority with the power to launch a prosecution under the Personal Health Information Protection Act (PHIPA) said the government would not comment ‘unless and until a charge has been laid.’”", "Really, there is a delay in having justice followed through on, quite honestly. Yet the flip side, which is fairly interesting as well, is that you have people who want access to the data and the stats around health care. This most recent article was just published by the Toronto Star. Of course, a lot of this came about because of the investigative reporting that was done by the Toronto Star into hospitals that were refusing to reveal the critical incidents that happened in their hospitals. Some of them actually did a very good job. I think it was Toronto East General that came forward and revealed everything—because when you investigate critical incidents, you have an opportunity to learn from them. When you learn from them, you have an opportunity to strengthen your system.", "What we have now—this story was just from last week, from Diana Zlomislic, who is a news reporter. She’s done an evaluation of “Cancer Care Ontario ‘Covering Up’ Casualties by Hiding Stem Cell Data, Critics Charge.” This raises the question: What sort of information should the public have access to and what should they not? In this instance, “Critics decry a ‘cynical abuse’ of privacy law to avoid revealing how many people fell off the transplant list because of a system breakdown.”", "Why is it important for us to be raising this issue in today’s debate? It’s that we are trying to get a sense of how the system is responding to the health care needs of the people in this province.", "The article goes on to say, “Just how many of Ontario’s sickest patients fell off a controversial, $100-million waiting list for life-saving stem cell transplants in US hospitals is a secret Cancer Care Ontario said it is ‘committed’ to keeping.” The question is, does Cancer Care Ontario have the right to keep this information from us as legislators, or from the general public who pays for the system? This is a perfect example of that tension that exists in the health care sector.", "There are some people, including some lawyers, who feel very strongly that this information is ours to have. It doesn’t reveal personal, private medical records, but it will tell us the story of how Ontario’s system is not responding to cancer care, in particular, allogeneic stem cell transplants.", "Amir Attaran, who is a professor in the faculties of law and medicine at the University of Ottawa, says very clearly, “They’re covering up. It is a cynical abuse of privacy law, to shield a callous and incompetent agency from disclosing how many Ontarians its inattention and bad management have killed. Simple as that.”", "This is somebody who feels very strongly that Cancer Care Ontario has no right to hold onto this data. But right now, Cancer Care Ontario is protected by a government that gives Cancer Care Ontario the right to withhold this information. That’s why getting Bill 119 is so important.", "“Ontario’s privacy commissioner also took issue with Cancer Care Ontario’s rationale.” And you have to remember Ontario’s privacy commissioner is an independent officer of the Legislature. This is what Brian Beamish told the Star: “‘It is not apparent to us how patients would be identifiable from a raw number in these circumstances.’", "“Beamish consulted with Cancer Care Ontario before the government agency doubled down on its decision to withhold statistics on patients who relapsed or died while waiting for an American stem cell transplant.”", "Most people are incredibly surprised to find that citizens in this province have to go to the United States to access this life-saving treatment—they genuinely are—because of the costs associated with going to the United States, but also the bigger question—and having access to the full data would help us figure out why Ontario hospitals are not able, not funded, not resourced or don’t have the mandate to fully respond to this particular kind of treatment.", "“An ongoing Toronto Star investigation revealed that since the fall of 2015, more than 200 Ontario patients with various forms of blood cancers, such as leukemia, and immunologic disorders were referred by Ontario hospitals for out-of-country care because of a systemic capacity crisis in the province.” That’s the key piece, Mr. Speaker.", "“There are too many patients in need of” these “stem cell transplants—new immune systems, essentially, delivered through donated bone marrow or stem cells—and not enough beds, staff or funding to offer equal-access urgent care.”", "Having the full dataset, though, and all of the information to holistically look at who these people are—what communities they come from; how long they have been on a wait-list; what kind of cancer they have; how long they have been in treatment; what costs they are bearing themselves, as patients, within our so-called universal health care system—this is the information that I would be interested in, not to point fingers at this hospital or that administrator or even this ministry. It would be to solve the problem, to bring a policy in place that actually is responsive, so that people do not have to travel to the United States, including children. Tomorrow we’re going to be debating the terrible experience that children have when they suffer through cancer.", "The holding-on of the information, the power that some organizations have to protect or to put up a wall around information, is a very important democratic discussion and debate that we are having in the province of Ontario. Certainly, for those of us who want to have this information, to inform policy going forward, that wall is very thick, and those walls are very high.", "Then you have, on the flip side, information that is revealed without the appropriate protection and support—clinical, personal health information, like what happened to Rob Ford, where there was no system in place to protect the integrity of that health care experience for that patient. That is why Bill 119 is a personal story. That’s what I’m trying to bring to this debate today.", "It’s interesting, on the stem cell data: “International standards dictate that patients requiring such a transplant generally get one within three months of their initial diagnosis, for the best chance of success.” This is from the same article, Mr. Speaker. “Canada’s largest cancer centre, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, formally shut its doors to new stem cell transplant patients in March” of this year—last month—“because its wait-list for treatment had grown to eight months.", "“A spokeswoman for the hospital confirmed that 147 of its patients have been referred for US transplants in the past seven months.”", "We need to get to that information. It’s just not good enough that we know that it’s 147. We need to know the circumstances as to why the system is not responsive.", "“The Ontario government has approved 191 patients for funded transplants in Buffalo, Detroit and Cleveland at a cost of roughly $500,000 (US) per patient. Only 19 people have received the treatment so far.”", "This story is a very sad story, because one of the patients, Sharon Shamblaw, had to wait so long that, really, she got bumped off the list again. She wasn’t able to get the treatment in the US—or in Ontario, where, quite honestly, she should be able to get the treatment. She shouldn’t have to wait on a wait-list to go to the United States for this kind of surgery.", "“The government’s contract permits US hospitals to treat only patients who are in remission from cancer”—the only way you get into remission from cancer is that you at least have some quality treatment to hold the cancer back—“even if doctors believe a transplant is still a curative option. Shamblaw was ordered back to Ontario. She is in palliative care at home,” and obviously the prognosis is not good.", "What you have here is Cancer Care Ontario, funded by the Ministry of Health, able to not give us the full dataset that we all deserve to fully understand. We agree with Ontario’s privacy commissioner, Brian Beamish. He has, for good reason, challenged this decision.", "Bill 119 will not rectify this situation. When you read through this piece of legislation—I’ve called it, and several other people here have called it, “selective transparency and accountability” associated with this.", "The stats that we have, unfortunately, are somewhat anecdotal because these are doctors who finally came forward. One of them was from Hamilton. Three doctors finally said, “You know what? It goes against our oath of ethics to continue on this way.” They spoke out, and I commend them for doing so. For more than a decade, physicians at Princess Margaret, Juravinski Hospital in Hamilton and the Ottawa Hospital, the only three Ontario centres equipped with highly specialized staff and space to provide these kinds of treatment, have warned Cancer Care Ontario that this crisis would happen without immediate intervention. The crisis is here. Why deny the information? Let’s look at all the data. Let’s find a solution. Let’s make sure that people in Ontario have the access to universal health care that they’re supposed to have.", "I mentioned the investigation which prompted the review that has been going on for almost—I think it started two years ago. When we were on finance, we had a woman come in—and the thing is, the human side of these issues is so painful. The woman who came in—her mother had passed away very quickly, very suddenly. She suspected a breach of treatment. She is still, five years later, fighting to find out what happened to her mother.", "That’s part of the grieving process which never ends. It never ends because you need answers so you can have closure. You need answers and you need the data so that you find justice. We need access to some information about the system so that we can move forward and change the system because I think we all agree that this health care system in Ontario can be stronger and more responsive.", "Sending patients to the United States at half a million US dollars does not make sense. There has to be a solution. The legislation is so old that we have to acknowledge that this will address some issues. But unfortunately the amendments we put forward were not well received, as I mentioned, by the government. There was a time when legislation could be made stronger at the committee level because there was a genuine interest in shaping legislation which was actually strong. I think that those days are gone. It’s unfortunate, though, because there’s no doubt in my mind that Bill 119 will be coming back to this Legislature, and we will have to fix it at that point." ],

  "text" : [ "It’s a real honour for me to stand here in this House today as we move third reading of Bill 114, An Act to provide for Anti-Racism Measures, which I’ll refer to as the Anti-Racism Act.", "I want to start by acknowledging our indigenous past here in the province of Ontario, and recognize our First Nations, our Métis, our Inuit heritage here in this province and country, and in addition to that, recognize that we’re on the traditional territory of the Mississaugas of the New Credit. People often say this at the beginning of a speech these days. In fact, the first time I ever heard anyone say that was listening to the Premier speak years ago, but I think it’s especially important today, considering that we’re talking about racism here in the province of Ontario.", "Over the last year, I’ve had the opportunity to travel across this province and to talk to people face to face. As I’ve mentioned before, I’ve probably interacted with over 4,000 people during these consultations. I also had smaller meetings with different groups and also meetings one-on-one with people. And when we talk about racism here in the province of Ontario, there is no question that it exists. There is no question that there are different forms of racism that exist here in Ontario, including systemic racism. Some people have asked me, “What is systemic racism? What does it mean?” The best way I can explain it is, systemic racism is racism that may be institutionalized within an organization. You may have folks who do not necessarily have racist tendencies; however, the system is set up in such a way where it doesn’t allow people to reach their full potential. My job is to look for ways to remove barriers that exist to eliminate racism.", "Last month, I was at the Economic Club of Canada speaking about racism. It was the first time in the history of the Economic Club of Canada that they had a speaker come in to talk about racism. I made an argument. I made an argument that fighting racism is a good thing to do because it’s the right thing to do. When we talk about our morals and ethics, our values as Canadians, it’s the right thing to do. But I also talked about the economic side of racism. I talked about the fact that in the United States, it’s estimated that it costs the United States about $1 trillion in lost revenue each year. The government alone loses about $100 billion in costs associated with systemic racism, and then there’s also a monetary value that’s lost through taxation.", "Here alone, in Ontario, there’s no question in my mind that the more we remove the barriers that exist that are caused by systemic racism, the better our society is going to do.", "I want to take a moment to talk about some of the things we’re doing as a government to build a fairer Ontario. I’m sure that someone in the opposition might think, “Why is he talking about things like free tuition or having a $15 minimum wage? What does that have to do with systemic racism?” But I would have to argue that what we’re trying to do here in the province of Ontario is make sure, at the end of the day, that people have a fair chance here in Ontario: that they have the ability to reach their potential and to really capture the benefits that this beautiful place called Ontario has to offer. There’s no question in my mind that every single person in this Legislature agrees that Ontario is a beautiful place with boundless opportunity. We’ve been very fortunate, on this side of the world, to live in a place like Ontario. We know that we need to make sure that we can continue to have that place we call home.", "As a government, we’ve been looking to do things to make sure that people can reach their full potential. Madam Speaker, we have proposed a $15 minimum wage here in Ontario. We proposed that because we want people to be able to earn the right type of income that’s aligned with the cost of living. We want to make sure that tuition is accessible to everyone. That’s why we put in free tuition. That’s why we put in a proposal in our budget that passed a new provision that if you’re 24 or under, medication would be free from now on.", "We did this because we want to make sure that people are set up for success here in Ontario. Eliminating racism is aligned with building a fair Ontario. I’m very proud of the fact that as a government, we’ve introduced the first type of legislation in this country that is set up to combat systemic racism, to fight racism. It’s the first of its kind. It’s the first piece of legislation I believe anywhere in this country that has been set up by a government to take on systemic racism.", "I want to thank the members on this side of the House, and I also want to thank members on that side of the House as well. I know that the member from Brampton–Springdale put in a lot of work in the committee process to get us to this point. So I want to thank her. I also want to thank the member from Eglinton–Lawrence for the work that he did because this was a huge passion for him, to look for ways to set people up for success and to eliminate systemic racism.", "I want to thank all members of this House, because we went right across the province. I was in Kitchener. I went to Windsor. I was in Ottawa. The members that joined me at those meetings listened first-hand to the stories from people about systemic racism. There are stories that I can’t forget. I remember being in Thunder Bay. Thunder Bay today—there are a lot of challenges that are taking place in Thunder Bay. You can open up a paper and see that for yourself. But in Thunder Bay, one of the teachers that was there—and he was of European background. He stood up and spoke, and he talked about the way the school system was set up. He talked about how the system was set up based on agriculture and letting kids out during the summer so they can go back and work on farms, which is great if that’s aligned to your livelihood. But he was saying to me that as a teacher, he noticed that the kids in northern Ontario who were indigenous were not coming in in the fall period and he didn’t understand why they weren’t coming. It was aligned to their traditional hunting period.", "So even our education system has been set up in such a way where it didn’t take into account the livelihood of some of those communities in that region. Really, that’s what systemic racism is all about: looking at the system and looking for ways to make sure that a young person—or a middle-aged person or an older person—can access the system in a way that’s aligned to their culture and looking for ways to remove barriers that exist.", "We heard stories from people about blatant, overt racism—in-your-face kind of racism—where people felt that their human rights have been disrespected. Some pretty tough, nasty, horrible words have been presented to people. We also heard about the overrepresentation of indigenous and black children in child welfare; the overrepresentation in our corrections of indigenous and black people, mainly males. We heard many different stories.", "At the end of the day, the message that I got is that there is a lot of pain out there. There are a lot of people who are suffering. Again, I don’t want anyone for a second not to understand that people do see Ontario as a great place. Even when they’re placed in a situation where they’ve been presented with some form of racism, they still looked at Ontario as a great place, but they knew it could be a better place. What we’re trying to do in this Legislature by developing this type of legislation, presenting it and having it be adopted is to build a better Ontario.", "So we’ve been able to bring this bill forward—again, the first of its kind. The bill is quite unique. It has some very unique things embedded in it. I want to take a moment just to talk about some of those things because I believe they’re very important. They are necessary in order for us to go forward.", "Within the legislation, it will recognize and back a three-year plan that we’ve put forward as the Anti-Racism Directorate to fight systemic racism. This plan itself is bigger than the directorate itself. It’s a pretty important piece because it captures the work that is going to take place beyond the work of the directorate.", "While I’m talking about the directorate, I’d like to recognize three of the individuals who are in the west gallery this morning who have put a lot of work into developing the directorate. Let’s give them a big round of applause, folks." ],

  "text" : [ "Thank you for being here. I know the rest of the team is going to be here for the vote later today, which we all hope passes, but thank you for being here today.", "Today is a special day because we have Bill 114 and another bill that’s coming from the Ministry of Children and Youth Services which will be presented, Bill 89. So today’s a pretty big day in regard to legislation being proposed and going for third reading and hopefully being supported by all members of the Legislature.", "If the bill does pass today, this legislation will establish a long-term plan to fight systemic racism here in Ontario. It mandates community engagement, and this is an important thing because I often hear criticism about the community engagement piece. When we went out there, there were some folks who were saying, “Why are you continuously engaging the community? Why are you doing this?” Some other folks would be saying, “You haven’t done enough engagement.”", "There are folks out there who have been engaged; they’ve been engaged for years and years and years—10, 20, 30 years—from the Stephen Lewis report way back in the Bob Rae government to the Curling-McMurtry report on the roots of youth violence. People are exhausted when it comes to looking for ways to fight racism here in Ontario. The recommendations that have been made today are some of the same recommendations that have been made 30 years ago, 20 years ago. But there’s a difference between what we’re doing here today and what has happened in the past. The first thing, like I said, this is being backed by legislation.", "This legislation mandates community engagement through multi-year strategic plans. It will obligate the minister responsible for this file to continuously go out there and engage community and ask them what they think, and have the ability to adjust that strategic plan based on the realities of today.", "Now, I’ll tell you what the changes have been in the last 15 years, the last 20 years, in comparison to 40 years ago. We all know that there have always been anti-Muslim sentiments that have been out there in the past. Islamophobia has always been there, but we know that after 9/11, Islamophobia has become one of the fastest-growing forms of hate here in this country.", "We have a great Muslim community here in the city of Toronto. In fact, I know that most Muslims who live in Canada live in Ontario, and most of them reside in the GTA. We have a very strong Muslim community, a very prominent community, occupying some of the most influential positions in society—from lawyers to academics, academia, to members of provincial Parliament, to heads of universities.", "We know that there are many folks in our communities, our neighbours, who are Muslim. Over the last 15 years the hate towards that community has increased. We’ve seen it. We’re all aware of it. You can open up a paper and you can see those stories. We need to make sure that we continuously engage the public to ensure that our plans are reflective of what’s happening out there.", "I need to take a moment to talk about what has happened in the Jewish community. Anti-Semitism is one of those institutionalized—one of those forms of racism that exists, one of those forms of hate that exists, that has been here for a long time. We know that 30% of the hate crime that takes place in the city of Toronto is against our own Jewish community. We need to monitor this stuff. We know what’s happening in the United States and around the world when it comes to hate.", "In fact, last night before I was going to bed I was going through Twitter and LeBron James, the NBA star, found a hate word spray-painted in front of the gates to his home—had the N-word there. This week they found two nooses in front of the black museum of history in Washington.", "Things are happening out there, and we need to monitor it. We need to continuously engage the community to figure out what they’re thinking and what they’re feeling. Are there forms of extremism that are taking place? We need to, as a responsible government, understand what’s going on. So I’m proud to be part of a government that is going to continuously engage.", "One of the most important pieces that we have in this legislation is the ability to collect disaggregated race-based data and mandate organizations to collect that type of information. There’s an old saying, “No data, no problem, no solution.”", "Madam Speaker, I always drag you into these debates because we were at the school board when that debate took place around disaggregated data. It was something that as a school board we embraced and as former trustees we acknowledged we had to focus on. It was a good thing for the city of Toronto.", "In fact, now we look back 15 years later, or 10 years later—it was 2004, and then 2006 it was implemented, the first census. We look back, and it’s interesting. At the Toronto District School Board back then, when Bruce Davis and myself moved that motion, we won by one vote. Now the world looks at Toronto and the country looks back at Toronto and the TDSB, and they say, “How did you do this? What does it look like?” It’s something that everyone embraces, but it was a hard sell years ago.", "So we’re going to make sure that we put forward a plan to collect the right type of data so we can make better policy decisions to fight systemic racism here in the province of Ontario.", "I’m aware that I have about 45 seconds left. I want to end by saying this: This piece of legislation is not very complex when you look at it at first glance. But when you start to dig deep and you figure out what it empowers government to do, it becomes a lot more complex, because it’s multi-ministry and it goes beyond just the role of government, and goes out and looks for ways to work with community. I believe that this piece of legislation is one of the most significant pieces of legislation that, as a government, we could put forward.", "I hope, at the end of the day, that all of us here in the Legislature can rise to the occasion and support this piece of legislation so we can end hate here in the province of Ontario." ],

I certainly commend your civil action. If the government doesn’t vote for it, I won’t encourage you to be civil anymore.", "These people have taken time out of their busy lives to show their support. I hope the government takes notice today.", "I also want to thank the some 3,000 people in my riding who have taken this time to sign a petition for either the Collingwood hospital or the Alliston hospital. I think I saw one or two sign both. Their voices are being heard here today.", "Madam Speaker, I rise on a matter of great importance to the people of my riding. As members in this House will know, Simcoe–Grey is the home of two hospitals: Collingwood General and Marine Hospital and Stevenson Memorial Hospital in Alliston. The Collingwood hospital was built in the late 1950s; Stevenson Memorial Hospital was built in the early 1960s. The infrastructure is old and outdated and badly in need of redevelopment. There is a lack of space and storage, and as a result, patients and equipment are overflowing into the hallways.", "I want to be clear that I am not suggesting that patient care at these hospitals is in any way substandard. This is certainly not an issue, as compassionate, tender loving care is the norm at each hospital. The hospitals are staffed by incredibly caring, talented and well-educated individuals, and they are supported by a legion of dedicated volunteers. These same volunteers help fundraise for our hospitals, and in doing so they so very often contribute their own money. All of the stakeholders, in some fashion, are working towards the common goal of getting Ministry of Health approval for redevelopment. But what these two hospitals need now, what the government can help with today, is approval of the hospitals’ planning grant requests.", "Let me tell you a bit more about these two hospitals in my riding and about the enormous efforts they have already gone through in the process of putting together the redevelopment applications. Just so you know, the information I am going to read today is being provided directly from the hospitals, so it won’t be one of my usual partisan speeches.", "Collingwood General and Marine Hospital is a 60-bed facility on a journey to build a new hospital for its patients, patients who reside in the south Georgian Bay region of Clearview township, Collingwood, the Blue Mountains and Wasaga Beach. The hospital serves more than 60,000 permanent residents in addition to the 3.5 million visitors who visit the Georgian triangle each year. Many of these visitors are from right here in the GTA. The hospital’s redevelopment journey began in the fall of 2014 on stage 1 of the five-stage application process called the master program/master plan.", "Planning teams consisting of more than 100 staff and physicians spent a year working diligently on the master program, a document which defines the future programs and services needed in the new hospital, and on the master plan, which identifies the physical space needed for a new hospital.", "Multiple rounds of community education and engagement sessions were held in all four communities. After two years and much hard work, the hospital submitted its complete stage 1 application to the capital branch of the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care on September 30, 2016. After a rigorous site evaluation process and with community input, the hospital board has identified a preferred site in the town of Collingwood on Poplar Side Road. The Poplar site, adjacent to a local community college, will allow a new regional hospital to become an even more significant player as it will facilitate a higher probability of achieving the hospital’s greater vision of being one of the first medium-sized hospitals in the province to become a true learning campus that will better prepare our next generation of health care providers to obtain the skills required to better function in medium-sized health care operations.", "With exponential growth and no room, the redevelopment project needs to get under way for the following reasons:", "The current hospital was developed in the 1950s, with subsequent additions and renovations in the 1960s, 1970s, 1990s and 2000s, and is out of space. Most non-clinical staff have moved into external modular buildings in order to free up every inch of hospital space for patient care and clinical needs. The hospital has four portables to deal with the constant overcapacity.", "Many of the major building systems will require renewal within the next few years. That’s expensive and ongoing. Due to inadequate floor-to-floor heights and floor plate sizes, the building is ill suited to meet current clinical standards. Structurally, the hospital is unable to add additional floors to the existing building for growth. Due to poor area layouts, there are inefficiencies in staff time and a general sense of frustration.", "When Ornge is required, the hospital has a single flight path for helicopters. Currently, safety regulations call for two flight paths. Power lines surrounding the hospital building are at a height that interferes with the flight path. As the helicopter lands—and this is something to see; I’ve seen it myself—the emergency department has to turn off the ventilation system, as the landing site is so close, the fumes would otherwise enter the building.", "From a clinical perspective, there are great challenges.", "There are substandard facilities in the emergency department for patients with mental illness or addiction issues, as some patients remain a number of days.", "There is no space in the dialysis unit to expand. In order to accommodate two additional dialysis chairs, a closet was actually converted into a patient care area in the fall of 2015.", "There is a lack of patient confidentiality due to the open-concept areas divided by curtains, instead of private rooms and recovery areas, and poor visibility to patient areas for nursing staff.", "There is a lack of family support facilities such as quiet interview rooms and lounges for families when in a time of crisis. You literally have to have your family meeting in the hallway among all the gurneys and equipment.", "For all of these points mentioned, it’s imperative a redevelopment be approved in the near future.", "Next, I want to talk about Stevenson Memorial Hospital in Alliston, and this brief was provided by the hospital.", "Stevenson Memorial Hospital is a 38-bed progressive acute care community hospital serving south Simcoe. It has received strong community support for its plans to construct a new hospital facility that will better serve the community’s growing health care needs.", "The hospital is dedicated to revitalizing and redeveloping the facility to meet the needs of a community that has outgrown a facility that was constructed in 1964 and has had no major renovations since.", "The 4,000-square-foot emergency department was made to accommodate 7,000 visits per year, yet in 2016-17, Stevenson saw over 36,000 patients in its emergency room. The facility is attempting to handle over five times the level of visits it was designed to handle.", "Stevenson is committed to upgrading its emergency department. It is the “most relied-upon and essential service” at the hospital, accounting for over 50% of the total visits to the hospital. Alliston needs a facility that is over twice the size of Stevenson today. The emergency department is hard pressed to meet the needs of the community, and without addressing this, the community could be put at risk, especially if there is a critical outbreak of an infectious disease in the future.", "There are other reasons the redevelopment of the hospital is necessary.", "The hospital has emergency patients on stretchers in the hallway. This is not optimal care.", "The hospital’s current HVAC system is below industry standards.", "Birthing suites need to be modernized, giving women in the community services that reflect best standards set by the province.", "Mental health services in the Mary McGill building are developed in a building that does not meet accessibility standards set by the province and challenges the cornerstone of privacy and dignity of patients.", "The hospital building has problems meeting the fire code. There are frequent fire and safety infractions because medical equipment has to be stored in the hallway. The hospital’s electricity systems are at capacity, and newer technologies require upgrades.", "Parking at the hospital is at overcapacity.", "The ORs are severely dated and small for modern-day surgical practice.", "The best answer to these issues is a redeveloped facility with modern infrastructure and services. These services would include a new emergency department and OR facilities, diagnostic imaging and lab, and refreshed in-patient and outpatient clinics.", "Stevenson Memorial Hospital Foundation fully supports the efforts to develop the hospital and can meet the local share requirement of $30 million.", "By 2031, the population that Stevenson will serve is expected to grow from its current 55,000 to over 90,000. The hospital’s services will be even more in demand because a large percentage of that 90,000 will be of an older demographic, making it even more critical that we get under way with the renovations and upgrades Stevenson needs.", "I’d also like to mention that this hospital was recently recognized with an “exemplary” standing from Accreditation Canada for its operations. The hospital’s operations were assessed and measured against national standards of excellence. Of the standards assessed, the hospital impressively met 1,782 of them. Only 18 were not met, and 51 were not applicable to that hospital. They met 100% of the required organizational practices.", "I hope this provides a good picture of the needs of the two hospitals, in the short time that I am allocated today. What I’m asking members of this House for today is this: Support my resolution that calls for the immediate approval of the planning grants for Collingwood General and Marine Hospital and Alliston’s Stevenson Memorial Hospital.", "This is not a partisan issue. This is about planning for the health care needs of Ontario today and in the future. I would ask all of the government members—I know it may be difficult to vote for expenditures in other people’s ridings, but we are all here, and particularly government members, to represent all of the people of Ontario, as my predecessor George McCague would remind us if he were here today.", "I do want to thank the government. Up to this point, you have let us go through stage 1. But each hospital, to get to stage 1, has had to spend slightly over $1 million of their own money. They’ve had to use front-line patient care money in order to put the studies and the applications together.", "We can’t go to stage 2, let alone get all the way to stage 5, without a few million dollars each, for each hospital. Today, we were encouraged, during question period, by the Minister of Health to continue, but that’s not possible without sending cheques.", "We’re not asking for the hundreds of millions that these two buildings will cost eventually. We’re simply asking for the planning grants. We’re willing to raise the money locally. We’ve got wonderful communities that fully support their hospitals. I hope you’ll fully support us today." ],

He has spoken about the deficiencies that exist with these hospitals, deficiencies that have to be corrected.", "As you may well be aware, Speaker, our health critic, the member from Nickel Belt, has spoken extensively about the shortcomings in the hospital systems in this province: how many hospitals don’t have adequate facilities; how many hospitals put people in hallways. Frankly, she recently referenced a hospital where people on gurneys were pushed into a shower area. That was the accommodation that was available.", "I had an opportunity a year ago to talk to one of my colleagues in Thunder Bay. The Thunder Bay Regional Health Sciences Centre, their hospital, was at something like 110% capacity. They had people on stretchers and on gurneys in the television rooms. They had them in whatever indoor space they could possibly stuff them in, so that they didn’t get rained on.", "That was the level: They don’t get rained on? That’s good. They’re indoors, and they aren’t freezing? That’s good.", "I think what the member has raised here, with the extensive list of problems that he has outlined—it’s clear that investment has to go into these hospitals.", "I’m not the person you would normally have speaking on rural hospital investment, but I have seen, in Toronto, situations in hospitals where people have been forced into hallways and kept there for extended periods of time.", "It doesn’t matter where you are in Ontario; you deserve a standard of health care that is acceptable to everyone. Because you’re in a rural area, it doesn’t mean that we can do that work or provide those services on the cheap. People in every community in Ontario deserve the same high-quality standard of health care, and Simcoe–Grey is no exception.", "The member went through a list of a number of deficiencies in those hospital buildings, and I agree with him. My guess is, the staff do the absolute best they can. They would do, for the patients, everything within their power. But there is a limitation on what you can do when the buildings you’re operating in are no longer providing the context, the environment, in which the proper job can be done.", "The member noted a number of problems. He noted the inadequate floor-to-floor heights and floor plate sizes in the building, making it ill suited to meet current clinical standards.", "In my riding, what was formerly the Riverdale Hospital, a rehab hospital—Speaker, you’re well aware of the building I’m talking about—was a good building in its time, in the 1950s and 1960s.", "And my guess is, this hospital was a good building in its time. But standards of care have changed. Our knowledge of what it takes to give people proper care—and you’re familiar with the medical system, Speaker—to give the right amount of space for the movement of equipment and provision of care to patients means you have to have a different design. It isn’t just putting equipment into a space; you need a space that’s appropriate for that equipment.", "The list of deficiencies in this hospital includes “no direct connect from the medical device repurposing department to the operating room.” It’s saying that staff then have to use the same block of elevators as the general public. Frankly, if you’re going to make sure that equipment is clean and sterile and provides people with the service they need, you have to have that changed.", "When you look at their list of deficiencies, there is a “lack of storage, overflowing into halls.” Halls, which would generally be used for the storage of patients, don’t have the room for equipment. Halls shouldn’t generally be used for the storage of patients, but given what has been said, that’s probably where they are, and they’re cheek by jowl up against janitorial supplies and other material.", "“Crowding in the main entry at registration, due to small space”: You shouldn’t have that. You just shouldn’t have that. The space should be adequate for the purpose so that people have a good experience from the moment they arrive till the moment they leave. We want them to come out healthy. We want them to be treated properly. They deserve to be treated properly.", "In addition to the problems that were outlined by the member, there’s “poor visibility to patient areas for nursing staff.” Well, why wouldn’t you have proper visibility? It makes sense that if you’re going to give people a high level of care, medical staff have to be able to survey all the patients who are there and be able to look after them.", "Noting again from the list of deficiencies—I’ll go to the Stevenson Memorial Hospital. If you look at the list of deficiencies, the hospital’s current HVAC system is below industry standards. Standards change; equipment ages. Now is the time to bring it to modern standards so that people get the right temperature of air and the right level of humidity consistently so that they’re assisted in getting better.", "One of the things that is noted are the services in the Mary McGill building. Currently, that building has a lot of asbestos in it. My guess is that it has been isolated. But if you’re actually going to do the work that’s required to ensure there’s proper space, you’re going to have to deal with that. I’ve dealt with asbestos before, when I was a property manager, and it ain’t cheap. It just is not cheap.", "There’s no question that those people in those buildings deserve good-quality and modern equipment, and they deserve it now.", "So I want to thank the member for bringing forward this bill. I know it’s his riding, but I think there’s a principle here, and I talked about it earlier: Everyone in Ontario should have a high quality of medical care. It doesn’t matter where you are, the quality of care has to be the same." ],

I have been over there to visit him many times, and I hope to be there many other times.", "This is not a partisan issue, as he stated. But there is a process involved. Infrastructure doesn’t appear overnight.", "All Ontarians—I agree with my colleagues—deserve access to high-quality, publicly funded health care. Nobody does not agree with that. We are investing in pharmacare, in hospitals, in home and community care, in long-term care, in mental health and in our world-class health care professionals—and that’s important—including $9 billion to support the construction of new major hospital projects across the province. Our government is committed to making capital investments across the health care sector. We will continue to work with our health care partners to assess needs based on sound fiscal planning and guided by priorities for the health care system.", "All decisions our government makes regarding hospital and capital funding are based on the best evidence available to us. I do know that, in both areas that we’re talking about, there is growth. I know that. There is good reason for it, and it’s good news. Our government assesses many factors, such as community need, growth, hospital condition, and local health care needs when reviewing capital submissions. We also work with the local hospitals and community to follow a structured process for hospital infrastructure planning and development. A process, of course, means step by step. Sometimes, you’re not able to skip steps in processes.", "The Ministry of Health has received the capital submissions for both hospitals mentioned in this motion, in Collingwood and Alliston. Our government is taking the necessary steps to assess both projects. I was very pleased, when I made my announcement about additional money to hospitals, to have the CEO from Collingwood there. He was quite pleased about the money he was getting. Alliston was not there that day. I think I’ve made a couple of phone calls there, over the last year, with good news, and that news was well received. We will continue to work with both hospitals, the local LHIN and local health care partners to ensure that local residents have access to the care that they need.", "Between June 2015 and July 2016, the ministry, the LHIN and the Stevenson Memorial Hospital were actively engaged in review of the stage 1 proposal submission. The capital planning and review process typically involves multiple exchanges to ensure that the ministry’s and the LHIN’s concerns are addressed such that all factors that could affect a proposed project are satisfied prior to proceeding with detailed planning.", "The LHIN board endorsed stage 1, part A—program and service elements—on September 27, 2016. While the ministry’s review does not constitute ministry approval for the project or an approval to move to the next stage, the ministry remains committed to making capital investments across the health care sector and will continue to work with the LHIN to assess needs based on sound fiscal planning, guided by its priorities for the health care system.", "Collingwood General and Marine Hospital: Since March 2016, the ministry has met with CGMH to receive updates on their planning activities. The hospital has worked with the LHIN in preparing the stage 1 proposal submission, and submitted it to the ministry in September 2016. The submission is currently under ministry review. At this time, there is no agreement on the project scope or ministry approval for the replacement hospital proposal to move forward.", "However, again, while the ministry’s review does not constitute ministry approval for the project or an approval to move to the next stage, the ministry remains committed to making capital investments across the health care sector and will continue to work with the LHINs to assess needs based on sound fiscal planning, guided by its priorities for the health care system. The ministry’s health capital division receives proposals for capital projects from health service providers via their respective LHIN, and reviews planning submissions at various stages of development to ensure the proposed project is developed in accordance with provincial standards.", "Again, all Ontarians deserve high-quality publicly funded health care. Unfortunately, all infrastructure can’t be taken care of at the same time. As I said, there is a process. Our government is making the important investments our health care system needs. If the member from Simcoe–Grey thinks that our government should invest more in Ontario hospitals, then perhaps he and his colleagues should have voted for the budget." ],

I don’t think that’s a lot to ask, especially when you’re going to smaller communities in the riding. For them to come up with millions upon millions of dollars—this money doesn’t come out of trees; it comes out of either the donations of their communities or—what’s happening right now—their operational costs.", "When the government opposite mentions their investment in the hospitals, we do know that the true fact is that much of that money they’re putting in isn’t going to the base operating costs of the hospitals in this province, so that’s going to continually degrade the system. Now we have a system where the Collingwood hospital especially is going to be pulling out funds from their operating costs just to do the process from the bureaucracy created by this government.", "We only have to look as far as when this member from Simcoe–Grey was the Minister of Health.

I commend him for that.", "It’s also my job as a representative from my area to spend a few minutes talking about hospitals in my area, and I have seven.

My seven hospitals, I’m going to name them just so—I’m also representing my folks.", "In Cochrane, I’ve got the Lady Minto Hospital. In Iroquois Falls, I’ve got Anson General Hospital. In Matheson is the Bingham Memorial Hospital. Those three hospitals are governed by one group, the MICs Group. They did this years ago, before people started talking about amalgamating things. The leadership of these three hospitals thought, “You know what? We can provide better service to our resident base if we consolidate administration,” which they did. They were years ahead of the curve, and it’s not easy, but they have been leaders in that area. I’d like to commend them for that.", "Other hospitals in my area are Kirkland and District Hospital, and Englehart and District Hospital. I used to be on the board of Englehart and District Hospital. They are also in the process of amalgamating their administration under Blanche River Health Partners. If you go down the road another half an hour, you will come to the Temiskaming Hospital. If you go down the road another two hours, you will have the West Nipissing General Hospital.", "Those seven hospitals are—as, I’m sure, the hospitals in Mr. Wilson’s riding are—often the only place where help is available 24 hours a day. That’s what makes hospitals so incredibly important in rural Ontario.", "We find, and we know, that a lot of the services that people take for granted in urban populations—which they deserve; I am not anti-urban population at all, but a lot of those services aren’t available in rural and northern Ontario. The only service that’s available, the only lights that are on 24 hours a day, seven days a week, are the lights at the hospital. That’s why it’s so important to make sure that for hospitals across the province—big ones, highly specialized ones, medium-sized ones that serve small cities, smaller ones and the tiny ones—we realize the different roles that they fill, how important they are to their populations and how, by working together, they create a part of a health care system of which we can all be truly proud.", "In closing our portion, once again I would like to commend the member—I know him as Jim, but the member from Simcoe–Grey—on bringing this forward, so we all have an opportunity to talk about what is important. This is truly a non-partisan issue. He is trying to bring light to his area; I brought light to mine. We have philosophical differences both with his party and certainly with the government, but we should all work together on issues like this, and that’s why we are in strong support of this motion." ],

But I have also come to understand, in the work that I have been able to do here as the parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Health, the reason for that deliberative process, which is you’re building a facility that has to meet the needs for sometimes 30, 40, 50 years. You want to make sure you get not just the design of your building right, and your community contribution in place, but also what the needs of your population are going to be. Who else is in that environment?", "It’s an iterative process that goes back and forth and back and forth. I know the member opposite, and other members opposite, have probably seen this as well. I think that process, as impatient as I have been with it at times, is critical to make sure that we get it right, and critical to make sure that that investment—because we’re often talking about tens or hundreds of millions of dollars that are being invested in health care—will be spent rightly and correctly.", "While I commend the member for bringing it forward, I also recognize that we have to get it right and that there is an issue of balance.", "We all have needs in health care in our communities. I think every member here could stand up and speak for 10 minutes about what they need for their communities, about what their communities are asking them to bring forward.", "I’m sure that all the members opposite know as well that it’s all about choices and planning. Those choices are not always easy or black and white, and sometimes they are not exactly what a community envisions. But what you end up with, once you make the right choice by informing yourself, is the best investment that you can make for your community.", "Speaker, I do want to say a few things about the investments in the budget that we put forward, especially with regard to capital over the next 10 years in hospitals across Ontario. There’s another $9 billion in this budget, over the next 10 years, bringing to $20 billion the investments in capital in hospitals over the next 10 years. That’s a lot of money. That’s a historic investment, and I think that will serve the people of the province well.", "As well, I think it’s also critical, in terms of choices, the choices that we made in this budget with regard to health care by investing more money in the operational increase for hospitals this year, but also in OHIP+, pharmacare for children and youth. If you’re under 25, after January 1, you bring your prescription to the pharmacy, you bring your OHIP card and you leave—no deductible, no copayment. That’s a choice that we made, and I think it’s a critical choice that will support families in Ontario in a way that has never been done before.", "As importantly, that’s a clear statement about the need for us to get to universal pharmacare. I think that’s critical. I think it’s critical in this country that we all come together, all provinces and the federal government, using some leadership, to ensure that every Canadian, every Ontarian, has access to the medications they need. That’s really what universality is all about. Medications and pharmacy play a bigger role in the cure of disease and the maintenance of health than they ever did before.", "When we look at the budget and we look at the investments that we’ve made, we know that there are choices, and we must make those choices well. We must get the information that we need to make the right choices.", "While I can understand the member’s sentiment and his advocacy for his community, I think that we have to look at the processes that we put in place which ensure that we spend that money wisely and invest in communities, not only for their needs of today but of tomorrow and on." ],

When you think of the kinds of medical technology and resources that are available to us, if we can afford them, if we can get to building and things like that—the point is that the dispensing of medical care and the population growth are two things at loggerheads here. Such examples include meeting the standards of the fire code. With the current hospital building, it’s problematic as it has been grandfathered. Medical surgical rooms are below needed space standards, again forcing medical equipment into the hallways and compromising patient privacy and infection standards. The hospital electricity systems are at capacity, and newer technologies require upgrades to the electrical infrastructure to keep standard. These are sort of the bread-and-butter fundamentals of being able to provide this kind of health care in the 21st century, so we’re not looking at anything more than what people have come to understand are the important tools and technology of the kind of medical services that we’re providing. It even gets down to the parking lot and leaving patients and visitors aimlessly wandering to find their parking spot.", "In the few moments that I have, I want to also express my gratitude to the hard-working staff at Stevenson Memorial who work to serve our communities despite these challenges. Most of all, I want them to have the tools that they need to succeed when it comes to looking after those who need it most, and some of them are my constituents. Let’s get Stevenson Memorial to the next stage so they can do what they do best: provide care to our communities.", "I’d also like to end my remarks with a quote from Simcoe’s warden, Warden Marshall: “Building a long-term plan to ensure Simcoe county residents have access to the health care services they deserve is vital for the well-being of our communities. When all levels of government come together to create sustainable success for our health care centres and long-term-care facilities, everyone wins.”" ],

It was a deteriorating facility. It needed a new building to ensure the safety, the health, and the early diagnosis and care which is paramount to everyone, Madam Speaker.", "I want to thank the current minister, Minister Hoskins, for recommitting and making sure we’re moving forward with that, and it is moving forward. We are actually in stage 2. I’m going to hold him to his word to make sure that it does goes forward, that we do actually build Markdale. I believe they’re looking at a 2020-21 time frame. Facility operational start dates for the new hospital will be confirmed at a later capital planning stage, so we’re in a relatively similar process that my colleague is going for. I commend him. As a former minister, he absolutely knows what needs to be done. He was in charge of our hospitals and did a great job at that point to ensure we had that care.", "Particularly in our small rural communities, it is truly the lifeblood of the community. People need that care. They need timely access to care. They need facilities that they can depend on that are close to home, not just because of their own care, but for the ability of their families, the spinoff economics from all of the staff that are there—and we all have wonderful staff in our small rural hospitals. But paramount to everything is absolutely the quality care close to home.", "I applaud him. I hope the government will forget anything of partisan reality and say, “This is what’s needed.” If they can find $25 billion to give short-term hydro relief, surely to goodness they can find money for a planning grant for both the Collingwood hospital and Alliston’s Stevenson Memorial." ],

Collingwood, very little done; the last renovation it got was a bit of a facelift when I was Minister of Health, Madam Speaker. It had a $16-million small redevelopment done there.

  "text" : [ "It’s an honour to be able to speak to this private member’s bill.", "Last year around this time, I introduced a private member’s bill to ban door-to-door sales of certain products to protect consumers from aggressive, coercive or misleading sales practices at the door. Recently, the government adopted my private member’s bill as part of Bill 59, the Putting Consumers First Act. Ultimately, that act, Bill 59 which we passed this spring, banned unsolicited door-to-door sales.", "Recently, I’ve been talking to my constituents about Bill 59 and the ban on unsolicited door-to-door sales. I’ve been talking to them when I knock on doors; I’ve been talking to them at my seniors’ advisory group meeting. When I mention that ban on unsolicited door-to-door sales, almost all of my constituents tell me the same thing: “Okay, great. That’s really good news. That’s great work on door-to-door, but can you stop the salespeople from calling my home? Can you stop the phone calls?”", "I started talking to constituents about this issue, and I began hearing from constituent after constituent who told me stories about receiving unwanted or harassing phone calls from telemarketers, who call them up to four to five times a day, every day, and who use aggressive tactics to sell them products that they don’t want or need. Many are calling to sell air conditioning, window repair services, roof repair, financial services, long-distance plans and a number of others, but the one that I hear about the most by far is duct cleaning services.", "I hear from people everywhere in my community who are complaining about getting four to five calls a day from people trying to sell them duct cleaning services. I don’t know how often we’re supposed to get our ducts cleaned, but I can guarantee you it’s not four to five times a day.", "Many consumers have said that they are on the federal do-not-call list. They shouldn’t be receiving telemarketing calls at all, but they receive them anyway. Many ask the company to add them to their do-not-call list, which under federal regulations they should be doing, and they don’t do that anyway.", "A lot of these telemarketing companies, particularly the ones selling duct cleaning, completely ignore the federal do-not-call list and don’t establish their own do-not-call list or don’t abide by them. As a result, I’ve heard from far too many consumers who are harassed by telemarketers, who call them multiple times a day, every day, and use aggressive sales tactics to sell them services that they don’t want or they don’t need.", "It’s disgraceful to me that we have businesses that have a business model that’s based on harassing consumers into compliance, that’s based on harassing consumers into buying products, and frankly, taking advantage of vulnerable consumers. This bill is about taking action on this very issue to end this predatory practice. It’s about protecting Ontarians from these harassing phone calls. This bill is taking action to stop the phone calls.", "This private member’s bill, the Stop the Calls Act, would ban telemarketing for products and services that have resulted in consumers receiving countless unwanted and harassing phone calls. If passed, the bill would ban certain products and services from being sold as the result of an unsolicited phone call to a consumer. This means that if a company calls a consumer and it’s unsolicited—the company did not have permission to call in the first place, in advance, from the consumer—then any sale that results from that call, even if it happens subsequent to that phone call, is disallowed.", "Should the company contravene the ban and sell products or services to a consumer, the first thing that would happen is that the contract or the sale with the consumer would immediately be void. In addition, the consumer would be entitled to be paid back all the money that they’ve paid under the contract, and the return or replacement of any product that was taken under the contract, if that applies. Stiff penalties would be put in place for offenders who violate the ban. Individuals who are responsible for the sale of the product or service, or the signing of the contract, would be fined up to $2,000 per incident, and the companies responsible would be fined up to $25,000 per incident.", "Finally, if the consumer does not receive payment, they have the option of taking the company to court and, if successful, receiving double the amount that they were owed, plus legal fees.", "The voiding of the contract; the requirement to return the consumer’s money; and the stiff fines that would be placed upon the company would make telemarketing of these specific products and services prohibitively expensive. That’s what would stop many of the harassing and unwanted calls that consumers receive, because these telemarketing businesses that propagate these calls could no longer make money selling products this way.", "My goal here is not to go after everybody. It’s not to stop the good, honest salespeople. It’s not meant to stop the young student who is trying to make money and calls you once a year to clean your windows. It’s not meant to stop the young person who is selling newspapers and calls around and asks if they can add you to their delivery route. I’m not talking about those. We’re talking about the bad actors who call people multiple times a day every day, multiple times a week, who are really just trying to harass people into buying their products.", "We’re trying to focus this, so what I have done in the bill is give the Minister of Government and Consumer Services the authority, through regulation, to select the products and services that would be banned. The minister could select which products and services this ban on telemarketing sales would apply to.", "The other thing that I’ve included in the bill is certain exemptions. Certain sales originating by phone would be allowed. These would include calls from businesses that have an existing or a recent relationship with the consumer. The bill would also exempt businesses that have previously received consent from consumers to call them. If you’ve called a business and enquired about a product, and they call you back, and then you ultimately buy that product, that’s okay. That’s exempted under the bill.", "If you have an established contract with a company, if you have an existing service with a company, and they call you and then upsell you, or sell you a different product, that’s okay. That’s allowed under this bill.", "If you had a contract recently with a company, or you’ve dealt with them recently, or recently had a sale of a product, and then they call you again and you buy something, that’s allowed under this contract.", "What we are talking about here is this: We are exempting those folks who are doing ongoing, reasonable business with consumers. We’re also giving exemptions to charities, to non-profits, to political parties and candidates. They would all be exempted. This is focused on those for-profit telemarketers who are harassing consumers and calling them repetitively, non-stop.", "One of the questions I get from a lot of people is, “Isn’t this federal jurisdiction?” The regulation of telecommunications and telemarketing falls under federal jurisdiction; that is true. It’s not under the province’s jurisdiction to say who can and cannot call a consumer. But the province is allowed to outline conditions under which a contract or sale can be agreed to or can be completed. The Stop the Calls Act doesn’t ban phone calls from coming in. We can’t do that here at the provincial Legislature; the government of Ontario can’t do that. The Stop the Calls Act bans sales or contracts resulting from an unsolicited call. That’s how the bill works.", "Speaker, I have been told by a lot of consumers, a lot of constituents, that a lot of the unwanted or harassing phone calls that they receive come from beyond Canadian borders. This bill would actually protect them against those calls as well.", "No matter where telemarketers are based, they are striving to sell you a product or service on behalf of a company here in Canada. If you think about it, the duct cleaning company, the company that wants to repair your windows or repair your roof, and the long-distance company are all Canadian-based companies that have hired telemarketing companies to sell their products.", "My bill would void the contract with the Canadian company and require that they return the consumer’s money and pay a fine. This would make it prohibitively expensive for the company here in Canada to hire telemarketers to sell their products, and that’s what would stop the calls.", "Not only would the Stop the Calls Act be a deterrent to businesses that are using these harassing techniques; it would also give consumers a lot more confidence in dealing with illegitimate scammers.", "Take, for example, the “Can you hear me?” scam. I’m sure some of us in this Legislature have heard about this or have been targeted by this. Scammers will call a consumer, asking “Can you hear me? Can you hear me?” at the start of the conversation. Upon responding with “Yes,” the consumer’s voice is then often recorded and edited to sound as though the consumer has agreed to purchase a product or service. While the consumer would not be liable to fulfill any such duty, this is often used as an intimidation factor to scare consumers into fulfilling false contract obligations.", "The Stop the Calls Act actually gives consumers the peace of mind of knowing that they can’t be forced into a contract, regardless of what they say on the phone, because it came as the result of an unsolicited phone call.", "The Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre, which is a federal government agency, also warns consumers about a number of different scams: the time-share scam, for example, that lures potential customers with free stays at time-shares in exchange for the client agreeing to simply sit through a time-share presentation. However, problems can arise once you agree to buy the property." ],

Or they’re told that as a preferred customer, they’ve been awarded a credit or a discount on a destination vacation if they book right away. Once the potential victim proceeds with the call, they will be asked to provide personal information, like a credit card and that sort of thing, to book a vacation and to make a deposit to guarantee the trip.", "The Stop the Calls Act gives consumers the protection of being able to leave these deals, regardless of what they say or agree to over the phone, because the sale came as the result of an unsolicited call, Speaker. Not only would this bill help protect consumers against those harassing phone calls four to five times a day, every day, or once a day, every day, multiple times a week—certainly, it would stop those calls. But it would also help, in some selective cases, with some of those scams where sales are completed, where consumers are defrauded or convinced into signing a fraudulent agreement.", "I have heard from too many consumers in my community of Etobicoke Centre who are harassed by telemarketers who call them multiple times a day, every day, and use aggressive tactics to sell them services or products they don’t need or want.", "To me, it’s absolutely disgraceful that some organizations have a business model that is based on harassing consumers into buying their products. I think we need to take action to protect Ontario consumers from this, and my bill would do just that. It’s time to stop the calls." ],

This does fit in very nicely with that bill. At that time, when he spoke to his constituents about the door-to-door sales ban, he heard, “What about those annoying phone calls that we get all day long? Why can’t you do something about that?” So my question to him would be, why didn’t he include that in his door-to-door sales bill? This bill, as he said, is not really focused on stopping the calls, because that is a federal issue; this is more about stopping the sales, meaning cancelling the sales.", "I’m wondering if a lot of these sales are to vulnerable people, older people, people who maybe need a little bit of extra help from the community. Maybe we need to have a sign-up list of vulnerable people that’s more extensive—because there are people who now are on somewhat of a vulnerable list, if they’re under protection, if a relative has power of authority and things like that.", "My question is, what have we done about education? I’m concerned about spending money on more bureaucracy and, as the member beside me said, more red tape. That’s money that’s taken out of front-line health care, education and other important things. Maybe what we need to do is to better educate the public through our newsletters and through our websites and warn people to protect themselves by asking for more information and not agreeing to anything on the phone.", "I hope that we’re going to be hearing from many community members and stakeholders about this issue.

Often, when we receive those calls, we picture people in our communities who are dealing with it and struggling and maybe being left paying for a hot water tank, or something, that they don’t need.", "The member mentioned that a lot of the calls are for duct cleaning—at first, I thought he was talking about cleaning big inflatable ducks, but then I realized he meant duct cleaning. I’ve had a lot of calls about duct cleaning as well. What I advise the people who complain to me about these kinds of calls is to always say, “I have a service that I use for all my home repairs,” or “I have a gardening service that I use.” That cuts them off the line very quickly.", "Thank you very much, Madam Speaker.

  "text" : [ "I want to thank the member for bringing this bill forward. I think this bill does address an issue that we’ve heard a number of times, and I think it’s important to touch on that issue. There are certainly people in many constituencies across this province and in my riding—I can speak to the stories that I’ve heard about vulnerable people who are caught up in sales tactics that are often aggressive and high-pressure at the door, which result in people signing contracts which are not really helping them out in the long run, and which are quite hurtful.", "In addition, though, we know that there are high-pressure tactics by phone, and it’s important to address those. We know that there are people of various backgrounds—whether they’re seniors, people with language barriers, people who are taken advantage of—and we need to absolutely protect those people.", "At the same time, it’s important to acknowledge that the people who are working in these telemarketing positions are often themselves people who are racialized or vulnerable. We have to look at what has resulted, what conditions this government has created that have left people having to find this type of employment. There are no other forms of employment for many people, and we need to talk about that. Many of the people we want to protect—people with language barriers, people who are vulnerable—are the people who rely on some of these jobs that are created by telemarketing, so we need to ensure that this bill doesn’t end up resulting in those people losing their jobs as well.", "Why are these conditions existing right now in this province? Why do these conditions exist? The problem is this: The government has failed in this province to create the conditions for good work. People deserve good work. People have the right to good work. But the government has not allowed for those conditions, has not created the conditions for good work. In fact, what this government has encouraged is precarious work.", "One particular topic of precarious work, which has been one of the top issues in my riding, is temporary job agencies. Many of the folks who are vulnerable in our society have to work through agencies. They can’t find a job. And these are citizens. These are people here in Ontario who can’t find employment unless they go through an agency. But the problem is that the agency often claws back as much as half of the pay of the person who works for that agency. They often don’t see any benefits at all, and they face significant barriers to getting hired permanently.", "None of this needs to happen. None of this should happen. If someone is hired through an agency, the client company should pay a premium, but it shouldn’t be the case that the employee has to see half of their pay being clawed back. That’s just unfair. But this government has allowed this to continue. In fact, over the past decade, temporary job agencies across this province have proliferated. They have grown significantly, and they have all grown because this government has allowed it to happen.", "So what do we need to see happen? We need to see protections for workers so that they receive the same pay as their colleagues. We need to ensure that there aren’t barriers, that people do not see barriers to getting hired directly. Right now, if you’re working through an agency at a client company, you’re doing a great job and the client company wants to hire that person, they have to pay a penalty fee to the agency. That’s what’s going on right now. That’s unacceptable.", "In addition, we see that there are no benefits given, and people go through this revolving door of employment, where they work at a client company, then they’re let go and hired back on, and they end up working at the same client company for six months, a year, two years at a time. They’re continually working at the same client company. What we need to see happen is that after a certain amount of cumulative work, we need people to get hired directly.", "But it’s more than that. There are folks who come to this province with tremendous skill sets who don’t see their talent, their international training and education, recognized by this government. This is not an issue that has just popped up this year or last year; this government has had over a decade—14 years—to address this issue, and still we have extremely qualified people, who have so much to give, who are not being actualized. Their potential, their capacity, their skill set is not being realized, because this government hasn’t implemented a program, a policy to recognize their training.", "There are still too many barriers to education. This province is one of the provinces that provides the least level of funding to post-secondary education, and we have some of the highest tuition fees in the country. We need to tear down these barriers so people can get the education and skill set they need so that they can go on to find good employment.", "This government needs to make strategic investments in industries, in technologies that are sustainable, that are long-lasting, and to encourage a workforce that’s able to find good work because of the investments this government can make but hasn’t made. We need to be innovative. We need to be creative with those investments. It can be done.", "Again, the bill addresses an issue—" ],

Consumer confidence leads to a stronger economy. One thing I asked is, how many complaints do we get about these kinds of phone calls? My ministry was able to do some research. There have been over 400 inquiries just on this issue of telemarketing alone since 2014. I know that may not seem like a huge number, but we have to remember, too, that not everybody calls to complain about a specific issue to the consumer protection branch.", "As MPPs, we’re all pretty familiar with this issue in our own ridings, especially when some of these practices target our most vulnerable consumers, whether they’re seniors, whether they are Ontarians where English isn’t the first language and so on.", "I want to congratulate the member for bringing this forward.

Unfortunately, from my perspective and some of the perspectives that I’ve had the opportunity to have conversations about with this legislation, I am concerned that it might be a bit superfluous. What I mean by that is that the reality is, we already have the CRTC framework, which applies federally, across the country, where duplicating that CRTC code in this piece of legislation would really not have any impact on stopping the practice of annoying telemarketing calls or stopping the practice of invasions of privacy through these unsolicited phone calls.", "I’m concerned. Again, I have an open mind on this, and I look forward to listening to more of the speeches and debate on this bill, but I’m concerned that it might just be more red tape without additional consumer protection. That’s a concern that we have to be wary of. We have to make sure that we’re not simply creating greater barriers for those who may have a valid concern with this legislation. Of course, regulation and red tape seem to be a favourite habit of this government—increasing overregulation." ],

Many people have said to me, “I don’t want a land line because all it’s good for is telemarketers, so therefore I’m getting rid of my land line.” I don’t know if that helps, but that’s what some people are doing.", "The constant haranguing by these companies is quite alarming, because it’s not just your fly-by-night companies. This is, I think, international criminal fraud. These companies are not just little outfits in boiler rooms, as they used to be. I found this out when I was trying to help some people with the Canada Revenue Agency scam, where people across Canada were being phoned non-stop and being told that they hadn’t paid their tax bill and that if they didn’t pay their tax bill, they would be arrested. We had cases —I remember talking to the RCMP about this—of elderly people going to the police station and saying, “Arrest me. I was told that I had violated the Criminal Code or something.” So this is how serious it is.", "These companies are multinational.

As soon as they find out you’re a senior—they go after the seniors and they’re relentless, to the point where the seniors don’t enjoy the comfort of their home, never mind their phone.", "Then you have the half of the Ontario population who doesn’t have English as a first language. They are taken advantage of on a regular basis by these fraudsters.", "So I commend the member for bringing this forward to try to do something to get rid of some of these companies that take advantage of people. I think it is a very aggressive and a very important step to take. They think—again, I remember talking to the RCMP—that Canada is an easy mark for these scammers. That’s the word: “In Canada, we can do it, and there are no repercussions.” So I think we’ve got to take tougher measures to protect our citizens, whether it be provincially or federally.

I know that Minister MacCharles is here with us and spoke to the bill, and the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services does a tremendous amount around consumer education, so that consumers can protect themselves from scams, whether it be over the phone, or door to door, or any other kind.", "One of the challenges with this is that no matter how much education you do, that’s not going to stop the phone from ringing. The phone calls are going to continue to come in. What I’m trying to do is make sure that we stop the harassment of consumers over and over again. Education is helpful to protect people from scams, but it won’t stop the phone from ringing. I think this bill will help stop the phone from ringing.", "The second piece that was raised was that the federal government is already tackling this issue and is responsible for this. I think the member for Ottawa South spoke to this quite thoughtfully. But the federal government regulates the kinds of phone calls that can come in.", "There is a do-not-call list and people can sign up if they don’t want to receive telemarketing calls. But as the member for Ottawa South said, the do-not-call list does not work very well. It works in some cases, selectively, but telemarketing firms seem to be ignoring that list. Part of the problem is that the CRTC, notwithstanding some good effort on their part, is struggling to enforce the do-not-call list, in part because a lot of the telemarketers aren’t even based in Canada. But they also won’t even investigate, they’ve said, unless they get at least a complaint a day about a specific caller. That means that a lot of telemarketing firms don’t even meet the threshold to be investigated in the first place. That’s why the federal do-not-call list isn’t fully working and protecting consumers from these calls.", "Therefore, what this bill does is provide that financial disincentive that will stop telemarketing firms from calling, because they can’t make money making those calls to consumers.", "As I’ve said, this is a bill that I think will protect consumers. I’ve heard from too many who get those harassing phone calls. It’s time to stop the calls to consumers. I think this bill will do just that." ],

We do not expect the exact same access as afforded to Ontarians who live in the densely populated south, but we ask for equitable service—that is, fair access to health care services as afforded to all Ontarians through universal health care.", "A fundamental tenet of equality of access means that no person should be refused health care based on their ability to pay. But in Ontario’s north, where people must often travel hundreds of kilometres and incur significant expenses related to accessing health services, many are forced to go without medically necessary care. Between the mortgage, the hydro bill and food, there isn’t much, if anything, left over, and the program that is designed to help offset the regional disparities and associated costs of accessing health care is not fulfilling its mandate.", "Over the past few years, my constituency offices have been receiving more and more complaints about the program being too restrictive in terms of the eligible services and locations, the unrealistic accommodation allowance, and having too many application barriers, among other things. There are so many stories from my constituents that they have shared with me which underscore the need for change. I will share a few of those stories with this House in my brief time this afternoon to illustrate the importance of the changes I’m seeking today.", "Many northerners mistakenly believe that, if their doctor determines that medical care is required which isn’t available within their home community, their travel will be covered under the Northern Health Travel Grant Program, but this is not the case. Presently under the program, if northerners are referred to either Thunder Bay or Winnipeg to receive OHIP-insured care, only some services are eligible for a travel grant. Having the visit or procedure covered by OHIP is no guarantee of travel assistance.", "Recently, a hardworking single mother in Dryden who works at Walmart and who is barely making ends meet took her son to the dentist to have some dental work performed. The dentist informed her that the required work could not be performed in Dryden and that she would have to take her son to Winnipeg. She was told by her dentist that this trip would qualify them for a Northern Health Travel Grant because the care is not provided in Dryden and because the service would be performed by a specialist in a hospital.", "Despite the fact this that medically necessary, OHIP-insured service was performed in a hospital by a specialist, the travel grant was denied by the ministry because the doctor who performed the procedure is a children’s dentist and not a dental or oral surgeon. This technicality does nothing to help this mother, who is without the financial means to travel hundreds of kilometres and who is without a say on where her child is referred by the medical practitioner. The government has put this mother, who is trying to look after the health of her child, in an impossible situation where she’s trying to give her son the care that he needs but is without the financial means to incur travel-related expenses, including ground transportation, overnight accommodation and meals, to access a service that the majority of Ontarians can access locally and take for granted.", "A senior citizen in my riding who has required opiates for many years to manage severe pain caused by two separate health conditions is now experiencing resulting liver problems. Her physician referred her to the only clinic within a 1,000-kilometre radius for medical marijuana treatment that will assist her with the pain while she is weaned off opiates. The clinic, located in Thunder Bay, is a 700-kilometre return trip away, and the treatment requires a number of visits.", "Her travel claim was rejected on account of the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care not recognizing it as a designated health facility. She approached my office because her small pension does not allow her the luxury of travelling to Thunder Bay and staying in hotels on a regular basis in order to go for treatment. She told me that the government is making her choose between eating and receiving the care that her doctor has prescribed.", "In another case, a Sioux Lookout woman with diabetes and severe associated foot problems was sent to the orthopaedic clinic at the Health Sciences Centre in Winnipeg to see her doctor, who specializes in foot care, for frequent and ongoing treatments. Although this physician operates in a hospital and only treats patients with diabetes-related foot issues, the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care does not recognize him as a specialist and has consequently denied this woman’s travel grant claims. She still has to make several more trips but does not have the money to go. If she doesn’t go, she will lose at least one foot.", "These technicalities are arbitrary, wrong and not consistent with universal health care. It’s abhorrent that people should be put in a position where they may have to go without medical treatment because they cannot afford to travel to their medical appointments. It also does not make sense and, in fact, I dare say that it’s even cruel that the government would refuse to defray the relatively minimal cost associated with medically necessary travel for early treatment, but would fully fund the significantly more expensive and catastrophic resulting amputation—a consequence of non-treatment. It becomes unconscionable when one considers the statistics around amputations, which reveal terrible patient health outcomes and which precede either another amputation or death within five years of the first amputation.", "For northerners whose OHIP-insured care is performed by a specialist in a hospital setting, there is still the issue of restricted service locations. Presently patients are only eligible for grants if the procedures are performed in Ontario or by the nearest medical specialist in Manitoba, often located in Winnipeg. But with long wait times for some procedures in Winnipeg, patients have turned to smaller nearby centres for faster care.", "Such is the case for a gentleman in Kenora who required shoulder surgery following a motor vehicle accident. In this particular case, the wait in Winnipeg was significantly longer than the waits in both Thunder Bay and Winkler, Manitoba. Being that Kenora is located significantly closer to Winkler, which amounts to a day trip, rather than Thunder Bay, which is further away by about 300 kilometres, round-trip, and would have required an overnight stay in a hotel, the gentleman had the procedure performed in Winkler.", "This saved the government the mileage of about 1,500 kilometres as well as $470 in overnight accommodations for the five trips that were required for his treatment. But rather than look at the bigger picture of the improved patient outcome of accessing the surgery faster and of saving money on mileage and accommodation costs for each of the five trips, the government penalized this gentleman for accessing care in a community that is closer than the nearest Ontario location and refused to compensate his mileage for the modest distance increase between Winnipeg and Winkler. The increase in the cost of the travel grant is insignificant for the government, but it makes a big impact on this senior’s personal finances.", "Another travel grant claim was denied to a northern patient who had a double mastectomy with a male chest reconstruction as part of gender reassignment surgery. It appears that in this case, the travel grant was denied on the basis that the procedure was performed in a location other than Ontario or Manitoba, despite Montreal having the nearest specialist clinic.", "The Northern Health Travel Grant Program should allow northerners to have access to more out-of-province facilities so that patients have the option to access grant-eligible services in locations closer to their place of residence or for the purpose of accessing OHIP-insured services that are not offered or available in Ontario.", "In terms of accommodation compensation, while the Liberals recently made changes in the 2017 budget to allow compensation of more than one night, the accommodation rate remains unrealistically low at $100. A person is hard-pressed to find a place to stay in larger centres where patients are often referred, such as Winnipeg or Toronto, for $100 a night. I understand that the intent of this program is to help defray the costs associated with travel to medical appointments, but there are so many other costly out-of-pocket expenditures, like food and other medical or personal expenses, that to not compensate patients for realistic accommodation costs is doubly punitive. It is for this reason that I believe the maximum eligible accommodation rate should be set at the average nightly cost per community and should be recalculated on an annual basis.", "In order for the Northern Health Travel Grant Program to be effective, it needs to be easier to access. There are many rules that are outdated or needlessly cumbersome which result in barriers to access, such as only allowing one travel grant application per envelope or the complete rejection of an application based on one missed check box. When a check box is overlooked, the entire travel grant is returned by mail to the applicant, and the original grant must be altered and mailed back to Sudbury. Presently, minor revisions cannot be made by electronic means such as by fax or email, resulting in delays of months for a single travel grant.", "Other rules, such as only allowing a single travel grant application per envelope, seem needlessly bureaucratic. While the processing times have decreased over the past few years and grants can be approved in as short as six to eight weeks, it can also take as long as six months. Approvals can take a very long time to process, and as I mentioned, even if there’s a very small clerical error—sometimes that’s not even a mistake on the part of the patient; sometimes specialists who are going through these things are going through them so quickly that they just overlook it—patients who have to go back and forth for a number of treatments can be left without the money to continue on to pursue their treatment.", "Before I close, I’d be remiss if I did not pay tribute to the former member of provincial Parliament for Port Arthur, New Democrat Jim Foulds, for his vision and tenacity. This program has been instrumental in increasing northerners’ access to medically necessary care since it was created in 1985. We would not be here discussing these modest reforms if it had not been for his work. On behalf of all northerners, I thank him.", "I tried as best as I could to relay to this House the real hardships my constituents face when accessing health care in the north, but I was only allotted so much time. I hope these stories, all taken from recent experiences relayed to my office over the past couple of months, have helped the other members of this House to understand the need for the specific reforms I’ve presented today.", "The Northern Health Travel Grant program is intended to defray the costs northerners incur when accessing OHIP-insured health care services that Ontarians in other parts of the province do not have to spend when accessing care. The program serves as a lifeline to many northerners, making the effective coverage and implementation of this program key to ensuring that all Ontarians, regardless of postal code, have equitable access to health care." ],

We have to be very careful to ensure that we invest the money in a way that is going to be most effective.", "When I hear some of the stories mentioned by the member from Kenora–Rainy River—and I hope that as they’ve come forward, I’m sure she has brought them forward to the ministry. Some of those things that you hear are not the intent of what the northern travel grant means, I believe. I’m sure the member has done that. I know in the last budget that we increased from about $44 million to $54 million the money for the northern travel grants. That’s a significant increase of about 20%. I think that will go a long way to addressing some of the issues the member opposite has raised.", "I think this budget, from a health care perspective, was an exceptionally strong budget. We had measures mentioned earlier today about extra investments in operating funds for hospitals. What that meant for northern hospitals is about $30 million additionally in this year. There’s also an extra $9 billion over the next 10 years invested in health care capital. That makes $20 billion over the next 10 years. That’s another historic investment.", "Another thing I think that is critical—and actually the most critical thing in the budget—is OHIP+. That’s pharmacare for children and youth. If you’re under 25 after January 1 and you go to the pharmacist with a prescription, all you need is your OHIP card and you’ll leave—no deductible, no copayment. I think this is going to be exceptionally important for Ontario families. It’s going to reduce the burden and ensure that children and youth have access to those medications.", "I don’t think we can stop there, and I don’t think any of us thinks we can. We need to have a partnership with the other provinces and territories and the national government, our federal government, to get to universal pharmacare. There’s no question that that is where we need to be, and that measure in this budget is critical in making sure that we get ourselves to universal pharmacare here in Canada.", "Again, I want to thank the member opposite for putting the motion forward. It’s important that all of us advocate for those needs that are in our communities, whether they be a need that we can generalize, say, or a specific need, especially a specific need for a constituent who is maybe having a difficult time connecting with the health care system in whatever way. That’s our job; that’s what we do. I want to commend the member for bringing that forward, and thank you very much for this time, Speaker." ],

I want to just share that our member from Nipissing, Vic Fedeli, from almost day one in here, has been very concerned that the Liberal government of today cut the Ontario Northlander train service, which made it exceedingly difficult for people in the north to access health care in a timely manner.", "I want to note that Gracin here, from Perth–Wellington, has been an exceptional page, as all of the pages have, and we’re going to be sad to see them go. One of the reasons we stand here and fight so much is so that they have health care in the generations to come. We worry about the debt this government is loading on to people like our great pages and how they will ever pay that back.", "But I digress, and I will go back to the bill.", "Where I serve, Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound, is certainly not anywhere close to the extremes of the Far North, but I want to tell you that there are a lot of similarities. Certainly, a number of years ago, my predecessor, Bill Murdoch, from the great riding of Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound—and others as well, but certainly Bill—tried to introduce some opportunity for us to be given the northern designation because we’re caught in the middle. We don’t get some of the other things the Far North does as far as funding, and yet we’re saddled with challenges because we’re a bit closer.", "They sought an amendment to the Northern Ontario Heritage Fund Act to designate the Bruce Peninsula, including Wiarton, as part of northern Ontario, making it eligible for extra funding. The idea was to allow these communities access to programs and funding assistance in areas of health care, which she is speaking about, and economic development and education. They argued, and rightfully so, that they shared the same northern geographic characteristics and challenges as Parry Sound–Muskoka, my good colleague Norm Miller’s riding. Lion’s Head is actually on the same latitude as Parry Sound—Parry Sound, of course, is the home of one of my hockey heroes, Bobby Orr. Namely, an aging population, declining youth opportunities and a lack of commercial and industrial assessment were some of the reasons.", "That was denied. People keep coming and asking me if we can do that and we, of course, still try, through channels here, to make that happen, but at this point it has not.", "We share some of those things of being an underserviced community. An underserviced community is where access to health care is limited, which most of the time refers to our rural and remote communities in Ontario. Certainly, the north has even more challenges than we do. Access to doctors and mental health and addiction service continues to be a struggle in Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound. As of today, some 1,500 constituents in my riding continue to go without access to a primary physician. Likewise, we’re starting to hear more alarms from the medical community over the lack of access to mental health and addiction services in Grey and Bruce.", "Dr. Susan Boron of Hanover and District Hospital has said that we’re in dire straits, while the president and CEO of the South Bruce Grey Health Centre, Paul Rosebush, has called it a crisis. The lack of mental health resources in Grey-Bruce is beginning to take its toll.", "Local hospitals in the area are not prepared to deal with suicidal teens, people diagnosed with schizophrenia and individuals who pose a threat to themselves or others. So what are they forced to do? Hanover and District Hospital has had to resort to contracting police officers, at a great cost, to watch over some of these patients, while staff struggle to find an available bed somewhere in the catchment area. Not only is it the cost but it’s the challenge. That officer knows that they’re not specially trained to help the person they’ve been called to help, and that’s challenging for the person who is in dire straits and needing that help, because they also know that police officer may not have the skills that are needed. We currently have 440 psychiatric beds in the South West LHIN—clearly not enough. The ministry has been aware of the bed capacity problem for a few years, yet beds were not added.", "I was being a little bit humorous when I spoke about the debt and the concerns, but I’m very sincere and serious. Very similar to the member from the north, every dollar that we waste, every dollar that goes to scandal, corruption and mismanagement, every dollar that we actually have to go and borrow takes away from our very valued health care services. We have to ensure that at the end of the day, we’re putting all that money to the front lines of care. We have to ensure that we are going to definitely deliver in a timely manner.", "When I see things like the travel of 100 kilometres, it brings me back again to a subject I’ve talked about here an inordinate amount of time, because I still don’t think the Liberals are listening: closing our rural schools. Kids will be on the bus, in some cases, for 60 and 80 kilometres. They’ll be on a bus for an hour and a half. It’s not good for our children. It’s not good, no matter what they say, for the education of our youth, and it certainly isn’t good for the health of our communities.", "When I look at a bill like this, I certainly try to understand and empathize with the member, because of the geography she has. A riding like Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound is still a large geographic area, with a very sparse population. What we need to do is ensure that people in those sparse-population areas have the ability to have the services that they deserve." ],

If you live anywhere in the GTHA, Hamilton, Toronto, Ottawa or any of those places, if you are unfortunate enough to get sick, there’s a hospital nearby; there’s a clinic; there are specialists.

The unfortunate reality is that the program over the years has not kept pace with what the realities are for northerners when it comes to accessing services. I’d just talk about people where I come from. If you live in Hearst and you have to get down to Timmins or Sudbury or Ottawa, depending on the referral, in every case it’s an overnight stay. And unfortunately, the amount of money that we pay for people for accommodation certainly doesn’t cover the hotel room in any of those communities when it comes to finding a hotel to be able to stay overnight to go for your MRI or whatever procedure you’ve been referred to.", "The unfortunate reality is—and the member spoke to that—as we all know, in our ridings it’s no different than anywhere else: There are a lot of people that don’t make a lot of money, and they don’t have $100 in disposable income at the end of the month to spend on anything. So if you have to go from Hearst and do an overnight in Timmins or Ottawa or Sudbury, by the time you check into your room, do a meal on the road to get there, and have a meal at suppertime, breakfast and a meal on the way back, you’re well over $200—I would say probably closer to $250—just to do that.", "We all know of people in our constituencies who can’t afford to go do the referral, so they stay home. Unfortunately what happens is that the person gets sicker and sicker and the government pays for it in the end, because they end up at L’hôpital Notre-Dame or Sensenbrenner or whatever the hospital facility is, in an acute situation, and they’re flown by air ambulance to go somewhere else to get the treatment. If they would have gotten their darn travel grant increased and the cost of accommodation covered, the person probably would have gone for the treatment that they needed, which could have prevented them from becoming more acute and then essentially costing the system far more money.", "This is a question where we’re biting off our nose to spite our face. If we don’t invest in making sure that people have the ability to access health care at the early stages of disease, we’re going to pay for it a heck of a lot more as the person gets sicker and sicker and eventually becomes acute—and in some cases dies, which is the worst sort of outcome. That we can all agree on.", "The member is trying to do what a lot of northerners have been asking for for a long time, which is to make sure that the travel grant is realistic to the reality of people when it comes to being able to travel. It’s not just a question of the mileage on the travel grant, which is helpful, but doesn’t cover the full cost of travel in some cases, because especially if you have to fly to Sudbury on Bearskin Airlines or you have to fly to Toronto or Ottawa on Porter or Air Canada, it doesn’t cover those types of costs, and in some cases that’s the only choice you’ve got. You don’t drive, and you can’t be on the bus because you’re too sick to do the 10-hour drive down to Toronto or 12-hour drive down to Ottawa, so you need to take a flight. The person says, “Well, I can’t afford that. I’m not going.”", "What we’re trying to do is to make sure that we give people the ability to have the equal amount of access that people in large centres have when it comes to accessing health care services for their medical conditions. One of the hindrances to doing that is not being able to afford to travel.", "I will support the motion on the basis of fairness for all northerners and people who live in rural Ontario." ],

I’d like to read that quote again: “People in rural communities have poorer health status and greater needs for primary health care, yet they are not as well served and have more difficulty accessing health care services than people in urban centres.”", "This is especially true for people living in northern Ontario, where they simply don’t have access to the same health care services and facilities that we often take for granted. That’s why, for many years, the Northern Health Travel Grants program has existed to help improve access. And yet, as my honourable colleague from Kenora–Rainy River points out, there are gaps in the current program. It can certainly be improved.", "There are really two elements that this motion would tackle. The first is improving access directly by, for example, allowing people to get OHIP services at an out-of-province facility if it’s located closer to home. Just a few blocks from Queen’s Park, we have many of the country’s best hospitals and specialized treatment centres. For people living in rural and remote communities, coming to these facilities would be hugely expensive, possibly involving days of travel. Expanding the travel grant to cover services not available within 100 kilometres of a person’s home would help level the playing field in this regard.", "The second area that the motion addresses is making the program more administratively efficient. I am especially supportive of the idea of putting a service standard in place for processing applications. As critic for community and social services, I have seen first-hand the grief that unpredictable wait-lists can create for families trying to get care for their loved ones. It’s a real problem in the areas of developmental services and long-term care.", "I also think the proposal to let people make small changes to their applications online is very sensible.

He said this last year, when the government tabled its Patients First Act: “Ontario is committed to a health care system that truly puts patients first. This means faster access to primary care for patients no matter where they live, and a system that will be there for generations to come.”", "I urge the government to put their words into action and join in supporting this motion." ],

I don’t think there’s anybody in this place that would argue with that—none whatsoever.", "I think our government, in the past 13 years or so, has made some huge advances, and the fact that we’re doing that—there’s an enormous amount of investment in health care, in all sectors. Let me just, for example, point out that within the 2017 budget—which, by the way, both opposition parties voted against—hospitals in northern Ontario are receiving more than $30 million. Do they need more? Do we need to invest more? Absolutely.", "I would say that I think we need to work on this together. We need to support those things. But in just the last few hours, both opposition parties voted against a budget that has huge investments in health care.", "Interjections." ],

We voted against the budgetary practices of this government. How could you support them?

In my riding, I’m over 100 kilometres from where I live to the services in Ottawa. It’s tough for people to make it those distances, especially when they are not feeling well from cancer treatments, for different things. Those services are not available anywhere but the larger centres, sometimes within those distances.", "We look at improving wait times. The Auditor General reported, after we got up here, about, in my riding, the eastern Ontario LHIN having worst wait times in the province, waiting up to three years for a long-term-care bed. When you question the CCAC, their answer is, “Well, you’ve got more than you’re supposed to have,” almost double what we should have. You think, if our wait times are the worst and we have double the facilities, somebody is doing a terrible job, or maybe the numbers aren’t right. But those are the numbers the government gives us.", "If we look at the response—this past spring, the Toronto Star had a large exposé about the condition of our hospital in Cornwall: patients waiting a day in the hallways and offices on stretchers, because there are no beds funded to go to. This is about choices. The member from Ottawa South talked about tough choices. That’s something this government can’t seem to make. When it comes to saving their own skin or making choices—$3 billion, we’re finding out now, in the gas plants. We’re talking about the fair hydro system—almost $100 billion to defer rates.", "Those are the types of decisions—if you’re going to take that money and waste it, that money should go back to health care and education. Instead of closing schools in rural areas, we should be improving our health and education. This government—as the member said, there are tough choices, but they are unable to make them. I think we’re paying for it, for sure.", "Back to the north: I’m sure the problems they’re having up there are even worse because of the distances they have. You can imagine, in this day and age, having to ask to make improvements when you talk about IT. When we look at some of the colossal failures of eHealth and SAMS, it’s little wonder they want to take on the fax machine. Sometimes, I think, for this government, that’s a huge advancement.", "We’re looking at supporting this bill and I think it’s time that we improved health care right across the province." ],

Of course, as the member from Northumberland–Quinte West has just outlined, we had $10 million added to increase the Northern Health Travel Grant that was contained in the budget that the NDP just voted against.", "I think the timing is obvious to all and interesting to all. For some reason, the member has decided that this is the appropriate time to come forward with not a private member’s bill but a motion, trying to do something and, I suppose, maybe wash away the stain of having voted against a budget that contained a $10-million increase on the very file that they’re pretending to be in favour of. It’s very big.", "On the equitable access piece, I would add a few points, just for folks to understand. This has been a huge issue for me in Thunder Bay since I was elected in 2003 in my riding of Thunder Bay–Atikokan. We have made significant progress, I would say, when it comes to our communities, in terms of providing a broader range of services in Thunder Bay that did not exist before.", "For about the last nine years in Thunder Bay, we have been providing angioplasty not only to Thunder Bay but to the region of Thunder Bay, where about 700 people every year, on average, now can receive angioplasty services in Thunder Bay. This represents thousands of people who do not have to travel to southern Ontario from points west and east of Thunder Bay; have their families with them; do not have to deal with the Northern Health Travel Grant; and get good, quality care right at home at Thunder Bay Regional Health Sciences Centre.", "Additionally, just two weeks ago, the Minister of Health was in Thunder Bay to announce and celebrate the first vascular surgeries ever performed in the history of Thunder Bay—never before. Speaker, Thunder Bay and northwestern Ontario have some of the highest rates of amputations when it comes to the entire province. The provision of vascular surgery is extremely important. We have now been providing vascular surgery out of Thunder Bay Regional Health Sciences Centre since around January or February of this year. We started with angioplasty, and we’re now providing vascular surgery.", "The big one yet to come is that this is a step in the right direction in terms of our partnership with the Peter Munk Cardiac Centre here in Toronto. Within the next two to three years in Thunder Bay, at Thunder Bay Regional Health Sciences Centre, you will be able to receive full cardiac surgery.", "You want to talk about providing equitable access? There are not too many people in Thunder Bay who are of my vintage, who could have ever contemplated at some point that we might actually be able to receive full cardiac surgery in Thunder Bay—not only serving the people of Thunder Bay, but those from Kenora and east as far as it may go. For that whole district, when it comes to equitable access, I would say that we are moving the yardsticks forward significantly.", "The Northern Health Travel Grant was in the budget—$10 million. I spoke directly to the Minister of Health and asked him if there was some capacity for him to address this.", "I take the point from the member of the official opposition: The distinctions between northern Ontario and southern Ontario are different; they’re not the same. There is a very good, justifiable position for the Northern Health Travel Grant to be maintained and enhanced in the province of Ontario." ],

I did recognize that there were some very minuscule changes that were made by this government in the most recent provincial budget.", "But we’re talking about expanding the program to cover all OHIP-insured services, not just cherry-picking a few from the tree. We’re talking about broadening the eligible services, increasing the accommodation allowance—not just having an extra night of stay, which is the only thing that was contained in that paltry budget—and also eliminating barriers to the program application.", "What I find particularly troubling is that the minister himself touched on the crux of the problem. Thunder Bay has among the highest rates of amputations in the province. This is true. I addressed that in my remarks.", "It is ludicrous that this government would sit back and watch people who have foot-related complications due to the high rates—the explosive rates—of diabetes that we have all across the north, and wait for them to fester, and underfund the Northern Health Travel Grant Program to the point where people have no choice but to get an amputation.", "If this government is truly concerned about bringing down the rates of amputations in the north, they will invest in preventive measures, like the Northern Health Travel Grant Program, and will not sit back and wait for people’s health to be on the line." ],

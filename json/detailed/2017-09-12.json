  "text" : [ "As I was saying, I just want to extend my gratitude to Ms. Sharon Vogel and Mr. Bruce Reynolds for the incredible work they have done in assisting the government in developing this very important piece of legislation. As members would know, having looked through the legislation, this is a complex area of law with a lot of nuance and intricacies, and technical expertise and know-how were very much needed. Having experts like Bruce Reynolds and Sharon Vogel on our side was extremely helpful in navigating through various different interests that exist and the technicalities around this very important issue, to the point where we are here today in the form and shape of Bill 142.", "Speaker, I would also like to welcome two members of the expert advisory group who also assisted in the development of the bill before you today. They are Tanya Litzenberger from the city of Toronto and Derek Freeman, who is a counsel and specializes in the area of construction law as well.", "Speaker, I would like to extend my thanks to all of the guests for their continued work and support in helping with this important piece of legislation. Thank you to them for taking time out of their busy days to attend the beginning of second reading debate on this important bill.", "We all know that Ontario has a strong economy, and it should come as no surprise to anyone that our construction industry is a driving force behind it. The sector is responsible for almost 7% of the province’s GDP, and it employs more than 400,000 hard-working men and women in our province, not to mention the many more people and businesses that benefit from this particular sector. The construction industry literally builds Ontario up. That’s why it’s so important that we always support the sector, so that it can continue to thrive.", "The bill before you today is the largest proposed change to Ontario’s construction industry in over 34 years. It’s a bill that, if passed, would help bring our laws up to date to reflect current industry best practices and ensure that each and every worker on a project is paid on time and in full, to support not only the thousands of people who work in this important sector but also their families.", "I would like to now take a moment to talk about how our construction sector operates.", "A construction project involves multiple projects. The best way to look at it is like a pyramid, with the owner or developer at the top entering into an agreement with one or more general contractors. Each general contractor then enters into an agreement with specific subcontractors to work on certain parts of the project, and those subcontractors hire other workers and suppliers. You can see the development of that pyramid.", "The payments flow downwards in a similar fashion. The money flows down from the owner or developer until everyone working on the project gets paid. However, when a company does not get paid for its work, it sets off a chain reaction that affects payroll and delays payments needed for trade workers, suppliers and everyone else who has worked on the project. This can have a devastating effect on not only a project or business but also on the workers themselves. This is not fair, and it is definitely not right.", "If you have ever known anyone who works in construction, you know that it can often be a tough job. It’s hard work. It’s physically and mentally demanding, and it’s exhausting. I have a ton of respect, and I know members around this House have expressed their own respect, for the women and men who work in our construction sector. Can you imagine working hard outdoors all day through all kinds of climate, and to come in at night and learn that you won’t be getting paid? How do you pay your bills? What do you tell your family? How do you support them? Protecting Ontario families is a top priority for our government.", "Projects like these will no doubt create a lasting legacy in the province because, as we know, we are seeing construction projects all across the province. I just look at my community of Ottawa Centre, where we are building an extension to the Ottawa Heart Institute—one of the best heart institutes in the world, saving lives every day. We’re building a major expansion, with new surgical rooms. People are working day in and day out to get this expansion built.", "A new school was built in my community in Ottawa Centre, the Broadview Public School, that went up in a matter of one construction season, so that our children could be in this brand new school—from the old school, that was built in the 1920s, which was asbestos-laden and whatnot—and be able to be in a state-of-the-art facility to get an education.", "We are about to commence construction of a new pedestrian bridge over the historic Rideau Canal, which is protected by UNESCO. That project will happen in two construction sectors. It’s a beautiful bridge, which I hope you’ll come to Ottawa to visit once it’s built in 2019 as one of the Canada 150 legacy projects.", "But projects like these—and I can go on and on, and I’m sure every member in this House can talk about incredible projects that are happening, be it building public transit like the Ottawa LRT in my hometown or building hospitals or schools or community centres. All these projects happen because there are people working on them. There are many partners in these projects. The stories that we hear sometimes, that the projects stall because somebody is not getting paid or money has run out—we want to make sure these kinds of things never happen.", "So, Speaker, to make sure that this critically important industry continues to thrive, we need to make sure that our construction laws are up to date and reflect today’s realities. We need to stand up for the needs of Ontario workers and businesses. That’s why the proposed Construction Lien Amendment Act is so important, because it would modernize our construction laws to make payment and adjudication processes fairer, simpler and work better for people.", "The Construction Lien Act was created in 1983. That’s well over 30 years ago. Until recently, the Construction Lien Act has not been the subject of a major review. But a lot of things have changed since 1983, and the construction laws that worked for industry back then just are not cutting it in today’s economy. Construction projects and payment processes have become more and more complex. Late payments are becoming a pervasive problem in all sectors of the construction industry. In fact, between 2002 and 2013, the average collection period in construction has increased from about 57 days to 71 days. The increased complexity of construction projects means that resolving disputes takes more time than ever—sometimes months or even years—to work out. That means that it can sometimes be years before some people see the money owed to them for their hard work. That’s no way to do business, any business, and that’s no way to treat the people who work for them in these businesses in our communities.", "Over the past decade, we have received several proposals from stakeholders about how to change the Construction Lien Act. While everyone agreed that there were things that needed improvement in the act, it has always been difficult to reach consensus on exactly what changes needed to be made, which in large part can be attributed to the diversity of the industry. That’s why, Speaker, in 2014 our government announced that we would launch an independent review—and that’s an important part, and that’s where our good friends Ms. Vogel and Mr. Reynolds come in, in terms of conducting that independent review of the Construction Lien Act. This review would include, among other things, finding a way to address payment issues in the construction industry.", "In February 2015, we retained Bruce Reynolds and Sharon Vogel—both of whom are leading experts in construction law at Borden Ladner Gervais and are well respected across the construction industry—to lead this review. When we retained Bruce and Sharon, we made clear to them our commitment for change, our commitment to update this law that directly affects hundreds of thousands of Ontarians every day. We made it clear that everything was on the table, and we trusted in them to get this job done. Suffice it to say that we gave Bruce and Sharon a formidable task. I would like to acknowledge and thank them today for their expertise and advice during the review. Over the last a little over a year, I had the opportunity to very closely work with them, and I’m absolutely impressed by the thoroughness they have demonstrated and competency in getting this work done.", "The review they conducted was done in three separate phases over the course of almost two years. In the first phase, the reviewers developed a consultation document that identified key issues, including prompt payment, and asked stakeholders to submit their concerns. Once they received that feedback, they began extensive consultations with a broad range of stakeholders, including both the private and public sectors, architects, engineers, legal and other building professionals and the financial sector.", "Speaker, they were not short on participants. The review convened more than 30 meetings which were attended by over 60 key interest groups hosting many lively and spirited discussions, as I am told; and they also received over 70 written submissions. We are talking about very technical written submissions as to how the law should be changed.", "I myself, as the Attorney General, the minister responsible for the Construction Lien Act, individually met with over 30 different stakeholder groups once I received the final report from Ms. Vogel and Mr. Reynolds.", "Speaker, it has taken us 34 years to get to this point, and until now, no one has been able to achieve consensus on these changes—until now. This is really an incredible milestone. I think the process that was undertaken to accomplish that, in terms of the consultation and the conversations, really added to the consensus we see today in the form of Bill 142. Thanks to this work, a broad consensus was reached on the three core issues of the review: maintaining and modernizing the lien and holdback process; establishing a new system for prompt payment; and creating a targeted adjudication system to resolve disputes. After consultation with these stakeholders, Bruce and Sharon landed on a plan for a way forward.", "But before I continue, Speaker, I would like to just take a moment to personally acknowledge all of the different groups who contributed to this incredible effort. I think it’s worth mentioning them, to understand the depth of expertise that was canvassed and consulted in this entire process.", "It includes legal sector associations with construction expertise, like the construction and infrastructure section of the Ontario Bar Association, who participated in a subcommittee on the Construction Lien Act review.", "In addition, private sector organizations like Enbridge Gas Distribution Inc. provided input during the consultations.", "We also heard from municipalities and associations, including the Association of Municipalities of Ontario, the city of Toronto, the Toronto Transit Commission, Toronto Community Housing Corp., York region, and the Rural Ontario Municipal Association.", "Of course, we worked very closely with associations representing building professionals. They included the National Trade Contractors Coalition of Canada; the Association of Ontario Land Surveyors; the Ontario Dump Truck Association; Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters; the Ontario Electrical League; the Ontario General Contractors Association; the Ontario Good Roads Association; the Greater Toronto Sewer and Watermain Contractors Association; the Ontario Road Builders’ Association; the International Union of Operating Engineers, Local 793; the Ontario Sewer and Watermain Construction Association; the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 183; Toronto Electrical Industry Benefit Administrative Services; the Laborers’ International Union of North America, Local 183; the Provincial Building and Construction Trades Council of Ontario; the Canadian Institute of Quantity Surveyors; and the Metropolitan Plumbing and Heating Contractor Association.", "Speaker, you can see the level of expertise that exists in all of these organizations. We know many of these associations ourselves, as we have met with them on a regular basis. We have heard from them about the issues around the Construction Lien Act, especially around prompt payment, and many other important issues and topics that relate to our construction sector. They were all extensively involved in this review period, that took two years before we got here today.", "I would like to take the time now to read comments provided in response to the Construction Lien Act by the Carpenters’ District Council of Ontario, which represents approximately 30,000 members throughout this province.", "This is what they say: “The Carpenters are overall very pleased with the changes proposed by this bill. We believe that the proposed changes have met the government’s mandate to have the Construction Lien Act better align with the modern-day construction industry. Most importantly, the new legislation ensures the steady flow of funds down the chain to the various contractors and subcontractors—and ultimately our members’ wages—in the construction pyramid.”", "They concluded by saying that the “Carpenters welcome the changes proposed in the bill and congratulate the government on its willingness to update the province’s construction lien legislation to better serve today’s construction industry and particularly the men and women who work within it.”", "I would also like to mention several other associations who contributed valuable expertise and insight throughout this process, organizations such as Prompt Payment Ontario, Ontario Association of Architects, Ontario Association of Landscape Architects, Consulting Engineers of Ontario, Ontario Society of Professional Engineers, Association of Registered Interior Designers of Ontario, Council of Ontario Construction Associations, Canadian Construction Association, Ontario Construction Lien Masters, Ontario Construction Secretariat, Surety Association of Canada and the Advocates’ Society.", "In addition, we involved the financial sector in our discussions as well, specifically the Canada Bankers Association. I would also like to note that the residential sector provided an important perspective during the consultation process, and very thoughtful insight. We heard from the Ontario Home Builders’ Association, the Building Owners and Managers Association, the Association of Condominium Managers of Ontario, the Canadian Condominium Institute of Toronto, and the Residential Construction Council of Ontario—again, all very important partners, as we all know, within the residential development sector of the construction industry in our province.", "Moving on with acknowledgements, I think it’s really important to reference all these groups again because we know them all and because we speak with them. They have been diligently involved in this process, and I want them to know that we all collectively do hear them. When we meet with them and attend the receptions that they host at Queen’s Park, those conversations are meaningful to us. Their input is relevant to the deliberations that take place within the government and with all members. When their work and their input is reflected in the legislation that we are debating today, I think it’s important that we do acknowledge them for the work they do.", "I do want to also acknowledge the many government ministries as well as the independent agencies that provided a public sector lens to the discussion, because there is a huge public sector element to this conversation, given the billions of dollars that our government is investing in building Ontario up when it comes to our hospitals, schools, public transit and the bridges, roads and highways that are being built in our province. So I want to also thank organizations like the Ontario Public Works Association, the Canadian Council for Public-Private Partnerships, the Ontario Hospital Association, the Ontario Public Buyers Association, Infrastructure Ontario, the city of Toronto, Metrolinx, the Toronto Transit Commission and York region for their input.", "Of course, the education sector was also represented in the consultations that we did—represented by the Council of Ontario Universities, Ontario Public School Boards’ Association, Colleges Ontario and the Ontario Association of School Business Officials.", "Speaker, I wasn’t kidding when I said that this industry is diverse. You start getting a real appreciation of the work that our experts have to do in terms of engaging with all these stakeholders: not leaving anybody behind, making sure they all had an opportunity to provide input and making sure they all were consulted frequently on an ongoing basis as the expert independent review report was being developed and, once that work was done, when the legislation then was being crafted as a result of the recommendations that Ms. Vogel and Mr. Reynolds provided. It has been—and I’m not exaggerating at all, Speaker—a monumental task. It has been a very significant task.", "When I got into this file, once I was appointed the Attorney General, I started learning—and I did read the report; I mentioned that a few times. It’s a sure cure for insomnia if somebody’s having trouble sleeping; not that the report is boring, but the content is very technical. I think they know this. They were surprised that I read the whole thing. I did admit that it took me three sittings to completely read the report, but I had some good sleeps after that as well.", "The report is public; it’s on the Attorney General’s website, and I encourage members to look at it. When you read the report, you really do recognize the complexity of the subject matter. You do recognize the layers and layers of issues that had to be dealt with.", "It was impressed upon me by our expert panels and our advisory group—and I’m going to speak about them in a moment—that the entire scheme sort of hangs together, that everything is interlinked. We’ve been very mindful, as we’re going through the report and working through what recommendations to implement and how, not to do too much going through a menu and picking and choosing. There is a fragile balance that exists in the entire scheme from the beginning to the end, and there is a lot of consensus that has been built. Everybody has done a little bit of a give-and-take to get to the point. We should do our very best to respect that integrity. I think we’ve accomplished that. Again, in that whole process of taking the report and translating that into policy and then translating it into the drafting of legislation, Bruce and Sharon were really helpful in keeping that balance and keeping that intimate intricacy that exists within this legislation.", "The inside knowledge and expertise of each of these groups was invaluable to this review. Their work included identifying 90 separate issues and sub-issues in the areas of construction lien and holdback rules, prompt payment, and dispute resolution. These issues were then clearly set out in an information package that was distributed to the stakeholder community and posted online. They also distributed a survey to industry to better understand their perspective and needs, all of which helped ensure that the proposed changes worked for a wide cross-section of the construction sector. Once all of that input was received, Bruce and Sharon convened an expert advisory group that consisted of lawyers aligned with major groups in the industry who were responsible for providing insight into different stakeholder perspectives as we move forward to craft the legislation.", "Speaker, I would just like to take a moment to acknowledge the members of the advisory group, a few of whom, as mentioned, are here today. They’re an absolutely impressive group of people who know their subject area very well, who not only brought their expertise but all their respective positions in terms of different groups so that there would be that healthy tension you need to create legislation like this.", "I had the opportunity of meeting the group personally at least two times—if not three, but I think definitely two times—just to do a check-in, as the experts from the perspective of Bruce and Sharon, the other stakeholders and my ministry—my staff was working on it—just to make sure that things are on the right track and everybody feels comfortable. I always came out thoroughly impressed by the calibre of these individuals and their expertise, and the positive willingness they were bringing to the table to get this work done, fully recognizing that this is our opportunity to modernize this piece of legislation. They were committed to get that work done.", "I want to take the opportunity to thank people like—I’ll mention their names and their law firms or their organizations because it’s important: Glenn Ackerley of WeirFoulds LLP; Geza Banfai of McMillan LLP; Ray Bassett of Travelers insurance company of Canada; Glenn Clarke from Simcoe Muskoka Catholic District School Board; Marni Dicker of Infrastructure Ontario; Derek Freeman of Freeman Law Barristers; Duncan Glaholt of Glaholt LLP; Howard Krupat of DLA Piper; Tanya Litzenberger of the city of Toronto; Jeffrey Long from Koskie Minsky LLP; Bernie McGarva of Aird and Berlis LLP; Jerry Paglia from York region; Matt Ainley, who is a construction executive; and Howard Wise of Goodmans LLP. Like I said, Speaker, an impressive group of people who spent a lot of their volunteer time in this process and giving advice through this advisory experts group.", "Bruce and Sharon worked closely with the advisory group to develop a report containing concrete, workable solutions to reform Ontario’s construction legislation. We released their report, entitled Striking the Balance: Expert Review of Ontario’s Construction Lien Act, last September.", "Speaker, “balance” is absolutely the right word for this report because its recommendations carefully weigh the diversity of interests across the construction industry. Since the release of this report, I have met with 25 industry and stakeholder groups to get more feedback on the proposed changes. I was really pleased with the thoughtful input we received.", "As we moved forward drafting the legislation, we also continued to work closely with Mr. Reynolds and Ms. Vogel and the expert advisory group of industry professionals. I found it quite heartening how well we all worked together—government and industry—to find common ground among many competing interests. By keeping the dialogue going, it helped us to ensure that the changes we are proposing today are practical, workable and address people’s needs.", "For the most part, all of the stakeholders expressed their support for the review process, the report and its recommendations. I am proud to be introducing changes today that not only have their full support but reflect a wide spectrum of input across the industry.", "Let’s get into the legislation and the different elements in the legislation. As I have mentioned, it has been a long time since the act was last updated—over 30 years now. The industry has changed considerably over this time. As a government, we need to make sure that our laws are keeping pace with that change and make sure we are supporting—not hindering—its growth. That is why it’s so important that gaps in construction laws be addressed.", "Our bill includes some key amendments which will modernize construction lien and holdback rules. The holdback process was an area that our stakeholders identified that they have had some difficulties with. We heard that most of the construction industry sees the value in maintaining a fund for liens that can be claimed, but we also heard that this can cause funds to move very slowly down the construction pyramid that I spoke about earlier and that there needs to be a level playing field for everyone involved in a project, no matter what their position.", "We want to ensure that holdback fees are paid out as soon as the deadline to file construction liens against a project has passed. Every person in our province should be able to plan ahead and know exactly when to expect payment for their work. These changes would give contractors and subcontractors the certainty they deserve and should expect.", "We also want to extend the timelines to file liens and start court actions from 90 days to 150 days. This would give contractors and subcontractors more time to resolve disputes out of court and avoid additional legal fees.", "Our new proposed legislation would also require surety bonds to be posted on public projects above a certain dollar amount. These bonds are currently used in both public and private projects, but there is no legislation that mandates contractors to post them. By posting mandatory surety bonds, subcontractors and suppliers would be protected and paid in case of a project’s insolvency. In addition, specific bookkeeping requirements would be set out to better protect subcontractors if a contractor becomes insolvent and cannot pay its debts.", "We want to keep any actions as simple and cost-effective as possible, so our bill proposes that construction lien claims under $25,000 could be referred to Small Claims Court. This will go a long way in allowing a claim to be resolved quickly and with minimal cost involved.", "Our final proposal to modernize the act includes changing its name to the Construction Act, which would more accurately reflect the range of items addressed in the proposed legislation.", "Let me now speak about the prompt payment regime, an area that is probably well known to members and an area that was championed by a colleague, the MPP for Vaughan, the Minister of Transportation, who, before being in cabinet, also brought a private member’s bill and has been quite a champion of having a prompt payment regime in our province. I want to thank the member for Vaughan for his advocacy on this issue.", "Late payment is one of the most urgent and pressing issues facing the construction industry today. When a company does not get paid for its work, it sets off a chain reaction that affects its own payroll and the payments it needs to make to others. As I mentioned earlier, this can be devastating for workers, for businesses, for the entire project. This is actually a problem seen around the world.", "In recent years, a number of jurisdictions have introduced legislation to address late payment in the construction industry, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and Malaysia. If Ontario wants to be competitive on the global stage, it’s time we stepped up, which is exactly what we are doing through Bill 142.", "Under the proposed legislation, the deadline for making a payment would be triggered by the first submission of a proper invoice. Under our proposal, the proper invoice would clearly state information like the amount owing and the payment terms, and invoices would be submitted monthly, unless the parties set out an alternate arrangement in their contract.", "These changes would require both parties to negotiate and set out details before work has begun. This may even help to avoid some disputes in the future. If they do not agree on payment timelines, both parties will have to follow the timeline for payments set out in the legislation.", "For instance, once an invoice is submitted to the subcontractor, the owner would be required to pay the contractor within 28 days. That contractor must then pay his subcontractors within seven days of receiving that payment, and these subcontractors need to pay their subcontractors within seven days as well. Payments then flow down the construction pyramid in a reliable manner to workers on a construction project.", "This will help to ensure that funds are not held back at the top and that everyone is paid in a timely manner. Knowing exactly when to expect payment allows contractors and suppliers to run their businesses more effectively, make more competitive bids and meet their financial responsibilities in a timely fashion.", "In the event that an owner or a contractor fails to make a payment, mandatory interest would be added onto the amount owed. Owners would be able to dispute an invoice by notifying the contractor within 14 days of any amounts that will be withheld from payment. If the parties do not reach an agreement at that point, the contractor could refer the case to a new construction dispute interim adjudication system.", "Speaker, I would now like to take a moment to read a press release from Prompt Payment Ontario from May 31, 2017. I do this because Prompt Payment Ontario was a coalition of members from the construction industry that came together to urge the government, to encourage the government, to have a prompt-payment regime in the province.", "On May 31, when we tabled this legislation, this press release was issued by Prompt Payment Ontario. The heading of that press release was “Prompt Payment Ontario Congratulates Government on Introduction of Prompt Payment Legislation.”", "It goes on to say, “Today, members of Prompt Payment Ontario (PPO) congratulate the Ontario government on the introduction of prompt payment legislation in Ontario. The introduction of prompt payment legislation is a groundbreaking step in the right direction and will help to protect over 400,000 workers across the province. Ontario is the first province in Canada to introduce prompt payment legislation—leading the way for other provinces across the country and the federal government to do the same.", "“Delinquent prompt payment has been an issue in Ontario for too long and has various negative consequences on our entire economy. Rampant delinquent payment drives up the cost of construction as contractors have to factor the risk of delinquent payments into their bids and taxpayers are increasingly burdened by the rising costs for important infrastructure projects that are a key to the province’s future economic success. Prompt payment legislation will help our economy thrive and help our ever-growing number of new infrastructure projects move ahead in a timely and efficient manner.", "“‘We are happy to see that the government is doing the right thing, to solve this problem.’” That was said by Ron Johnson, the director of Prompt Payment Ontario, who then went on to say, “‘Prompt Payment Ontario, and our wide-reaching membership, are hopeful that the government will stay true to their commitment and pass this important legislation in the fall of 2017.’” Here we are, Speaker, in the late summer of 2017, debating this bill, with the hope of being able to pass this important bill in the fall.", "I wanted to read that because I think, from Prompt Payment Ontario’s perspective, which is an important organization focused on this issue, they really summarized the issue and the impact on workers and our economy quite succinctly, and also to highlight that they have had the chance to be part of these consultations. They’ve had the chance to review the legislation and are supportive of what has been put forward. I think it’s very important to hear from a group of people who have been advocating to have a prompt payment system in our province, not to mention that they highlighted the fact that we are the first province or jurisdiction in Canada do so, encouraging other jurisdictions, including the federal government, to follow Ontario’s lead in bringing a prompt payment system to the province.", "I have had conversations with the federal government—I won’t bore you with those—to see that other jurisdictions are starting to get interested to see what Ontario is doing. I have heard from our reviewers and experts as well that other provinces are watching Ontario with the work that we are doing with modernizing our Construction Lien Act to see the opportunities for them to follow suit. They are most welcome to cut and paste if they wish to, if it works for their jurisdiction.", "Speaker, PPO also thanked Bruce Reynolds and Sharon Vogel for their work in tirelessly undertaking both the Construction Lien Act review report and ensuring that this legislation was truly reflective of the feedback received in stakeholder consultations. The members of PPO, as they said, are looking forward to reviewing the legislation and to working with parliamentarians in implementing prompt payment legislation in Ontario as soon as possible. They went on to say that PPO would like to thank their various members who have provided ongoing support in this endeavour. Their tireless efforts have helped to raise awareness of the ongoing issues of delinquent payment in our construction sector, and have assisted in a solution. That solution is contained within Bill 142, which is before this House—a very important element of this legislation which I know many members have spoken to me about. As I said, the member from Vaughan, in fact, brought a private member’s bill introducing this concept to our Legislature, which we were able to then build upon and present in Bill 142.", "Speaker, let me now discuss the next major part of this bill. There is a lot in it. I’m sure you’ve seen the bill. It’s fairly lengthy. Adjudication is a critical part of the prompt payment system. It is the key to speeding up the dispute resolution process. It also gives owners the ability to dispute invoices where they feel there’s a problem with the work done on a project or with the amount owed. We have seen other jurisdictions implement prompt payment systems without it and, unfortunately, they see the same delays in the court system. Those in the construction industry that have experience with litigation, particularly on large or complex projects, will understand the time and investment that are all too often involved in resolving a dispute in court. In some cases, the process just to get to trial can take up to a year.", "The new system we are proposing in Bill 142, if passed, would mark a dramatic change for the industry. In most cases, adjudication will allow these disputes to be resolved in short order, freeing up funds down the construction pyramid. This means that the parties do not have to wait for the issue to move through the court system and they can continue work on the project without delay, which I think is a significant part of this and desired by everyone within the sector. The adjudication system would examine the matter and reach a decision on the amount owed, usually in less than six weeks. If the adjudication decision is that the owner must pay and then the owner refuses to comply, the contractor would then have the right to suspend work on the contract.", "Speaker, one important aspect of the new prompt payment and adjudication scheme that I would like to point out is that it would only apply to contracts and subcontracts entered into on or after the relevant parts of the bill are proclaimed in force. As you can see, we have worked hard to make sure that everyone’s interests are covered with our proposed amendments and maintain a sense of fairness and balance.", "I would like to now touch on some of the key aspects of the proposed system. Adjudication will be conducted by private individuals who have extensive expertise in construction and specialized training in dispute resolution. A private, authorized nominating authority would be responsible for selecting and training adjudicators, as well as maintaining a list of qualified adjudicators. In a dispute, both parties would be able to select an adjudicator from this list who has the most relevant expertise for their case. Adjudicators would have broad authority to consider a dispute as quickly and effectively as possible. Their decision would be binding on the parties on an interim basis to keep the project moving. This means that either party will still have the option of taking the dispute to court or arbitration for a final determination. But if both parties are satisfied with the adjudication, then they could choose to treat the adjudicator’s decision as final.", "Combined with the proposed prompt payment system, this provides a fast and inexpensive option to resolve disputes while maintaining all the protections of the court system where needed. Adjudication is a critical part of prompt payment, but it could also be used for other disputes that parties want to see resolved by an expert quickly and easily outside of the court system.", "I would also like to note that Ontario would not be the first to try out this system. It has worked well in many other jurisdictions, so we’ve got some experience to build upon. In fact, the adjudication system has been in place in the United Kingdom for about 20 years now. Adjudication in the UK has the respect of both the industry and the courts, and it has been a big success there, having largely replaced costly litigation on construction matters. The adjudication process has been adopted in other common law jurisdictions, including Ireland, New Zealand, parts of Australia, and Singapore, where it has experienced similar success. Speaker, I have full confidence that adopting the same process here in Ontario would make a big difference for the industry and those who work in it.", "Speaker, let’s talk about the next steps. As with any dramatic industry change, we anticipate that there will be adjustments and tweaks needed down the road, so it’s important that we get every aspect of this legislation right. Over the summer, we sought feedback on the bill from stakeholders across the industry. As you may recall, we tabled this before the end of the spring sitting, so summer was available to all stakeholders to actually review the legislation, as drafted and tabled in the House, and an opportunity to give us feedback over the summer months on the actual wording of the legislation. We received a number of submissions telling us what worked for them and what did not. Speaker, our government is working alongside Bruce Reynolds and Sharon Vogel and the advisory group to address these concerns. That work is ongoing.", "I am proud of the level of input, collaboration and interest we have had from industry each step of the way. It really speaks to the importance of the changes we are proposing. As this bill progresses through the committee stage, we will be looking for continuous suggestions and ideas from our stakeholders to identify areas for improvement.", "This bill contains significant changes for Ontario’s construction industry. Not only is it important for the Legislature to get this legislation right; it is also important for the industry itself to be properly prepared for the changes that may come as a result of this bill. I have heard from the industry that it will need time to become familiar with the new rules and make the necessary adjustments to its practices. The industry will also need certainty as to how the new rules apply and advance notice as to when the new rules will come into effect. So the transition period is extremely important, from the time of passage of the bill and its implementation and then all of the regulations that have to be developed. As we know, construction projects are ongoing and we need to be able to transition properly.", "I want to say again that this legislation is groundbreaking. It’s important, and we have worked very hard and are continuing to work hard to make sure it reflects the needs of the industry.", "Again, if the bill is passed I would like to assure the industry that they will have time to prepare for these changes. This government is committed to providing appropriate advance notice before any of the proposed changes are brought into effect so that there will be no surprises for anyone. Should this bill pass, I look forward to seeing the impact that it makes on the thousands of people and families in Ontario that are supported by this very important sector.", "Speaker, the bill before you today is the biggest proposed change to Ontario’s construction industry in over three decades, and it marks the first-ever consensus we have reached with industry stakeholders on issues including modernizing lien and holdback rules, prompt payment and adjudication. But the bottom line is this: We need to bring our laws up to date to support the thousands of workers in this important sector and their families. It really comes down to that.", "The changes we are proposing will impact everyone involved in the construction industry. From the companies that are involved in large, multi-million-dollar construction projects to the families doing small-scale renovations of their homes, we kept their interests top of mind as we carefully consulted with people across the sector.", "I would like to provide one final quote at this time from the International Union of Operating Engineers, better known as Local 793, which represents more than 14,500 members across all sectors of the construction and industrial industry in Ontario. They had this to say about this legislation:", "“As a whole, Local 793 is very pleased with the legislation as currently drafted. Your decision to appoint special advisers and have them engage in an open and transparent process of consultation that allowed all stakeholders the opportunity to participate, comment and review the amendments has resulted in a significant achievement that we believe addresses the many interests at stake.", "“From Local 793’s perspective, many of the changes being tabled will directly assist some of the most vulnerable groups in the construction pyramid, namely those that reside at or near the bottom of the pyramid. This includes many hardworking individuals and companies that live, work and vote in Ontario, of which many are members of Local 793.”", "It’s clear when you hear from all the partners in the construction sector—from owner-contractors all the way down to trades and sub-trades—that there is a very healthy respect for the entire pyramid, so to speak, as referred to, or the entire chain. Everybody recognizes the important role everybody in that chain plays for a construction project to take place, big or small; obviously it’s more complex in bigger projects that we see and you and I often talk about this in the House.", "The desire to get the work done, to get the project completed and, most importantly, the need for payment for work to take place, from the top to the bottom, in a timely manner, in a prompt manner, is always being highlighted. It’s very important, because construction is done by people. It’s still a very human-resource-intensive way of doing work. That’s why it creates so many jobs, that’s why it’s 7% of GDP. Half a million Ontarians are involved in construction. It’s such an important key to our economy. I think there’s probably somebody in all of our lives who is part of the construction industry.", "Making sure that people get paid for the work they do, and that they get paid for the work they do in a prompt manner, is absolutely essential. The fact that it has taken us this long, because of—the complexity in this area of law, I think, at the end of the day, was a motivating factor to get it done. The process to get this done, in my view, has been that secret ingredient—not so secret now—for success that has resulted in us being at this point.", "I often asked this question: If everybody thinks that the legislation is outdated—and it has been 34 years since the last changes—and if everybody within the entire pyramid thinks that it is time, why is it that we have not been able to accomplish that? The answer I always got was just that we were never able to find a consensus. We never were able to land in one place where everybody said, “You know what? In the grand scheme of things, with everything being equal, I’m comfortable with this.” Those divergent interests always got in the way.", "What became clear was that we needed a process—a process, perhaps, that was independent of the government’s traditional policy-making process—to get to that point, for two very important reasons. One was the expertise needed in the subject matter area, because it is very unique. It’s a niche area which requires technical know-how and expertise, both from the perspective of how the construction sector works and operates, and all the nuances in it from a business practices point of view, but also legal know-how in terms of how things are done here in Ontario, and then, of course, taking that to experiences around other jurisdictions.", "Another reason why this file had not moved for such a long period of time was that you needed experts who could bring people together, to bring all that knowledge into one place.", "We were successful in doing that. I’m not taking the credit for that success, that somehow we knew it was going to work that way. Thought went into having an independent process. But I think that the people we got—people who brought their expertise, people like Bruce Reynolds and Sharon Vogel—they made it into a success. They were able to not only bring their expertise but also their relationships into this process, by bringing people together who they knew were important in the sector and who trusted them to be honest brokers—people who are good people, who know the industry well and who are doing the work to improve the law. They are independent from the government, so they’re not doing anybody’s bidding, as the case tends to be in our system—which I’m not criticizing. It exists for good reason, that healthy tension. They were able to separate the traditional government policy-making function, on an independent level, from the expertise they brought and all the different parties’ points of view, and then, very methodically and meticulously, work through the different phases in gathering the different points of view, and seeing where the points of consensus were and the points of discord and then bridging that gap, to the point that they were able to give us an independent report, upon which we made a commitment that we would run with this report and then continue to work with them to make it happen.", "It’s interesting, Speaker. When I received the report and I finally read it, as I mentioned earlier—of course, I met with Bruce and Sharon, to make their acquaintance and work with them, but then I asked them if we could convene that expert advisory group to come together. The advice I got from every single person around that table—and, by the way, I thought they paid them to say that, but they assured me they did not—was to keep these two people on board as the government works through the report, because—and I will say this because it was said to me—there was a certain magic that was developed in that whole process. The word “magic” was used, and we don’t want to lose that magic.", "I made an undertaking and a commitment to the panel that will not only keep Sharon and Bruce engaged in the process from report to policy development to legislation drafting, but also the expert panel as well and their expertise, because they were bringing perspectives from different people. They were making sure that not just one perspective is being heard but all the perspectives are being heard. It was a very interesting process for us to get to the point.", "Of course, nothing is perfect in life, and I’m sure everybody would want something a little bit different here or there. I don’t think anybody expected where we’d be. In fact, one of the questions posed to me again and again was, “Are you really sure that you will table this legislation in the spring?” I think there were doubters out there who thought that we would not get to the point where we would be able to table the legislation or have it debated in the House.", "I am really excited and thrilled that here we are, the second day into the fall sitting. We are debating Bill 142. We have started the second reading debate. I know that there is a lot of interest on behalf of all three political parties and all the members on this piece of legislation. Everybody is anxious to get this second reading debate done so the bill can get to the committee.", "I think the committee process on this bill is very important so that we can hear from people like Bruce and Sharon directly. I’m sure they will be able to give us a lot of answers. I caution you: There are no short answers. They know this area inside out. You will be impressed by their expertise, but also with other members of the expert panels and other stakeholders that I mentioned in my remarks earlier.", "I think it’s important that we get to the committee as soon as possible on this bill so that we can bring the outside voices who have been part of this process for the last two or so years and even longer and get their counsel directly so that we can make the tweaks of the amendments that we need to do—there’s always some of that in the committee process; it’s an important part of the process because it’s such a technical piece of legislation—and on for third reading. The sooner we can pass it, the sooner we can work on the regulations and the transition phase. As I committed, we will make sure that we give ample notice to everyone as to when certain parts of the legislation will get implemented.", "This is one big important step that we are here for today. There are a lot of important steps to come, but we need to make sure we can get it through this House. I very much look forward to working with all the members and again thank our friends for being here and for the work they have done. If we could give them a big round of applause for the work they’ve done, I’d really appreciate it." ],

They built the Herb Gray Parkway in my riding, and it came to light that the large international company that was put in charge of the build had actually allowed the installation of faulty girders. This is a very dangerous situation. They could have failed and people could have died. The local people in Windsor were alerting them to this fact.", "When the multinational company finally decided to do something about it, what they did was they took their toys and went home. By that, I mean they took off out of town and left all the subcontractors without payment. We had long-standing, very reputable companies in Windsor that were looking at going out of business because they had put so much money into the build of the Herb Gray Parkway but never got paid by this multinational company.", "Rather than the government owning up to the mistake and saying, “You know what? We’re going to try and do something to stop this from happening ever again,” they went on to award that multinational more government jobs after they left people in this province without payment.", "I think this is something that we see historically, so it’s nice to see that the government is now trying to do something around prompt payment. There’s still a lot of work that needs to be done as far as taking care of workers in this province. Frankly, all we have to look at is today, where Sears Canada is going to court to try to dissolve their obligation to pay their workers’ pensions while taking care of the CEOs and the people at the top. This Liberal government has done nothing to protect those workers or other workers in this province." ],

It is something that we sometimes don’t think enough about, because these construction projects are very complex, whether you do a small construction project around your home or whether you do a massive construction project which takes place in my riding.

  "text" : [ "Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I’ll be sharing my time with the Minister of Labour.", "I’m very proud to rise for the second reading of Bill 148. As the Minister of Housing and minister responsible for the Poverty Reduction Strategy, but also as the former parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Labour, I know why these reforms are so badly needed. I’ve personally heard the stories of people who are anxious about their future and their children’s future. They told me and my colleagues about how they feel they can’t get ahead. Well, I’m confident that the changes our government is bringing forward will bring fairness and opportunity to working people right across the province of Ontario.", "Our proposed legislation comes at a time when Ontario’s economy is outperforming any other province in Canada. Over the last three years, Ontario’s real GDP growth has outpaced all of our G7 competitors. Unemployment is at its lowest point in years, while employment is forecast to increase over the next few years. Exports and business investments are also increasing, and household incomes are rising. We’re in the midst of the largest infrastructure investment program in our province’s history.", "All of this is encouraging, but the truth is that some in this province are still struggling to make ends meet. While our businesses are expanding and creating wealth, not everyone is feeling that prosperity. We all know that the world we live in today is very different from the world of yesterday, and so are our workplaces. Over the past several years, worldwide trends and those unique to Ontario have changed the way in which our workplaces operate.", "We are seeing accelerated advances in technology giving rise to new products, services and whole new industries. This is the so-called sharing economy. We’re seeing the rising prominence of the service sector and the shift away from manufacturing—again, changing the employment landscape for many of our employees. We’re seeing increased globalization and trade liberalization, which, among other things, put pressure on employers to reduce costs and to boost productivity and innovation.", "We’re also seeing a change in demographics in the province as baby boomers retire and new Canadians come into the workforce. How we respond to these changes will play a key role in determining how well we protect employees while encouraging more economic activity. In a time like this, with the very nature of workplaces rapidly changing, we need to make sure that our most vulnerable employees are protected and treated fairly.", "Two years ago, our government appointed two special advisers to oversee broad public consultations with Ontarians, to consider how our labour and employment laws could be amended to address these changes in the workplace. The Changing Workplaces Review’s special advisers heard from hundreds of employers and employees across our province. The special advisers heard that some of the current employment standards rules create “a great deal of uncertainty, anxiety and stress, which undermines the quality of life and the physical well-being of a wide swath of workers in our society.” Mr. Speaker, that’s why I stand before all of you today to talk about why this bill is so important. Let me start by outlining some of the proposed major changes that would benefit Ontarians.", "Our government is proposing to increase the general minimum wage to $15 an hour by January 1, 2019. The reality is that one out of 10 workers in our province earns the current minimum wage of $11.40. Meanwhile, three out of 10 workers earn less than $15 an hour. This includes millions of people, many of whom are supporting a family, making car payments, trying to save for an education and paying their daily bills. They work very hard every day to try to get ahead, but they feel they’ve been left behind. Increasing the minimum wage will make a real difference in their lives.", "If passed, the increase would be phased in over the next 18 months, rising to $14 on New Year’s Day, 2018, and to $15 on January 1, 2019.", "The special minimum wage rates for liquor servers who regularly receive tips or gratuities; students under 18; hunting and fishing guides; and homeworkers would increase by the same percentage as the general minimum wage.", "After that, the minimum wage would once again rise annually with inflation, just as it does now.", "Mr. Speaker, we hear stories every day about people who are struggling to get by. You hear about the mother making the current minimum wage who has to work the overnight shift on call, to support her two children. After paying for food, rent and babysitting, there is nothing left over. You hear about the restaurant worker who would like to go back to school but is now working two jobs just to put a roof over her head. You hear about the worker who works minimum wage but still has to use grocery vouchers so that she can put food on her family’s table.", "So I ask, Mr. Speaker, who is helping people like her, like all of these people? This legislation, if passed, would help people like them, giving those who work hard a chance to get ahead.", "The second part of our plan is to ensure that workers, including part-time workers and, importantly, temporary workers, receive equal pay for equal work.", "There are still workplaces in this province that pay some people less for doing exactly the same job as others do. Paying people the same wage for doing the same work is the essential definition of fairness. The proposed amendments would, if passed, enable employees to request a review of their rate of pay if they believe that they are not receiving equal wages to other employees.", "Differences in the rate of pay for employees performing the same work would be permitted in limited circumstances, including if the difference is based on a seniority or merit system.", "Mr. Speaker, the legislation, if passed, would also help ensure that temporary help agency employees are paid equally to employees of the agency’s clients when performing the same kind of work.", "These changes would also protect the employees from reprisal for inquiring about their wage rate or asking another employee about their wage rate.", "Another area that this proposed legislation addresses is the scheduling of work. Some workers have little or no control over the hours that they work, with many of them receiving their schedules with little advance notice. Last-minute changes or cancellations are often made, which creates further uncertainty. Imagine being a student who set your work schedule around your class schedule, only to have it changed at the last moment; or a single mom who worked her babysitting and child care around her work schedule, only to have it changed at the last minute. We have reports about this happening all over the province.", "What studies have shown is that such uncertainty can lead to greater work-family conflict and stress, not to mention adverse health effects. Uncertainty over scheduling can also make it hard for employees to find the proper child care, to further their education, or to have a second job. It can also be hard for employees to arrange for transportation to and from work.", "At the same time, we understand that in some sectors, there needs to be flexibility in scheduling. That’s why we are proposing to establish fairer rules for scheduling that give greater certainty to workers while maintaining predictability and flexibility for employers.", "Generally speaking, an employer would now be required to pay three hours at the regular rate of pay if they cancel a shift with less than 48 hours’ notice. Employees would also have the right to request schedule or location changes after having been employed for three months, without fear of reprisal.", "Employees who regularly work more than three hours per day but upon reporting to work are given less than three hours must be paid three hours at the regular rate of pay.", "Employees could refuse to accept shifts, without repercussion, if their employer asks them to work with less than four days’ notice.", "When employees are on call and not called into work, or are called into work for less than three hours, they must be paid three hours at their regular rate of pay. This would be required for each 24-hour period that employees are on call.", "These proposed changes, if passed, would give employees more certainty while giving businesses predictability over shift scheduling. I have no doubt that this would lead to healthier and more productive employees.", "Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, there are often times in life when we must deal with hard realities such as the illness of a family member. Imagine dealing with these tough personal crises and worrying about losing your job. That’s why this legislation, if passed, would also ensure that employees have the right to take up to 10 days of personal emergency leave a year, two of them paid, if the employee has been employed for at least a week. Currently, personal emergency leave applies only in workplaces with 50 or more employees. If passed, this provision would apply to all workplaces and would help more employees protect their own health or care for their family members while protecting their job.", "The proposed legislation would also prohibit employers from requesting a sick note from an employee taking personal emergency leave. When you’re sick with a cold or flu, you should be at home recuperating. The last thing you need to be doing when you’re feeling sick is trying to get a note from the doctor’s office. In fact, the Ontario Medical Association has called for an end to sick notes for quite some time. We have listened.", "We’re also proposing to increase family medical leave to up to 27 weeks in a 52-week period. Family medical leave allows employees to care for certain family members who have a serious medical condition and are at risk of dying. The leave allows them to care for and support their loved ones without worrying about whether they would still have a job when they get back. It’s just the right thing to do. When loved ones are in a serious condition, it’s only right that we’re able to spend time with them, as we never know how much time they have left.", "Another circumstance that everyone hopes would never occur, but unfortunately sometimes does, is being addressed in this proposed legislation. This bill, if passed, would create a new, separate leave for someone who has suffered the terrible tragedy of losing a child. We’re proposing a leave for child death from any cause of a period of up to 104 weeks. The proposed amendments would also establish a separate leave for crime-related child disappearance for a period of up to 104 weeks. An employee would have to be employed for at least six consecutive months to be entitled to these leaves.", "Again, this is simply the right thing to do. As a father, I can’t imagine going through that circumstance, and I would certainly want to know that when anyone loses a child and they need time to heal, they would be given appropriate time to heal. To provide unpaid job-protected leave for employees while they mourn is the humane thing to do.", "When one of our sons or daughters goes missing in relation to a crime, we need to direct our attention to what matters most, which is finding our child again. The last thing somebody would need to worry about is whether they would have a job to come back to.", "Ontarians work very hard every day and are a testament to why our province has some of the best and most productive workplaces in the country. We also know how important it is to have some time off from work to spend time with loved ones and friends, to rest and relax. We all need time to rejuvenate and enjoy the fruits of our labour.", "Ontario already currently provides nine public holidays, and presently, employees are entitled to two weeks of vacation time with pay. The proposed legislation, if passed, would ensure that employees are entitled to three weeks of paid vacation after five years of service with the same employer. The proposed changes would come into force on January 1, 2018. This actually will bring Ontario into line with other jurisdictions in Canada. Most other provinces and the federal level start with two weeks of paid vacation and increase it to three weeks after a period of employment. In fact, Mr. Speaker, employees in Saskatchewan start with three weeks of paid vacation and receive four weeks after a decade of employment.", "It doesn’t make good economic sense for Ontario to continue providing one of the least generous vacation entitlements in the country. These proposed changes would enable our employees to be more productive and make our workplaces more competitive and attractive in the global economy.", "We are also taking steps to make sure that workers are properly classified and not incorrectly treated as independent contractors. Under our existing legislation, if you are an employee under the Employment Standards Act, you may be entitled to employment rights such as minimum wage, overtime pay, public holidays and vacation pay. Our proposed legislation would, if passed, prohibit employers from misclassifying employees as independent contractors. This is intended to address cases where employers improperly treat their employees as if they were self-employed and not entitled to any employment standards protections. This proposal helps ensure that everyone gets the benefits they deserve.", "We’re also modernizing the rules around unionization and making changes to ensure fairness in union certification and the collective bargaining process. That includes the extension of card-based certification to three vulnerable sectors—the temporary help agency industry, the building services industry, and the home care and community services industry—as well as the extension of successor rights to the retendering of contracts in the building services industry.", "It also includes eliminating certain conditions for remedial union certification when an employer engages in misconduct, making access to first-contract arbitration easier, and adding an intensive mediation component to the first-contract arbitration process.", "Ontario has been a leader in job creation these past few years, and our economy has been growing faster than any other province in Canada. It’s the workers and businesses across this province who have worked together to make that happen. And for our part, we are working hard at attracting investments and good companies to our province. But, Mr. Speaker, just as the Premier has said, we also know that it is businesses that are the real job creators in this province, and that is why we are committed to creating an environment in which business thrives. We understand that our government’s role in building a prosperous economy is to ensure that we have a competitive tax system, a smart and dynamic business climate, modern infrastructure, and a skilled and healthy workforce.", "One of the elements employers look for when making the decision to relocate or expand their business is proximity to a well-trained workforce. So we know that in today’s economy, we have to protect our workers and to ensure that they also thrive. We must continue to protect and nurture the competitive edge we have in Ontario. The competitive edge we have in Ontario is our people. That means keeping employees safe and helping to ensure a more fair society.", "There is a direct correlation between a business’ commitment to its employees’ well-being and its ability to spearhead more innovation, establish a better reputation and build morale in the workplace. The truth is that supporting workers is good for business. It’s good for the bottom line, it leads to more productive workplaces, it saves time and money by avoiding lengthy workplace disputes, and it also builds the reputation of a great company.", "Many companies across Ontario have already created these fair workplaces because they know that’s good for business. We’re continuing to support them as well. It’s a top priority of this government to ensure that everyone benefits from increased economic growth.", "We will continue working with all of our partners—business, labour and others—to ensure we continue growing the economy and the province in a balanced way. That means ensuring that the most vulnerable of our workers are protected, most especially in a time of prosperity. No one should get left behind in our economy.", "As we move forward together, let us commit ourselves to fair workplaces and better jobs. Let’s continue building up our province so that we can have a brighter and better future and a stronger and more prosperous Ontario." ],

  "text" : [ "It’s a pleasure to be here today. I rise, obviously, in support of Bill 148, the Fair Workplaces, Better Jobs Act, 2017, which I hope meets with the approval of the House.", "This is an issue that has certainly consumed the Minister of Labour for the past two-plus years. I think most people will agree the reason for that is that the world of work that was around when the Employment Standards Act was last taken a serious look at—and the Labour Relations Act—was in the mid-1990s.", "When you think of the world of work in the mid-1990s—it’s almost pre-email, cellphones were large—there were all sorts of things out there in the world of work that simply don’t exist anymore. One of those things is the expectation that I certainly had as a young man—and I think a lot of people who were entering the workforce in the 1990s or the pre-1990s would have seen that the expectation was a permanent job. The expectation was a full-time job. It would have benefits. It would have a pension. You might change that job two or three times in a career.", "But the world of work has changed. The economy has changed. Globalization and other pressures have been brought to bear on the Ontario economy and those workplaces that existed in the mid-1990s have changed. But the rules haven’t. The rules we had in place are still from the 1990s.", "So we had two advisers who went out—we appointed two very experienced people in the field of employment law and labour relations, one a former judge, both very experienced lawyers, who were really well regarded by the employment community. They went out and consulted with the people in the province of Ontario and they came back to us with some findings. They came back and said, “This is what the people of Ontario said.”", "It has been a long consultation in the Changing Workplaces Review that led to what we have before us today. That’s why I’m so happy to stand for second reading of the Fair Workplaces, Better Jobs Act. I really think what we’re doing as a result of this is standing up for the most vulnerable people in our society and helping ensure fairer and much better workplaces for employers and employees alike.", "I know that not everybody agrees with this bill—and that’s the beauty of the Legislature, we all get to air our views on this. Certainly the opposition parties have let us know how they feel about this bill in its current form. And there’s some support, I understand, at committee, and some would not support it. I think the Leader of the Opposition has stated very, very clearly that he would rather we not raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour this way. He doesn’t believe that part-time workers should be paid the same as full-time workers, he doesn’t believe that all workers should get paid sick days, and he doesn’t believe that workers should get suitable notification when their own schedule changes at work. He has clearly signalled that at this point in time he plans to vote against that, and that’s fine and we understand that.", "Let’s be clear about what that approach would mean. It means more people would live in poverty, more families will continue to struggle to put food on the table and shoes on the kids’ feet. It would stagnate the Ontario economy for years to come.", "What we have in front of us and what’s before the House right now, we believe, is a path forward that’s going to protect workers in a way that also supports business in Ontario. We don’t believe, on this side of the House, that being fair and being profitable are mutually exclusive. We believe that the two things can coexist.", "We recognize that, in the nature of work, just maintaining the status quo from the 1990s simply isn’t good enough in 2017-18 in the province of Ontario. It has been 17 years since we did a comprehensive review of the Employment Standards Act. It’s even further back for the Labour Relations Act—more than two decades since its last review, and as I outlined earlier, a whole lot has changed since then. There has been a shift, I think, to the service and retail industries. Technology has changed the nature of that work and the skills that are needed to do the jobs that simply didn’t exist in the 1990s.", "As a result of these societal changes, what we’ve seen is an increase in non-standard employment. This has led, we think, to some employees being left behind in what is clearly a growing economy and a very successful economy. The issue has become a centrepiece issue of vulnerable and precarious work. Some employees find themselves continuously in temporary jobs, part-time jobs or always looking for that stable job.", "I was talking earlier about my expectations as a young person entering the workforce. What young people entering the workforce today are often confronted with is temporary work, part-time work, seasonal work, contract work. They attempt to leave home and get started on their own. The contract runs out, the rent money runs out, and they’re back at home again. It’s one of those things.", "We often used to equate the minimum wage as a student wage. I think, for the most part, Ontarians agree with that. It’s a learning period. It’s a probationary period. It’s a chance where you learn how to work, how to be a team player, how to show up on time, how to wear a uniform and those types of things.", "It has changed right now. More than 30% of Ontario workers were in precarious work in 2014. That’s 30% of Ontario workers earning less than $15 an hour. Of those 30%, 50% of those people were between the ages of 25 and 64—students no longer, Speaker. These are people who are trying to raise families. These are people who are trying to run a household.", "Over the past 30 years, as well, part-time work has grown to represent nearly 20% of total employment. This trend is not unique to Ontario alone. It’s not just isolated to Ontario. We’re seeing it in a lot of other jurisdictions as well, including our neighbours south of the border. Many people now have to work several jobs or work on contract or in unstable positions with unreliable hours of pay.", "There’s not just a moral imperative to do something here; there’s an economic imperative to protect some of the most vulnerable employees in the province of Ontario. We believe, on this side of the House, that if you protect all Ontarians, you create opportunities for everybody and our economy will grow stronger.", "I think if we work together on this—and I mean the parties in the House and, obviously, business, labour and all those people who are a partner in a healthy economy—we can give families hope and confidence about the future and we can build a just society where everybody has a chance to get ahead. That’s exactly what’s behind the legislation, and, if it’s passed, that’s exactly what it would accomplish.", "What the bill reflects—along with the amendments, we made the unusual move of sending it out after first reading so that Ontarians could have a say in this. Normally, bills go out after second reading. The committee has looked at it. Some people from all sides of the House—and I thank them for that—gave some of their free time in the summer—perhaps that otherwise they would have spent with their families—to travel the province of Ontario and to talk to people about what their advice was on this bill, what concerns they had and what they liked about it.", "Minister Milczyn, I think, really touched upon some of the more progressive proposals that are contained in the bill. Many of these proposed amendments respond to the recommendations that came forward from the Changing Workplaces Review in the first place. That was a very extensive review. It included public consultations and heard from people from all walks of life, many of them sharing personal stories that they’ve gone through.", "The advisers met with more than 200 groups in person and received well over 300 written proposals. They talked to labour groups, obviously; they talked to large manufacturers, HR providers and physicians. They heard personal stories from people who have to work more than that one job, or two jobs often, in order to get by—those people who found themselves eternally working for what were supposed to be temporary help agencies but often in the same company; and they heard from small business owners in the province of Ontario who outlined some of the challenges that they would face.", "They heard about the effects of contract work. They heard about precarious employment and how that impacts on individuals and their families as well. They also heard from businesses. They were talking about how they needed operational flexibility. They talked about the need to manage costs.", "The two people, I think, who really should be thanked for this, Speaker, are the people who spent about two years of their lives, C. Michael Mitchell and John C. Murray, for their hard work and for the final report they delivered to us. I think they did a very good job with the consultation.", "What that consultation did for me is it solidified the idea that we all share a common vision: a future of much healthier, safer and fairer workplaces so that Ontario can remain competitive well into the 21st century, taking into account the fact that we’re now dealing with global competitiveness issues we didn’t have before, that we’ve got trade deals that didn’t exist before. A whole host of other pressures are being placed on the Ontario economy—and economies around the world. We’re not alone in this. But we know that any change must take into account the needs of employers, and we also must maintain a competitive business environment.", "So our government is focused on investing in people, in businesses, and really focused on fighting for that stronger economy and for those good-paying jobs that we want all members of our families and our neighbours to have. But from the beginning, Speaker, we’ve been very, very cognizant that this would be a big change, that this would be something that was necessary but something that was going to take the best of everybody to make sure it was accomplished. So we’re continuing to listen to those experts. We found that those experts represent a wide range of interests. There are so many parts to this; it’s a very complex issue and it impacts on all segments of our economy.", "Once again, the Standing Committee on Finance and Economic Affairs, I think, did an excellent job. They held public hearings on Bill 148. As I understand it, as they were travelling, they managed to get to 10 communities around the province of Ontario. They visited Ottawa, Niagara Falls, Windsor, Thunder Bay, so they were in every corner of the province.", "Interjection." ],

And as a government, we’ve listened. We saw what came back from those hearings, we incorporated some of the feedback into the proposed legislation and we made what I think are some very, very important changes that weren’t in the existing bill but that we introduced as a result of that.", "There are thousands of women each and every year who suffer or experience pregnancy and infant loss, and that can be from a miscarriage or that can even be from a stillbirth. Many of us have known someone who has faced such a tragic loss, and that’s often been experienced in silence and in isolation, the person thinking they didn’t have anyone to turn to, that nobody would understand what they were going through. Often that takes time. That takes time to heal, emotionally and physically, and often it’s best that during that period that somebody should not be at work. Some people can go and obviously some people cannot. Our proposed legislation now would extend pregnancy leave by an additional six weeks for someone who’s had a miscarriage or the tragedy of a stillbirth. What that does is it gives the birth parent additional time to recover from the pregnancy loss. We’re also proposing to extend the parental leave so it aligns with the new federal employment insurance benefits rules, which is something that has happened in the past. Obviously the province is the authority that grants the ability for the job-protected leave, and often it’s the federal government, through the Employment Insurance program, that funds that leave.", "We’re also proposing a new job-protected leave of absence without pay if an employee or an employee’s child has experienced domestic or sexual violence, or has been threatened with the same. When someone or their child experiences such an ordeal in their lives, they need the time to seek remedies and they need some time to help manage any trauma that may have been experienced as a result of that. When such an incident occurs, the last thing that somebody needs to worry about is whether their job is protected during that period.", "This leave would be taken for the employee to seek help for themselves or for the child. What we envision this covering is things like medical help, perhaps, for physical or for psychological injury, or maybe seeking help from a victim services organization. It could include counselling. It could be psychological counselling; it could be other professional counselling. They may have to move, Speaker. They may have to move on a temporary basis or even on a permanent basis. Also, they may need to avail themselves of help from law enforcement agencies or from the field of legal services. It could be that there are legal proceedings that follow this, as well, that are related to that domestic or to that sexual violence.", "We began this process because social and economic concerns are affecting vulnerable employees and precarious employment more than they ever have been in the past. We knew that in order for everyone to prosper, we also needed to be supportive of business in this changing economy. That’s what this legislation, if passed, would accomplish. It’s about fairness for all sides—not only for employees, but for businesses as well that play by the rules. The vast majority of employers in the province of Ontario play by the rules. They’re smart enough to know that you treat your employees well and they work well for you. It really is making sure that we honour those people who play by the rules, but it’s also about creating a level playing field where employers who obey the law aren’t undercut by those who think the laws were written for somebody else and that they don’t apply to them.", "To protect those businesses and the workers who work for those businesses, we’re taking action to step up enforcement of the Employment Standards Act, to ensure that nobody in province of Ontario is able to skirt a law that everybody else is obeying. We intend to amend a regulation under the Employment Standards Act to increase the maximum administrative monetary penalties for employers who don’t comply. The proposed changes in the bill would also allow the ministry to publish, including online, the names of individuals found to have contravened the act, the penalty they received and some information about the contravention.", "Speaker, there are instances in which some employers are found to have contravened the act and are ordered by the ministry’s employment standards officers to pay wages to their employees. These proposals would help ensure that all necessary measures are taken to ensure that even with that ruling, employees get what they are rightfully owed. When you work hard for promised wages, it’s quite understandable that you expect to receive those wages. It’s only fair.", "Along with this proposed legislation, our government is also conducting some other initiatives to support fairness at work. For example, the Ministry of Labour is planning on hiring up to 175 additional employment standards officers. What these individuals will do is investigate claims and conduct inspections in order to determine compliance with the Employment Standards Act.", "By investing in enforcement, we can get to more workplaces in the province of Ontario, and we can focus on the high-risk sectors where we know that the majority of the complaints come from. This really allows us to further increase awareness amongst those good, law-abiding employers in the province of Ontario and have them understand what it means to comply with the act and what they need to do in order to be in compliance. Because I know that the vast majority of employers in this province want to be in compliance.", "Employees deserve to be paid for the hours that they work. We expect to be paid in this House; our family members expect to be paid as well. What we need to do is continue to do all we can to ensure that those Ontarians receive the entitlements that they have earned.", "We know, as I’ve said, that the majority of businesses are law-abiding and they want to do the right thing. Many businesses in the province of Ontario in fact go far beyond and far above these proposed standards. These are minimums. These measures would help level the playing field for those good businesses. These initiatives, along with our proposed legislation, would really make a positive difference in the lives of hard-working Ontarians.", "Speaker, a lot of us define ourselves by the work we do. Most people these days spend more time with their co-workers each day than they do with their very own families. So we need to ensure that people’s experience at work is a beneficial one.", "The workplace environment is changing at an unprecedented rate as our businesses compete in a global economy that brings with it new challenges on an almost daily basis. When we first started this process almost three years ago, I thought I would hear from lawyers, perhaps from heads of corporations and labour leaders. And that was true. But the issues we’re addressing with the Changing Workplaces Review and with Bill 148 are also the issues that very ordinary people talk about when they’re sitting around the kitchen table.", "As parents, what we want to ensure and what we want to believe is that our children will be better off than we are. It’s the way it has been for generations, so we need to be able to say the same for the next generation. But for many families, this just isn’t the case as it stands today. Many of our children will go on to post-secondary education. They will go to university; they will go to college; they will go into skills training, perhaps. They get a good education, but sometimes they struggle to find those good jobs. Often, in the jobs they do find now, we are seeing a trend towards part-time work and contract work. For others, the working world is even tougher.", "So what does this mean, Speaker? What do we need to do about it?", "Well, it means if we don’t do anything, if we think the status quo is good enough, then there’s a real danger, I think, that the next generation—that would be our children and our grandchildren—will be worse off than we are today. The dreams that we had as young people could one day be out of reach for today’s youth, unless we act. I remain hopeful that we can still make those dreams become realities, which is why this legislation is so badly needed.", "In the end, Bill 148 is about answering this question: What do we want work in the province of Ontario to look like? It’s an examination of our collective values and of what matters to us here in Ontario. It’s about protecting the competitiveness of our businesses, the ones that operate within the law and the ones that already respect the rights of workers. It’s about making sure that that playing field is even for everyone to prosper.", "On this side of the House, we don’t believe that anybody in the province of Ontario who works 35 or 40-plus hours a week and who maybe has two or even three jobs should not be able to afford the basics.", "There’s a huge campaign out there called $15 and Fairness. It’s not confined to Ontario, by any means. It’s right across Canada. It’s right through the United States. What it is basically saying is that there’s a growing inequality of income in the province of Ontario and throughout the continent of North America. There are a number of us doing very, very well in society, who can afford to pay our bills, who can afford to make investments, to go on holidays and drive a nice car, and there is a growing number of people, even in a growing economy like Ontario’s is today, who simply find themselves falling behind and who aren’t getting their fair share. I think what they are saying, to all levels of government—I think you saw it in the United States in the last federal election. They’re saying to all levels of government that it’s about time, for those hard-working people in Ontario who just go to work every day and want to support their families, that we paid a little bit of attention to them.", "We don’t believe that anyone in Ontario who works full-time should be struggling to pay their rent, should be struggling to put food on their table or even to take care of their family, especially at a time when the provincial economy is doing so well. The moral and the economic evidence that supports this fundamental belief is without question. So when I hear people saying that we shouldn’t be doing this or that the status quo is good enough, I simply do not buy into that. I believe that shows a disregard for the working people of the province of Ontario.", "People move to this province from all around the world. Many of us came from somewhere else ourselves, or we come from families that came from somewhere else. We came here because it was that land of opportunity. It was a place where if you worked hard, your rights as a person and as a human being were respected, your rights as a worker were respected, and you were paid fairly.", "Together, what we are trying to do is to make sure that those people who are living at the lower end of the income scale are able to buy the basics, are able to pay the rent, are able to buy shoes and clothing for their kids, are able to put food on the table, are able to get through a month without the money running out.", "Think of the impact that this has, Speaker, on the overall economy. What this would mean is that 30% of the people who work in the province of Ontario would be earning more money. This isn’t money that’s invested offshore; this isn’t money that is invested in trust funds. Somebody earning income at this level goes right back into the community that week and spends this money. This goes into drugstores and supermarkets; it goes into places where people buy the basics, where they buy the diapers for their kids, where they buy the shoes for their kids, where they buy the food for the family table. It goes into a lot of small businesses that exist in the province as a result of working people having some money in their pockets to spend. I think it was Henry Ford who said that he wanted to pay his employees enough money so that they could all go out and buy Ford vehicles. It may be simple but there’s some sense to that.", "What we’re seeing in Ontario is growing income inequality and it’s time we did something about that, because if we allow that inequality to grow, the outcome or the forecast for the province simply would not take advantage of the huge potential that Ontario still has.", "Now, this isn’t the only thing we’re doing, though—as much of it talks about people who are living at the lower end of the income ladder. Those people too would now qualify under OHIP+, for example, for free prescription drugs for any child, including an adult child under 25. What we’ve done is expanded access to child care because certainly people have told us that in order to get to work, they need to make sure their kids are able to spend their days in a place they think is safe, where they know they’ll be well cared for.", "We have the basic income pilot, a pilot project in the province of Ontario that I think a lot of people around the world are looking at—seeing if there’s something we can do to ensure that people have the basics.", "We’ve got the Fair Housing Plan and the fair hydro plan. We’re seeing people’s hydro bills reduced by 25% in the rural areas; I understand as high as 40% for some people.", "We’re building a province where real opportunity and greater security is not just in reach of those people who are at the upper end of the income scale. We need to make sure that it’s within the reach of everybody. We believe that gives everybody hope. It doesn’t matter whether you’re rich or poor, you have access to post-secondary education and skills training.", "We find that a lot of young people recognize the income level they come from. They look at their mom or their dad and they say, “It looks like we don’t earn an awful lot of money. Maybe I’m not a kid that’s going to university.” They’re making those decisions in elementary school. They’re counting themselves out before they even get to high school. What we’re saying with the free tuition plan we have in place is that you don’t have to count yourself out; you shouldn’t count yourself out. The fact that your parents may be at the lower end of that scale is no reason to count yourself out. We’re going to make post-secondary education available to everybody in Ontario whether you’re rich or poor. That applies to prescription drugs as well. What we’re trying to do is make it easier for families to get by in Ontario. It’s that simple.", "I opened my remarks by saying that we used to think of the minimum wage as a student wage. There weren’t a lot of adults who were earning the minimum wage when I grew up in the 1980s and 1990s. But now we’re seeing an increasing amount of people between 25 and 64 on minimum wage pay or under $15 an hour. The fact of the matter is, there’s nowhere in the province of Ontario where you can raise a family on $11.40 or $11.60 an hour. It just is not possible.", "Now, the minimum wage was frozen by a previous government for nine or 10 years at $6.85. We’ve raised it nine or 10 times since we’ve been in office—I think 10—and we’ve raised it by 70%. But during that period of time, employment has grown by some large degree. We went through 2008-09, and if you look around the world, you look across the country, you look throughout the United States, you’ll see that we went through a period of varying degrees of austerity where people tightened their belts a little bit. We all pulled in a little bit and tried to get through what was the biggest economic crisis that I have been through as an individual. I’ve heard about the Great Depression, but I didn’t live through it. This was the greatest economic crisis that I had ever seen. That caused, I think, a lot of people to retrench a little bit. It caused people to pull back a little bit.", "I want to tell you that I spent the afternoon with a group of people called the Better Way Alliance. The Better Way Alliance is a group of very profitable small and large businesses, investors, people who run retail, people who run manufacturing, people in construction. What drives them is profitability, as it should be, but also, treating their employees well is something they really care about. Their aim is to provide real evidence that you can run a business in the province of Ontario and you can pay people a living wage. You can do both, and both can be successful: the business, and the employees themselves.", "There was a gentleman named Helmi Ansari. Helmi, as I understand it, used to work for a big multinational corporation. He decided to leave that world, and he started his own business. He paid people minimum wage because he could. He said that one day, he went to visit—either by invitation or just by dropping in—some of his employees. He went to their homes, and he didn’t like what he saw.", "He said, “I went home, Kevin, and I couldn’t sleep at night.” He said, “I was running a good, profitable business, but I couldn’t sleep, knowing that my employees, who served me well during the day, were going home and living in conditions that simply weren’t fair.”", "What he did was he came back and he raised his wages. He raised them well above the minimum wage, and he found that the payback that he got from his employees was far beyond anything he’d invested in that minimum wage. They became more productive. There was no turnover. People wanted to work there. The employees that worked there were telling other people that they should work there. People were talking to the customers, saying, “This is a great place to work. You should buy more of this product.” Basically, it grew his business.", "Some people would find that to be a contrary message, that you couldn’t do both of those things—you couldn’t possibly grow your business or, as a result of raising your wage to a living wage, you couldn’t possibly have a better business. But that’s exactly what happened to Helmi Ansari in Cambridge.", "I had met Helmi before. I went to visit his company. Today I was able to meet a lot of other people just like Helmi. It’s a growing movement in the province of Ontario. It really speaks to what Bill 148 is all about, and that is saying, yes, there’s the economy; yes, there are good business practices; yes, there are the economic considerations; yes, there are things like cost containment and productivity and all those things. But there’s also the relationship that we have with each other as human beings, which is just as important.", "By paying your employees well, you’re actually investing in increased profitability in your own company. You get a better return on your investment. You’re able to go home at night and sleep, when it comes to Helmi’s case. He was saying that he felt very, very selfish for doing that. He’d just paid people more money. But he said, “It was worth it for me to put my head on the pillow at night and know that my employees were living the life that I would like to think they were having as a result of that.” He is up to 10 employees now, and he started very, very small.", "When you see those types of stories, you know that what we see is there’s a lot of other companies around the province of Ontario that pay far above the minimum wage. They are profitable companies. They do a great business. They’re employers of choice: People want to work for those companies. When they put postings out there, for example, when those job postings go out there, they get hundreds of applications, because they’ve built a reputation as being a place where people want to work. It’s a place where you’re valued, where you feel treated well. That’s what we would want to see for all businesses in the province of Ontario.", "There has been a growing trend—when I talked about the expectations in the 1990s and the expectations today, there were temporary help agencies around in the 1990s, the 1980s, the 1970s and the 1960s, and they served a good role, I think. For somebody who for some reason just needed to work for a few months, it was great to be able to go to any one of the temporary help agencies.", "But what we have seen, what has replaced that now, is some workforces are entirely temporary help agency driven. There may be a few executives who are employees of the company, but everybody else is hired through a temporary help agency for what is essentially a permanent job, and the future of that is just grim. You think of where that takes you, when you think of that in terms of growing income disparity in the province of Ontario, where a report just came out and said that the top 50% of people in the province of Ontario share 81% of the wealth and the bottom 50% are left to share 19%—and that’s growing. You wonder why people don’t have any hope when they see that type of a change, and you wonder why Bill 148 is so popular with the public—it’s because if it’s not them, it’s their kids, it’s somebody they know, it’s somebody that they worked with. It’s somebody they know is working as hard as anybody else.", "Ontario has got a reputation for hard work. It has been what has drawn people from Europe, from Asia, from South America—from all continents. They know that if you come to the province of Ontario, if you put in the hours and you put in the work, you can prosper in this province. We need to make sure it stays that way. We need to make sure that people at all levels on the income spectrum are able to prosper in the province of Ontario—because it really is that feeling of hope.", "The immigrant story—often, as you move to a country, you move to a place like Canada and like Ontario, sometimes you do the work that other people don’t want to do. Somehow that’s when you get your foot in the door. But you know, as a result of that, that your family is going to prosper, that your kids are going to go to college even if you didn’t. That’s what has grown this province. What we are seeing is that being diminished. We’re seeing increased use of temporary help agencies. We’re seeing minimum wage being applied to positions where it just wasn’t applied before.", "It seems to me that in some respects, some people in our society have almost become disposable; they’ve become viewed as units of production. That’s not what I think business in the province of Ontario wants either. The vast majority of people in the province of Ontario want a society in which people have money to spend, so people can put money back into their businesses, they can buy their products, they can buy their services. When the money keeps circulating, the economy gets stronger.", "The ironic thing is that when we told the advisers to go out for the Changing Workplaces Review, we said, “Don’t look at the minimum wage. Look at the Employment Standards Act, and look at the Labour Relations Act. We think we’re doing okay on the minimum wage.” We had a process in place that I still support and would apply to the changes that are made here.", "On April 1 of any given year, what we do is take a look back at the consumer price index for the preceding year. We tell employers that that will be the new minimum wage. It’s applied on October 1 of that same year; it’s fair and it’s predictable. But what we found is, when we established that base four or five years ago now, we established it too low. We established it at a point where somebody could still work 30, 40 or 50 hours a week in the province of Ontario and still live in poverty. That’s not the Ontario I think any one of the parties here really supports.", "I know there are varying opinions on the bill. Some people think it goes too far, and some think it doesn’t go far enough. It’s our intent to work with small business, with the chambers of commerce in the province of Ontario. I know the Honourable Brad Duguid and my seatmate the Honourable Jeff Leal, the minister responsible for small business, have been tasked with coming up with some assistance for transition, because we know this is challenging. We know it’s challenging, but we know that it bodes for a better future.", "The vast majority of economists that I have heard from have spoken in favour of this. They’ve said that Ontario is on the right track. When I read the editorials in the papers, the changes to either the temporary help agencies, the changes that would bring in sick time or the changes that would just treat employees with the dignity and the respect that any one of us would want for ourselves or would want for our family members will be strengthened by the passage of Bill 148.", "I’m hoping that we enjoy the support of all members of the House on this. A lot of work has gone into this. You’re looking at about three years of consultations. It’s something that I think would make us proud—that we’re able to pass this and make sure that everybody, regardless of your income level, is treated fairly in the province of Ontario." ],

As most in the House know, and many outside the House know, this bill went out at first reading with the Standing Committee on Finance and Economic Affairs. I was lucky, at the Kingston meeting on July 13, to have four constituents make presentations—three of them, actually, from the village of Westport. I had Todd Stafford, the president of Northern Cables in Brockville, a large job creator. But the three from Westport were Robin Jones, who’s the mayor of Westport and the warden of the United Counties of Leeds and Grenville; Terry Cowan from the Cove Country Inn in Westport; and Neil Kudrinko who runs an independent grocery store in Westport and also a fine foods shop.", "It was interesting to have three constituents from a small community—Westport is a village with about 700 people. It’s the smallest municipality in Ontario that provides water and waste water services. The Cove and Kudrinko’s are two of the largest employers. Both Terry Cowan and Neil Kudrinko expressed concern about the speed with which the minimum wage will be increased and their ability to adapt. Both of them used the percentage of 32% and also talked about the issue of dealing with banks, because their net income would be, basically, in a negative position.", "It’s very interesting to hear the minister not address many of the comments that were brought up in committee about what the government is going to do after all of the consultation, all of the public hearings, and how they’re going to deal with that. I’m very concerned about the minister’s comment about raising prices earlier today. I had hoped that he would have addressed that in his speech, but maybe that will happen later." ],

In particular, I wanted to do a shout-out to Deena Ladd at the Workers’ Action Centre and to the folks from ACORN. They were out in every community that we visited. They are the ones who have been lobbying not only the government but all of us for years for a fair wage for workers in this province. They’re non-profit agencies who work with very little financial resources, and they work for the greater good of people who are in low- or lower-middle-income situations.", "So, the bill—we certainly support many parts of it. There’s still more work to be done, and I think our leader, Andrea Horwath, spoke to that this morning. The issue of temporary workers: Although it is addressed in some ways within this bill, the government still has the opportunity to make some more amendments after these debates and before we go into clause-by-clause in the next reading.", "If you read the Toronto Star article on the weekend, there are thousands of people working in temporary situations, and WSIB is reporting that those people working for temporary agencies in a variety of sectors are in the top 10% of injuries of any workers in this province, even though they only make up 2% of the entire workforce in the province.", "There’s more work to do on this bill, and I’ll talk about that when I’m up next." ],

Most of what they’re talking about, again, is the reckless speed at which this government is trying to implement something.", "The business community is certainly not suggesting, and we’re not supporting, that people don’t need a good living wage. Certainly, at the end of the day, we support a $15 minimum wage. But it has to be done in a timely manner. It has to give people the ability to adjust their business. At the end of the day, the fiscal accountability officer has just come out with a report suggesting that there could be 50,000 jobs lost because of the speed at which they’re going to implement this. So this isn’t just us, Mr. Speaker. This is a third-party resource of this Legislature that is suggesting that.", "The minister has suggested that an option is to raise costs. Well, how is that really helping out the average consumer or the average person out there trying to make ends meet with everything that could increase across the board?", "The other alternative is certainly—and I’ve heard this from business people—“The reality is that I’m either going to have to raise costs or lower hours and lay off people”—lower the number of hours people are getting and/or lay them off totally. How is that truly helping people at the end of the day?", "The Minister of Housing suggested that this is to make our province more competitive. We have the highest energy rates in the country. At the end of the day, the Liberals have raised rates between 300% and 400%. Whether it’s at the home, whether it’s our seniors on fixed incomes or our business community, they’re saying, “This is the most challenging thing to pay. I cannot keep up with my bills.” They want to say they gave a 25% decrease. They forget to say that they raised your bills 300% before they did that.", "We know that life is harder under the Liberals. We know that this is challenging. We certainly, at the end of the day, believe there are better ways that we could do this. We want to make sure that people have the ability to have a good living, absolutely. But we have to do it with conscience, to understand—as the fiscal accountability officer says, do a full financial impact analysis and let people know what’s coming at them." ],

The concerns are real. The concerns have come as a result of consultations that were held around the province by people who know an awful lot about employment standards and know an awful lot about labour relations. The two of them, very esteemed individuals, spent a lifetime in those fields. They went out, they heard from Ontarians, they came back and they gave the government advice.", "What we’ve done is taken that advice and turned it into Bill 148. Along the way, what we realized is that 30% of people in the province of Ontario are trying to get by on less than $15 an hour. At the end of the day, you either agree with that and think, “Well, that’s just okay,” or we need to do something about that, Speaker. We need to put those people, who are working as hard as you or I are, who are working as long as you or I are, in a position where they’re able to pay their basic bills.", "You agree with that or you don’t. This side of the House agrees with that. I think the third party agrees with that and would like us to go even further, if I understand the comments. It appears that the Progressive Conservative Party did not agree with that. I don’t know why, because I can’t understand it. I think it’s a basic tenet of what it means to be a Canadian and what it means to be an Ontarian.", "This is the land of opportunity. This is the land where you can go, you work hard and you live in a society where you can pay your bills, where you can feed and clothe your kids. People often move from other corners of the world to Ontario because they can’t do that where they come from. They move here because this is a place where they can do better. We need to ensure that we’re able to do better. Bill 148 is going to allow us to do that. I would urge all members of the House to find a way to support this bill." ],

I have an hour to speak to the comments earlier from the Minister of Housing, Minister Milczyn, saying that people with a cold shouldn’t be at work. I’m here because that’s the schedule for the speaking. I’m not sure how it’s going to work for an hour. The old voice might crack a little bit.", "I did want to start by pointing out to the minister, who talked about the consultative process—I don’t know where to start because I have to pick out a few things that he said that were somewhat less than accurate. He said that as a result of the consultative process, they arrived at Bill 148, which encompasses the increase in minimum wage. The Changing Workplaces Review never, ever discussed the minimum wage—never discussed it. I want to make that very clear to the minister. It was never part of the discussion. Those experts he paid to come up with the conclusions—they never discussed the minimum wage.", "In fact, the minister is chastising Progressive Conservatives for wanting to exercise caution in the implementation. He’s chastising us. He says that either you believe in supporting workers or you don’t.", "We certainly believe in supporting workers. As a person who came from a business environment and owned a business, I can attest to that, and I have former employees who would agree with me.", "Having said that, when the minister talks about the implementation of the minimum wage and that if you don’t support exactly what they’re talking about you don’t support workers, he’s going to have to have some chats with the Financial Accountability Officer. I will get to that report in due course.", "The minister is going to have to have a discussion with himself. I don’t know whether he got a lightning bolt or knocked off his horse on the way to Oakville, aka Damascus, and came to some epiphany on the minimum wage only recently, for the crass political considerations that we have accused them of, but the discussion about a $14 and $15 minimum wage has been going on for some time. The minister has, on many occasions, defended what is still the current policy—because this is not law yet—of affixing it and tying it to the consumer price index.", "In fact, I have a number of quotes that the minister—I also have the Premier. Let’s start with one of the ones from the Premier.", "“Premier Kathleen Wynne said it is fair to base future changes on the consumer price index since it is a key indicator of how the economy is doing and would offer some predictability for businesses”—predictability for businesses.", "“‘It takes the decision out of the realm of political whim and puts it into the realm of some kind of relationship with the way the economy is growing,’ she told reporters in Ottawa....", "“Despite the mounting pressure for a $14 minimum wage”—at that time—“Wynne is worried about the impact on business of such a big hike.", "“‘I know that there’s a call for $14 (but) we have to move very carefully, because this is about making sure that we retain and create jobs.’”", "That’s Kathleen Wynne, in the Toronto Star, January 27, 2014. This was at a time when Mr. Naqvi was the minister, but I’m going to leave him out of here for now.", "This is Minister Flynn: “However, in the past, increases to minimum wages have been made on a very ad hoc basis. They’re subject to the political process of this place, and we feel, on this side of the House, that that’s not fair to workers. They didn’t know what their hourly wage would be from one year to the next. It was unpredictable for businesses that couldn’t plan for the future and it was really based on the political whims of the party that formed the government at that particular point in time. That’s why this government has introduced this legislation to remedy that and to index the minimum wage as we move forward.”", "That was Minister Flynn on October 20, 2014, during second reading debate on Bill 18, which established the consumer price index as the vehicle for determining what the increases in the minimum wage would be.", "Further, from the minister: “We’ve heard from experts, we’ve heard from workers, we’ve heard from business. They want stable and predictable increases to the minimum wage in this province. We’ve had recommendations from the Minimum Wage Advisory Panel and they advised the government on the best approach: to tie future minimum wage increases to inflation. And that’s exactly what we’ve done.” Minister Flynn, Hansard, during oral questions, September 30, 2015.", "Again: “‘It’s important for people to know that there is a consistent, transparent and fair approach to setting the province’s minimum wage that ensures workers receive annual increases that keep up with inflation,’ Labour Minister Kevin Flynn said in a statement Friday.", "“‘It’s also important we provide predictability to businesses so they can prepare for annual wage increases. This helps to build a more prosperous economy and a fairer society for all.’” Toronto Star, March 19, 2016.", "Minister Flynn, more recently, on October 5, 2016: “We’ve put predictability into the system and stability into the system, and it’s working.”", "“‘We’re trying to make sure that people are earning a decent living, we’re also trying to ensure that employers have predictability,’ Labour Minister Kevin Flynn told reporters at Queen’s Park on Wednesday, adding that the minimum wage is due for review in 2019.", "“Flynn said he realizes the $15 wage appeals to people.", "“‘When you dig down a little deeper into the issue though, you realize it’s got ramifications that go beyond that first initial political appeal,’ he said. ‘There is actually an awful lot of economic forces at play.’”", "That was the CBC on January 19 of this year, when he opposed a $15 minimum wage.", "Then I read from Mike Crawley in the CBC. He writes, “Barely four months ago, I asked Premier Kathleen Wynne how open she was to the idea of boosting Ontario’s minimum wage to $15 an hour. She was rather unenthusiastic.", "“Despite activists pushing the government for a sharp increase from the current minimum wage of $11.40, Wynne defended the existing system of nudging it upward once a year by the rate of inflation.", "“‘We’ve got a really good process ... that actually depoliticizes the increases to the minimum wage,’ Wynne said on Jan. 19.", "“‘That is the responsible way to move forward. It is very important to me that we have a predictable and sustainable way of seeing increases to the minimum wage.’”", "That was just on May 31.", "Then I have one more, from Minister Flynn, from oral questions on the May 4, 2017:", "“What we did a few years back is that we got all parties that were interested in this around the same table. We established a process. We set a foundation for the minimum wage. We got opinions from organized labour, from business, from poverty advocates, from everybody—from the workers themselves. We got everybody who was interested in this issue around the same table. We put a process in place that, for the past few years, has worked very, very well.”", "That was Minister Flynn in oral questions on May 4 this year.", "As I said, where was the epiphany? I suspect the epiphany came from the political advisers who said, “We’ve got to do something drastic. We’ve raised the cost of living. We have hurt people in this province for 14 years. We have driven down their spending power, because their wages have not kept up with the cost-of-living increases that we have inflicted on them,” whether it’s hydro prices, whether it’s fees, whether it’s health taxes. All of these kinds of things that this government has foisted upon the taxpayers, wage earners of all levels—high-, medium- and lower-wage earners—has had an impact on their ability to buy the goods and services that the minister says everybody is entitled to. They should have a basic living; everybody should be able to afford it. But in Kathleen Wynne’s Ontario, it has become increasingly unaffordable.", "So the political masters decided that on the last day of the Legislature, June 1, they would table a bill that, yes, rewrote the Employment Standards Act and the Labour Relations Act. Many of the changes in that bill, we have no problem with them. I really question the minister implying today that Patrick Brown was against this or against that, when Patrick Brown has not even commented on those sections of the bill. He hasn’t commented on those sections of the bill, so why would a minister of the crown make a statement that claims he knows the position that Patrick Brown has on a particular issue when he has yet to comment on it? That is not in keeping with the responsibility of a minister, in my estimation, Speaker.", "Everything that I have said, that I have attributed to Minister Flynn, he has actually said. Those are quotes. He makes statements that Patrick Brown has said something that Patrick Brown has never said.", "What did Minister Flynn say today? When I travelled the province—I was on that committee that travelled the province and heard from so many different businesses and representatives about the rapid increase. It’s about the rapid increase. We have never said we are opposed to a $15 minimum wage. What we have said is that you need to take a step back and ask yourself whether the timetable is right.", "Even in British Columbia, which doesn’t even have a Liberal government—it’s got an NDP government—" ],

What we have asked for, Speaker—we proposed an amendment at clause-by-clause, and I asked for the same thing yesterday in question period. I asked the minister to commission a third-party independent economic impact analysis to determine what the effects of making this kind of change in this period of time would have on Ontario’s economy and on the jobs of the very people they’re purporting to protect.", "Of course, he refused and danced around the issue and got all political. He talked about how we don’t care—you know, that typical Liberal response when they don’t want to deal with the actual issue. They didn’t deal with the actual issue for years. If the $15-an-hour minimum wage was so important to them, why didn’t they do it last year? Why didn’t they do it the year before?", "All of a sudden, on June 1, without any—it was never part of the report, the Changing Workplaces Review. They threw it out there because it was strictly a political manoeuvre.", "But I want to say, again, back to what the minister himself actually said—smaller printing on this; I’ll have to put the glasses on. The minister was being asked in a scrum today about the Financial Accountability Officer’s report that shows that at least 50,000 jobs will be lost as a result of the minimum wage hike. A reporter said, “You just said there’s a number of things that small businesses could do in order to prepare for a $15 minimum wage. What are those things?”", "Minister Flynn said, “Well, I think they could look at pricing, obviously that’s one thing that obviously any business would do.”", "What the minister is saying is that in order to adjust for the minimum wage increase, businesses should simply raise their prices. On the surface, if you lived in a bubble, that might be possible. But there is a tipping point for everything. The minster earlier used the word, “globalization” and how that has changed things. Yes, it has changed things dramatically. The economy that we exist in is not the economy of the 1970s, 1980s, the 1990s, etc. We live in a very internationally competitive economy. We have to compete for everything that we get.", "If Ontario simply has the price of everything raised, it will lessen its competitive status, both nationally and internationally. Businesses can make the decision to build, establish, expand or leave in their best interests. If businesses feel that Ontario is not the place to establish and/or expand, then they will not come here. They will not expand if they’re here, but they can also make the decision, as many have, that they’re leaving Ontario and moving elsewhere.", "I think it’s kind of—not “kind of”; it is irresponsible for the minister to make that kind of statement: “Just raise your prices.” Well, if that was simply the case, if that’s the way you want to conduct economics, then why stop at $15? Why not make it $25? Why not make it $30, and we’ll just keep raising the prices of everything else to cover it off? But everybody knows and every economist knows that that is not possible. It is not feasible and it is not practical or pragmatic in a global economy. Globalization does not allow you to build a fence around your jurisdiction and act as if what you do here has no effect anywhere else or what they do has no effect here. It just doesn’t work that way.", "When the minister makes those kinds of comments, I can’t get into his head and figure out what he was thinking, but I can certainly ask the question: What were you thinking when you make a comment such as that? “Just raise your prices.” If it was as easy as that, then we’d all be doing quite well—everybody—because the prices would just keep going up and everybody would make more money. But it doesn’t work that way.", "It’s not going to work that way, according to so many businesses that we heard from at the committee. Even the businesses that came that were not opposed to $15 a hour, they were opposed to a 32% increase in those wages in a year and a half—well, actually less than a year and a half because it really will be a year, because it will be the increase on January 1, 2018, and the further increase on January 1, 2019; so really they will go up 32% within a year.", "Their question was, “How are we supposed to adjust? How are we supposed to prepare for this?” Well, I say again, the government should be doing an economic impact study. They ignored every piece of testimony that came from small businesses at that committee because they are fixated and focused on doing what they believe is the best political manoeuvre for them prior to the June 2018 election. They’re not concerned about the effect on jobs across Ontario; they’re only concerned about the effect on their jobs in the Liberal caucus and the election in 2018.", "In the absence of them doing an economic impact study of their own or an impact analysis of their own, the Ontario Chamber of Commerce commissioned one. I can’t speak to the accuracy of their findings. I wasn’t involved in the study. But if the Liberal government wants to question their findings, then they should do a study of their own, commission a study of their own that tells us something different. But this is the only study that was specifically commissioned post the tabling of Bill 148.", "The Liberals have quoted studies from other jurisdictions and quoted 50 economists who all signed a letter, none of whom have ever worked in the private sector and none who work in the private sector. The majority work in the academic bubble of universities. They’re not job creators. They’re not job retainers. They’re theoretical economists. And they cite them as the so-called experts.", "The chamber of commerce commissioned the Canadian Centre for Economic Analysis to do a study. It was released in August and the findings are quite startling. As I said, I won’t comment as to whether the numbers are absolutely accurate because that’s not my field of expertise, but the numbers that they released should give anyone reason to pause and ask, “Is this something we want to do immediately? Is this something we want to rush out the door”? But then, all you have to do is look at the motivation of the Liberals and this is something they want to rush out the door, even though it was never discussed in the Changing Workplaces Review, which I will repeat more than once when I speak to this bill.", "The Ontario Chamber of Commerce and the Canadian Centre for Economic Analysis state that the impact will be a $23-billion hit to business over the next two years alone—$23 billion. Some 185,000 Ontario jobs will be at immediate risk over the next two years; 30,000 of the jobs at risk are youth under 25 and 96,000 employees at risk are expected to be women. There will be a 50% increase to inflation for this year and the foreseeable future. The cost of everyday consumer goods and services will go up by $1,300 per household on average each and every year.", "Now, those three findings alone—a $1,300 annual hit to the average household, a $23-billion hit to businesses over the next two years and 185,000 jobs being lost, so many of them young people and women—in the face of that, the government did nothing. It takes this report and basically files it in the recycling bin—not interested, not concerned. Why? Because it takes away from their single goal, which is to campaign on this next year.", "I see some of the members of the House in here today who were also on that committee. They travelled and they heard the same testimony that I heard. They were asked so many times to pause and slow this down, to do that analysis so that it can be implemented in such a way that the injury to Ontario’s economy is minimalized, not maximized, as the calendar that they’ve already indicated they’re going to go by is 32% essentially within a year. January 1 to January 1 it will go up 32%.", "I met with people from my riding, Dan and Trina Worner, who run a small RV resort on Lake Doré. They were in my office for over an hour and a half, which is a long time for you to have a meeting with a constituent, as people in this House will know. But I felt compelled to allow them that time to articulate in the clearest possible way the effect that this was going to have on them and how precarious their business and the future of their business was or would be upon the accelerated implementation of these changes.", "I’ve talked to youth who have said, “Why are they doing this? It’s going to hurt me. I’m going to be the one who’s not going to get a job next summer in Barry’s Bay,” or Renfrew or Pembroke or Killaloe or Owen Sound or Peterborough. They’re going to be hurt, the young people who will not be offered a job for the summer. That’s going to have an impact. The chamber of commerce report supports exactly what I’m saying here, that so many of these jobs that are not going to be here are going to be youth, disadvantaged, women. Why are you attacking those groups for your own political gain?" ],

Good afternoon, committee members. Thank you very much for inviting me to speak to you. I’m a Tim Hortons restaurant owner with stores in Toronto. My wife and I have been in the chain for almost 25 years. I’m also a proud member of the Great White North Franchisee Association, the official franchise association for Tim Hortons owners.", "“Over the past two weeks, you’ve heard many different opinions of the bill that’s in front of you today. As a business owner with 250 employees, I have grave concerns about how a $15 minimum wage would affect my operation. But today, I would like to speak with you about how this bill in its current form could and probably will do considerable harm to the lives and livelihoods of Ontario’s most vulnerable workers: those with disabilities.", "“By way of background, I’m not only a restaurant owner; I’m recognized as a leader in inclusion. I believe in real jobs for real pay for people with disabilities. My wife and I have employed over 160 workers with disabilities in the last 25 years. Today, 46 of our employees have a disability. That’s 17% of our workforce. As a keynote speaker on this subject, I travel across the globe encouraging corporations to become disability-confident and to include workers with disabilities in their own hiring practices. It is working.”", "He goes on to say, “The unemployment rate for Ontarians with disabilities is over 50%.” And he goes on to say, “Ontario is now a leader in encouraging employers to hire people with disabilities. The future is bright.", "“However, ladies and gentlemen, this could all unravel very quickly with the stroke of a pen if Bill 148 is implemented in its current form. Knowing that business will reduce labour, who gets cut first? The answer, of course, is those employees who do not generate revenue—the most vulnerable workers, those with disabilities and youth. This is the unintended consequence of an unprecedented minimum wage increase.”", "When you have someone such as Mark Wafer—who has won numerous awards, and the minister who knows him well can attest to that, for his support and treatment of the most vulnerable workers—raising the alarm bells, raising the spectre of concern about the rapid changes to the wage increases in Ontario and how that could affect those people—he is just saying what we’ve been saying.", "The Liberals want to live in some sort of a dream world. They think that businesses are going to be faced with 32% increases in costs and they’re not going to somehow try to act in a way to mitigate the effect—" ],

Those jobs would be the easiest ones to cut first.” That was his answer to a question.", "One of his last responses was, “The concern I have is how quickly we’re bringing it in: $14 in six months, $15 in only 18 months. It doesn’t give us enough time to plan. The emails that I’m getting from Ontario retailers, and from Alberta because they have the same situation right now, say, ‘What do I do with the people who have disabilities who came to me from an agency? What do I do? I can’t afford to keep them now.’”", "It’s interesting that the Financial Accountability Officer was taking almost a similar position when he said—and this is an independent officer of the Legislature. This is not a hired consultant. This is an independent officer of the Legislature appointed by us—the Financial Accountability Officer. He weighed in and released a report today, commentary on the changes to the wages: at a minimum, a net loss of 50,000 jobs, with those job losses concentrated among teens and young adults.", "“However, there is evidence to suggest that the job losses could be larger than” estimated.

He used the term “food deserts,” where places like Kudrinko’s are gone and people from Westport would be forced to drive to the nearest large municipality, which would be Kingston, just in order to do their grocery shopping, because businesses like his could not exist and could not survive the onslaught of the speed of this implementation.", "This is not me speaking or my colleague from Leeds–Grenville.

When you see the fundraising drive that goes on in a small community, where do they always turn to? Where do they always turn to spearhead those drives? It is almost certainly the small business sector of those communities, the ones that have their heart and soul invested in that community. They are part of that community. They share their lives with the people who work for them and the people who walk through that door. They’re not there simply to extract revenue from that population; they are there to serve, to provide a needed service, a needed product for a population that requires it.", "Some of them are generations old. Some of them are new; many of them are new. But they’re no less invested because they moved to a small community or they grew up in that small community.

When the minister was asked by a reporter, “Minister, you just said there are a number of things that small businesses could do in order to prepare for a $15 minimum wage. What are those things?”, Minister Flynn replied, “Well, I think they could look at pricing. Obviously, that’s one thing that any business would do.” So he’s saying to the Neil Kudrinkos of the world, “Just raise your prices.”", "The ability for the Walmarts of the world to absorb some changes is far different than Kudrinko’s or, in my case, the Metro in Barry’s Bay, or Valu-mart. It’s highly different, the ability for them to absorb these kinds of increases and remain competitive. If they can’t remain competitive, slowly but surely their business shrinks to the point where it cannot survive. There’s a minimum amount of revenue that has to come through a business in order for it to operate. Once it drops below that, all of a sudden, doors start to close, businesses are shuttered, and people have to move. People have to go to the next big town—the city of Kingston.", "Let’s just take those two businesses. You’ve got the Cove Country Inn and you’ve got Kudrinko’s, the two biggest employers in Westport, the two biggest businesses, and all of a sudden, they’re not there. How much longer do you think there’s a Westport? Or does Westport become like so many other ghost towns?", "If you look at Ontario’s history and do the background of the back roads maps, you see where there are ghost towns. The railway used to go through there or they were a bustling town at the turn of the century, but they don’t even exist. There might be an old church there; there might be an old schoolhouse that has been abandoned; but the place no longer exists. Is that what we’re trying to do to small business in rural Ontario with this bill? I don’t know.", "I also heard testimony in Ottawa from my riding—Calabogie Peaks, Paul Murphy; an absolutely moving testimony about how this could affect his business. Paul runs a ski hill. He relies on the people from Ottawa as one of his prime markets. But people from Ottawa have a lot of choices about where they do their skiing, and most of Paul’s competition is on the other side of the border, in Quebec. If his rates aren’t competitive, they’ll go there. The drive is similar, or less, even, certainly for some of the hills on the Quebec side. They don’t pay the price for hydroelectricity that Paul pays. He’s already at a competitive disadvantage as a result of the mismanagement of the electricity system by the McGuinty-Wynne government. Now he’s being told that he has to be subjected to a whole new environment of costs.", "I don’t know how many people here ski or not, but if you’ve got the choice of six or so hills within a similar distance, and one of those hills all of a sudden has priced themselves much higher than the others, I don’t know where you’re going to be skiing, but I think I know where you’re not going to be skiing. That’s the conundrum that faces Paul Murphy at Calabogie Peaks.", "He’s also the biggest employer in the municipality. He’s got a hill; he has trails and motocross and stuff like that during the summertime. He employs some people year-round, but clearly, his biggest business is in the wintertime, for the skiing.", "What I’m saying is, again, why wouldn’t this government look into the faces of those small businesses, look into those organizations, and ask them, “Is this really necessary in this period of time?”", "I’m just going to give you a number of quotes from people who made submissions, not necessarily to the committee orally, but written submissions as well.", "Ontario Tender Fruit Growers represent over 250 growers across Ontario: “Our industry will need to rapidly increase the cost to the consumer for fresh local fruit.” So your senior citizen who is living on a fixed budget and working on only a Canada pension has to pay more for nutritious food. “We project that the non-ad price of $3.99 for a basket of peaches today will need to be approximately $6.99 in 2019. Some farms may not be able to make the investments needed to compete and will simply close.”", "Blue Spruce Resort, in Dwight: “We’ve been in the hospitality business for 63 years.

It is very sad that we will not be able to provide that experience for as many youths going forward. I have no recourse but to change the nature of my business and reduce my labour force. I am considering technology alternatives to replace jobs in my workplace. I will also have to increase my rates.”", "Advanced Design Solutions, in Stratford: “We typically employ between 110 and 160 people.

It will also lead to increased use of the broader health care system at a time when government is trying to contain health care expenditures.”", "I spoke to a home care provider in Ottawa who said that this was going to mean a million dollars to their business. They’re one of 50 in Ottawa; that’s $50 million for home care in Ottawa. Extrapolate that across the province of Ontario: That’s $700 million across the province of Ontario.", "The government wasn’t thinking. They weren’t talking to each other. It’s time to think.

What we heard, quite frankly, was not pretty.", "It was backed up recently by the Ontario Chamber of Commerce and then only this morning by our own Financial Accountability Officer, who talked about, yes, there will be more money available, but the net loss after that extra money is put into the economy is still 50,000 jobs. Fifty thousand people are going to lose their jobs. We know that now. And he says that the job losses will be concentrated among teens and young adults. Knowing that 50,000 people are going to be put out of work by this plan, they still plan on going ahead with it. I can’t even begin to understand how you would do that, knowing that you are going to cost 50,000 people their jobs.", "It says that a “quarter of the … labour income would directly benefit low-income families.” This would be—and I’m quoting here from the Financial Accountability Officer—“an inefficient policy tool for reducing overall poverty.”", "He also says that prices are going to go up. Of course, we heard from the labour minister today that that’s what you should do: just raise your prices. Well, the FAO says that prices are going up and a minimum of 50,000 people are going to lose their jobs, mostly teens and young adults. “Job losses could be larger than the FAO’s estimate,” he says.", "Knowing that you’re going to have 50,000 people, minimum, put out of work. and they’re still going ahead with it? I can’t even believe this." ],

It’s great to see everyone in good form.", "This was certainly was a topic of conversation during the recess around my riding. Just meeting people everywhere who wanted to know what the ramifications are of this policy and were wondering why the government was taking the approach that they did. Certainly, I spoke to a lot of groups associated with agriculture production, toured some greenhouses, who, among other things, are worried about the impact on their industry through the increase in minimum wage.", "These are folks that will readily tell you that they are prepared to pay a living wage, and in most cases, they do already. They value their employees, who, we all know, are, by and large, temporary foreign workers, migrant workers, who have come in and who have been with these greenhouses for generations, actually. They are family members, so you hire the father, you hire the son and then the grandson. It’s really an important component of production there, but compounded by issues around increased hydro costs, regulatory burdens and failures in infrastructure management in southwestern Ontario. They are wondering how they’re going to be able to make it, without any acknowledgement from the government that that is the position that they’re in.", "There is a lot left here for this government to address in our communities. We wonder if they actually were listening at all when they consulted with our communities. We certainly understand that there are pressures on both sides. Most definitely, an increase has to happen, but in consultation with those who are going to be directly affected." ],

He should read the entire testimony. This guy is recognized as someone who is a champion for people with disabilities. He never said he was going to be cutting their jobs; he said their jobs are going to be cut across the industry as a result of this. But the member for Beaches–East York should pay more attention and get the whole facts. Mark Wafer is a champion for people with disabilities and has been recognized as such. I know Minister MacCharles would know that.", "It takes me back to what I am trying to say, but he also said, in his testimony—Mr. Wafer—that to do this without an economic impact study is simply irresponsible. He says, “Consultation is going to be vital. The fact that the government went ahead with Bill 148 without doing a cost-benefit study, I think, was wrong. I think that we need to fix that now.”", "That’s what we have been calling for from the start. From the very first day the bill was tabled and we were asked questions, we implored upon the government to conduct an economic impact analysis to determine what the results and what the effects of this bill will actually be.", "We only had so much time. We only really talked about the increase in the minimum wage, and that is really the biggest change in the bill there. There are many other changes in this bill that we support. But an economic impact analysis must be done." ],

  "text" : [ "I rise today as the associate critic of education to discuss an issue that is unfortunately becoming more common in Ontario schools. Violence in Ontario’s classrooms is putting our students and education workers at risk. No one should feel that their personal safety is at risk, and our schools should be a place of health and safety. At the same time, we should also be supporting students of all abilities in the classroom. This issue has become so prevalent in some schools in the region of Durham that teachers have been issued Kevlar-based clothing.", "Now, I’ve had the opportunity to speak with several parents from the region whose children have been directly affected by violence in the classroom. For one mother, her child now suffers from anxiety as a result of the school environment and, as a consequence, it can be quite challenging to convince her child to go to school. For other parents, they question how their child could possibly feel safe when they consistently see education workers wearing Kevlar equipment.", "Over the course of the summer, I took the opportunity to meet with several teachers’ federations and associations. Each of them told me that violence in the classroom is one of their prime issues. For example, according to a survey from the Ontario English Catholic Teachers’ Association, 89% of teachers in Ontario’s Catholic schools have either experienced or witnessed some form of violence at work. Weapons are involved in 15% of violent incidents in schools, more than three quarters of which were classroom objects.", "But, Speaker, violence in the classroom is also growing in Ontario’s public schools. I recently met with the Ontario Secondary School Teachers’ Federation to discuss a survey they had conducted of their members, and the findings were equally shocking: 30% of their members indicated they’ve received no training related to workplace violence; 41% of OSSTF’s local leaders surveyed indicated that the number of violent incidents reported has risen; and perhaps most jarring, 55% of members indicated that their employer often pressures them not to report a violent incident.", "Also, in January of this year, the Elementary Teachers’ Federation of Ontario issued a call to action to address violent incidents in schools. This call to action included recommendations to the Liberal government: stronger funding and resources for special education; a comprehensive approach to supporting children’s mental health; proactive supports from both the Ministries of Education and Labour to ensure school board compliance with health and safety legislation; and better health and safety training for education workers.", "Given these collective findings from Ontario’s school systems, there can be no doubt about the magnitude of the problem of violence in Ontario’s classrooms and the need for demonstrated, meaningful action. This is ultimately why I raised this issue last May, and why I will continue to do so inside and outside of this Legislature.", "I’m talking about the need for more services to address children’s mental health as well as the need to ensure that funding for special needs is also allocated to front-line support services, to help ensure the success and well-being of every student.", "Classrooms are meant to be places of learning where teachers, like my daughter, encourage their students to explore the many parts of the curriculum. At the end of the day, teachers should be able to teach, students should not be afraid to go to school and parents should be confident in their children’s safety and opportunity to receive a high-quality education.", "Speaker, Ontario schools are in distress. Education workers are doing all they can, but do not have the appropriate supports.", "I’d like to thank the teachers’ associations and federations for helping to build and maintain a culture of health and safety.", "In closing, I want our education workers as well as our students of all abilities, when they enter into a school, to feel safe. We owe them no less." ],

I agree with him that any incidents of violence have no place in our school system, and it’s unacceptable to all members of the school community, including students, teachers and education workers. They are entitled to be in a safe environment, Mr. Speaker. We agree on that.", "I was a school board trustee for some 11 years, and we always had violence to a certain degree in our schools. It’s always unacceptable. As a school board trustee—we had measures in place. We had incidents where we try to protect our workers within our schools to make them feel safe, but we got pushback at times from parents because we don’t want our schools to look like an armed camp and we don’t want the attire that the support workers within our schools wear to look intimidating to students. We know that over time equipment has changed and society has changed and safety is of paramount importance to us.", "Mr. Speaker, I know the member is alluding to more support. I would like to let the member know that the Special Education Grant is projected to be approximately $2.8 billion in 2017-18. This represents an increase of approximately 2.5% since last year—and we’ll never decrease spending. It has always increased exponentially from year to year.", "The member opposite will be happy to know that the Durham District School Board, which encompasses a part of my riding, is projected to receive over $98 million in funding for special education only for the 2017-18 school year. It is important to note that this funding is enveloped so that it can be put towards protecting and improving special-education programs, services and equipment, ultimately providing more support for students and staff.", "For this coming year, we are providing an additional $290 million targeted for additional teachers and educational workers to support special education and other staffing priorities. This includes the hiring of approximately 25 additional teachers and 51 additional educational workers for the Durham District School Board, resulting in more staff to support students with special-education needs and students at risk.", "I’d also like to let the member be aware that irrespective of what the opposition or the third party may think, Ontario has one of the best school systems in the world. Actually, three weeks ago I had the opportunity to meet with Senator James Rosapepe from Maryland, and he came here to see what Ontario is doing so well and why our education system is top-notch. I asked him why he came to Ontario. He said that there are three jurisdictions, Thailand, Denmark and Ontario—Ontario was closer to Maryland so he came here to see what we are doing right. So whatever the naysayers may say, we all should be proud of the system we have in Ontario, and we should build Ontario up.", "Having said that, we know there is a problem. I, like the member, have met with support workers, educational assistants and parents over the summer and they told me that a part of the problem is not only staff—staffing is not the issue; it’s training. To that end, we are working with the working group on provincial health and safety to strengthen knowledge and access to information for staff on violence prevention, as well as ensuring reporting requirements are easy to access for staff. We are also providing training, and we’ll provide additional training as required. So that’s a key component: training. As one educational worker said to me, “An increase in staff would only allow kids to have more of us to beat up or to spit upon.”", "The crux of the matter is that we need more training for support workers, and that’s the way to go. So, Mr. Speaker, we’re working on that, and we know it’s a problem. As I alluded to earlier, our support workers and our teachers should have a very safe environment, as well as our students, when they enter the classroom. So I agree with the member that it’s unacceptable, the degree of violence in the classroom. It’s something that the government is addressing, and it’s something that we should all work together on and find out solutions to the problem." ],

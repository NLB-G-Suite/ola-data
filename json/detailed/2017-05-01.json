  "text" : [ "Thank you, Speaker. I just want to carry on where I left off at the end of the debate last week about the fair housing plan. Our government released our fair housing plan a couple of weeks back. It’s a comprehensive set of 16 actions that the province will take to make buying or renting a home more affordable. Every year, over 100,000 people move to Ontario because of our strong and vibrant economy; yet, we all know that housing affordability is a complex issue with no one silver bullet.", "In some ways, our hot housing market is tied to the confidence people have in the Ontario economy. But as the Premier has said—and I said this last week; I will quote her again: “When bets and speculation drive the average resale of a house up by 33% in just 12 months, we know we have a problem.”", "Speaker, that’s why we took time to consult with people from every side of the issue: developers, planners, financial institutions, economists, federal and municipal partners, realtors; perhaps most importantly, though, we’ve listened to all of the people who are looking for a place to live or who are struggling to pay for the place that they are living in now.", "The Long-Term Affordable Housing Strategy—these initiatives that we’re introducing build on top of this strategy, which is, at the core, about ensuring that every Ontarian has access to an affordable and suitable home. Our government is serious about reducing the pressure of housing costs felt by Ontarians, as well as providing more affordable options for people to choose from.", "Last December, the Promoting Affordable Housing Act was given royal assent. Driven by the updated Long-Term Affordable Housing Strategy, this act lays the legislative groundwork to create more affordable housing across the province and supports our goal to end chronic homelessness by 2025. Our communities are already seeing the benefits. Through that landmark piece of legislation, we’ve made significant improvements to help expand and improve the rental housing market. We’re preventing unnecessary evictions from social housing units for those individuals and families who cease to be eligible due to an increase in income. In this way, we’re encouraging more inclusive communities, strengthening tenant rights, and creating more mixed-income housing. We’re making secondary suites, such as above-garage apartments or basement units, less costly to build in new homes by exempting them from development charges. Secondary suites are a potential source of affordable rental housing and allow homeowners to earn additional income. And we’re giving municipalities the option to implement inclusionary zoning, which would require affordable housing units to be included in residential developments.", "The proposed Rental Fairness Act that we’re discussing here today also includes a suite of other changes to the Residential Tenancies Act, because the issues that tenants face include more than just out-of-control rent hikes. Today I’ll discuss changes to the transitional housing system, illegal clauses in leases, unfounded evictions and rent increases above the provincial guideline.", "I want to take a minute to just turn the discussion to the issue of homelessness, an issue that continues to be a problem in my riding of Newmarket–Aurora and in many other communities. Too many of our citizens are transitioning out of provincially funded institutions such as jails and hospitals or out of a precarious living situation, and finding themselves on the street because they have nowhere to go. But our government is making great strides toward our goal of ending chronic homelessness by 2025. One of the ways we’re accomplishing this is through the province’s transitional housing system.", "Transitional housing serves an important role within Ontario’s housing system. In addition to being a person’s temporary home, it provides a mix of appropriate support services for people who are in vulnerable situations. For example, people with mental health and addiction issues or survivors of domestic violence may access these services. Whatever their needs, transitional housing helps people to become more independent and move to longer-term stable housing in their community.", "Currently, the Residential Tenancies Act does not define transitional housing and does not outline specific rules or responsibilities for transitional housing providers. Some transitional housing providers offer programs of up to one year that are fully exempt from the Residential Tenancies Act. However, these organizations have told us that many of their participants require more than one year to successfully complete the objectives of the program and find suitable and affordable long-term housing. As a result of these short timelines, some clients are not receiving the temporary housing and support services they need to become independent.", "To help us understand how the province could facilitate better outcomes for people in transitional housing programs, we consulted stakeholders on potential amendments to the RTA, Residential Tenancies Act. These amendments aim to provide flexibility for transitional housing providers while ensuring that clients in vulnerable situations have appropriate protections. We consulted with transitional housing providers, tenant and landlord advocacy organizations, municipal service managers and indigenous organizations. We also spoke to approximately 70 people who have lived experience in transitional housing programs.", "We heard from the transitional housing providers that, due to the nature of their programs, they need an exemption from the Residential Tenancies Act, and if transitional housing programs were to remain under the act, providers might not be able to enforce rules that are critical to the program’s success, such as restricting visitors or prohibiting drug use or substance abuse.", "Throughout the consultations we also learned about how transitional housing programs affected participants’ lives. For some, participating in a transitional housing program helped them adjust to a new life in Canada and acted as a stepping stone to pursue education and employment. For others, it helped them to overcome addiction, trauma and other challenges, and to relearn life skills they lost after years of homelessness and housing instability.", "Participants told us it often takes more than a year to successfully complete a program and find suitable and affordable longer-term housing. To illustrate this point I’d like to share this quote from a participant in Covenant House’s program, just one of the many testimonials we heard. She said, “Everyone who enters the transitional housing program ... has to attend school or work. And, if you’re in school, it’s challenging to fulfill your school duties as well as the life skills commitments of the program. We need more time. I think if we had the option to stay longer that would be better.”", "During these discussions with participants, we also heard that most if not all participants signed written agreements to enter into the program. Participants understand their rights and responsibilities under the program, and that restrictions like most curfews or disallowing guests were necessary in order to operate the program successfully.", "With the one minute I have left, I just want to reiterate some of the important aspects that we bring to the fore.", "Changes to the act, this legislation, will provide more protection for renters and will make for a far more robust Residential Tenancies Act as we go forward in the future. We’ve all heard stories about untenable, unconscionable rises in rent over the past few months—stories that really break your heart. We have to make sure, through legislation such as this, that does not happen again, that tenants are treated fairly, and that we have a system that provides stability for families to put down roots in communities they love." ],

Obviously, we want to go after those. But why wouldn’t they go after the people who are actually doing this, instead of whitewashing like they do and trying to make everything look like it’s going to be a perfect scenario at the end of the day? In this case, again, he talked about tenants. I believe that tenants—in some cases in this proposed legislation—are the latest affordability victims in Wynne’s Ontario, where a shortage of supply and high costs for landlords have been forcing up rents. In many of our areas, we have challenges with not having enough affordable housing, but they put in restrictions there that make it prohibitive for a landlord or builder to say, “I want to do that.”", "I just had a gentleman approach me on the weekend. He knows that there is a need, but he said, “We need the government to come forward so that it’s actually viable for us to build this type of housing, so that there are solutions for people who are in need out there.”", "We’re facing a housing crisis because of a lack of supply, and this bill will make the problem worse by discouraging new rental buildings and second units in houses. They already know that people are scrambling and can’t find enough housing, and yet they put in restrictions and new legislation that’s going to impede even more of that.", "At the end of the day, the challenge is that they’ve taken an affordability problem and made it worse. Over the last six weeks, every time they mused about rent controls, landlords increased their rents in many cases, in case it was their last chance. This bill will only be retroactive to April 20, meaning that many of these increases won’t be covered.", "The government needs to take real action to address red tape and the barriers to building more housing in Ontario, and to work with the development community and builders and landlords who want to go out there and provide good, affordable housing for people in need, and ensure that they’re not putting more red tape, more legislation, more bureaucracy in place so that the builders say, “I don’t have the opportunity to make money, so I’m not going to build more housing,” even though they’ve identified in many of our communities that there is a need and they’re prepared to step forward.", "The government needs to start working before they put legislation; not go out and consult after, like they are with our school closings." ],

They are a blunt instrument, and the fear is that, with rent controls, we might actually—but what we have done is very different. It’s a comprehensive plan.", "If the member from Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound had read the entire 16-point plan, he’d see that we are working with the development community. We’re making changes to the property tax rules around multi-residential housing, and it’s going a long way to provide the incentives the development community needs in order to do exactly what was suggested, to build more tenancy buildings, not the least of which—and I’ve said it before—is the notion that we’re going to change the property tax on multi-residential units so you’re not paying four times the property tax that you would if you built the same unit that was in a condo structure.", "To the NDP’s comments that they have been behind this, it was only, what, three weeks, four weeks ago that the member opposite from Toronto–Danforth actually brought his private member’s bill. The coincidence—and I’m sure it was just a coincidence, because we see him do this time and time again. When he hears our members asking that member, our Minister of Housing, questions about affordability, he knows, “Oh, my God, something’s about to come. I’d better jump all over this. I’d better take credit for this and put a private member’s bill.” He did the same thing when I did my daycare wait-list fees.", "We have not a blunt instrument, which was the NDP approach, to just change what they call the loophole. We have a very comprehensive, a very large, complex suite of programs which will address affordability problems, and I’m very proud about it." ],

There are more forms they have to sign; there’s more of this, more of that. I look at this bill and I look at some of the things that are in it, and I can see this happening very easily.", "One of the things holding back development, certainly in my riding and in different spots in the province, is the red tape issue. You go through years of trying to get a development approved by anybody. There’s all kinds of different levels of bureaucracy you have to go through. It changes from here to there, in different areas. It frustrates anyone who wants to get into the rental business, and as we are seeing where I live, we have a lack of rental units in our area. It’s very frustrating, if you can’t afford to own a home, that there aren’t the rental units around that there should be. I do know that there has been some movement to try to correct that, but again I get back to red tape and also the costs of building new rental units. You know, a metre of concrete costs the same whether you’re putting it into an affordable housing unit or a new home. So contractors are standing back a little bit and waiting to see how some of this stuff unfolds. But I do believe the real issue with some of this is the red tape issue that we’ve been trying to correct for a number of years." ],

The fact is, the 1991 exemption, which was put in place with a promise that there would be lots of purpose-built rental constructed, did not achieve that objective. Out of 1.45 million housing completions in Ontario between 1992—the year after that was put in place—and 2016, purpose-built private rental units accounted for just 6%, or around 93,000 units. So, clearly, it’s not working.", "Despite this evidence, the official opposition refuses to accept that rent controls do not impact the construction of rental units. The official opposition’s pitch is simple, in my mind, in its code. When they talk about increasing supply, what I really think they’re talking about is paving over the greenbelt and hoping that prices will plummet.", "By passing this bill, a quarter of a million more people will be protected from unreasonable rent hikes. With the pre-1991 rental units continuing to appreciate in value, and attracting new capital investment, the evidence shows that Ontario’s version of rent control allows landlords to make a fair return on their investment." ],

If anybody has ever pruned an apple tree, you can see what this government is like. It just keeps growing and growing and growing, and it gets twisted and gnarled, up, to the point where no more fruit grows on that tree unless it is pruned and trimmed.

It’s absolutely incredible that this government would rely on historically failed policies as a solution to the problems that they keep creating themselves.", "There is a significant problem of housing affordability. We’ve seen the magnitude of the increase in housing down here has been unsustainable.

We will be talking about an even greater shortage of rental housing 10 years from now. We will be talking about the same problems that led to this bill, but we’ll be speaking to them in even greater and more imminent and more credible terms, because this bill does not address any of the problems.", "Creating two new bureaucracies to advise the government about the barriers to development—Lord jumpin’, Speaker.

But basically, if there is no supply, you have a whole whack of demand, and that is what we see, not in economic terms, but in personal terms, every day in our constituency office: that person after person who comes through our doors looking for housing can’t find it because the supply isn’t there; the inventory isn’t there.

When I mention that, I mean, of course, the greenbelt plan, the growth plan, the Niagara Escarpment Plan, the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan. I’m not sure, but I think he was referencing those plans as somehow perhaps being responsible—for what he describes as being responsible for what he describes as being fundamental to the issue of housing affordability. Obviously, on this side of the House, we don’t agree with that. We think these policies largely are important and well received.", "Given the significant population growth that has occurred in the GTHA over the last number of years and given that it is expected that by 2031 or 2041 there will be four million more people coming to work, live and make their home and their families in this region of Canada, I think it’s all the more important that we have these sorts of land use policies in place to help guide that growth.

  "text" : [ "Thanks a lot, Mr. Speaker; we tried. I guess they’ll just have to listen to me for a fair bit this afternoon, then.", "Mr. Speaker, there are a lot of things that I’m going to cover today. The budget was a big challenge in many ways. I’m going to start off by suggesting that it was not a balanced budget. They’re using $5 billion of either unusual or one-time revenues to try to suggest to people that they have balanced the budget. They can try to spin it however they want to the people of Ontario; we know what they’ve done. The people of Ontario will see through the charade and they will know what they’ve done.", "They’re hiding $5-billion operational deficits through cash grabs like the sale of Hydro One—which, once it’s gone, it’s gone; there’s no bringing it back; unauthorized pension assets, which the Auditor General has recommended to them they shouldn’t use; and one-time unusual revenues like the sale of the LCBO and OPG head offices here in Toronto. Once you sell those, they’re gone. You don’t get to do this again next year and the year after and the year after.", "The Financial Accountability Officer has already told them that they’ll be back into a structural deficit by trying to play this shell game. It’s unacceptable. They’re trying to cook the books a year before the election. They’re trying to get their speaking points out and say that all is good in the province of Ontario; everything is wonderful; it’s all good. But the people in my riding of Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound—that’s not what they’re hearing and it’s certainly not what they’re telling me when I go home each weekend to see what’s really happening in our area.", "They are telling me that things are harder under the Liberals. They’re struggling under hydro bills. They can’t get mental health. Schools are closing. Hospitals are starting to actually look at, in some cases, stopping operations in some of their facilities because of budget cuts. All of the waste that they’ve had over their 14 years is coming home to roost, and sadly, it’s on the backs of youth—our school closings—on seniors in our hospitals and everybody obviously in our hospitals, and in our long-term-care homes.", "Again, they promised 30,000 redeveloped beds, Mr. Speaker. They’re nowhere even near that. For two years in estimates, I’ve been asking them, “Just give me the game plan. Tell me where you were going to build them and what year you were going to build them.” They don’t even give me that. To me, that was just a number that sounded good at election time: “We are going to redevelop 30,000 beds.” It’s not happening. I’ve confronted them and told them that there are 26,500 seniors currently sitting on a waiting list, waiting to get into a facility. That’s going to grow to 50,000 in six years. Not one bed was actually announced in last week’s budget. So what are those people—and not just the person who needs the bed. What about the caregiver? What about the family who is struggling to keep these people at home currently—of where they will go? Those are true-life issues.", "They want to talk to us about all kinds of things in the budget that they think are wonderful. It is not wonderful out there. It’s a patchwork. It’s an attempt to fix the mess they’ve created over their 14 years. They’ve doubled the debt. Again, these aren’t my numbers; these are the Auditor General numbers that I’m putting out. We’ll be at over $330 billion. We’re spending $12 billion a year in interest payments just to service our debt. Not one cent of that goes to mental health; not one cent of that goes to social housing or affordable housing; not one cent of that goes to the less fortunate in our society, and none of it goes to our youth—$12 billion a year. This has been every year since I arrived here almost six years ago.", "At the end of the day, they are not doing anything to truly address the problems. It’s a patchwork. They want to pretend. They want people to think the world’s—they’ll bring out stats that make it look like they’re doing fine, but you actually go back and ask the people. You ask the people who own small businesses, you ask the seniors on limited revenues, you ask people who are less fortunate what they’re getting, and you ask people who are needing social services—all of them tell me that life has gotten harder and worse under these Liberals.", "We asked them for a number of budget requests that would start to address a number of these challenges, and they did not do that. I’m going to go through a few items here, Mr. Speaker, just to share some of the reality.", "As I just said, Ontario used to be the leader of Confederation, used to be the province that was pulling everyone else along for our great Confederation. We are now the largest subnational debtor in the world: $300 billion and climbing is our debt—more than doubled. The rest of our history of our province was $129 billion. They’ve doubled that in 14 years, and it continues to go in the wrong direction. How could we, in good conscience, stand here and applaud them for doing that, particularly to the students in front of you, our great pages in front of you, Mr. Speaker?", "We pay $12 billion in debt. That’s more than they spend on post-secondary education. I don’t think most people, if they were given a chance, would say, “We want you to spend more on debt payments than on post-secondary education.” They spend more on that than on important youth programs like autism—only $4.4 billion spent on autism, but $12 billion on the debt.", "They spend—it’s projected to be $312 billion this year, which is 24% more than just five years ago, and will go up another 8% in two years, to $336 billion. The number is so big, I think, sadly, many people in Ontario can’t even get their head around that. They don’t know what $336 billion even means. But I can tell you, it’s a lot of woe for our next generation. They’re going to be paying off what we have done to them. Not we—the Liberals, because it’s been their decision. They’ve had the majority government. They made the decision despite the official opposition challenging and trying to hold them accountable and hold their feet to the fire.", "In a similar matter, some people confuse the debt and the deficit. Again, here they use one-time and unusual revenue. They’re hiding more than $5 billion in operational deficit. They’re getting $1 billion on a one-time sale of government buildings and the sell-off of Hydro One. They’re hoping for $2 billion on cap-and-trade, but they’ve followed California—not a great example. In the last auction they had there, it didn’t come anywhere near that. So what happens when you budget for $2 billion and it doesn’t come in? They’ll go and borrow more money, Mr. Speaker, and make it even worse. And let’s not forget in these notes—these are historically the lowest interest rates we’ve ever had in our province. What happens when they start—and eventually they will go back up?", "They’re getting $1.5 billion in new federal money; in other words, the Trudeau trust fund that they’re using to reduce the deficit. Is there a guarantee that will come in every year? Because if not, there’s another $1.5 billion that either has to come from new taxes or they cut programs. And over $500 million in pension asset funds—which I have already said the Auditor General specifically did not authorize.", "Many times in this House, particularly in the last couple of months, I’ve talked about school closings: very near and dear to my heart, particularly single-community schools. When you take the school out, people start to leave. It makes the challenge that much tougher, not just for the school enrolment that they keep saying is a challenge, but that whole community starts to falter. The little grocery store; does it stay in business? The little gas station; does it stay in business? How do those students get any extracurricular activities? They’re going to put kids on buses for an hour and a half in some cases to get to school and another hour and a half back. Mr. Speaker, I don’t want to miss this opportunity to suggest: They keep talking about the environment all the time. Why is increased busing not counted into this? What about all those emissions that are going to happen with people riding buses two and three times longer than they currently do now?", "They put a fair bit of money into the budget. They’re sending three people out, apparently, from their caucus to start listening to the school closure issue. Would you, Mr. Speaker, not typically send the people out to listen before you actually decree your direction and your stance? Listening now, when half the schools have been closed—they have actually closed more schools than any other government in history. And there’s still 300 more schools on the chopping block.", "I think there’s a lot of hollow words from the minister when she says, “We’re going to listen”—because we’ve presented various options. We had an opposition day motion in this House. They could have, at that point, said, “We agree. We’ve taken a misstep here. We need to recalibrate. We need to truly care about the kids and listen and not decimate communities and ruin lives.” They could have stepped back and said, “Yes, we will put a moratorium for a year.” But you know why they probably aren’t doing that? Because they’ve run our province into such a hole financially that they need that money. They need to pull it from our schools so that they can go out—because of the waste and mismanagement over their 14 years—to try to make those balanced budgets they want. They want to be able to say before an election, “We balanced the budget.”", "The upcoming budget promises investment in new schools 10 years down the road. The Wynne Liberals are closing schools now. We’re not talking 10 years down the road. We want to ensure we’re talking about today and what’s happening today and the destruction they are going to create when they make these misguided decisions based on their own ideology and their need to cover up—sorry. I withdraw, Mr. Speaker. I didn’t mean that as “cover up”—but when they are trying to cover over what is happening in their government. At the end of the day, there are 300 more schools on the chopping block. I can’t imagine I could stand on that side of the House and portray to be the government of education, knowing that they’ve actually closed more schools than any other government in our province’s history, and there are still more to come.", "Investing in health care: After freezing hospital budgets for many, many years—four straight years—they’re finally trying to play catch-up. And that’s good. I will applaud them for putting some money back in. But what has happened in the four years? What are the challenges that those hospital corporations currently are having because they’ve had four years of that? At the end of the day, you worry: Have they put in enough to truly allow those hospitals to catch up? Have they lost staff? Have they lost valuable practitioners and medical staff that have gone off because they see the writing on the wall that there are cuts coming?", "In my own backyard, Grey Bruce Health Services is having to look at actually removing surgeries out of some of their more rural sites because of the ability to budget for them. Part of that, again, is because of 40% increases in energy and hydro costs. That has to come from somewhere. At the end of the day, they are forced to have a balanced budget. It’s unfortunate that this government doesn’t have the same legislation imposed on them. Then we wouldn’t be in this crisis of a financial situation that we’re seeing.", "Front-line health workers: Nurses are continuing to lose jobs. The doctors are challenged; they are certainly not in a happy place with the current government in the last number of years. Instead of looking at that and saying, “We’re not going to cut more front-line health services,” what they have done is they have focused on growing their health bureaucracy. They’re actually creating 80 new sub-LHINs and 84 new LHIN vice-presidents. Now, yes, you need a bit of planning and, yes, you need strategy, but do you need that many, at the cost of cutting front-line care? Most people who come to me don’t even really understand what a LHIN is or what they do, but they know that they are not getting in for their surgery; they know that there’s a wait-list. They don’t know how to fight bureaucracy and get the service in a timely matter.", "I’m a recreation guy from way back, and I believe it’s better to be proactive and preventive, as opposed to waiting until someone gets sick, missing the diagnosis and having to try to treat them at that point, which is much more costly. People are running to the emergency department because they don’t have family physicians. At the end of the day, those are the very most costly forms of health care we have, as opposed to being more proactive, more preventive, and allowing people in front-line services to get them in, get them diagnosed as quickly as possible and get them on the road to recovery as quickly as possible.", "I had someone last night tell me she waited eight months just to get in to get an assessment for her knee surgery. That was about a year and a half ago. She’s still waiting to actually get in for her surgery. She was hobbling and in great pain. She was saying to me, “Can you believe it, Bill, that in Ontario it takes me that long just to get in to be seen by a specialist, and now I’m still waiting to get in for my surgery?” Luckily, she has the ability to have some help around her through her own family, but what if she didn’t? What if she was on her own? This is unacceptable, how we’re treating people in our great province—and I’m going to reinforce it over and over and over again in my remarks today—because of those challenges with regard to waste, mismanagement and, frankly, just the pure ideology of “We know what’s better” as opposed to addressing the challenges in our system.", "Hydro: As I say, Mr. Speaker, every meeting I go to, whether it’s a business, whether it’s a seniors’ organization, whether it’s with young people buying their first home, the biggest issue most people out there are grappling with is hydro. I can’t take this opportunity and not mention it. The Liberals keep coming out and saying, “We have a relief program for this, and we have a relief program for that, and we have another relief program over here.” Why don’t they do anything to actually take action to stop the issue of why we have to have so much relief?", "Just a month or so ago, whenever they introduced the 18% or 17% cut, as opposed to how they tried to sell it, as a 25% cut—of your money, by the way; it’s taxpayer money coming back to you—what they didn’t share with the people, particularly those pages in front of you, Mr. Speaker, is that they just moved that debt out by 10 years. It’s going to cost our province, the taxpayers of Ontario, an additional $25 billion. Again, that’s at today’s historically low interest rates. What happens if, in five years, those rates go up by 2%, 3% or 4%? Invariably, at some point, those rates will start to go back up. How much will that cost that generation at that time, and what programs and services will then be cut? If they continue to follow their trajectory of overspending and not living within their means, then those debt payments become bigger, and even less services and programs are available to the great people of our province.", "They’re selling Hydro One. You campaigned, Mr. Speaker; I campaigned. I don’t recall that ever being in an election platform. You would have thought that, if they were truly sincere and wanted to show their integrity and show their accountability, they would have said to the people of Ontario, “We’re coming to your front door. We’re going to take Hydro One and we’re going to sell it off, a one-time fire sale, to make us look good, and I want you to vote on that.”", "That would have been the absolute defining moment of an election. I’m pretty certain that we would have gotten there, and we wouldn’t be in this situation today where there would be a fire sale.", "Once Hydro One is gone—a $750-million net revenue to this province—it’s gone forever. You can’t put it back together. As much as I believe the NDP are saying that they’ll take it and put it all back together, some of those shares are already sold; you’re not getting them back. Hopefully, they won’t go forward with any more sales, and we can actually try to make some sense out of it.", "The Green Energy Act is going to cost us $133 billion. Speaker, again, I ask you: Is that truly, for about 5% of the overall grid—if it was ever all running at the same time, it’s about 5% of our grid.", "We are fully supportive of climate and environment, but we have to do it in a strategic manner. We have to do it in a manner where there are actually actions that are proving to be helpful to all Ontarians, and not just go again down the path of ideology.", "It comes up continually. Since 2009, Ontario—and many people say it this way—has given $6 billion. It’s not quite that simple; in fact, it’s worse. We actually pay other jurisdictions—the United States and Quebec—to take our surplus energy. We’ve paid them $6 billion to take our surplus energy, which makes their manufacturing community doubly competitive against our own Ontario businesses. There’s not one word that they can defend that with. They just keep saying it’s just part of business and it’s the way we go, and it’s all in the spirit of “we’re going to save the planet.”", "Mr. Speaker, there are other ways to do environmental programs that are actually going to be of value and show some actual benefit and change in our province and in our country.", "They’re so out of touch. They spent nearly $1 million on partisan advertising to spin their plan, and they’re approving $4.5-million executive salaries at Hydro One.", "This partisan advertising absolutely drives me crazy. There are people out there who aren’t getting their payments, their supports, their programs and their services, yet the government comes out and, instead of relief going to the families that need it for their hydro bills, most of it is going to consultants, with, I think, $9.2 million, and another $2.3 million for the advertising campaign. They stripped the Auditor General of being able to have actual teeth in saying, “I approve,” “I don’t approve,” and that’s a partisan ad or it’s not.", "If they did that, it leads you to believe they did it for a reason. They wanted to be able to continue to do what they want to do on their agenda, and utilize taxpayers’ money for their benefit and their gain, to stay in power.", "It’s unacceptable that people are going without when there was $10 million or $12 million on the table. They should have had that money going to the front line, to help them with their day-to-day needs, with their energy costs, with their ability to provide services.", "We’ve already said, particularly with regard to Hydro One, that we’ll get rid of the Green Energy Act before it costs us that $133 billion. We’ll dismantle that Green Energy Act, or the “bad contracts act,” as we like to call it; we’ll stop the fire sale of Hydro One; and we’ll rein in exorbitant executive compensation in every sector.", "I’m going to move on to housing. They say they have a plan to increase the supply. In fact, the budget shows they’re reducing supply. It shows that housing construction starts are projected to go down next year by almost 10%, or—" ],

It shows that housing construction starts are projected to go down next year by almost 10%, or 6,500 housing construction starts. At the same time, they’re cashing in huge because of higher housing resale prices. They’re collecting more on the land transfer tax than ever before—again, a concern I have with regard to that.", "Mr. Speaker, I want to talk a little bit again—my critic role is long-term care. I started off with a few comments. We all know that the aging boomers gap is coming at us. The baby boomer generation is upon us. They should have been doing this planning 14 years ago. They should have had the solutions in place, as opposed to now, still just kind of blindly pretending that it’s not coming at us. Not one new bed was budgeted in the budget. I think the words they used were, “We’re encouraging the private sector to build more beds.” Well, they’ve been “encouraging” a lot of things to happen in 14 years, but tell that to the senior who has been sitting at home wondering where that bed is going to be. Ask the senior’s family member, who is getting battered and beaten down because they’re trying to provide that care to their loved one when there’s no bed in sight.", "We would have hoped they would have listened. We’ve been working with all of the long-term-care associations to push the government and ask them to take some kind of action to give people hope, to give them the thought process that at least this government truly cares about seniors.", "I will give them a little bit of credit. They put in some money for food for seniors, which is good. Partly, though, that’s because we in this House pushed them and said that it’s a crime that seniors in long-term-care facilities were getting less allotted per day than prisoners. We asked them to gauge that to the consumer price index every year. They did not agree to do that, but at least they put some money in there for that.", "There are still, as I said, considerable concerns. They cut $47 million from the agriculture budget. Mr. Speaker, where does our food come from—the healthy food that we all need—if we aren’t supporting our agriculture industry? Every day in here when the Minister of Agriculture gets a chance to speak, he stands up and trumpets the flag that he’s the greatest guy to support agriculture in the world. I’m not certain how he’s going to go out and talk to all those agricultural groups and tell them, “Yes, I did a really good job. I got $47 million cut from the budget for you to be able to continue to invest in your business and your livelihoods out there.”", "We continue to hear about mental health housing. Dr. Susan Boron, from my backyard, “called it a crisis and warned that it could ... turn into a publicity nightmare for the province.” Today we’re wearing pins addressing mental health and yet, Mr. Speaker, there are many organizations—and individuals, more importantly—out there very concerned with where the government isn’t going and what they’re not doing, because they continue to waste.", "I’m going to recap a couple of numbers:", "—$1.2 billion in gas plants and not one thing to show for it except a barren piece of land to remind us of what a boondoggle it was;", "—eHealth: $8 billion they’ve wasted on that, and I think if you were to ask anyone in your riding, they would probably suggest to you that there is no eHealth program that they access and actually have working for them; and", "—the Green Energy Act: $133 billion for a bunch of companies that they’re ideologically supporting, trying to make people across this province believe that they’ve done the right thing.", "Mr. Speaker, there are a lot of challenges. This budget is going to need a lot more scrutiny. It’s going to need a lot more discussion.", "I’m going to turn it over to my colleagues soon because I believe many more people are going to weigh in on this. It’s a challenge. The debt payments scare me—the deficit that they continue to run year after year. They say they balanced the budget this year, but there’s a $5-billion gaping hole. If they truly are sincere, they’ll show trust and integrity and truly tell the people of Ontario that they didn’t balance.", "At the end of the day, we’re going to have a hard time justifying how you would support—they’ve thrown in a few baubles to try to make it go that way, but at the end of the day, they haven’t changed their ways. They haven’t addressed the problems. They’re structurally going to be back in deficit very shortly, Mr. Speaker, and we’re spending $12 billion on interest payments. That doesn’t help anyone in this great province of Ontario." ],

C’est un petit encadré qu’il y a dans le budget. Tout le monde est bien excité. Mais lorsqu’on essaie de voir où est cet argent-là, et comment on fait pour s’assurer que cet argent va venir cette année pendant qu’il y a encore un gouvernement libéral majoritaire et que ce n’est pas une promesse qui est faite pour les trois prochaines années—parce qu’en ce moment, lorsque moi je regarde dans le budget, je ne peux pas trouver où sont les 3,2 millions de dollars qui ont été mis dans un encadré dans le budget pour la Place des Arts à Sudbury.", "Donc, autant que je voudrais être capable de me réjouir du fait que la Place des Arts va finalement recevoir un financement du côté de la province, c’est difficile de faire ça quand je suis députée et que mon rôle à moi est de m’assurer que les promesses qui sont faites vont venir. C’est important de comprendre que lorsqu’il y a des choses comme ça que les gens voient dans le budget, automatiquement ils assument que, « Oh! C’est écrit dans le budget. On va recevoir cet argent dans une couple de jours, une couple de semaines au plus tard. » Mais plusieurs des promesses qui sont faites viennent avec une période de temps de trois ans, cinq ans ou 10 ans. Donc, on fait des promesses à long terme quand on sait très bien qu’il y a bien des chances qu’ils ne seront pas là pour garder ces promesses à long terme.", "Une des promesses—et j’espère que quelqu’un du côté des libéraux va se lever pour dire, « France, ne t’en fais pas; c’est parce que t’as manqué la page, et puis, oui, c’est vraiment là. » Il y a 294 pages dans ce budget. À date, je n’en vois pas, sur aucune de ces pages, où on dit d’où vont venir les 3,2 millions de dollars pour la Place des Arts de Sudbury, et que ça va venir cette année, pas après la prochaine élection. Donc, on va avoir le droit d’avoir des commentaires de deux minutes. Les libéraux auront deux commentaires de deux minutes à faire sur ma présentation. J’espère qu’ils vont en profiter pour me dire exactement où dans le budget on va retrouver les 3,2 millions de dollars pour la Place des Arts et également me donner des garanties que ces 3,2 millions, ce n’est pas une promesse qui nous est faite pour les trois prochaines années mais une promesse qui nous est faite et qui est absolument dans le budget 2017-2018 et qui va se passer pendant l’exercice financier en cours.", "Donc, j’ai bien hâte d’avoir les commentaires là-dessus, parce qu’à date je l’ai déjà demandé à plusieurs personnes, et il n’y a personne qui a été capable de me rassurer. Donc, c’est le temps. Si vous avez des « réassurements »—je ne sais pas si c’est un mot, ça. Mais en tout cas, si vous pouvez me rassurer, c’est maintenant ou jamais. J’aimerais ça qu’on me montre où on peut trouver ça dans le budget.", "Bien entendu, du côté des services en français, j’aurais aimé voir du financement pour les centres de santé communautaire francophones, que l’on demande un peu partout dans la province. Ça fait longtemps qu’il y a des communautés qui attendent. Je vous dirais qu’il y a des communautés qui attendent depuis 2007 pour avoir accès à des services en français, des soins primaires en français, la promotion de la santé, le développement communautaire et la prévention de la maladie. Il me semble que cela aurait été un bon temps pour investir. On voit déjà quelles sont les conséquences, du fait qu’il y a tellement de gens que moi je représente, de francophones et d’anglophones, qui ne sont pas capables d’avoir accès aux services de soins primaires.", "Qu’est-ce que ça veut dire? Ça veut dire que ces gens-là se ramassent dans la salle d’urgence, et on voit les conséquences de ça : les temps d’attente dans les salles d’urgence de l’Ontario sont les plus longs depuis 10 ans. Ça fait des années que le gouvernement libéral dit qu’une des priorités est de diminuer les temps d’attente pour les salles d’urgence. Pourtant, bien qu’on nous le promette année après année, les temps d’attente sont les plus longs des 10 dernières années.", "Ça m’emène également à regarder un peu un autre de mes dossiers, les soins de santé.", "The budget did show that in health care there will be a hospital-sector-wide increase of 3%, with all hospitals receiving a minimum 2% increase. This means that the increase to our hospitals will not keep up with inflation and population growth. I must say that not very often do we hear our hospitals going on the record telling the ministry and everybody else that just to maintain what they already have, just to maintain the long wait-lists in our emergency rooms, just to maintain the 1,200 beds that are not funded, just to maintain the overcrowding of our hospitals, where every nook and cranny in hallways and patient lounges and rooms is being used as a hospital room that should have never been designed as a hospital room—just to do this, to maintain where we’re at, they needed 5%. What we’re seeing in the budget is that they will get 2%. I’m worried, Speaker; I’m worried.", "The situation in the hospitals in the north is not pretty. But now, it’s starting to be not only in northern Ontario that the situation in our hospitals is becoming worrisome; it is throughout our big community hospitals, and it’s actually starting to show its ugly face even down here on University Avenue, in some of our tertiary and quaternary hospitals here in Toronto. We’ve never seen that before, Speaker—never.", "Our health care system was something that we could all be proud of. Yes, every now and again there was—I don’t know—a community-acquired pneumonia going on someplace and that hospital would have a tough time, or a case of the flu going on in another community where that hospital would have a tough time, but we’re way past that. We’re way past that. Our hospitals don’t have any surge capacity anymore because they are all full or overfull. And what does this government say? They say that our hospitals will get a 2% increase when hospitals have spoken clearly that they needed at least 5% to maintain—we’re not talking about undoing the damage that has been done by four years of budget freezes for our hospitals and a year with a 1% increase. All in all, if we go back the last 10 years, our hospitals haven’t had enough to keep up with the cost of living and population growth.", "You have to realize that when you’re talking about hospital services, many of the operational expenses of hospitals are way above the cost of inflation. If you look at the cost of drugs in our hospitals, they are in double-digit increases year after year. All of the new drugs that come into the market come at really, really high costs. Whether we look at the new biologics or we look at the new chemotherapy or we look at the new drugs coming onto the market, they all come at a really high cost, which means that the overall cost of drugs for a hospital don’t go up by 2%; they go up by 10%, 11% and 12% year after year. So to go from percentages to an amount, what had been put on the record is that our hospitals needed a minimum of $850 million to keep the status quo, and the government is offering $518 million. This is $300 million short of what our hospitals needed.", "Of course, when you just say our hospitals are getting a budget increase of $518 million, nobody knows what that means. Those are huge numbers. Unless you follow health care, like it is my job to do, and know how much is being spent, those numbers look really big. When you put them in percentage points, you realize that no, they were not that big.", "Then it brings me to the need for pharmacare. I have nothing against giving children access to medication. We looked at the number that the government used; the number says there are four million people between the ages of zero and 24, and I don’t doubt that. But I want to be clear that there are not four million children without access to drugs. In that four million, we have all of the kids who live with parents who receive OW and ODSP; they are already covered. We have all of the children who are covered by a private drug plan because their parents happen to have a drug plan—very lucky parents, but there are some—so to say that this would help four million youth is not exactly dead on.", "I have no problem with giving children and youth access to drugs, but I have a big problem when we leave 2.2 million Ontarians with nothing. There are 2.2 million Ontarians above youth, 12 to 65—because at 65 you get on the Ontario Drug Benefit Program—in that age category who have nothing. Most of them struggle, and most of them cannot buy the drugs they need.", "Did you know, Speaker, that of this cohort who work, of all of the people who work under the age of 65, although they have a job, they have a paid income, one in three does not have a drug plan? They are added to the people who have nothing at all. What does that mean? That means a lot of hardship for a lot of people. That means the dream that Tommy Douglas had brought forward, that care would be based on need, not on ability to pay, is just that—a dream—because if you have access to your physician or your nurse practitione free of charge and you end up with a prescription and you don’t have the money to fill it, then it is all for nothing. For 2.2 million Ontarians, it is all for nothing because they can’t afford to buy the medicine that they need, or the choices that they end up having to make to be able to pay for those drugs mean going without a lot of other things.", "Health does not just happen. We all know that the determinants of health play a huge role in keeping people healthy. We all know that the number one way to identify who will be healthy and who will not is your income. For every $1,000 more of income you get, you are a little bit healthier. If you look at the one in three workers that work precarious jobs with no benefits and often with poor pay, they are more at risk of poor health. When you look at the 2.2 million people who have no benefits at all, they are more at risk of poor health.", "Medicine has changed greatly, and continues to evolve. A lot of the care that you need, once you have a diagnosis, once there is an illness or a disease—most of that treatment comes from drugs right now, and all sorts of different medicines. If you cannot have access to those medicines, then it is all for nothing. We all know that the burden of disease is not shared equally. Certainly, for people who live in poverty, poor education and even the neighbourhood that you live in will have an impact on your health. There are many things that impact your health, but certainly having access to the medicine you need is something that could be a game-changer.", "When Tommy Douglas brought medicare forward, he started with hospital care in Saskatchewan. Once the hospital care was established, he grew it to include physician services. Then he was the champion to make sure that not only Saskatchewan had this but that it was throughout our country—ten provinces. There were two territories at the time; there are now three. We can all be proud of medicare. We have to follow the same path towards pharmacare. It has to be accessible to all. It has to be universal, as when Tommy Douglas started medicare.", "The point about the way the NDP rolled out our pharmacare program is that it allows us to build the infrastructure to negotiate better prices for our drugs. It is shameful that the same series of drugs, if you go to the US and ask their veterans affairs—because they pay for the drugs for all veterans—they average 67% cheaper drug costs than we do. If we were to purchase this series of drugs for 13.4 million Ontarians, we would be in a position to negotiate better drug prices like we have never been able to negotiate before. Those savings would allow us to expand towards a fully universal and comprehensive pharmacare, which is something that I hope the government will look at seriously.", "Unfortunately, my 20 minutes is almost over and I still have lots of other parts that I wanted to talk about. How come there’s no money for Grassy Narrows? We have brought this issue forward so, so many times. It is time to clean up the mess in Grassy Narrows. You have made the point that you care about those people. Well, show that you care by putting some money aside so we can start the cleanup so that the population doesn’t have to live with mercury poisoning. But it’s not in the budget." ],

First of all, this is a budget that really reflects the hard work of people across Ontario and members of this government. If you look at what has happened in this budget, this is the culmination of years of work to arrive at a balanced budget. That is because of a strong-performing economy across Ontario. We are outpacing the G7 in growth, and we are outpacing the rest of Canada in growth. But it is also the result of the fact that this government has worked incredibly hard to make sure that we do our best to focus on outcomes, to focus on results, to make sure we’re spending taxpayers’ dollars wisely. That’s really at the root of being able to balance the budget.", "What balancing the budget has allowed us to do is to invest even more in the priorities that Ontarians hold dear.

The PCs have become nothing more than the party of no, and their stall tactics in the Legislature are only designed to slow the progress we’re trying to make here for the people of Ontario, for people of our respective communities, for people in my community in Etobicoke Centre.", "Amongst other things, Speaker, the budget bill, if passed, would also give workers chronic and mental health stress benefits, and provide Ontarians with better access to health care, but—", "Interjections." ],

  "text" : [ "Thanks very much, Speaker. Amongst other things, the budget bill would, if passed, give workers chronic and mental stress benefits, and provide Ontarians with better access to health care by giving nurses the authority to write prescriptions.", "In addition to the budget bill, the PCs are also stalling bills to make roads safer for children and to give municipal councillors better parental leave benefits. Now they’re pushing back against OHIP+, mental health benefits, helping nurses provide more services to our communities, and billions in health care investments.", "As I said at the outset, I came here because I stand for something, as do my fellow caucus colleagues. They stand for making the lives of the people in their communities stronger and better. This budget is designed to do that.", "The PCs have not put forward plans of their own in these various areas that we’ve talked about, and many others. Not only are they not putting forward their own plans; now they’re trying to stall the plan that we’re trying to move forward.", "I’m really disappointed in the PCs, and I wanted to make sure that the members of this House and the folks watching at home understood that the PCs are stalling the work we’re trying to do here.", "What I did want to do was talk to the work that we are doing here. When we think about the quality of life of the people of Ontario, foundational to that is the health of our economy. When you look at what’s happening—if you look at economic growth in Ontario and you compare it to other provinces, if you compare it to other G7 countries, you can see that we’re outpacing them in terms of growth. I think it’s a testament to the people of Ontario that our economy is performing so well. It’s incredible to see the progress we’ve made since the depths of the recession, economically, as a province.", "That, in combination with some very, very hard work by folks here in the government—the President of the Treasury Board, the Minister of Finance and our entire caucus and cabinet—in working to balance the budget, in working to find ways to spend money more wisely, has allowed us to balance the budget. This in turn has allowed us to make investments in important areas. I’m incredibly proud of that.", "When the recession hit, we made a deliberate choice to invest in the economy, to protect vital services like health care and education. As the President of the Treasury Board was alluding to just a few moments ago, we set out a path to return to balance.", "What’s incredibly interesting about this is that we’ve done this while making record investments in infrastructure. This budget here has $190 billion over 13 years in infrastructure investment.", "We didn’t do what that party did, the PC Party, when they were in office, and slash and burn public services. We went out and we took a thoughtful, methodical approach to making sure we were getting better value for money and to balancing the budget while investing in the services that the people of Ontario really care about.", "Those investments in infrastructure that I’m talking about include things like building schools and hospitals and transit.", "We also know that when infrastructure investments are made, private sector investment also increases, businesses are more productive, and real wages rise. So it’s thanks to these investments, thanks to the work of the people of Ontario, thanks to the work we’ve done together, that our economy is performing so well, and it’s thanks to this that we’ve been able to balance the budget.", "Just to give some quick figures about our economic performance: Since the recession, almost 700,000 new jobs have been created. March’s unemployment rate was at 6.4 %. That’s below the national unemployment rate of 6.7% for 24 consecutive months. We’re leading Canada in foreign direct investment, and that’s ahead of California, ahead of Ohio, ahead of Michigan. Exports are up. Retail sales are up 4.8% since 2015. Housing starts are up over 24% from January, and Canadians are flocking to Ontario at the fastest rate in 29 years.", "As someone who studied economics, who studied business, who worked in business, who looked at these indicators in advising my clients in business, I know how important these indicators are. These are strong indicators that Ontario’s economy is performing well, and a very good sign. That doesn’t mean there is not more work to be done, but this is a very good sign.", "It’s interesting to hear some of the members of the PC caucus rise and speak. Aside from just trying to delay the budget, what they have said has been about tearing down this budget. They’ve talked about how they, effectively, obviously want us to make cuts to services that people rely on. I guess what I’m not clear on is—on the one hand, during this debate they’ve talked about the cuts that they would like us to make, and then they rise in question period and demand to know why investments haven’t been made in their communities. It’s very difficult to understand what the PC Party is really standing for. Again, I gather it’s the party that stands for nothing except delaying the good work that people here are trying to do on this side.", "They talk a lot about the debt. When I hear the PCs talking about debt, I find it shocking to hear some of the things that the PCs are saying. The PC Party is the party that increased the debt by 53% when they were in office. They make it sound as though they’re very concerned about bringing the debt down. Their track record is awful on this account, Speaker.", "This is the party, the PC Party, that kept hidden from the people of Ontario a $5.6-billion budget deficit and then took the 407, sold it well under value—so, wasted taxpayers’ dollars—and used that to balance the budget. Now they’re rising up and talking to us about how to manage debt. I think you can see from the work that the team on this side has done—the President of the Treasury Board, the Minister of Finance, the Premier and others—that in balancing the budget we’ve taken a thoughtful, methodical approach—this is not to mention all the slashing and burning that they did in public services and the damage they did to health care and education during their time in office.", "The other thing that the PCs have been talking about, Speaker, is this issue around sub-national debt, the amount of debt we have as a sub-national jurisdiction. I think it’s really important that people at home and people in the House understand that it’s inappropriate to compare Ontario with many other sub-national jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons for that. One is that there are different accounting approaches in different jurisdictions; that’s the first. For example, in Ontario, we account for pension liabilities as part of our debt and we don’t use our capital assets to reduce our net debt. That’s the first thing.", "You also have to think about the services that Ontario provides in comparison to the services that other sub-national jurisdictions provide. For example, in Ontario we provide health care, including OHIP+. We provide education, highways and transportation, and sustainable social welfare programs. In California, for example—I know that the PCs like to reference California—health care is delivered by private insurance companies; education is provided by the local, not the state government; their highways are the most congested in the country and in the second-worst condition; and social welfare programs are delivered by the federal government. So to compare Ontario to other sub-national jurisdictions is an apples-to-oranges comparison, Speaker, and really is misleading people about the fact that Ontario carries a much larger burden in terms of providing services within its jurisdiction than do these other sub-national jurisdictions.", "I’d like to go back to what the budget does for people—and one of them is the investments in health care. We’re increasing health care investments by $11.5 billion over the next three years. That includes a $7-billion booster shot to health care, including the commitment made in the 2016 budget. This will improve access to care. This will expand mental health and addiction services and enhance the experience and recovery of patients.", "We’re also dedicating $1.3 billion in funding to further reduce wait times. I had my seniors’ advisory group meeting this morning, as I do every month. In those meetings I consistently hear from seniors in my community, in Etobicoke Centre, about how important it is that we continue to improve access to care, that we continue to improve the quality of care, but also that we reduce wait times. So many of them have told me about that, and that’s what we’re doing: We’re responding to that feedback, to those concerns.", "One of the key components within health care is, of course, OHIP+. As of January 2018, we’re going to be providing free prescription drugs to everyone aged 24 and under. This is going to provide coverage for over 4,400 medications, Speaker. This program is the first of its kind in Canada. This will ensure that parents and young people never have to choose between paying for medication and other essentials. There are four million young people who will benefit from this, Speaker—four million people in the province of Ontario, not to mention all of their families. I think that is something that we have to keep in mind: how many people this will touch in a really meaningful way.", "I want to move on to education because I did mention that at the outset. I think that, for example, if we look now in Ontario, 85.5% are graduating from high school. That’s more than ever before. In 2016, 68% of adults in Ontario had a post-secondary credential, which is up from 56% in 2002. That’s higher than any rate for any country in the OECD. We can be proud of the work that’s been done to make sure that young people get the right start. There is, of course, more work to be done.", "We continue to build new schools and renew existing ones. The province, in this budget, is providing almost $16 billion over 10 years to help build and improve schools. So it’s interesting that I watch the PCs rise in question period and talk about schools, and then here they are delaying a budget that would invest $16 billion over 10 years to help build and improve new schools. Now, instead of debating the bill, all they can do is heckle from the other side. I think it’s pretty disappointing.", "We’re rolling out the new Ontario Student Assistance Program, which means free tuition for more than 210,000 students in post-secondary education. That’s starting this fall. I know that the Minister of Advanced Education and Skills Development is here for the debate, and she has done incredible work in trying to develop and launch this program. I know that when I talk to people in my community, they think that this is really exciting. So when you think about this in combination with some of the other measures in this budget, like what’s been done on OHIP+, these are steps that are really going to make a difference in people’s cost of living and are really going to help families, particularly those with young people who are trying to get a good start.", "On this note of making life more affordable, Speaker, one of the things that a lot of us hear about in our communities is that one of the areas where a lot of families are struggling is with child care. That’s something that we’ve heard and we’re trying to respond to on the side. We’re helping 100,000—100,000, Speaker—more children get affordable, quality, licensed child care. In 2017-18 alone, Ontario will support child care for 24,000 more children—24,000 more children—up to four years old, through new fee subsidy spaces and support for new licensed child care spaces in schools.", "One of the other things that we’re doing to make life more affordable is our plan on housing. When you think about the fair housing plan, which has a number of components—and I’ll talk about it in a moment—this is again another step to make sure that we are helping people with their daily costs of living and helping them to address one of their largest costs of living, which is housing. That’s in addition to the things we’ve done on pharmacare, the things we’ve done on OSAP and post-secondary education and other areas.", "One of the things that I spoke about at the beginning is the importance of the economy. Although we are performing well, there is definitely a lot more work we can do. One of the things that I know Minister Matthews and others have been working on is helping people acquire the skills they need to find a job and receive secure and predictable employment and then retirement income. We’re doing a range of things to help businesses prosper. Through our investments in supporting business, Speaker, we are creating and retaining more than 37,000 jobs across the province.", "So there are a number of steps being taken to strengthen our economy. Obviously the foundation of that is the significant investments in infrastructure—$190 billion over 13 years—and the investments in helping young people access post-secondary education and then strengthening that education so that they are prepared for the world they are entering.", "I talked about the investments in infrastructure before. These are all important steps. Again, this is in hospitals, this is in schools, this is in transit, this is in roads, this is in bridges. This is in all the things that the people in my community and communities across the province have said they would like us to continue to invest in.", "Again, when I hear the members of the PC caucus talk about how they want to reduce the debt, the question that they have to be asked is, what would they cut to make that happen? Which infrastructure investments would they cancel? Which hospitals would they close? Which transit plans would they cancel? Those are the questions that I think the PCs have to wrestle with, and perhaps that’s why they’re mum on this budget and not willing to debate it, and trying to delay it.", "Lastly, Speaker, I think an issue that’s really important to people in my community of Etobicoke Centre is the issue of housing. I know a number of members of our caucus have worked incredibly hard on this particular issue. One of the issues that I work very hard on is the issue of helping people enter the housing market. Housing prices have grown very, very rapidly in the greater Toronto area, so this is something that I felt we absolutely needed to address. If you look at resale house prices in Toronto, they’re up more than 33% from the previous year.", "Buying a home is critical for people and for families because it allows them to put a roof over their head and it’s the most economical way for people to do that. But the purchase of a house is very often, traditionally, the way that families accumulate wealth and accumulate savings, and are able to save for their retirement and able to save and earn for their children’s education and many other important expenses throughout their lives. So it’s really important that we do everything we can to make sure that people can enter the housing market, especially young families, as they’re trying to do so.", "We’ve put forward a plan that has a suite of measures; I won’t mention them all. Some of the measures, like providing municipalities with the ability to tax vacant properties; the non-resident tax, which I was a strong advocate of, to make sure that we are putting people first who live here, who work here, who pay taxes here—I think that that’s an incredibly important principle that we need to support.", "I started by talking about why I ran for office, and about the issues that I wanted to work on, whether that be education, health care, growing our economy, building infrastructure and, of course, balancing our budget. I’ve had the privilege of working on all of those things, particular on balancing the budget, over the past three years.", "I’m proud of what this budget does. I’m proud of what it does for our financial future. I’m proud of what it does for the people of Ontario and the people of Etobicoke Centre." ],

About two years ago, we lost another one. We’ve lost beds in Harriston. I wonder how $11 billion could have helped there. I think it would have gone a long way to help those businesses keep those nursing homes open. But they’re gone.

Yet we have 12,000 children waiting for services in the province—and this is moderate to severe cases that are waiting, for over a year, which we read in the Star this morning.", "So to talk about all of the great things that they’re doing that they want to boast about—it’s unfortunate that our most vulnerable children are still not going to be a priority for this government. Quite frankly, Speaker, that’s where we need to start. If we do not deal with our children’s mental health, they are going to go on to live lives with mental health issues. Then they are probably going to have to access the systems further.", "We see hospital wait times increased because of children’s mental health. We see emergency room wait times increased because of children’s mental health. That’s all a cost on our budget, in our hospital systems. If we fix it when they’re children, those costs will come off later in life. It’s really unfortunate. And then, we see a $4.6-million cut to special education over 15 school boards. Where are this government’s priorities when it comes to our children? Because I think they were completely left out of this budget." ],

It’s been almost a decade, but we are in balance. I’m happy about that because it allows us to make really important investments that will benefit the people of this province. This budget is a big booster shot to health care—and I couldn’t be happier to be sitting in this House. I will have the right to vote on a bill that is an historic expansion of medicare. We very much look forward to working with the federal government, with other provinces and territories. I do believe Ontario taking this step will mean that other provinces will see what we’re doing and follow suit.

Not one dollar was put back into the budget for those people. I keep saying the kids that were needing those special-needs—they had special needs the day before they made that choice and they still do.", "He talked about building some schools. I’m glad to see some schools getting built. What he leaves out is, they have closed more schools than any government in the province’s history, and there are 300 more to go. We’re going to continue—because that is infrastructure in our own backyards that has a huge impact in the community. They stripped out the community impact portion on the actual school reviews.", "Our hospitals are now struggling.

I’d like to ask him the question: In your own home, if you spend more than you bring in, you have to make choices too. Why aren’t you doing it as government? Why can you continue to put the debt on our next generation and the generation after that, to try to pretend that we are actually in a great space in Ontario’s history? We’re not. We’re financially in a very dire situation. All you’re doing is moving debt beyond your ability out to the next generation and the generation behind. It’s unconscionable that you think we should just say, “Yes, all’s rosy,” and vote for your budget when you continue to saddle the next generation with debt and deficit. It’s unacceptable.

We’re outpacing the G7. We’re outpacing the rest of Canada. That work, along with the work of making sure that we’re using tax dollars even more wisely, has allowed us to make investments in key areas: investments in health care, whether it be the OHIP+ pharmacare program for kids or young people under 25; whether it be increased investments in education and building schools across the province, including in the ridings of all members in this Legislature; whether it be expanding the new OSAP so that more young people can get access to post-secondary education; whether it be the steps taken to build out infrastructure, $190 billion over 13 years. All of these things are critical and are touching and will continue to touch the lives of the people of our province and of my riding in Etobicoke Centre. That’s why I’m proud of this budget.", "I’m also proud of this budget because it is fiscally responsible. I’m someone who studied finance, who advised companies in the private sector on how to grow their businesses and how to invest their money. I know a sound financial plan when I see one. I know that what we’ve done here is to very thoughtfully try to come to balance, and we’ve done just that. We didn’t approach it the way some governments of the past have, by slashing and burning services. We’ve done it in a thoughtful, methodical way by getting more value for money for the people of Ontario.", "The member opposite suggested that we should make choices. I would like to know what choices the PCs would make. Unfortunately, we haven’t heard from the PCs. They have no position on anything. It would be great if they took a position on something, but as of now it appears that they’d like us to cut. They cut in the 1990s.

You know, you can’t help but think of that song—Sixteen Tons, is it? “Another day older and deeper in debt”—after each budget. Even now we have a financially balanced budget, we’re another day older and we’re deeper in debt.", "The hallmark of this Liberal government is debt—debt. Everything with their government, everything with their administration, everything is about expenditure and about debt. That’s the prism and the lens that they measure themselves through: How much money can they spend? And they are prolific at spending money. There is no question, no doubt about it. But spending money and going into debt is not an accurate measurement of government effectiveness, nor is it an effective barometer of proper administration.", "We hear every day in this House, Speaker, the stories from individual members about the ineptness and the incompetence of this government in the delivery of services and their responsibilities. So when the member from Etobicoke Centre is talking about fiscal prudence and wondering what our plan is and equating expenditures as effectiveness, let me remind him of the story that we just had in my riding last week where the LHIN was refusing patient care. The LHIN in Ottawa was refusing to accept patients from my riding. It had nothing to do with expenditure of money. It was improper, incompetent administration. I would say a government that doesn’t take its responsibility seriously about providing good administration—that was one example, but there are many, many examples.", "In my riding, five years ago, a long-term-care home closed up.

We know that we have thousands of people in my area who need a long-term-care bed. They pulled out 78. That was five years ago.

We’re getting close to deciding where we’re going to put these 78 beds.” Every long-term-care facility in my riding has put forward, “We need them. We need them. We want them.” But this government is trapped in its paralysis and its irresponsibility of actually doing its job. They can’t decide where to place those 78 licences.", "But I want to talk about one other—well, maybe a few more elements of this bill. But the next one that I want to speak to is the administration of justice.", "For the member of Etobicoke Centre here: Again, we have seen story after story after story in the press and through discussions—all of the attorneys general of this country met last week in Gatineau to discuss the egregious problem that is happening in the administration of justice, where criminal cases are being thrown out of court because of delay—thousands. We understand that in Ontario alone over 11,000 more cases are at risk of being thrown out because of delays due to the Jordan case. We also know that our jails are severely overcrowded. We know that segregation is severely abused. We know that there are all kinds of maladministration within our justice system.", "But what is the government’s solution to that egregious, acute problem in the administration of our justice? Well, in this budget, the solution is to reduce expenditures at the Ministry of the Attorney General by $4 million. Can you imagine? Everybody is clamouring for more crowns, more resources and more courts—more resources—so that we ensure innocent people are not unduly held and that violent criminal offenders are suitably punished or penalized by our court system. But no, Speaker, this government chose once again to turn its back on its responsibilities, turn its back and say, “This is just too complicated. This is too troublesome. This is too problematic. We don’t know what to do with this.”", "Some 11,000 cases, and let’s put this in context for everybody, because I did hear the Attorney General last week quoted in the Ottawa Citizen; I think it was by the columnist Kelly Egan. The Attorney General mentioned in his column that the Jordan decision was tantamount to rule changes in a hockey game in the third period. I think that’s an accurate reflection of that quote.", "The right to a timely and speedy trial is nothing new. It is established and recognized in our Charter of Rights and Freedoms: the right to timely and speedy trials. This is not a new requirement. Indeed, that was solidified even further after the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in the Askov decision. Once again, it said, in that case, that a 34-month delay in trial was unacceptable and that the case would be thrown out. The Jordan decision has just provided further clarity and clarification. And this government, in the budget anyway, has said, “Well, that’s too complicated. Let’s not go there. Let’s not fix the administration of justice. Let’s leave our jails overcrowded. Let’s leave our courts overcrowded.” Is that not an abuse of process? You would think that the members opposite would feel the egregiousness of keeping people incarcerated for years without trial. You’d think that would tug at them to say, “We can’t allow that.” But no, they continue on.", "Is that wise spending and prudent fiscal management? I don’t think so. But again, after saying all that, we’re deeper in debt. Let’s not fix the problems. Let’s let those problems persist, but let’s go into debt some more.", "And listen, Speaker, I know the difference between an investment and a debt. The people of Ontario know the difference between investments and debt. The Liberal government use those words interchangeably, as if they were synonyms. They are not synonyms. Debt and investments are very different instruments. These guys go in debt; the investments pale. There is no investment in our courts, in our administration of justice, as I just spoke about, but more debt.", "When we’re speaking about this budget, it’s hard not to speak about the cost of electricity and hydro, the operations of Hydro One and the cost of electricity. I put out a mail-out to my riding a few weeks back. So far, I have received over a thousand responses mailed back to my office. A thousand responses have been mailed back. Each one of those was about the Liberal government’s electricity policies and the high cost of electricity and how it was hurting and harming those individuals, those families, those businesses.", "That was an astonishing number: 1,000 returned. That means that everybody went out and cut that mail-out up, wrote on it, went out and bought a stamp, and put the stamp on it. They also—many, many hundreds of them—attached their hydro bill to those mail-outs, and asked me—and they want to know from this Premier and from this government: What are they going to do? We still have significant numbers of errors on our hydro bills, as well as high costs.", "I had one individual in to see me on Friday last. He had a letter from Hydro One saying, “We want a $2,000 security deposit from you.” It went on to say, “You have no history of NSF cheques. You have no history of late payments. You’re a good customer; we really like you. But we’re going to demand a $2,000 security deposit from you.”", "He phoned up Hydro One and he said, “I meet all your requirements as a good customer—never paid late, never an NSF cheque, always a good, paying customer.” And the response from Hydro One was, “Just pay the security deposit anyway. We have on your file that you’re a good customer. Just pay the $2,000 anyway.”", "Of course, Speaker, we can also tell everybody now that, under the new program of these abuses at Hydro One, we no longer have the Ombudsman in the province to deal with this. Hell, we don’t even have an ombudsman at Hydro One anymore, right? She left." ],

We did see that story. I’ve not seen any indication of that anywhere else in the province. I may be wrong, and if I am I’d be happy to hear, during this debate, some other examples. But there it is again: a problem in Toronto, and the Liberal government brings out the sledgehammer to the rest of Ontario as the solution. That’s not the way to administer; it’s not the way to govern. It’s a way to cause problems, and that’s what this government has done. And they’re causing further problems.", "This budget—I guess the only thing we can really say about this, what the people of Ontario really gain with this budget is that they get two campaign budgets instead of just one. We know that the general election is scheduled for next June, June 2018, and the people of Ontario have now got two campaign budgets, one this year and one next year. But I think the people of Ontario clearly understand the difference between debt and investment, unlike the Liberal members, and they will reject that view that just going into debt is the way to measure the quality of government. Going into debt is not the way to measure the effectiveness of government." ],

A similar situation in my riding: announced in 2008, and the beds were not built until 2016, a long nine years later. And they weren’t additional beds; they were beds that had been squeezed out of a former, larger nursing home. They were given to the for-profit sector instead of to the not-for-profit sector, although in Welland, we have a great non-profit nursing home called the Foyer Richelieu. The Foyer Richelieu is supported not only by public dollars but by the Club Richelieu, who just celebrated their 90th anniversary this past couple of weekends ago. That club raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for this non-profit nursing home over the last 25 to 30 years, but the government chose to give the beds to a for-profit.", "It used to be that 80 beds was a break-even proposition, and now the people in the game say 120 beds is break-even. The foyer only had 60 beds, and so they really could have benefitted from having those additional 80 beds. They would have still had thousands of dollars being flowed in from the Club Richelieu for all kinds of programs and equipment. I know that they lobbied the government and MPPs for a number of years, but nobody was listening to them, unfortunately. At the end of the day, those beds are now with Jarlette, which is a good for-profit operator—we can’t take that away from them—but the beds would have been far better off with the Richelieu, in our community, in a non-profit setting." ],

The Liberals have consistently refused to fund the repairs of municipal social housing, and in 2013 the Wynne government cut $129 million per year in annual funding for Toronto social housing programs.", "Anything that makes it easier to evict tenants, even if they’re bad tenants, requires close scrutiny, Speaker. This bill comes too late for tenants who have already received rent increase notifications; for example, Liberty Village, 100% increases. The bill does not get rid of vacancy decontrol and does not provide for a rent registry. Landlords will still have an incentive to squeeze out lower income tenants in gentrifying neighbourhoods, and prospective tenants still face unaffordable market rents.", "Tenant groups and advocates have long sought the disclosure of the 1991 loophole, which has been done. Standard leases and rents to the AGIs and “landlord’s own use” eviction rules—they will be strongly supported. Landlords will not be supportive of the rent regulation provisions, probably. Smaller landlords will benefit from the clarity and simplification of eviction rules, but large landlords already know how to manage any current lack of clarity and simplicity.", "In closing, all of these incentives that have been brought forward at the eleventh hour are quite interesting. All I know is that I’ve been here a while, and I know that they have wasted billions and billions of dollars.

You should be trying harder for the seniors of this province so they don’t have to go to private, for-profit, expensive homes which now the LHINs are subsidizing. In some of the homes in the province of Ontario, we are spending less on food and nutrition than we are in prisons in the province. That is your legacy. That is your legacy and your track record. If you think that we’re going to let you forget that, you have another think coming.", "The anger is well placed. The anger is a legitimate emotion for the people of this province to have. When I knock on doors and they open their hydro bill, that’s the difference. That’s the difference. They now open their hydro bill every month—they’ve done everything that they possibly can, and they see how this government has neglected them, has turned its back on them. That is what this government has done.", "So when I look at this budget bill and I see that we have a pseudo, sort-of-hydro plan for pharmacare for youth—a great many of these youth are actually covered under their parents’ plans; some of them are actually covered under student plans. I have a son who is attending Conestoga College. He is covered by that plan as well, and he’s covered by our plan. He has two plans. Many people don’t have plans. But our plan would have covered those people as well. It would have covered the kids and the parents and the grandparents. What a concept, Mr. Speaker. Imagine the universality of a plan that actually meets the needs of the people of this province. It’s bold, and it resonated really well, obviously, and this government responded. However, the pharmacare plan and the costing of that pharmacare plan was not in this budget, and that’s how you can tell the real priorities. You have to cost it out. You have to tell the people of this province how you’re going to pay for it, and you did not. In fact, the finance minister said he forgot that part or he left that part out of the budget. It’s a matter of public record. He left that part out because it’s such a big document. Oh, it’s such a big document, they couldn’t actually cost it out—only at Queen’s Park, I tell you.", "We have exorbitant hydro costs in the province of Ontario which have undermined our economy. We have a health care system which has embraced privatization under the leadership of this government, which has compromised the quality, which has undermined the value and the return on investment for those health care dollars, which has hurt jobs in Ontario. One only has to look at Sudbury—and we should not look down our noses at any job in the province of Ontario that pays a living wage. Of course, a living wage was also left out of this budget. But the workers who were doing the laundry services at the Sudbury hospital—they’re gone; contracted out, taken those jobs someplace else. The jobs at Wilfrid Laurier University, the custodial jobs that paid $22 an hour, got contracted out—now $12 an hour—to a private company.", "This is what this government has done. It has basically sold out public services. The basic job of government in Ontario is to serve the people of Ontario. It really isn’t a complicated concept. However, this government really has done a good job in undermining why many of us have entered politics: to try the make a difference for the people in our communities and across the province, especially those most vulnerable.", "On any given issue, though—it’s hard to imagine how this government failed to address housing. I have said this many times in this House—the importance of housing. Housing stabilizes the economy; housing creates educational opportunities where the potential of those students can be realized; housing has direct health consequences and environmental consequences, and criminal and justice health consequences. If you don’t get housing right, very little else can be accomplished. You can have a youth pharmacare program—but if you have no home, then really, what is the point? If you’re sleeping on the street, but can access a drug, how are you ever going to reach your potential? This came through with some of the voices of youth across the province who were willing to be brave enough and courageous enough to speak out on this issue.", "Perhaps housing is on my mind because we just met with the Co-operative Housing Federation of Canada, who have done a very good job—in fact, they lobbied hard, as they always do, for significant strategic investment in housing. As you know, Mr. Speaker, we favour a shared model of responsibility for housing. We think that every level of government can and should come to the table in a fair and open, transparent way, in a sustainable way, so that we can plan for housing to make a difference in the province of Ontario.", "The Co-operative Housing Federation of Canada says very clearly that trying to achieve the goal of housing “will help lift children, seniors and refugees out of poverty, enabling them to reach their full potential and lead more dignified lives.” We all want that. “It will also significantly reduce government spending on health care, emergency shelters and incarceration. A recent report estimated the cost of poverty in Toronto alone to be between $4.5 billion and $5.5 billion annually. The lack of affordable housing is a leading cause for poverty in Ontario.”", "And yet, where is the money for housing in this budget bill? Maybe there’s a curtain that I haven’t pulled across. Maybe there’s a different layer to this budget I haven’t found.", "When you consider that affordable housing has an important part to play in building and growing an inclusive economy—for every dollar spent on construction of affordable housing, there’s a corresponding $1.40 increase to the GDP through new local jobs and locally sourced construction materials. It also creates a long-term public asset and a permanent pathway to the middle class. Well, that’s what everybody is talking about: lifting people up. Right? But how can people ever achieve their potential if they don’t have secure, stable, affordable housing? How can it happen? It cannot.", "I remember in Hamilton, at the finance committee, when the executive director of the legal aid society came to the table and he said that there are children in Hamilton who change residences six times in the course of a school year. That sometimes means that they are changing schools. If you have transient, unstable housing, then you have transient, unstable learning. They will never reach their potential.", "It defies logic.", "There was obviously a political gold medal for them as well. There was a political gold medal for them, waiting to be had. They rarely turn down an opportunity to grab the gold, Mr. Speaker. There’s a ribbon to be cut. There’s a press release to go out. There’s a couple of op-eds in a local paper. It defies all logic why the Premier of this province has drawn a line in the sand on housing in Toronto, because I am going to tell you something: What happens in Toronto affects the rest of the province. The housing crisis that’s going to be happening in Toronto is filtering out through Mississauga, through Etobicoke, through Scarborough, through Durham. It affects the entire province. If you don’t invest in housing, you will never achieve your economic or social justice or justice goals, ever. It will not happen.", "In Kitchener-Waterloo and Cambridge, the rental housing units are in high demand. The cost is going up. Seniors are being bumped out of their houses. Supportive housing isn’t even on the agenda for this government. There is no home care strategy. Seniors are getting one hour—one hour a day—for all of their needs, their full needs. They can’t afford the long-term-care facilities that have been fully privatized by the province of Ontario. Where are they to go? If you haven’t been able to stabilize housing after 14 years—14 years this government has had. Majority—you only had the minority once, and it was a good time for us. It clearly wasn’t a good time for you. That’s when we had to fight for—", "Interjections." ],

For her to criticize this government on health care I find surprising in light of what is in this budget and what has been done in previous budgets. We are talking about a $7-billion booster shot to health care. We are talking about significant investments in hospitals that will touch communities across this province. We are talking about more funding for community care. We’re talking about more funding for not only patients, but for caregivers. We’re talking about a $100-million dementia strategy. These are just some of the things that are in this budget that support greater access, greater quality of care for people in Ontario.", "She talked about how this is a government that’s not investing in housing. I’ve got the housing minister next to me. I’m sure he would be chomping at the bit to respond to some of this stuff. We’ve put tremendous amounts of money into housing as a government. I think it’s unfortunate that the member opposite won’t recognize that and ignores that when she gets up and debates this budget.", "The other question that the member opposite should answer—and hopefully, she will be able to do so in her final two minutes—is to talk about, if she would like to see all this spending in all these other areas, what she would cut. What would she cut? Maybe she’d cut the pharmacare program; I’m not sure. Maybe she’d cut back on some of the health care investments we were just talking about.", "In any event, this is a budget that addresses health care, investments in education, investments in mental health services. There are investments in transit and infrastructure in communities across Ontario, and it underpins and supports a growing economy. We’ve been able to make these investments because of a growing economy, and that’s a testament to the people of Ontario. Because we have been prudent with taxpayer dollars, we have managed to balance the budget. By balancing the budget and being prudent with taxpayer dollars, we’ve been allowed to make these investments in these important services that matter to the people of Ontario." ],

Although the province will stop adding new debt from spending on day-to-day operations such as salaries, programs and income transfers, it will continue to add new debt from spending on long-term projects....”", "The Financial Accountability Officer estimates Ontario’s debt will keep growing, hitting $370 billion by 2020-21. Crucially, Ontario’s debt relative to the size of its economy is almost 40%, which I think is an all-time high. That’s something that a lot of lenders and others will look at. Hopefully, this government will work to reduce that.", "Ontario’s debt will rise by 17% in the next three years as a result of interest charges. I think that’s $12 billion a year, I’ve heard someone say here. That would be one of the largest government departments if it was actually a government agency or a government ministry.

When the global recession hit, we made a deliberate choice to invest in our economy while protecting vital services such as health care and education. If you go back a few years to what happened in the 1990s, when I was in home and community care, when I lost work because nurses and physicians were laid off in the province of Ontario, I really took stock at that time about wanting to contribute later on and to run for a party that invested in health care, rather than cut it.", "To give some context to this, during the 1990s when the NDP were in government—at that time there was a bit of a recession that hit in the early 1990s. The NDP made the decision to slash vital services like health care. They reduced nursing school places and reduced medical school places. They delisted home care. They took 5% out of the budget in home care, where I was working at the time. I sent patients back to the hospital to then be admitted to hospital before they were placed in long-term care. This was long a memory of mine.", "In came the next government, which were the PCs. The cuts to health care continued. Again, we lost nurses out of the system. We lost beds out of the system—12,000, as a matter of fact—and 28 hospitals closed. We knew at the time, with the burgeoning population of seniors and baby boomers coming forward, that if you cut beds, cut nurses and cut doctors while this was coming through, we were going to end up with a shortage of nurses, doctors and hospital beds. And guess what? That happened in early 2003.", "Since this government has come in, we’ve continued to make investments year over year: 27,000 more nurses in the province; we increased medical school places and nursing school places, and continue to invest in home and community care. So we have far more services, including diagnostic and imaging tests, than we did in the 1990s. And I know that for sure because I was working as an agency nurse in a number of different hospitals before I could find a full-time job again, and that wasn’t until 2004.", "The thing that really got me on Thursday was the finance minister, when we got briefed about this budget and the signature piece: pharmacare paid for, for kids under age 24. In 1990, I had a son that we were raising that had a severe, critical, life-threatening disease in his respiratory system. This was at a time when services in the province of Ontario were being cut and slashed. At that time he didn’t have a diagnosis that did anything but fall through the cracks. He ended up living in hospital for most of the time between 1990 and 1994, between age 10 and age 14. Every two to four weeks, they would try to send him home.", "Now picture the context that I just gave you. Nurses were being fired. Nurses were being let go. Home care was delisted. That was at the time when my son faced critical illness. At that time, I was also laid off. I had no benefits. My husband was self-employed to be able to manage my son’s care. He also had no benefits.", "At that time, in 1990, we were spending $1,000 per month—more than my net salary—in medication costs for this child. That respiratory solution didn’t last long because of expiry dates. Very often, we would spend the $1,000—more than my salary—and he would go back to hospital in two or three days. In two to three months when they stabilized him again, he would come back, and I would spend the same money again.", "That affected our financial future as a family until today. We mortgaged our house. We remortgaged our house. This child was in and out of hospital with no benefits from us, because he fell through the cracks.", "At that time, he was not eligible for home care. If I assessed him today, as a care coordinator for a CCAC, which I was working as when I was elected, he would have services at home. We probably could have kept him at home for two out of the four years. But under the NDP and the PCs, we didn’t have that ability.", "Eventually, after three years in hospital—two at KW, one at SickKids—and another year at a rehab hospital at the Hugh MacMillan centre, where 90% of those families were on social assistance—we were among the very few who weren’t on social assistance—during that period of time, we finally got a drug benefit card. But the damage was done to my family; it was done to my son; it was done to our finances. That affected the rest of our family until today, because we weren’t able to put aside for some of our children’s university costs. They’ve had to help to do that themselves.", "We have recovered greatly since then, but the financial hardship, the mental stress, the issues with our other kids, the financial hardships that not only my family had, but all of our extended family had because of this, were almost irreparable.", "When I heard that we are now providing pharmacare to all kids under age 24, it was a game-changer. It means that nobody else has to pay that money that we couldn’t afford to pay at the time. It means that those families are going to be protected from financial hardship because of those medication costs. It’s not just the 125 medications on that formulary. My son needed far more than what’s on the regular 125 formulary medications. They were specialized. We couldn’t afford to pay for them. Fast-forward to what that would cost today, in today’s terms: It would be far more than $1,000 per month.", "This is a game-changer for families. This is life-saving medication. Parents no longer have to decide, “Do I pay the money for that puffer or not? Do I pay the money for that rare-disorder medication or not?” These are families that depend on those life-saving medications for their families, to be able to provide better outcomes for their children.", "I was pretty emotional when it hit me that had this program been part of our health system in the early 1990s, when my son got a last wish—he almost died in the hospital several times; he narrowly avoided a lung transplant—this would have been a game-changer for my family. This is something that would have protected the financial health for the rest of the family. We did what we had to, like many, many people do. But make no mistake: This is essential to making sure that our children have the best start in life.", "You know, it was like a lightning bolt hit me. What was interesting was that I did my post-budget breakfast, and then I got on a plane and went to Boston. I went to Boston because that’s where my 37-year-old son is now, and together we celebrated his daughter’s first birthday on Saturday.", "These are the experiences where I am so proud that we are going to be able to assist in the future, with the program that we have brought in for OHIP+. It’s a game changer. The rest of the investments that we are making in health care go a long, long way to ensure that we are addressing some of the needs of the rest of our society right now: putting in more money to decrease wait times; putting more money to make sure that some of these surgical procedures can be done; making sure that we have $100 million put into the dementia strategy; making sure that caregivers—of which we were, for my son, at one time—could actually have some of the benefits of being able to care for their family member and to be able to have some of the support that we didn’t have in the 1990s.", "I could go on at length, Mr. Speaker, but I think you hear my story, and there are many more stories out there. As a nurse at SickKids for 10 years, as a care coordinator who used to assess families for what they needed out of the health care system for their children, for a VON nurse who used to go into the schools and do school health programs at noon, this is an issue that’s so close to my heart. I know that this is the right decision for Ontarians. I know it’s the right decision for families. I know it’s the right decision to ensure that our children have the best possible start and to be able to continue in life to the best of their ability." ],

Many of us in the Legislature do that from time to time. I know how difficult that is, having done that and seeing some of our colleagues from all the parties in here in the Legislature do that.", "But those stories make it real. They make it real in terms of what, in this case, this budget means to someone and her family, and she spoke of her constituency as well.", "Speaker, we’ve talked about how this budget is the first balanced budget since the global recession, which is a good thing, of course. But it also provides for us to further invest in things that are important to Ontarians and this government, whether it’s health care, whether it is supporting transit and infrastructure, whether it is supporting education. So it’s a pretty great budget.", "I, too, as many people have spoken about here in the House, did a number of post-budget events on Friday. I did breakfasts with the Scarborough Rotary Club and the business association there, and two pharmacare events to talk about the OHIP+ youth pharmacare initiative in the budget. I have another event coming up this Friday with the Ajax-Pickering Board of Trade. I am looking forward to that one. That one also gives me a few days to further think about the budget and focus that presentation with the business community, in that case.", "For the sessions that I did attend, it was pretty exciting. It was pretty moving to hear feedback from people, because it wasn’t just myself and my colleagues talking about the budget; there was dialogue and questions and answers. We heard, Speaker, from pharmacists who feel that the youth pharmacare program is not only great for the youth and families who will benefit from this, but it will actually make their job easier, because essentially this measure will only require a youth or child and their family to present a prescription and an OHIP card and things will be covered. There are no copays or deductibles: 4,400 drugs will be covered. That includes many drugs that many people who already have benefit plans are not covered for. I think we’ve all experienced that as employees: When you need an expensive drug or someone in your community needs a drug for a complex condition, you may have a decent health care plan, but often drug plans do not extend enough to provide that kind of coverage. I think the pharmacists saying it’s going to make their job easier is something we shouldn’t lose sight of.", "Then the other thing I would say, especially for the youth who will be covered by this program, is that in addition to it being a great, universal aspect of our health care, an extension of universal health care, it will, I believe, provide better health outcomes for young people in our province.", "The other thing is, if you think about it—I have two 19-year-olds, so I think about the 19-year-olds to 24-year-olds in this case, and their first job. They may be on contract. They may not have benefits, or maybe they’re an entrepreneur starting up and doing some sort of self-employment, start-up kind of activity. They’re unlikely to have any kind of health care benefit, and if they need any kind of routine or more complicated medicines, they’re going to get it, and they’re going to get it on January 1, 2018, not 2020, and not for a limited number of drugs.", "I think it would be very dangerous, such as in the NDP plan, to limit the amount of drugs that are covered by a pharmacare program, especially for young people. We don’t want to do that. We don’t want to presume what kind of drugs kids need.", "We heard from my colleague about what kind of drugs she needed. When I was battling my first round of cancer when I was 17 years old—the goal is to get out of the hospital. You want to get out of the hospital from your surgery, your treatment, and get home sooner. That’s great, and we’re seeing more and more of that in cancer care, in particular. But that also means that you have to go and fill your prescriptions at home, the things you need, for example, post-chemotherapy, whether it’s the steroids, the painkillers or the other drugs you have to take to counteract some of the effects of chemotherapy. I remember—sure, I’d get home, after my chemotherapy when I was 17 years old, but I would have to get drugs to finish the course of treatment.", "So it’s that balance of getting home sooner, but then you had a whole pile of prescriptions that would have to be filled that were covered while you were in hospital, but now when you’re home, you need to cover that. I was so pleased to see that this initiative will cover cancer drugs for young people, that it will cover drugs for rare diseases. We’ve heard a lot in the House here about cases of limited or lack of drug coverage for children and youth who have rare diseases, so this initiative will address that, and I think that is so important. It’s so important.", "I know I’ve had some people say, what does this mean for your health care premiums if you already have coverage? There’s a very good piece in the Toronto Star about that today and how the drug benefit market may play out in this regard. But it is important, as I said before, to remember that many health plans don’t cover all of the drugs in the 4,400 that will be covered here.", "I’ve also heard the question, well, what about seniors’ drug coverage? But we all know in this Legislature that we have the Trillium Drug Program. We also have the Ontario Drug Benefit Program, so that people on social assistance or seniors of low income can apply for drug coverage, and that of course will continue. This doesn’t change that in any kind of way.", "The reality is, this youth pharmacare program is transformational—not just here in Ontario, but what it’s really doing is extending the notion of universal health care that we enjoy already, whether it’s for getting a chest X-ray or when we have a cast put on our leg. Our Minister of Health has been taking a leadership role in working with other provinces on a national pharmacare program. To me, this program in Ontario is something that can be a catalyst for other provinces and our federal government partners to look at as well and see where we can go.", "Young people are our future, Speaker. Investing in young people, I think everyone agrees, is important. If they have good health outcomes when they’re younger, this is going to pay off beyond the age of 25. This is going to improve their health and longevity. This is going to reduce financial burdens for families who have to make some really difficult choices between filling a prescription and paying some other bills. Families will benefit from this in significant ways, in ways we probably don’t even fully understand yet.", "I’m pretty excited about that part of the budget and other elements of it. I really look forward to meeting with the Ajax-Pickering Board of Trade this Friday to talk further about the budget." ],

Agriculture has dropped $47.1 million. Northern development and mines has dropped $70.3 million.", "These are the wealth generators in the province of Ontario.

Well-managed companies roll over high-interest debt to low-interest debt, and that’s what this budget does and what this government has done for 13 years.

It’s the program that I’m most proud of. It’s the first of its kind in Canada, and it means that children and youth will no longer have to worry about having the medication to ensure that their health is well managed.

When I was first elected, the budget was about $68 billion and balanced. This year it’s $141 billion. Certainly, the government has learned how to spend money.", "Mr. Speaker, one of the great things about our democracy is that we have the right to voice our disagreement with the government, and that is one of the things I’m going to do today: I’m going to disagree with the government over their claims that this is actually a balanced budget.", "In order to make it appear that they kept their promise to balance the budget this year, the government relied on $1 billion from the sale of Hydro One and some LCBO properties and $1.5 billion in money from one-time federal transfers and other one-time payments. And, against the advice of the Auditor General, the Minister of Finance counted $500 million in pension assets the government cannot spend. All totalled, these things add up to $5 billion. Mr. Speaker, the deficit last year was $4.3 billion, so we’re actually no further ahead than we were last year. And that’s one-time funding, so it won’t be around next year. Over the long term, they don’t have a plan to stay balanced.", "I would like to advise them on how they could do something in my riding that would be beneficial to the government. It would help over the long term, generating funds and tax revenues for the government. I know the Minister of Infrastructure was here earlier, and something I hope he’s paying attention to—I’ve spoken with him directly about it—is the Muskoka Centre. The town of Gravenhurst is interested in the Muskoka Centre. It’s a beautiful property on Lake Muskoka, on Muskoka Bay, that has for 25 years sat idle. When I was first elected, there was a lot of interest in what might happen on the property. There was a series of public meetings. From those public meetings, it was decided that they didn’t want to see further pressures on Muskoka Bay, which has a lot of pressures already and just a narrow opening to the main part of the Muskoka Lake. They were concerned about water quality, boat traffic and that kind of thing, but they did want to see something happen there that would generate income and jobs. The property has been a sanatorium and all kinds of things, but it has sat idle the entire 16 years I’ve been elected. I believe it’s a three- or four-storey building that’s basically a huge liability now.", "So from the process many years ago, they decided that a development that would generate jobs but not put pressure on the waterfront would be something they’re looking for. Well, now, many years later, we have that exact type of project, for a Chinese Canadian school to be developed on the former Muskoka regional property. I’ve spoken with, and given all the information from the town of Gravenhurst to, the Minister of Infrastructure about this project. I completely support it, but it seems like the government is being very short-sighted in its negotiations with the town over the sale of this property.", "I just worry. There’s a tight timeline. They’re trying to open the school by September 2019. They hope to be doing demolition of those buildings that are there, and the company that wants to take it over is willing to assume this $6.5-million liability of taking down the old building and dealing with whatever is there and investing in a project that would generate 200 full-time jobs in construction and then 200 jobs on an ongoing basis, not to mention what difference it will make with all of the families moving in to Gravenhurst, and for the downtown, for the waterfront, for the good of the community and tax revenues for the province of Ontario—because we know this government needs taxes.", "I’ll just read from a recent article. It sounds like things aren’t going that well. The headline is “Province Short-Sighted in Muskoka Centre Sale Rejection: Gravenhurst CAO.” I’ll just give a couple of selective quotes here.", "“‘That’s the frustration—if this thing goes in the toilet and it comes out that to save a dime the province wouldn’t sell it to the town to create 200-plus jobs,’ said Gravenhurst chief administrative officer Glen Davies in an interview Monday, April 24.”", "It goes on: “Back in October, council approved ‘in concept’ a master plan put forward by Maple Leaf Education System, who in partnership with the town, would acquire the property from Infrastructure Ontario for the purpose of developing a Chinese Canadian boarding school that could house 1,500 students....", "“The developer would finance the entire project with the community reaping the benefits.", "“But now, Davies said, it could end up being another municipality enjoying the economic spinoffs.", "“‘Other communities have an interest in this school,’ he said, noting the province of British Columbia has come forward. ‘Maple Leaf Schools likes Gravenhurst because of Dr. Norman Bethune. If it takes too long or we can’t make a deal then those 200 (permanent) jobs go somewhere else.’”", "It goes on: “‘Whatever it costs to do that should be taken off the purchase price,’ said Davies, highlighting it will be the developer who pays for all demolition and environmental mitigation needed throughout the development of the property, which has been vacant since 1993.” Since 1993 it has sat there. My feeling is that if the government doesn’t act quickly on this project, it may be another 25 years sitting there vacant, not contributing to the economy.", "It goes on: “‘The property has been doing nothing for almost 25 years … The town comes along with a brilliant plan from a developer and we can’t seem to gain any traction,’ said Davies.", "“‘The province doesn’t seem to care about the economic benefit of this project,’ he said pointing out the announcement last month that the federal and provincial governments are each investing more than $100 million to support a $1-billion partnership with Ford Canada, that will allegedly create 300 jobs in Ontario.", "“‘They’ve invested big money in saving jobs and this is small money to create jobs,’ he said.", "“‘We’re probably within weeks of losing the project for the year,’ he said, adding the developer had hoped to be in the middle of demolition at this point.”", "I wanted to bring up that very important project because it’s so important to Parry Sound–Muskoka and it should be important to the province. I hope that we realize the time sensitivity. I hope the Minister of Infrastructure will facilitate the sale of this property so that we can see those jobs being created, which will be of benefit to the finances of the province of Ontario.", "Mr. Speaker, that was a bit of a sidetrack. I’ll get back to my speech on the budget motion.", "The government certainly doesn’t have a plan to start paying down the debt, which has more than doubled to in excess of $300 billion under their watch. As we’ve heard, that’s some $22,000 per man, woman and child. When I was first elected, the budget debt was about $140 billion, and at the end of this year it’s going to be $312 billion. I think people should be concerned about that. When you look at all of the interest going in to pay for that, to service that debt, it’s almost $12 billion—$11.6 billion a year. That’s more than all post-secondary education, at $8.4 billion. It’s more than all of the youth programs; that’s $4.4 billion. It’s more than on community safety; that’s $2.8 billion. It’s more than indigenous people, at $91 million. So that $12 billion could go a long way, if it wasn’t just servicing debt, toward delivering programs.", "In the budget, it’s unfortunate that they don’t have the money to really fund the programs that they are doing. Some of the programs in the budget I thought were okay, like helping family caregivers and allowing people on ODSP and Ontario Works to earn more money without being penalized. I support that. Our leader, Patrick Brown, has been talking a lot about skills development. There’s some mention of skills development. How effectively they do it we’ll see. But I can’t support a budget that’s based on the false premise that it’s actually balanced.", "I wish they would fund programs that are already out there before they come out with big, expensive new programs. They’ve come out with a new program, an expensive program, pharmacare, that’s $465 million at its initial stage of implementation, but they aren’t funding the programs that are already there.", "The example I’ll give from my own riding: I have constituents come into my riding office looking for help with dental problems. Just try to imagine what it’s like to go around with either a toothache—anybody who’s had a toothache knows how debilitating that can be—or in a situation where you’re embarrassed to open your mouth because your teeth are rotten.", "The government does have some programs to assist people who can’t afford to get dental care—programs like Healthy Smiles. But the dentists were here last week, and what did the dentists tell us? They told us that the government funds those programs at about half the cost of what it actually costs to do the work. As a result, they can’t afford to do too many. They certainly can’t fill the demand for the people who need the help. Why wouldn’t they properly fund that, something pretty basic? If you’re the person who is in pain, who can’t open their mouth or can’t get a job, it’s pretty major. Why wouldn’t they properly fund that, and just increase the rate to dentists before taking on more expensive programs?", "I would say also that if we look at health care, it’s the same thing. I’m glad to see a 3% increase in funding for health care. I hope the money makes it to the front lines. On the Muskoka side of my riding, pretty much every year, Muskoka Algonquin Healthcare has a deficit. This year, I was pleased when the government bailed them out with $2.3 million in increased funding. I spoke personally to the Minister of Health about that. But they shouldn’t have to do that every year, all the while cutting services as they try to make their budget balance. It’s obvious that there’s a need for increased investment in health care. Whether 3% will do it or not—we’ll wait for the hospitals’ response. I suspect that won’t be sufficient.", "I know, for example, at West Parry Sound Health Centre, they spent 25% more on hydro in 2016 than in 2014, despite having reduced consumption by 37%. They actually had their financial person analyze it and send that information over. The increased cost came from a 69% increase in the global adjustment in just two years—69% in just two years in the global adjustment. That’s taking precious health care dollars away from front-line services and putting them into the hydro black hole.", "For 2016, the government reduced funding to the West Parry Sound Health Centre by 2.3%. They’ve had their hydro bill go up and they’ve had a reduction of 2.3%, so seeing a 3% increase barely gets them back to where they were, and I suspect it won’t be sufficient.", "While the government is busy congratulating themselves for increased hospital funding, I think we need to take a hard look at the reality. In order to increase funding and announce new programs, to even pretend to balance the budget, they’ve had to do a lot of cutting in other places, and it seems to be mainly in rural Ontario and northern Ontario. I know our agriculture critic has certainly talked about the Ministry of Agriculture. The Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs’ budget is being cut by $47 million. That is a big concern.", "The Ministry of Natural Resources—the minister was just speaking. Their budget is being cut by $37 million. I can tell you again, from the perspective of my own riding, that natural resources—we have a lot of building going on around the lakes, and as a result of a case in the court this last year, they now all require land use permits for these docks. It used to be just the big boathouses that required them; now they all require them. I can tell you that it takes a long time, and timeliness is really important to the builders and the employment that comes from the projects that get going. Seeing a further reduction in the budget for natural resources could directly affect jobs and the ability to do projects in my area.", "Looking at one of the main line items under the Ministry of Natural Resources, emergency forest firefighting is being cut from $108 million to less than $70 million. Speaker, I have to ask, does the Minister of Finance have some inside information from Smokey the Bear that forest fires are going to be down this year? If we have a bad season, you need to spend the money.", "We had a Tourism Day last week, and we heard from people in the tourism sector. I met with the president of Resorts Ontario about the challenges in the tourism sector. I didn’t see, unless the government wants to point it out, changes in the budget that address some of the concerns they had.", "Their concerns were that they can’t plan their marketing. Let me step back a second and say that the Ontario Chamber of Commerce just did a study on tourism in Ontario and pointed out—you can go online to see it—that over the last 15 years, if Ontario’s tourism had increased at the same rate as the rest of the world, which it hasn’t—they have a graph showing that we are missing out on $16 billion in economic activity the last number of years because we’ve lagged behind. What tourism is asking for is multi-year funding so that they can plan their marketing, so they can actually make a difference.", "They mentioned the terrible burden of red tape in the tourism sector. You bring students in for a summer job and they have to have WHMIS training; they have to have health and safety training; if they’re working at heights, they have to have working at heights training; they have to have first aid. And then what happens typically in a busy summer resort is you start and a number of the students quit. Then you’re too busy and don’t have the time to train the students in a full season. So their very good recommendation is to do that training in the schools. Give the student who has done the training some sort of transferable card that shows them they have the training. That will save the businesses having to actually take the time to do it, and it solves that problem of transferability. It would be a positive thing for the student, having done all that work.", "They also complained about the fact that since—it was always tough in the tourism business to get money from the bank. I was in the business for 30 years, and if you had a $3-million asset, they might loan you $800,000 from a traditional bank. Post-2008, that’s dried up completely. So it is a real challenge for tourism operators to be able to make the capital investments to have the quality of accommodations that the world expects. The operators are saying that they have to go to secondary loaners and pay quite high interest rates to be able to get any money to be able to keep the accommodations and the sort of quality that is needed. That is something that needs to be addressed.", "In past years, I remember when I was in the business, the Conservatives of the day, when interest rates were almost 20%, had a TRIP program—I think it was the tourism reinvestment program—that just about every resort in the province took advantage of. It was backed by the government. They got a 5% reduction in interest rates, and there was a huge amount of redevelopment that happened in the province when that happened. Unfortunately, my father being a cabinet minister in the Davis government, I was not able to participate in that particular program.", "They also talked about the need for more skills development, that finding the necessary skilled people in the tourism sector is a real challenge. That is, again, something that our leader has been bringing up.", "Mr. Speaker, I can see I am going to run out of time for the long speech I have here to deliver, so I will try to get to some parts of it anyway.", "Northern development and mines: Obviously, I’m the critic for northern development and mines. We’ve seen its budget cut by some $70 million. The other thing that was very noticeable from my perspective watching the budget: I didn’t hear the Ring of Fire mentioned in the budget. If you go back and look at past budgets, there was a great flourish and mention of the Ring of Fire and applause from the Liberal members, standing up and applauding when it was announced—" ],

We just had the National Day of Mourning on April 28. I can tell you I attended a number of events across my riding, and there are injured workers out there who have been fighting the system for many years, trying to get benefits, who are existing in poverty situations.", "I had a woman not long ago in my riding who had actually lived in poverty with her three teenagers for 20 years, until she found her way to my office. We filed an application to assist her and she was awarded, after all these years, compensation for the last 20 years. For some reason, her spouse, who had passed away, had fallen through the cracks.", "That was a good-news story, but there are hundreds and thousands of others who actually need our assistance. I don’t see anything at all in this budget bill that will amend the Workers’ Compensation Act to assist those workers in this province." ],

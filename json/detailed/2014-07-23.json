There’s no guarantee that any money will ever make it to the trust and not be used just to offset your deficit.

Members from all sides of this House understand the difficulties many families have in accessing support and services for their family members living with a developmental disability.", "One family in Dufferin–Caledon recently had a terrible experience with the local developmental services office, or the DSO. This family has been looking after their child with a physical and developmental disability for over 30 years, but because the parents’ own health is declining, they called the DSO to update them and ask for assistance. The reaction from the DSO was anything but helpful. They displayed an appalling lack of empathy to my constituent, going so far as to say they were lucky to receive any funding at all.

On many occasions, the region came to a standstill.", "Living in the North, we aren’t strangers to winter weather. We expect snow to fall and to have to exercise caution when driving during the winter months. That is reasonable. But what isn’t reasonable are the conditions we were confronted with last winter. People in Kenora–Rainy River told me they have never seen a winter like that before and they’re already worried about this upcoming winter. They’re looking to this government to make changes now, in advance of next winter, so they can rest easy knowing they can safely travel our roads. They don’t want to hear the compliments and accolades exchanged in question period yesterday or a regurgitation of the ineffective assurances they heard last winter.", "I’m calling on this government to uphold the will of this Legislature and immediately strike an all-party committee to evaluate the root causes of the poor maintenance we received and to develop a comprehensive solution so that we never have to endure another treacherous winter like the one we just did." ],

As many of you know, Elections Ontario set up a website called Where Do I Vote?, which was designed to direct voters to their respective polling locations on June 12. The problem is that, in the case of voters in Dufferin–Caledon, the website was sending people to the wrong polling locations, and even in some cases to the wrong riding.", "Indeed, a reporter at one of our local papers used the site to find the voting location nearest to the newspaper’s office in Caledon and was directed to vote in Simcoe–Grey. In addition, my campaign received numerous complaints from voters who were frustrated because they had been directed by Elections Ontario’s website to the wrong areas and were unsure where they were supposed to vote.", "This was obviously a serious problem. It appears that the problem was due to the fact that Canada Post changed a number of postal codes in rural Dufferin–Caledon. However, this change started to take place almost two years ago, and even earlier in Caledon.", "Voters expect and deserve to have upfront and clear information from Elections Ontario. Mistakes like this are totally unacceptable when it comes to something as sacred as a citizen’s right to vote.", "I will be writing the Chief Electoral Officer on the matter, and I’m eager to hear the explanation behind the error, as well as what is being done to make sure that it doesn’t happen again. I know many Dufferin–Caledon voters are looking for answers, and I am hopeful that we will receive them." ],

The bill was thoroughly reviewed, clause by clause, by the Standing Committee on Finance and Economic Affairs yesterday, and I want to thank my fellow committee members for the detailed attention to the proposed amendments. I would also like to thank the many organizations that took part in the discussion and shared their valuable input.", "Mr. Speaker, I will use this time to again highlight how this bill would support a brighter, stronger future for the people of this province. The Building Opportunity and Securing Our Future Act is our government’s plan to build on the strengths of Ontarians to help everyone achieve their best so that together we can help grow our economy. We would do this by investing in people, building modern infrastructure, and supporting a dynamic and innovative business climate.", "Our plan would invest in transportation infrastructure so that goods and people can get where they need to go.", "Our plan would help give people greater security in retirement, especially the middle class; because we know that we must do more to ensure that people have adequate savings in their retirement years.", "Our plan would continue to focus on managing responsibly, because we know that making every dollar count will create a more efficient government. We remain firmly committed to balancing the budget by 2017-18.", "Mr. Speaker, I will take a moment to remind the House of some of the important initiatives included in this bill. A notable change from the previous budget bill includes amendments to the Gasoline Tax Act which would increase the tax rate on aviation fuel by one cent per litre each year for four years, beginning on September 1, 2014. The revenue generated by this change would be dedicated to public transit, transportation infrastructure and other priority infrastructure projects across the province.", "This bill also includes amendments to the Legislative Assembly Act which would continue the MPP pay freeze from April 1, 2014, until the budget is balanced.", "Mr. Speaker, this bill proposes legislative changes to foster a fair society. This includes amendments to create the administrative child support calculation service that would help parents determine child support through a new online service without going to court.", "Our 10-year plan will help create a stronger Ontario. It will build opportunities by investing in Ontario’s strength, and that is its people. Our new vision for education would continue investments in early learning. Through additional funding of $33.6 million over the next three years, we would support the ongoing operation and modernization of the child care system. Our plan would see the implementation of full-day kindergarten by September of this year, which means that full-day kindergarten would be available to approximately 265,000 children across the province, saving families up to $6,500 a year per child on child care costs, and most importantly, giving Ontario’s youngest learners the best start to their education.", "Mr. Speaker, I’ve said this before: Ontario remains among the top jurisdictions in North America for talent, training and skills development. We plan on making sure that every eligible student can pursue their education regardless of their financial circumstance. That is why the 30% Off Ontario Tuition grant would continue to support up to 260,000 students through their studies.", "And we won’t stop there. We will invest in our youth who have shouldered the brunt of job losses in the last recession. We plan to continue to help young people gain work experience and find jobs by extending the youth jobs strategy. We will focus on the services that are important to the people of Ontario by keeping education and health care strong. Our plan would see more than $750 million in additional funding by 2016-17 in more home and community care services, making sure that our health care system puts patients first and responds to their needs.", "Mr. Speaker, Ontario is a great place to live, to work and to do business, in part, because of our investments in hospitals, schools and transportation infrastructure, and we plan to continue building Ontario up to help stimulate the economy, create jobs, and increase prosperity and fairness for Ontarians.", "Our planned infrastructure investments would support more than 110,000 jobs, on average, each year in construction and related industries. By making strategic investments in roads, bridges and public transit, we will help manage congestion and travel times for commuters. We will move Ontario forward through new funding for investment in transportation infrastructure. Our plan would make nearly $29 billion available for investment over the next 10 years for public transit, transportation infrastructure and other priority infrastructure across the province.", "The greater Toronto and Hamilton area, Mr. Speaker, would receive $15 billion, and other regions of Ontario would receive nearly $14 billion. In the GTHA, proceeds from the fund would be invested in public transit priorities to address congestion, and outside the GTHA, the dedicated fund would be used for important infrastructure projects. This includes supporting local and regional transit, roads, bridges and other critical infrastructure.", "Our plan would invest $2.5 billion over the course of this year for highway rehabilitation and expansion projects across the province. This will create jobs and help move goods to market faster. We also plan to support municipal roads and bridges through a new, permanent $100-million fund.", "We are committed to investing up to $1 billion towards infrastructure development in the Ring of Fire, creating thousands of jobs in northern Ontario and providing more opportunities for aboriginal communities.", "We will continue to build strong public services. Through an investment of $700 million over the next decade, we will support critical repairs in hospitals so that patients can receive high-quality health care.", "We plan to continue to fund repairs in the post-secondary sector with additional funding of approximately $500 million over the next 10 years. Our plan would improve school conditions, support safe and healthy learning, and modernize classrooms.", "Ontario is an international hub for business and has been ranked as Canada’s most competitive province, but we have to build Ontario even stronger. We know that productivity is a key driver of economic growth and prosperity, and we know that a key challenge for Ontario and for countries around the world will be raising productivity growth in the future. That is why our plan is focused on creating business investments, developing a culture of innovation and bringing high-quality jobs to Ontario.", "We are going global. Ontario’s trade offices around the world are facilitating investments, and we will expand our growing global trade strategy to promote Ontario companies’ quality goods and services. This will help exporters find new markets that connect foreign buyers with potential Ontario exporters. It will help small and medium-sized businesses grow and create jobs.", "The new 10-year, $2.5-billion Jobs and Prosperity Fund would help secure business investments to support growth and create good jobs at home.", "A dedicated food-processing stream under the Jobs and Prosperity Fund would help Ontario’s farmers, through an investment of $40 million annually, to enhance productivity and competitiveness and expand market reach throughout Ontario and abroad.", "We are committed to helping Ontario’s innovators and entrepreneurs bring their discoveries to market. Through the Ontario Research Fund, we plan on dedicating $250 million over the next three years to invest in leading-edge research infrastructure. These investments will help sustain Ontario’s long-term prosperity by supporting research that will create the technologies and well-paid jobs of the future.", "We are also providing $25 million in funding over the next five years to support the Institute for Quantum Computing at the University of Waterloo, which will position Ontario at the forefront of the emerging field of quantum computing.", "We are proud to invest in the people of this province, in modern infrastructure, and to develop a competitive business climate. We want to make sure that our economy draws on everyone’s capabilities.", "After raising the minimum wage to $11 as of June 1, 2014, we plan on tying it to inflation to provide fairness to low-income workers and predictability for businesses.", "Mr. Speaker, we increased the annual Ontario Child Benefit per child to $1,310, and our plan is to index it to inflation to safeguard the purchasing power—" ],

That is why we are proposing a new investment of $485 million over the next three years to support adults with developmental disabilities. This would mean more funding to help individuals in their communities and expanded planning to help individuals transition to adulthood, find employment and achieve greater independence. We would support workers who serve Ontario’s most vulnerable by investing $200 million over three years for front-line workers in the developmental services sector, supporting salaries and wages as well as the overall transformation and modernization of the sector.", "We are committed to managing responsibly. We know that across-the-board cuts hurt public services like health care and education. Through a careful review of spending, we will be able to transform public services to increase efficiencies and improve outcomes. The 2013-14 deficit is estimated to be $11.3 billion, an improvement of $0.4 billion compared to the 2013 budget forecast. We will continue to make important decisions to root out waste, to focus on priorities and make every dollar count.", "We have a plan to move forward with maximizing and unlocking the full value of provincial assets, while maintaining provincial ownership of core government assets remains a priority. Some assets are no longer critical or necessary for delivering public services and our plan is to explore opportunities to maximize and unlock the value from real estate, as well as improve efficiencies and enhance performance and revenue of crown corporations, like the Ontario Power Generation, Hydro One and the Liquor Control Board of Ontario. We will do this in a responsible manner. We owe it to Ontarians to extract more value for them as taxpayers.", "Each and every year, the share of federal revenue raised in Ontario is higher than the share of federal spending in Ontario. This results in an $11-billion gap, according to most recently available figures. This money could be used in Ontario to fund more hospitals, more nurses, or public transit, but instead, it is redistributed to other regions of Canada to subsidize programs and services that Ontarians themselves may not enjoy. In fact, since 2006, the federal government has taken more than 110 unilateral actions that have hurt people and businesses across Ontario and undermined the province’s fiscal plan. That’s why our 2014 budget calls on the federal government to be a fair and collaborative partner.", "Our plan includes investments in retirement income security, and we plan to invest more than $130 billion in public infrastructure over the next 10 years. This is nearly five times more per capita than the federal government plans to invest over the same time period. As I mentioned before, we have also committed $1 billion for infrastructure in the Ring of Fire. That’s why we are calling on the federal government to work with us in these areas so that together we can build a more prosperous Ontario in a more prosperous Canada.", "Our plan also includes a strategy to enhance retirement savings because we know that most people don’t have a workplace pension plan. In many cases, voluntary savings are inadequate, and people are living longer, fortunately. That’s why we are moving forward with our proposed mandatory pension plan. The Ontario Retirement Pension Plan would be the first of its kind in Canada and would build on the strengths of the CPP. It would target those most at risk of under-saving, particularly middle-income earners without a workplace pension plan, to help working Ontario families build a more secure retirement future. It would provide a predictable stream of income in retirement by pooling longevity and investment risk and indexing benefits to inflation. It would require equal contributions to be shared between employers and employees, and it would aim to provide a replacement rate of 15% of an individual’s earnings, up to a maximum annual earnings threshold of $90,000. We would introduce the ORPP in 2017, to coincide with the expected reductions in employment insurance premiums.", "Our 2014 budget is our plan for building opportunity and securing our future. It is our plan for a strong Ontario, with more jobs and more opportunity across the province. Our plan, as I’ve mentioned, includes investing in people, building modern infrastructure, and supporting a dynamic and innovative business climate.", "We know that at times it will not be easy. We know that our plan is ambitious and forward-looking. But we are determined to work together with all Ontarians to make the right investments in our future and to remain on our path to balance the budget by 2017-18. I call on all members of this House to support our plan so we can work together to build a stronger future for all Ontarians." ],

There were some highlights made. I think the biggest thing overall that you want to bring people back to is the fact of our record debt and deficit and that the third-largest budget item is just servicing the interest payments on that. That’s over $11 billion, I think, close to $12 billion, a year. It’s the third-largest budget item: health care, education, and then paying the interest on the money that the Liberal government has borrowed on behalf of the people of Ontario.", "That is the biggest threat to our front-line health care, education and social programs that we all agree need to be invested in. We hear from our communities all the time. CUPE was protesting yesterday in front of Frost Manor, a long-term-care home in Lindsay, about the cutbacks that they are going to have to caregivers to provide care to our elderly and frail population. That’s not a competent government. When you are that deep in debt and deficit, that threatens the province’s success. That doesn’t encourage businesses to come and set up, to expand and to create the jobs that we all desperately need in the province of Ontario.", "I will have time to speak a little bit more later on the pension plan, because I do want to touch on that and what I heard in my riding during the election.", "I spoke earlier today about the aviation tax. That’s a huge issue that the member from York South–Weston brought up in her comments. We heard from the committee this week, and I just want to quickly say that it is the worst thing that can happen for the aviation industry. Again, I’ll go further into that when I have more time." ],

You won’t find a savings of $265 million.”", "I don’t think the government fully understood the divestiture of Ontario Northland and what it meant in terms of severances. Actually, in the Auditor General’s report, she acknowledged that the government truly had absolutely no idea—they did not understand the severance criteria—and as a result, they would not save $265 million. It would, in fact, cost $820 million to sell all of Ontario Northland. That’s from the Auditor General’s report that we, the PCs and the NDP—have successfully fought to bring the Auditor General. She brought that number out, and now that it’s known, Speaker, you would think that they would pull back entirely from the fire sale of Ontario Northland. Instead, they’re bent on selling this one division, even though according to the Auditor General’s numbers, if we leaf through her report, it’s going to cost the taxpayers between $50 million and $70 million to do." ],

I’m going to walk us all through many of the components. I’d like to start with one of the Liberals’ own consultants, who was hired more than two years ago. I’m going to read some exact quotes from Don Drummond to kick this all off.", "Don Drummond outlined some big-ticket reforms that he said would be “an important turning point in the province’s history.” These are all quotes now, so I won’t repeat the word “quote” every time. He called for a “sharp degree of fiscal restraint.” He said, “The government must take daring fiscal action early,” and we must “act swiftly and boldly.” To balance the budget will “require tough decisions,” and “the treatment may be difficult.” “Most of the burden … must fall on spending.” He called for “a wrenching reduction from the path that spending is now on.”", "Speaker, here we are, more than two years later, and the Liberals are now implementing an expenditure review to study whether to take any of those urgent actions of two years ago that were recommended by their own economist.", "That’s how we started on this long path. We’ve learned a few things along the way, though. We continue to hear—and the member who spoke earlier repeated what the Premier has said and what the finance minister has said: that they are on track to balance the budget by 2017-18. Well, let me bring some actual facts to the floor of this Legislature.", "Again, if we look at the government’s own documents—these are documents from the Ministry of Finance that were delivered to this Liberal government. At the time, it was called Confidential Advice to Cabinet, and it was alarmingly opposite to what the government claims.", "If you look in the budget of last year, Speaker, there’s a quote that says that “the government is on track to meet the steadily declining deficit targets outlined in the 2012 budget” and achieve a surplus in 2017-18. This is the government’s discussion of what they’re telling the people. This is printed.", "In the document from the Ministry of Finance, it’s the opposite. These are the documents we were never supposed to see. This is the confidential advice, and it says, for 2014-15 and 2015-16, the government is “not on track to meet” the budget deficits. This is the Ministry of Finance internal documents, confidential advice to the Premier of Ontario when Kathleen Wynne took over the Liberal government. She asked for a report on the status and she—" ],

I’ll send it over to you.", "These are the confidential documents that the Premier asked for from her Ministry of Finance, and received, that said, “You are not on track to meet the budget,” yet they went out and told the world, the taxpayers and this Legislature that they were indeed on track.", "So, Speaker, I wanted to bring that to the floor of this Legislature because we continue to hear one thing from the government in terms of the 2014 budget, which is the same as we heard in the 2013 budget, which was contrary to the actual facts from their own Ministry of Finance that were to be kept from us at one point.", "I wanted to continue on this theme for a moment, Speaker, of the fact that we don’t actually have all the facts. This is actually a very disturbing scenario that’s playing out right now. The real numbers have not been presented to us for almost a year now—certainly more than three quarters of a year.", "Last October, Finance Minister Charles Sousa failed to deliver the long-range assessment of Ontario’s fiscal environment as he was obligated to do under the Fiscal Transparency and Accountability Act. He was supposed to turn over the numbers but never did. Here’s what I asked him. This is a quote from Hansard. Here’s what I asked him during question period last October, only a few days after the law said he had to turn over these numbers: “Minister, the Fiscal Transparency and Accountability Act … states, ‘Within two years after each provincial election, the minister shall release a” long-term “assessment of Ontario’s fiscal environment.’ Minister, you’re two weeks late. When will you be releasing this assessment that you were legally required to release ….”", "So the minister responded that there’s a fall economic statement coming out and that first-quarter results—we will be hearing of it in the fall economic statement. Basically, he said, “Look, there’s a fall economic statement coming out. You’ll get it then.” When the fall economic statement did come out, there were no medium-term outlook numbers included. In addition, individual ministry expense numbers were not listed for 2016-17, just the total program spending which magically falls within this balanced budget; no numbers to back it up.", "Then, in February, the minister announced he would not be presenting the third-quarter results on February 15. People, this is also something that’s required under the law, under the Fiscal Transparency and Accountability Act. They’ve been keeping the statistics from us because all of these figures would back up what their own Ministry of Finance said, that they’re not on track to balance the budget.", "I wanted to start off by at least talking about the fact that when they tell us something—we have been in a minority government; we’ve been able to get the truth because in the committees where our two opposition parties held a majority, we were able to ask for these documents, vote on them and be eventually awarded the documents.", "Sadly, those days of actually seeing the facts are long gone now. For the next four years, in a majority government, we have no way any further to get the kinds of documents that we were able to get in the last two and a half years, which literally blew the lid off the gas plant scandal, which got us to the Ornge scandal facts, which showed us they’re not on track to balance and a myriad of other details—Ontario Northland, which we spoke about earlier: the fact that at the time, when they were telling us one thing, a savings of $265 million, the documents showed us it was actually going to cost $790 million, something they never admitted to until they were outed with these documents, and finally the Auditor General brought the real number, and by that time it had grown to $820 million.", "Those days are over. I just have to say that: Those days of getting to the bottom of these stories and getting to the facts, they’re over. But we will continue to dig, and dig deep, for everything. They say one thing, but they do another.", "Here’s a great example, Speaker: In the budget, they speak about the Ring of Fire. On May 25, our Premier was in Thunder Bay and she gave a great announcement. I want you to know that I was very pleased when I heard that announcement." ],

  "text" : [ "Don’t worry; it didn’t last long.", "It said, “We will commit $1 billion, with or without federal government involvement, towards transportation infrastructure that will help make the Ring of Fire a reality.” Sadly, that joy in northern Ontario did not last long because, as we’ve now seen on page 89 of the budget—let me read you what it says: “The province is willing to commit up to $1 billion towards infrastructure development, contingent on matching investment by the federal government.” So they’ve backed down from their first statement, “with or without.” It’s a bold statement during a campaign. We always hear these things during the campaign: “This is what we promise.” This is the reality; page 89 tells the truth.", "Sadly, we’ve seen very little activity in the Ring of Fire, so I want to take a few minutes and talk about the Ring of Fire, because it is one of my favourite topics, as people who are viewing know. I love to speak about the Ring of Fire. It is a place I’ve been to four times now. It’s complicated to get there; I’ll give you that. It’s not an easy task to get to the Ring of Fire. It’s a lot easier in the winter, by the way. It is in the Far North. I would envision that it looks today like what it must have looked like in Sudbury over a hundred years ago.", "It’s in the middle of nowhere; that’s putting it bluntly. It’s in the Far North. It’s about 300 kilometres due west of Attawapiskat. If you look on the map and you look at the bottom end of Hudson Bay, James Bay, you’ll see Attawapiskat, you’ll see Moosonee. Look due west, about 300 kilometres, and you’ll find Webequie, a beautiful First Nations community. This is just a little bit east of Webequie.", "In the summer, you fly to Webequie. You get yourself down to the shore and you take a float plane from there into the Ring of Fire area. From there, you take another helicopter ride that gets you into the base camp. This is where there were almost three dozen companies who have staked claims. There were really about three that were very actively working.", "In the winter, it’s a lot easier to get there, as I’ve said. You fly directly from where you’re leaving and you land right on Koper Lake. The lake has a runway that’s ploughed on it. It’s very exciting to do that if you’ve never done that. You land on the lake, and then you take the helicopter ride into the base camp.", "I have to tell you, the first time I ever flew in there, I was so excited to see these blue-and-white tents, the tent city that was created. Because back in the day, between 1978 and 1992, when I owned my own company, a marketing company here in Ontario, one of my clients was Canadian Can-Tex, and they proudly make these canvas buildings that were bought by base camps up in the Ring of Fire. So as we were flying in, I could see my former clients’ products there—a big smile on my face. As we got a lot closer, as the helicopter came down we saw these mounds—just mounds—of drill rods.", "Again, in my corporate days in the 1970s and 1980s, we had about 10 clients in the mining sector, from J.S. Redpath, from mining and engineering firms, and Atlas Copco, who make drill bits. There was a company called Craig Bit, who became Kenroc and then became Atlas Copco. These were all clients, and all of these companies—there are 12 in North Bay and one in Powassan—make these drill bits. There are mounds of them stacked up there. It was so exciting to see that, because a lot of those products were made in my hometown.", "As we landed and started talking to the base camp operators, and to the vice-president of Noront and people from Cliffs—Noront, that one summer, had spent about $200 million drilling. These are drill bits that they need, that are made in my hometown. These are drill rods. This is actual drilling equipment that is made all throughout Ontario. It’s great business all throughout Ontario, not just in northern Ontario. These companies had about $200 million in business that one year.", "As I said, I’ve been there four times. The second and third times I was there, there was very little action going on, and I said to the president of the company, “What the hang is going on here? How much are you spending on drilling this year?”, considering they spent $200 million on drilling the year before. The answer was, “Nothing. Zero.” Well, the problem is that they have shareholders, and they said, “Why would we continue to spend our shareholders’ money when there’s no rail, there’s no road, there’s no way to get the products out of the Ring of Fire?” With all the time that has passed, they had run out of hope as well. I think that’s the most upsetting part of it, that they’ve run out of hope.", "Sadly for some, they’ve run out of time. As we know, one of the majors has now pulled out. They’ve now moved out of Ontario, as a matter of fact, not just out of the Ring of Fire, and not just out of Toronto, where their head office was here. They’ve moved out of Ontario. They sold their base camp.", "They went from 125 people each—250 men and women who were working there, just at the exploration stage. This was just exploring for the minerals, never mind actually drilling when they’re in production—the amount of people that they’d be. This is just exploring. They’ve gone now. There are about four, five or six people left now up in that whole place. It’s very sad.", "My fourth trip up there was the saddest—to see the torn plastic flapping in the winds of camps that have been abandoned. It was very, very sad to know that, so far in the drilling that they’ve done, they’ve determined that there is about $60 billion worth of chromite—it’s a metal that they found—along with the nickel, gold, silver, platinum and the other ores.", "Chromite is the metal that is needed to make stainless steel. There is $60 billion in chromite sitting there, Speaker, that is untapped, because there is no way in and no way out for the ore. Again, as I have been saying to this government: Ontario Northland has been your expert in hauling ore. You own Ontario Northland. The people of Ontario own this. It’s owned by the taxpayers. They’re not at the table. They’re not at the design stage to talk about road or rail. They’re not there.", "This is a lost opportunity that I am genuinely hoping that we can see be captured. It’s got to happen. It’s got to happen—not just for the north, but for all of Ontario. The engineering firms, the legal firms and the accounting firms all through Ontario are depending on this business.", "I wanted to speak about another item in this tax-and-spend budget, and it’s the tax. We held hearings on Monday here in the Legislature, and we heard from a couple of the aviation firms, who talked to us about the crushing effect that this tax increase will have. Now, it doesn’t sound like much; it’s only a penny, then two cents, then three cents, then four cents. It’s a 148% increase. Tax on aviation fuel today in Ontario is 2.7 cents, and it’s going to 6.7 cents incrementally. The aviation sector calculates this will cost about 400,000 passengers a year—292,000 to 400,000 passengers a year. It will cost several thousand jobs. Why, Speaker? Because new taxes never create jobs. It works the opposite way, people; it works the opposite way. I’ve never seen a tax that has created jobs.", "It’s going to cost more to fly out of Canada, which means this budget item is an economic development initiative for Buffalo. It’s a great economic development initiative for Detroit and all other border cities where people will cross the border and fly out of the United States because it’s cheaper. Why would we be doing this when other jurisdictions are eliminating the gas tax on international flights? Look at British Columbia: They got it right. Other provinces than Ontario got it right. British Columbia eliminated the gas tax on international travel, and as a result, Vancouver now has 22 new international flights bringing thousands upon thousands upon tens of thousands of people; more employees in repair, overhaul and maintenance; more hangar fees; more fuel that’s sold; more business. Business is what makes it spin.", "Here we are in Ontario, when other people are eliminating the gas tax, and we’re adding it. “We’ve got a great idea: Let’s have a gas tax.” Why? Because they cannot balance their budget. So they look to all sources to tax, and then, of course, sadly, they continue to spend. It’s the spending side of the formula that they should be working on, not the taxing side.", "It’s not only passenger travel that will be affected. Think how much cargo comes in and out of Ontario. All of our manufacturers that produce goods that are flown to markets around the world have a tax added to them, which means products are going to become more expensive. The products that we buy are all going to become more expensive. So while others are eliminating, we’re adding.", "Speaker, I visited aviation firms in the North this last weekend. I sat and had breakfast with the president of one of the companies in North Bay. I talked to you earlier about the fact that I had my own corporation until 1992. I sold it and took over a non-profit—actually, started a non-profit and ran it for seven years—in the aerospace sector. When the federal government downsized CFB North Bay and walked away from all the hangars, I and six others bought the facility from the federal government for a dollar. We had a great opportunity, a really great business idea and a great business plan. We formed a local development corporation, and this local development corporation was tasked to bring aerospace companies to North Bay. Very quickly, I’ll run to the end of the story, because it did take seven years. We ran this non-profit basically on a dollar. We had virtually no expenses, and for seven years no sales, but eventually we attracted a couple of international aerospace companies, who are being affected by this budget today.", "I wrote a business plan that attracted Bombardier to move to North Bay, Ontario, where they assemble their water bomber aircraft. I also wrote the business plan that attracted Voyageur Airways to North Bay, and today they have 352 employees. These are the kinds of companies who are going to be affected by the aviation fuel tax. Any company that’s in a flight training school, companies that do repair and overhaul where aircraft have to fly in, companies that are in charter or scheduled airline services, their bills are going to go up. Companies who are in the cargo business, their bills are going to go up.", "I met with companies over the weekend, and I assure you, Speaker, that the two representatives who spoke in the committee hearings on Monday are accurate. They are telling us this 148% tax increase is going to cost 292,000 to 400,000 passengers, and it’s going to cost us several thousand jobs in Ontario. It will likely create several thousand jobs in Buffalo, Detroit and all of the other border communities as passengers rush there to take their flights, which will mean those airlines will bring on more flights, and they’ll have a greater requirement for hangar space, repair and overhaul, staffing, and airside services. This is what’s going to happen, Speaker.", "Another area that we heard about through this budget, and a lot of talk about it—I’m going to try to shed some light on it—is the Trillium Trust. Speaker, I have said in the Legislature—in fact, this very morning I stood in the Legislature and said specifically that our party is not against asset sales, not at all. We are, however, against selling an asset, which is a one-time source of revenue, and using it for your operating expenses, using it to bury in your general revenue, which only tries to lower the deficit. It is akin to selling the furniture, or, as some would say, burning the furniture to keep warm. What happens next year when you don’t have any furniture to sell or to burn? You’re using one-time asset sales to put into general revenue.", "I know the government says that’s not what they’re doing, but we’ve heard a lot of times what they say they’re doing and what the facts are. So let me give you the facts from their own bills, Speaker. When an asset is sold, the first thing that they do is they “qualify the asset.” There are no guidelines to tell us what makes a qualified asset. They decide whether this building that they’re going to sell is qualified to become part of the Trillium Trust. So if the answer is no—and, again, we don’t know the criteria of what makes it qualified—then they sell the building, and they put the money in general revenue. We’ll never know—we’ll never know, Speaker—it’ll just be lumped in with general revenue. The building is sold. The money is gone. Nothing good for next year comes out of it.", "If it does qualify under these mysterious criteria, then—and here’s where it gets tricky—they may require, not must require, that a portion—not all of it, but a portion—be credited to the Trillium Trust. So here we go again. Once an asset is qualified, they don’t have to put it in the Trillium Trust; they may put it there. And they don’t have to put it all there; they may put a portion of it. So where’s the money going? Again, we’ll never know. There’s no auditing mechanism on each transaction.", "I would attest that the bulk of it is actually going into general revenue. That’s where it starts, by the way. It goes into the consolidated revenue. Then it’s supposed to be pulled out to put in the trust. It may be pulled out, and it may be a portion. I contest that that’s how they plan on balancing their budget. They’re going to sell assets and put it in general revenue, instead of cutting back on their spending. They can only tax so much before people will revolt. They’re going to bring this revenue in by selling buildings, selling assets. I believe that’s what they’re going to do.", "Speaker, yesterday in clause-by-clause, where all three parties reviewed the budget schedules, I asked for some amendments. Our party asked for some amendments. One of them was to bring the Auditor General in so that whenever an asset is sold, the Auditor General would report to the Legislature within 90 days what was sold, whether it was a qualified or not-qualified asset and, if it was not a qualified asset, where did the money go? If it was a qualified asset, did the money get into the Trillium Trust, and, if so, how much of it went in? It’s very simple. It’s all about being open and transparent. It was what I would have thought a very friendly amendment—open and transparent. That’s all we asked for: What are you selling? How much did you get for it? What are you doing with the money? This is not rocket science. This is a very simple request of legislators working together.", "The Liberals voted against that. They voted us down. They voted against open and transparent sale of assets, plain and simple. There’s no nice way to say that, Speaker. That is what they did yesterday. They agree with the loophole they have created. Again, I think that loophole was created on purpose. I think it was done with intent. I think the intention was to be able to sell assets, get that money, put it against the deficit so they can achieve this target that their own Ministry of Finance says is not going to be achieved, and we’ll never be the wiser. I think that’s what they have done. That’s why we brought the amendments, and I would suggest that’s why, on the amendments to offer open and transparent sale of assets, they voted us down.", "Speaker, I talked to you a little bit earlier about my earlier career as a business person, when I owned the corporation that handled those mining companies; I talked a little bit about my stint in non-profits, which turned out to be 11 years.", "Then I ran successfully for mayor of the city of North Bay. One of the first things I did was put assets for sale. Why? Because they were non-productive. When you drive down a street and you see house, house, house, vacant lot, house, house, house—it turned out we owned 108 of those vacant lots around the city. One of the first things I did as mayor was put those lots for sale. We went to the public and told them what we were going to do. We told them that we were going to identify these lots. We advertised them publicly: street name, street address, lot by lot. In many cases, we had photos of them. In many instances, we had—well, we had big “for sale” signs. I know I hammered in some “for sale” signs myself as part of our promotion. We did this in an open and transparent way. I wanted people to know we were selling these non-productive assets. I wanted people to know that. We never did anything but tell people about them. We sold these assets. Two summers before in the city of North Bay, we had construction, sadly, of only seven houses. Two years later, we had construction of 107 houses. It was an absolutely amazing turnaround because we took these non-productive assets and put them for sale. So, philosophically, I’m not against the sale of assets.", "We took that money and put it in the reserve. We didn’t put it to balance our budget. We didn’t put it in the operating budget. Because what happens next year when you don’t have 108 lots to sell? How are you going to balance then? That’s what is happening here. We took those properties, we advertised them, we publicized them, and we sold them. People bought them, people built 107 houses in the city that summer, one summer, and we celebrated it.", "When I took office, we had the lowest reserves in Ontario at $4.5 million, and when I left, we had reserves of over $22 million. So when a storm came in July 2006 and it cost us more than $1 million and we did not get any assistance from the provincial government, we dipped in. We had the money. It was a one-time event. We used one-time revenue to pay for a one-time, in that case, tragedy. That’s what this is for, not selling your assets for one-time revenue and putting it into your general government. This is going to be awful, Speaker, when they don’t have anything to sell tomorrow. That’s what is going to happen.", "That’s why we spent time on Monday talking about the Trillium Trust. That’s why we fought so hard in committee yesterday to have these amendments passed. We spoke passionately, Speaker, about getting these amendments because there are going to be regrets. I think you already know that. I know that you know it’s wrong. I know that you know that. Taking one-time money and putting it into your operating is wrong, and I know you know that.", "Speaker, I want to switch gears and talk about something that wasn’t in the budget that should have been in the budget: energy. There’s nothing in the budget to lower the cost of energy, yet in the finance committee, SCOFEA, as we call it, we toured eight cities together in Ontario, just during the Christmas break. I added 22 cities to that roster and travelled from Sarnia to Kenora, from Timmins to Cornwall, Toronto and everywhere in between. What we heard loud and clear at every one of these finance hearings that were designed to help us craft the budget—we heard about energy everywhere. There wasn’t one stop that we made in any city that people did not line up and talk to us about the skyrocketing energy bills.", "We know that when the Liberal government took office power was 4.3 cents a kilowatt hour. Before May, it was 12.9 cents a kilowatt. It tripled under this government. After May, it went over 13 cents a kilowatt hour. Now we have the highest energy rates in North America. That’s what we have in Ontario.", "We have 300,000 fewer people working in manufacturing. We have companies who have left Ontario who told us on the way out of Ontario, “Your skyrocketing hydro rates are costing business. We can’t stay here.”" ],

Whether they were representatives from the Ontario Chamber of Commerce or representatives from the food bank, it didn’t matter. Everybody and all sectors came and said to us, “You’ve got to do something about the high cost of energy.”", "I’m going to tell you, Speaker, it’s very sad that there’s absolutely nothing in this budget—absolutely nothing—that brings relief to families, to seniors or to businesses for the skyrocketing energy rates. There’s no plan. In fact, the government has said to us: “Brace yourself. Skyrocketing energy rates are going up a further 42% over the next five years.” This is the information that we’re getting from the government. Nobody here is denying that—a 42% increase. I’m denying it. I think 42% is the starting point. I think we’re going to see far greater than a 42% increase. We’ve seen that.", "Speaker, the highest energy rates in North America are now causing businesses to leave Ontario. Nothing in the budget—not a peep, not a word, not a mention.

We had just got elected October 6, 2011. In November, the Auditor General came out with his report. It was a scathing—we use that word far too often to describe his, and now her, reports on this government, but it was a scathing report about hydro. One of the things the auditor talked to us about was how many companies were going to be leaving Ontario because of the skyrocketing hydro rates. Nobody over on the other side listened. It was all barracking, and they did not pay attention to this at all. They just—" ],

They get a knock at the door one day from Quebec, who said, “Why are you in Timmins, 75 kilometres from the Quebec border? You should be in Quebec for cheap power.” And they did go. They moved 115 kilometres over the border into Quebec. They terminated 672 men and women in Timmins, tore the facility down to the ground so that they don’t even pay property taxes, and moved to Quebec for cheap power. That’s an example of exactly what the Auditor General was talking about. You would not pay attention to his threat that day. Now we have, in Timmins alone, 672 fewer people—we’ve seen the examples all across southeastern and southwestern Ontario.", "Not only did we do this eight-city tour, which I extended into a 30-city tour, but during prorogation it gave a real opportunity—at that time, I was energy critic. I travelled to 62 cities during prorogation. It was purely on an energy tour, again, right across all of Ontario, and it was quite amazing that so many companies would show me letters from American companies, especially around Cornwall and Brockville. They would show me letters from mayors in American companies just over the border that said, “I have no idea why you continue to run your company in Cornwall,” Brockville, whatever, “when you could cross the border for cheap power.” Sadly, some of these companies were tempted and were lured—just the realities of business. They saw the writing on the wall. They heard the Auditor General say that rates were going to triple. They believed the auditor, and they had to go. That’s what has happened. But, Speaker, there’s not one word in this budget that addresses the single most important issue that we heard—Liberals heard, NDP heard and PCs heard—as we travelled on the same bus and the same airplane together to these cities. Every one of them talked about energy rates. Sadly, that never made it into the budget. There’s no relief coming for families, for seniors and for businesses with respect to their energy rates.", "Another issue that this government has been spending a lot of time promoting is their ORPP, the Ontario Registered Pension Plan." ],

It’s a PRPP, a pooled registered pension plan. This allows people to be in a large pool of companies from all around Ontario. It allows individuals to get involved in a pension plan, and if they move from one company to another, it’s portable. They can transfer it. We do favour the PRPP. It’s part of our platform as well. It’s part of our beliefs. We believe that. We believe people should be investing. We believe that they should have it portable. We believe that when they die, it should be part of their estate, that their family can share in that money that they have put away. The ORPP, of course, does not do that, as a side unintended consequence, no doubt, that should something happen and you have a premature death, the money that you’ve invested is gone; the money that your company has invested is gone.", "A survey of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business found that 86% of their members are against an ORPP, and 53% of their members said they would have to cut staff if this is implemented. I’ll talk about that in a moment.", "Speaker, on Monday we had the Ontario Chamber of Commerce. They came and talked about the ORPP as well, and they said in their study that 4% of their members said that they will leave Ontario if this is implemented. I don’t think that’s an idle threat. They have 60,000 member companies—several million employees, but 60,000 member companies—and 4% is 2,400 that will close and leave Ontario, joining the others that have left Ontario.", "I said that the CFIB said that 53% of their members would cut staff. When I was travelling through Ontario in the last couple of weeks, I asked one small business owner with 10 employees—this will be an anecdotal story—to tell me about the ORPP. He said, “I will have to fire one employee, use that salary to pay my share of the pension plan and make the other nine work harder.” That’s what he is talking about. That’s what the CFIB is talking about, but there is somebody else talking about this as well.", "Again, I started off this discussion 45 minutes ago, talking about the fact that, when there was a minority government, we had access to files. We could have access to one-time confidential documents, advice to the Premier—all of these documents that I spoke about earlier: the ones that exposed the gas plant scandal, the ones that exposed Ornge, the ones that exposed the Ontario Northland scandal.", "Those documents also talked about an ORPP. It was quite fascinating, actually. It was advice to the Premier that for every $2 billion spent on this payroll tax, 18,000 jobs would be lost. So, if it does match the CPP, if it gets to that point, that’s 150,000 jobs in Ontario that would be lost. The guys at the chamber of commerce weren’t making this up. This was the confidential advice to the Premier. This is the advice that she got, as well, telling her that this is going to cost you tens upon tens of thousands of jobs.", "You have to ask yourself: Why would you do that, knowing that it’s going to cost you jobs, and hearing from the chamber, who are telling you that 4% of their members have said that they’ll leave the province, that 86% disapprove and that 53% are going to cut staff? That’s what the advice to the Premier was. That’s how that got calculated, they said, because of less productivity and companies cutting back.", "Basically, on the ORPP, what it is—it’s not a voluntary program; it’s mandatory. You would pay a portion of your salary—the numbers go from $700 or $800 up to $1,710—and then your employer matches that number. So, in the company of the chap whom I was speaking with, a small tech firm of 10 people, he’s talking about $17,000 as his share. That’s just one little company.", "You saw the comment the day after this came out about Magna. Their share, they calculated, will be $36 million a year, and they said, “We’re not going to be opening another plant in Ontario.” Well, why would you when all you’ve got is this continual threat and fact of taxes? Tax and spend, tax and spend—these companies are going to continue to leave Ontario. I’m not threatening that these companies will leave; they’re going to continue to leave. They’re leaving one after another.", "We saw it before the election with Kellogg’s and all of the other companies that we spoke about—Caterpillar. These are companies that have left Ontario. They didn’t close. They’re not out of business. Kellogg’s, Heinz and Caterpillar aren’t out of business; they’re just out of Ontario because of the high-cost regime that has been built here in the past 11 years. That’s why they’re gone.", "Whether it’s high energy, the threat of the payroll tax or just the threat of taxes in general, this government has a habit of answering their problems by creating a tax. That’s what they do.", "So the fact that you have a $12.5-billion deficit—remember the deficit was $9.2 billion two years ago; it grew to $11.3 billion last year and now it’s forecast to be $12.5 billion this year. People, we’re going the wrong way. This is very concerning and alarming to business. They look at that and think, “You know what? They’re going the wrong way. They won’t rein in their spending. They’re going to come after me next. They’re going to come after more taxes.” When it comes to making a decision about expanding in Ontario, or even locating in Ontario or closing in Ontario, these are the very decisions that companies bring. This is how business people think. High taxes don’t create jobs. This payroll tax, that aviation tax, those payroll taxes, those income taxes—those are going to cost jobs, plain and simple. People will go elsewhere. We have 300,000 fewer people working in manufacturing today. This is not, “The sky is falling;” I’m telling you that the sky is falling. We have 300,000 fewer people in manufacturing.", "Speaker, I can continue to tell you that there are other problems here in Ontario. Let’s look just at last month, the month of June: Ontario lost 34,000 jobs just last month, in the month of June. Now, sadly, it was mostly amongst people aged 15 to 24. Our province’s unemployment rate is 7.5%—up from 7.3% the month before—compared to the national unemployment rate of 7.1%. This is the 90th consecutive month that Ontario has higher than the national average of unemployment. It’s nice to be first in a lot of things, but being first in unemployment is not one of those things; being first in payroll taxes, which we are today, is not one of those things; being first in energy rates is not one of those things to be proud of in Ontario. Ninety consecutive months of unemployment rates higher than the national average. It belies every speech that our Premier has ever given. It simply does that.", "These members continue to talk about our strong economy in Ontario when the facts are opposite: 34,000 fewer people working today than last month; 300,000 men and women not working in manufacturing.", "Again, one of those confidential documents that we had was very telling. When this government and their ministers continue to tell us one thing about employment—well, here’s the quote from the internal document from the secretary of cabinet to the Premier a month after she was elected—of critical importance. This is to the Premier: “The economy has not yet regained the strength of pre-2008.” There are “fewer jobs relative to our population and more unemployed.” This is the advice to the Premier. She knows there are fewer people working, while “per capita output of the economy remains below its pre-recession benchmark.” That’s the fact—Speaker, that’s the fact.", "So here is what’s happening: Because they can’t balance their budget, because they can’t address this $12.5-billion deficit that they are staring at, their answer was to go on a spending spree. They’re going to be spending 5.7 billion new dollars in this budget, taxing people to help pay for it, but, at the end of the day, there’s $3.4 billion more in spending. Speaker, because they can’t balance their budget, we have real cuts all across Ontario, whether you are in those cities that we talked about earlier, from Sarnia to Kenora, from Timmins to Cornwall, Toronto and everywhere in between that we toured. Those are the cities we toured.", "So here’s what they’re doing: They are cutting, right across Ontario—they have already cut physiotherapy for seniors. They have done that, Speaker. They have cut physiotherapy to seniors by 100 visits down to four visits. They have cut diabetes testing strips. They’ve done that." ],

I have to agree with him when he highlights the big problems facing our province, particularly with regard to the high unemployment rate, the fact that we are above the national average, and particularly when it comes to youth as well.", "I also want to acknowledge and commend the member for raising concerns around the Ring of Fire, the amazing potential that the Ring of Fire presents and the fact that it is a wonderful opportunity for our province to create manufacturing jobs, to invest in natural resources, and hopefully not only to extract those natural resources but also to provide a mechanism where we actually add value to those resources to create jobs here.", "While I disagree with some of the solutions to these problems, I agree with raising those. I think it’s important that all members of this House are aware of the problems. If we have a particular circumstance going on in this province where we’ve seen unemployment rates increase and beat the national average, we need to come up with solutions.", "I disagree with the solution that has been proposed by the Conservatives, the idea that we continually need to cut taxes, and that cutting taxes will eventually lead to a trickle-down effect and create more jobs. We’ve tried that. For the past number of years—for the past decade—we’ve tried this policy of cutting corporate tax rates and hoping that will create jobs. If something hasn’t worked in the past, does it make sense to continually do more of the same, hoping that a new result will occur? That doesn’t make sense, in my mind. I think we really need to turn or put a fresh pair of eyes and critically analyze the solution, because it’s not in using the same tactics that haven’t worked before. We have to come up with something more innovative.", "But I certainly agree with some of the key issues that have been raised in terms of the problems with this budget, and I’ll get into those in detail in my time. Thank you so much." ],

I’m going to end by reminding us of his comments and a quick synopsis. Again, two years ago, Don Drummond said that we needed a “sharp degree of fiscal restraint.” This budget doesn’t have it. He said, “The government must take daring fiscal action early.” Well, that was two years ago, so I guess that one’s off the list. We must act “swiftly and boldly.” Again, swiftly was two years ago, when the deficit was $9.2 billion; it went to $11.3 billion and now it’s scheduled for $12.5 billion. So there’s nothing swift about it and there’s nothing bold about it.", "To balance the budget will “require tough decisions.” Well, spending 5.7 billion new dollars is not a tough decision; that’s the easiest thing to have done. He said that “the treatment may be difficult.” Well, there’s nothing difficult about a candy-coated budget. Anybody can do that. There’s nothing difficult there at all, Speaker. He said, “Most of the burden … must fall on spending,” yet this budget has $3.4 billion in net new spending. He called for “a wrenching reduction from the path that spending is now on.” We know that that did not happen." ],

We have also seen the headlines from Bloomberg News that warn your budget will lead to the biggest cuts since Harris, and yet this government has remained steadfast in its approach to freebies, no-strings-attached policies and loopholes. I can’t honestly say that I am surprised, because this seems to be business as usual for this government.", "While this government focuses on its own priorities, I am focused on delivering real results for the people of my riding of London–Fanshawe. What I am seeing is that there is no plan to reduce hydro rates, no plan for new ideas for jobs, no end to corporate tax giveaways that reward companies that ship jobs overseas and, clearly, no credible plan to balance the books, and here we are waiting for this government to hack away at our services and assets to make up for the billions of dollars they themselves allowed to fly out the door.", "This government needs to hear this: The people of London–Fanshawe can no longer afford to pay for the mistakes of this government. Your spending is set to increase by $3.4 billion, yet you ask the people to do more with less. Your private pension plan is a page right out of Stephen Harper’s book, and the public plan you tout won’t even be on the radar for three to four years, if at all. The people of London–Fanshawe need your help now, not years from now. In spite of this government’s claims to want to uphold transparency and accountability, the Premier continues to dodge Andrea Horwath and the NDP’s very pragmatic call to have your fiscal plan reviewed by the Auditor General.", "The Fiscal Transparency and Accountability Act calls for an independent review of the government’s budget in each election year and you’ve continued to deny the measures of transparency at every turn, even though this is the only time when the Auditor General has the authority to examine the government’s revenue projections, the government’s expense estimates and the government’s fiscal assumptions. Further, it’s the only opportunity for Ontarians to hear from the independent officer about whether your budget can be trusted. It’s very disturbing that back in 2004 the Premier actually supported the Fiscal Transparency and Accountability Act to crack down on the notoriously inaccurate budgets that governments campaign on. Today, the Premier has the opportunity to quell all opposition and doubt about her budget by requesting, under section 17 of the Auditor General Act, that the auditor promptly review the fiscal plan and report publicly on her findings. But alas, we know this will be another squandered opportunity to bring transparency and accountability to this province and to the people of this province.", "Why do the Premier’s fire sale of public assets, her cuts to public services and her layoffs of up to 100,000 people need to be hidden from the public? I urge the Premier to stand behind the budget she claims is the best way forward for our province. Is it really too much to ask of this Premier that she allow real and genuine debate, rather than refusing to share with all Ontarians her intentions for their future?", "Last week in the Legislature, I asked the Premier to provide clear answers on how she plans on paying for a high-speed rail project to London, but the government provided no clear and concrete details on how much they plan to spend and where the money will come from. Transportation specialists have sounded alarm bells on this project, yet this government continues to keep their heads in the sand whenever they are pressed for details of any kind. For a Premier who continues to claim to uphold the importance of transparency and accountability, every step they have taken proves otherwise. But know this: My NDP colleagues and I will continue to hold this government to account for each and every election promise made.", "In the last budget, you couldn’t keep three promises and now you have made more than 60 promises to the people of this province.

I will be sharing my time with the member from Niagara Falls.", "I am glad to have this opportunity to respond to this government’s budget and to focus on pensions.", "Ontarians deserve retirement security and decent pensions. The next generation is not going to be taken care of. Two thirds of Ontarians do not currently have a workplace pension. It is difficult to imagine our province where the majority of our aging population will not have the resources to pay their own way, to afford housing, to buy necessities, to contribute to the economy or to live with dignity. It is a pretty grim reality that we are facing.", "We stand in this Legislature and talk, and over the last few days we have heard talk about what is or isn’t being done to address youth unemployment in this province and it is worrying, because talk is cheap. Not only do we need to take action now, but we need to start planning for the future. How on earth can our youth, without employment, start to save for retirement when they can’t even pay their tuition bills today? Debt continues to balloon, jobs don’t just appear and future stability is not on the horizon. If their own government is not planning for the future and isn’t forward thinking, how can the youth of today be expected to look forward to the future? This brings us to the budget and brings us to the promise of public pensions in Ontario.", "The members on the government side of this room groan and heckle when we talk about broken Liberal promises. Far be it from me to beat a dead horse—or in this case, beat a dead Trojan Horse—but the question must be asked for the sake of two thirds of Ontarians without a workplace pension. For people living in a never-ending cycle of financial struggle, for people who deserve and want stability in their retirement, and for people who want to one day be able to retire, the question is this: Will we ever even see this Ontario Retirement Pension Plan?", "The NDP supports the idea of public pensions; that’s why we proposed them. The government will inevitably parrot for four years that, since we didn’t support the budget, we don’t support pensions. That’s nonsense. The NDP supports progressive, public programs.", "We don’t, however—and never will—support Harper-style pooled retirement pension plans, or PRPPs, that put banks ahead of people. It is concerning that the government is now apparently hawking bank products. Admittedly, I am a new MPP, but I was under the impression that we work for the people of Ontario and not for private financial institutions. PRPPs are not part of an Ontario Retirement Pension Plan, they are financial products. I see the same green comfy chairs around this Legislature that everyone else does, but I don’t get confused and see green TD Bank chairs. I see constituencies. This is the Ontario Legislature. People do not come here to withdraw funds, make deposits or purchase investments, but will they soon be able to buy PRPPs?", "In all of the budget and pension talk, the government is selling the idea of an Ontario Retirement Pension Plan to Ontarians. The comforting and progressive language we are all hearing from the government speaks to the need for stability and the ability to live with dignity into retirement. However, there has been quiet mention, almost as an aside, about giving Ontarians voluntary options. These voluntary add-ons—extra investment bank products—are not part of an Ontario Retirement Pension Plan. They are favours for banks and investment companies which, incidentally, will be thrilled when Ontarians start putting their money into bank coffers instead of pensions. I’m not saying these aren’t investments, but losing, on average, 20% to 30% due to fees over the life of the investment is not the kind of retirement security that Ontarians should be banking on when it comes to pensions.", "In the budget, the Liberal government has promised an Ontario Retirement Pension Plan in 2017, which is three years from now. I would like to wonder aloud, if I may: I wonder if the PRPPs will be such a success for the government’s financial partners and supporters that those institutions will push to keep them the only option. I wonder if the banks, which seem to have so much say in this plan, will say they don’t want the government to implement the public part of the plan. The Ontario Retirement Pension Plan is going to be immensely complex, of course. I wonder, though, three years from now—and only one year before an election—if the Liberal government might hesitate to implement such a complex plan at the end of their reign. And I wonder if it wouldn’t be a better idea to lead with the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan. Perhaps once Ontarians are looked after, banks can sell their own products because by then Ontarians might be in a position to afford voluntary options.", "I am pleased to serve Ontario as the NDP pension critic. I look forward to working to hold this Liberal government accountable when it comes to the future financial stability of workers and Ontarians across all of the constituencies represented by these comfy green chairs.", "So many layers of this budget are hidden between positive, progressive language and early-phase spending. So many of those later-phase layers, however, are going to be do real damage to our programs, our services and our families across this province. This budget is not unlike an onion. The more layers we peel back, the more reason to cry.", "Odds are that this budget will pass, and with it these two-tiered pension promises. If this government is truly committed to the idea of helping Ontarians plan for and afford their futures, if they truly believe in retirement security and stability, then they should lead with the public pensions and not with the Harper-style pooled retirement pension plans, which commit money and benefit to corporations and banks. As I’ve said before, banks and big business are doing just fine, and they are not planning to retire.", "I hope we will see this government re-evaluate and re-prioritize its pension plan and prioritize Ontarians over financial institutions. I honestly hope we will actually see this public Ontario Retirement Pension Plan and not just hear about it. I implore the government, please stop talking about bank products. Please don’t start selling bank products. Please design and implement a progressive public pension plan for hard-working people across Ontario who deserve one." ],

  "text" : [ "Speaker, I want to share my time with the member from Timiskaming–Cochrane.", "I want to start—and those that aren’t playing with their BlackBerry can follow this—on the budget. The Ontario government committed to spending $29 billion for public transit, highways, roads and bridges. What I’m concerned about in the budget is that it doesn’t talk about things that are important in my riding. It doesn’t talk about a year-round daily GO train to Niagara. Yet my good friend and colleague, from the Liberal Party, from St. Catharines, during the campaign, said, “I see it coming in 2015—St. Catharines to Niagara Falls.” The MPP from St. Catharines said in a June 4 debate, “Make no mistake about it: The Welland Canal is not a problem. We’ve heard that for a number of years, but it’s not. The canal can be accommodated and I’m committed to it and the government is committed to it in 2015.” The problem that I have, Speaker: It’s not in the budget.", "When I take a look at what we can do with the $29 billion—that’s B for billion—the Canadian content requirement for manufacturers who want to bid on public transit contracts in Ontario is just 25%. Quebec requires a 60% domestic content plus assembly. The US, who really is part of our competition, have a 60% domestic content plus final assembly, and in the US, although it currently requires 60% local content, the Obama administration has proposed raising that to 100%. Now, think about what we could do in Ontario, if we did the same thing, on putting people back to work when we have one of the highest unemployment rates in the country.", "Most trade agreements allow exemptions for government-financed infrastructural projects. There has to be an understanding, clearly, that if you’re going to use Ontario tax dollars to fund projects, which I believe is a good idea, Ontario workers, businesses and contractors should be used before workers from another country. The Ontario government should take a look at their budget and commit to raising the domestic content law to 60% plus final assembly. That’s what the Ontario government should do with this budget. We have to find a way to put people back to work right here in Ontario.", "Now I’d like to talk about the horse racing industry and the Slots at Racetracks Program. This budget, surprisingly to me, doesn’t do anything to help address this issue that has been hitting the horse racing industry for a number of years. The horse racing industry has been quite clear on what it needs to survive. The key word there is “survive.” It needs the Slots at Racetracks Program to be reinstated. Tracks like Fort Erie, which is expecting—think about this—somewhere between 10,000 and 12,000 people to watch the running of the 79th Prince of Wales race this Tuesday, rely on those slots. I invite my colleagues, Conservatives, Liberals, to come to Fort Erie; come on Tuesday. Come and see what Fort Erie has to offer. Come and see the opportunity that you could be part of and protecting, those 1,000 jobs. In Fort Erie, we don’t have stores closed; we have plazas closed. We need that racetrack to survive. I believe that if my colleagues would come and see what it has to offer, you would be standing up here like I am, saying, “Let’s find a way to keep it open and bring slots back.”", "The problem that we have in Fort Erie, in particular this year—and, again, it’s not covered in the budget—is they’ve been forced to run on 37 race days. You cannot run on 37 days and keep it running. We cannot continue to put 1,000 jobs, both direct and indirect, in jeopardy. The budget can do something about it. We need the slots, and we need the racing schedule somewhere between 74 and 80 racing dates. Bring the slots back, and we can really start going forward again.", "The other one I want to talk about is manufacturing. I’ve heard how we’ve lost 300,000 manufacturing jobs. But I want to be clear: Every country in the world is investing in manufacturing. When I hear about the budget, that you’re looking at selling the GM shares, I believe you lose some of that control with General Motors. It wasn’t just me up here standing and talking and saying, “This doesn’t make sense to me.” This afternoon I called the president of Unifor, Jerry Dias, who your party is familiar with. I said, “Is this a good idea?” He was very clear. Jerry said absolutely not do we want the government to sell those shares.", "I would encourage my colleagues on the other side to pick up the phone, talk to the president of Unifor and say, “Is this a good idea?” Are you actually threatening good-paying jobs—that actually are well paid; they have benefits, and they have pensions—by selling those shares? I ask you to please give him a call. I did this afternoon.", "Ontario has a lot to offer. In Ontario, we’ve got the type of highly skilled workforce these manufacturers are demanding. Just in General Motors in St. Catharines, when you talk about manufacturing, they’ve hired 150 new employees over the last few months. For the first time in 25 years, they are hiring students; they are hiring our children and our grandchildren. So why wouldn’t we want to continue to fight for manufacturing jobs?", "We have a manufacturer that’s called SpencerARL, which I talked about in my by-election and I talked about in the general election. They’ve gone from 11 employees up to 300. Why did they come to Niagara? They came to Niagara because of the highly skilled workforce, because of the skilled trades that are in the Niagara region. Don’t give up on manufacturing. We can do better. We can lead again in the province of Ontario when it comes to manufacturing.", "On the LCBO, the words “downsize” and “consolidate”—it doesn’t make sense to me, the budget plan to sell a wide range of public assets, including potentially—and I say “potentially,” in fairness—the LCBO and the OPG. According to the LCBO’s own website, the LCBO delivered $1.7 billion last year to the Ontario government. In 2010-11, it was $1.5 billion. In 2011-12, it was $1.63 billion. In 2012-13, it was $1.7 billion. What do you see in those three years? The profits are growing. They’re growing, and we want to sell it off.", "The thing that you have to remember with the LCBO: That $1.6 billion or $1.7 billion is every year. Where does it go? What does it finance? This money goes to health care. This money goes to education. This money goes to infrastructure for the province. How can this be seen as anything but a fire sale of valuable public assets?", "The LCBO employees—it’s something that you should be interested in, and all of us should be in interested in. They’re good-paying jobs and they’re represented by OPSEU. Job losses from privatizing and contracting out mean one thing. Those workers who are out there working hard every day making a profit for the LCBO and, at the end of the day, for the province of Ontario, could lose their jobs. They could be forced into lower wages, less benefits. It makes no sense. And this budget doesn’t contain labour law reform measures.", "The OLRA, the ESA etc.: There was no mention—and this is important—of any such changes about replacement workers in the province of Ontario in your budget. There is nothing about severance pay. When a company decides to get up and leave, and leave the workers without severance pay, there’s nothing that protects that. They just leave, leave the workers behind and don’t pay the workers. That’s not in this budget. That makes no sense to me.", "Let me talk about health care in my area. There is no mention of the new Niagara Falls hospital, which the province has awarded and committed to a $26.2-million planning grant—which is good, because you’ve got to have some planning around a new hospital. But here’s the problem that you’ve got with the hospital in Niagara Falls: The one in St. Catharines was a P3, a private-public partnership, and it was built at a cost of $900 million, yet the same type of hospital, with the same number of beds and the same type of service, was built in Peterborough for about $350 million, but it was publicly funded and publicly delivered. Now, wouldn’t that make sense, if we have a deficit problem in the province of Ontario, to take a look at that model? I’m hoping that, during the transition period, we have the opportunity to say, “Let’s take a look at that.”", "I listened today—very interesting—about parking fees in our hospitals, where there has been some conversation around reducing the cost. I raised this issue, by the way, in my by-election; I saw that you put it into your platform. But here’s the problem that we have right now in the province of Ontario—and I have raised it with the health minister: What’s happening in the P3s, which are run by a private company, is that they are taking some of the revenue away from parking. That is why you’re seeing the prices go up. They’re making money—the private company—on parking fees. It’s not going into front-line health care workers or equipment like it used to be. I’ve asked the health minister to look into that, because that’s important.", "The last one I want to talk about is schools, particularly in my area. I’ve got a school that has been scheduled to close. I took a very hard look at the budget, and I thought I was fair with the budget, but when I took a look at the budget, there was a line in there of $750 million to consolidate schools or to close schools. But there isn’t another line in there where you say, “We’re going to give $50 million or $60 million to keep schools open,” so that they can continue to be the hub of their community, where you can have not-for-profits come into the school. It has worked in the past; it can work again.", "It says in the budget that you’re committed to small community schools, and I really believe that that’s the way to keep small schools open. Not-for-profits want to come to the schools. They want to partner with the school boards. They want to partner with the parents. It becomes the hub of the community, particularly in small communities. I wish that was in the budget. There’s nothing in that. I would really like you to take a look at that.", "I appreciate the time. Thank you very much." ],

We’ve got people in the country, but also we’ve got people in towns, whose only way to heat their house is electricity. I knocked on their doors and they showed me electricity bills over the last six or seven years. I’ve got seniors who are being forced out of their houses. They own their houses—they don’t have mortgage payments; they’ve worked hard their whole lives. They’re on fixed incomes. They’re being forced out of their homes, but in my riding there’s nowhere to go. That’s not addressed here.", "I’m not here just criticizing the government. That is a huge, huge problem. What am I supposed to say to those people? That’s why I’m going to vote against this budget.", "My dad always taught me that if you take care of the little things, the big things will fall into place. This budget is talking about the $29-billion plans over 10 years and the $2.5-billion job fund over 10 years, but it’s not talking about what it’s going to do for the people in Latchford with their electrical rates tomorrow.", "I’m going to take a few issues from the budget. One other thing that my dad taught me—I didn’t spend a lot of time on books for my education, but I paid very dearly for it. One thing he taught me is to look at what people do, not what they say, because it’s easy to say things and not so easy to do them. One issue I’d like to take is the Ring of Fire, because in northern Ontario it’s very important to us. It’s important to the province, but it’s very important to northern Ontario. A lot of people like to say, “I’ve been to the Ring of Fire four times.” I’ve been there once. I’ve heard today that the Ring of Fire is in the middle of nowhere. I take offence to that, because I live in northern Ontario and lots of people think I live in the middle of nowhere. There is no place in Ontario that is in the middle of nowhere, but the Ring of Fire is extremely hard to access.", "I’ll tell you a little story about my trip to the Ring of Fire. I was at Noront’s base camp; I was in there in February. They had little wooden sidewalks going to each of the tents—to the mess tent and to the drilling. I asked, “What’s the deal with the little sidewalks?” He says, “Well, this is February. You should come in June.” There’s no base at the Ring of Fire. It’s not like the rest of northern Ontario. It’s not like in Sudbury, where you can just build a railroad and build a road, because it’s rock. It’s not rock there; it’s muskeg. It’s going to take an inordinate amount of money and planning to get there. But we have to get there.", "One thing that really bothers me about what the government continues to say about the Ring of Fire is that during the campaign, they committed $1 billion no matter what—and you know, it might take that. Without the government leading the way, we’re never going to get there. Yet in the budget, that $1 billion is attached if the feds come in. You know what? There’s a good chance we’re never going to get there if we keep saying, “We’ll do it if you do it.” Once again, that’s one of the reasons why I don’t think we can trust this budget.", "Another one: We’ve heard a lot about selling off assets. The government is looking at selling off assets. On page 164, they’re going to tell you how they’re going to do it. “To identify opportunities to optimize the full value and performance of these core assets, the government will launch an in-depth review process.” That sounds wonderful, but the last time they tried to sell off assets—and we can disagree about the numbers, but with the ONTC divestment, and you can go to the Auditor General’s report, they announced that they were going to save $265 million, and they hadn’t even cracked the books. They didn’t know.", "The last time you tried to sell off assets, you didn’t even know what you were talking about. But this time, it’s going to be “an in-depth review process.” How are we supposed to know?" ],

In fact, what’s so astonishing is, Don Drummond who is the economist that you hand-picked—you hand-picked Don Drummond; you asked him to give us a report on what we need to do to get our finances in place. The person that you hand-picked openly said on TVO’s The Agenda with Steve Paikin—and I encourage you all to watch it. These are all archived. You can access it from the Internet. Don Drummond, your own hand-picked economist, said, “The Liberal plan, by 2017, I wouldn’t be at all surprised if that involved the public sector about 100,000 lower.” Wow. Your own economist says pretty much that you’re going to cut 100,000 jobs by 2017—not my words, the words of your hand-picked economist.", "Somehow magically, though—and I’m really impressed again by your messaging. When the Conservatives said it—and I think it was absolutely wrong. I think it’s wrong to cut jobs—particularly our public sector. I think it’s a very bad thing to do, given our precarious financial situation. But you’ve got to give a hand to the Conservatives. They went out and said it straight up, “We’re going to cut 100,000 jobs,” and the people of Ontario said, “That’s not what we want. We don’t like that,” and they voted against them. Somehow you didn’t say it, and your economist certainly says that it’s going to happen by 2017, but somehow by not saying it, by saying that you have a progressive budget, you’ve hidden the truth and the reality that’s there we’ll see in a couple of years.", "The reality is that your budget, which has been touted as a progressive budget, really is not; it’s an austerity budget, and I’m not saying it alone. This is your own hand-picked economist. Not only did your hand-picked economist say it, but Bloomberg News says that literally this budget and this Liberal government are going to involve the biggest cuts since Harris. You’ve got to think about that for a second. How can the most progressive budget be affiliated with the biggest cuts since Harris? How do those two—I don’t know.

We are here to debate this issue at length this evening because the answer I received from both the Ministers of Aboriginal Affairs and Children and Youth Services were unsatisfactory.", "Before I talk about the unsatisfactory response to this very important issue, I want to first take a moment to bring people up to speed on the issue itself. Over the past 10-plus years, seven students have died while far away from home attending high school in Thunder Bay. These youths left from their six separate communities, northern reserves, to access education and earn their high school diploma. Far from home and far from their friends and families, these young people suffered tragic deaths that have now been termed “mysterious circumstances.” The families and communities of these children have been waiting for years with unanswered questions as to what happened to their child and why. Investigating and finding the cause is important for two main reasons: to provide closure to these families and also to prevent future deaths.", "In September 2011, NAN, Nishnawbe Aski Nation, and Aboriginal Legal Services of Toronto called on the Ontario government to convene a commission of inquiry into these seven deaths. In response, the chief coroner made the decision to direct a joint inquest. At that time, assurances were made that the review and inquest would happen in an expeditious manner. But three years later, it appears that no progress has been made. Just last week, the chief coroner announced that the inquest that was scheduled to commence this fall in Thunder Bay was not going to go forward due to the under-representation of First Nations people on jury rolls, a long-standing issue examined by the Honourable Frank Iacobucci in his February 2013 independent review.", "There are essentially two main issues that I raised in my question, the first being getting answers for the families, communities and all northerners who have been waiting, whether this takes the form of a coroner’s inquest or a public inquiry. Yesterday, in response to my question, the Minister of Aboriginal Affairs said the coroner “has adjourned the inquest so that he can make arrangements to perhaps work with some of the recommendations in the Iacobucci report.” But when speaking with the coroner’s office, we learned specifically that the inquest is to be announced and that the coroner’s inquest has not yet started. The only action the coroner has taken toward this inquest was a pre-inquest hearing to establish standing, not the start of an inquest. In other words, an inquest that hasn’t convened cannot be adjourned.

This begs the question of why and how it is acceptable for the Attorney General to continue to convene criminal cases in the north using the same jury roll when the coroner cannot. How is justice served in these criminal matters, but not in other investigative matters?", "The answer is, justice is not being served, and this government knows it. It has been aware of this issue for years, and it is beyond time for it to start taking steps to improve access to justice for First Nations people across this province.", "The fact is that the inquest hasn’t even started and it’s being referred to as a gross breach of trust in failing to deliver on this important promise.

It is important that they reflect all elements of society, including First Nations. That’s why our government commissioned Mr. Justice Iacobucci to do a review in 2011. His review undertook an examination of the existing process in the selection of jury rolls, held consultations with First Nations stakeholders, and evaluated best practices from Ontario and other jurisdictions. As recommended in the Iacobucci report, the only approach that will produce enduring results is a collaborative process between government and our First Nation partners.", "Consistent with that advice, in February 2013, the Attorney General and I were pleased to announce the creation of an implementation committee and an advisory committee in response to Iacobucci’s two threshold recommendations.", "The 11-member juries review implementation committee is composed of a substantial First Nations membership.

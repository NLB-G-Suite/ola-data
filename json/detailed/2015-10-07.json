In Newmarket, they’re looking at going even higher. It’s a somewhat new built form in our community and it’s one that, coming from a municipal background, we’ve had to adjust to.", "As a municipal councillor, I was always one of the first who new condo owners would call when they had issues with their developer or with their condo board or whatever. The tools that we had to help them with their issues oftentimes were limited, Mr. Speaker. I’m delighted to see that this bill will be addressing some very important facts like licensing condo managers, improving governance and oversight of condo boards, and providing a relatively inexpensive way for owners and boards to resolve some of the disputes they have without going a more expensive way, that of going to court.", "I look forward to seeing this bill move into committee and listening to what the parties opposite can bring forward in ways of improving it. I thank everyone for their support." ],

While we look forward, as you just said, to having this bill come to committee, one of the things we’ll talk about, in terms of this condo act, are the differences in the requirements of heavily populated urban centres versus the north.", "We do have condominiums in the north. Some are small, and some just won’t be able to quite match up with the new rules and regulations that are contemplated in this, such as the designing of a website to have access. There are a lot of places in northern Ontario, quite frankly, where we don’t even have dial-up website and access. It’s just the reality. When I drive in my riding from North Bay to Mattawa, there’s a good chunk of the area where we don’t have service. It’s just the reality of living in two-thirds the size of the population.", "So there are certain respects, I’ve said quite frequently in this Legislature, where it cannot be cookie-cutter, one-size-fits-all. As long as the acknowledgment is there that we really do need a separate set of guidelines that pertain to northern Ontario—you can’t always have a Toronto-centric solution to a Toronto problem, because it does spill over and ties in the rest of the province with these issues.", "So with respect to the condo owners in my community of North Bay and some of the smaller communities—I have 10 mayors that I serve in my area, 10 different municipalities. Some are as small as 200 or 300 people; they have a mayor.

I have to say it was very good.", "The member talked about how there are not a lot of condo complexes in northern Ontario; people purchase single-family homes. I compared that to maybe what’s happening in Toronto and what’s happening in London, because we do have a lot of condo buildings: We have high-rises, and we have townhomes. As people are aging, they look for alternative dwellings. A lot of seniors may not be able to cut the lawn and shovel the driveway or do those repairs outside that maybe they could do when they were younger. Having a condo option really alleviates some of that.", "I’d be interested to see, as the years progress, if the northern areas of Ontario accommodate some of those needs for seniors. Seniors usually want to stay in the neighbourhood or the area they raised their kids in; they don’t want to move far away from family, and I understand that northern ridings are huge and vast. So, talking about regional differences, this bill should acknowledge that there are regional differences in Ontario, and when bills are developed, we should keep in mind that other parts of Ontario have needs as well." ],

  "text" : [ "I was here in 1998 when the first condo act was brought forward. I know that at that time, a lot of work went into it. It was over two years of work that was brought in by the previous government. I’m quite aware of how complex and important this legislation is. At that time, we tried to do the best we could to protect Ontarians who invest in these homes. The number of deputations we had, the experts, the citizens who came forward trying to improve the legislation—it was quite commendable.", "That’s why, going forward now, I think we all have to appreciate how incredibly complex the condo act is. It really takes incredibly convoluted legal matters, real estate issues, property standards issues, municipal issues—and it affects so many people. That is why it’s so critical that we take time to do this right.", "It is very important to look at the long range here. This act will have to undergo all kinds tests, because it is going to be very, very difficult to solve all of these problems. As the member from Newmarket–Aurora was telling me, his elderly aunt, who bought a condo years ago on the shore of the Humber River, has a great penthouse condo, but now that condo is under mortgage watch. The reason for that, like a number of condos that may be under mortgage watch, is because of the fact that a lot of people who buy condos really abhor the condo fees.", "They get assessed certain fees if the parking garage deteriorates, the swimming pool has to be fixed, the roof leaks. What happens is that it’s a natural tendency for people to say, “Well, I don’t want to pay more this month and have this increased assessment.” So they kept on putting off these repairs. Subsequently, you get in a situation where now there are major, major repairs, to the point that some condos cannot be sold because people can’t get a mortgage for them. So it is very serious.", "I had a condo on Dufferin Street in my area just last year. It was one of the first condos in Ontario. The people living there have been living there since the 1970s, when it was built. Because they’re elderly and they’re living on fixed incomes, they’ve tended to put off maintenance. So this year they got hit with a huge maintenance fee: upkeep, the garage, the front entranceway, the roof. So a lot of them came to me, saying, “We can’t afford to pay this huge new assessment. Would you talk with the property manager?”", "In fact, the property manager happens to be an old football player of mine, Tony Seljak, who happens to be in the property management business. He said, “Listen, I’ll do what I can. We’ll work out a payment system. But the roof and the garage have got to be fixed.” That’s the reality of what happens, and that’s just one small part of this act.", "There are so many parts that affect—as I said, the city of Toronto, for instance, or the city of Mississauga or the city of Brampton all come into play with this. Right now there is a major lawsuit against the city of Toronto over the Condominium Act, and that is the result of the fact that people living in condominiums pay very high taxes. They say, “Why should we be paying more taxes than, or as many taxes as, people living in a detached home and then we don’t get snow clearance, we don’t get these potholes filled in our parking lot? Therefore, the city should also come and clear our snow on private property because we’re paying taxes for that equal to the other people.” It’s a very interesting case. It’s before the courts right now. It will be interesting what the decision is, because it could affect people and municipalities right across this province in terms of the relationship with condominiums. So there’s another example of the complexity of all of these.", "The bill itself tries to deal with 2,200 recommendations. She’s not here right now, but the Minister of Children and Youth Services and women’s issues spent a couple of years trying to listen to people and work with various groups, trying to come up with this act. As I said, it has been going on for years, trying to get the fundamentals of this act together. She should be given an award for patience and for the good work that she did. She is never mentioned, but she did a lot of work, as she does in a lot areas. So there are a lot of people who have shown an interest in this.", "It is critical that we understand that there is no silver bullet in fixing this form of home ownership. It is extremely, as I said, legalistic. Most lawyers who deal with real estate have no idea about the condo act." ],

One of the most important aspects of Bill 85—I’m sure this is shared in common for members of all sides—are the changes we’re going to make to the family responsibility act.", "Mr. Speaker, you and I both know that many of us at our offices have individuals who come in on a very frequent basis to talk about the challenges that they have under the family responsibility act, or with the Family Responsibility Office, particularly when it comes to support payments for individuals. It’s always a very sad situation when you have a matrimonial breakup. It’s very difficult on all parties involved, particularly for children. So there are significant provisions in this act today, Bill 85, that will allow us to handle the FRO payments in a much more efficient way. It will allow for much better tracking of the FRO process. It will also make sure that when Family Court judges make decisions in terms of support for children, those decisions are indeed enacted to provide that vital support that is needed by families when they find themselves in very difficult positions.", "Mr. Speaker, there are also amendments to the City of Toronto Act, 2006. These amendments were asked for particularly by the Toronto Transit Commission to allow them to expand service to York region and neighbouring municipalities by adjusting provisions of the act.", "This is a very important amendment today to allow us to facilitate the Big Move forward, which is a very ambitious plan in the greater Toronto-Hamilton area to provide that transit in a wide variety of means, whether it’s subways, whether it’s buses or whether it’s light rail, to make sure that various areas are solved. These amendments here today will allow us to facilitate the important planning that needs to be done by Metrolinx into areas outside of the city of Toronto border. So this is a very important piece of legislation.", "Mr. Speaker, something that you’ll also be very interested in, as a former city councillor in Hamilton: It’s about to improve the administration of the Provincial Offences Act. You well know, as a former municipal leader in Hamilton, part of the Who Does What exercise at the end of the 1990s—I know we, in Peterborough, gave that a new name; it was the “who got done in” committee. I know my municipal leaders from every part of Ontario certainly reflected on that new name that we gave to that exercise, the “who got done in” committee. There was universal support of how we renamed the famous Who Does What committee of the late 1990s.", "To give credit where credit is due—and I’m a very fair individual—under the Provincial Offences Act, part of that exercise was to make sure that municipalities were given the revenue that would be generated under the Provincial Offences Act, namely, quite commonly, our parking tickets. I know I’ve received my share of parking tickets in the city of Peterborough and went to the POA office in Peterborough to pay the appropriate fine. One of the provisions of Bill 85 is to allow more technology to be used in processing these tickets. Ultimately, that will allow us and municipalities to get that revenue that was part of that agreement that was negotiated between the then government in power, AMO and the municipalities right across the province of Ontario.", "This act also has a number of other provisions that I think are very important. I know many of us who had the privilege of serving in municipal government, particularly with EMS services—these operators that have non-emergency stretcher transportation, some of those vehicles that were used for this particular activity were not in very good shape. So we’re bringing in new requirements to make sure that they have the same standards that EMS vehicles have right across the province of Ontario.", "With that, I will cede the floor to my other colleagues." ],

In other words, this would make sure that children get what they need, what they’re entitled to, in terms of child support." ],

This aims to improve the safety and reliability of private sector non-emergency stretcher transportation services in Ontario. I know that many of my colleagues have spoken about this initiative that is part of the bill. In other words, these amendments will make sure that vehicles would need to meet specific requirements, contain prescribed equipment, and meet inspection and maintenance standards. Drivers and attendants would also be required to meet these minimum standards. This is really important because it would regulate the sector that, right now, is not safe enough and needs more oversight.", "Another initiative contained in this bill are the amendments to the City of Toronto Act. This will help make it easier for the Toronto Transit Commission to expand service to York region and other neighbouring municipalities by adjusting provisions in the act. This will allow for greater transit collaboration between transit agencies across the greater Toronto and Hamilton area.", "Why is that important? Because I think that few people today have the fortune of working close to their home. In the riding that I have the privilege to represent, York South–Weston, for example, through the years industry has been disappearing. This has been happening in all the major urban centres, so people’s jobs are farther away. I have residents who work in the city of Vaughan. They work in Richmond Hill. They work in Mississauga. They work in Brampton.", "Industries that at one time were a vital part of the riding—I can name Kodak; I can name CCM, which used to manufacture bicycles; the Moffat stove factory—they are all gone. Some have stayed, such as Irving Tissue, which is still one of the main employers in my area, but the majority of them have moved away.", "So people need to go to where the jobs are, and therefore need better transit. That’s why our government is investing in transit, but that’s why we also need to make it easier for municipalities.", "Because of the number of amendments that are included in this bill and because it does aim at modernizing what we do here in government, I will be supporting this bill, and I hope that everyone else will; I think I’ve heard consensus amongst all our colleagues. We want to get this bill passed, so that we can help individuals, families and businesses in our province." ],

In particular, the one that I hear constantly in my constituency office is about the Family Responsibility Office and the difficulty with young families, whether it be a single mother or a single father, trying to get the money that has been set aside every month for their children’s upbringing. I think that this bill hopefully will help get that done much more quickly. I think that is the good thing to do. Children should not suffer because mom and dad are having difficulty dealing with each other. They shouldn’t be hurt in this whole situation. It’s bad enough that they are now in a broken family.", "The Strengthening and Improving Government Act includes a number of small but important measures that will improve the efficiency and the responsiveness of government. We are looking at many aspects of government, trying to modernize processes and make systems easier to manage. To meet the needs of Ontarians, these public services require a solid foundation. We are taking action through this act to strengthen and update existing legislation.", "There are amendments to the Highway Traffic Act, particularly about stretcher transportation services. The government is taking action to improve the safety and reliability of private sector non-emergency stretcher transportation services in Ontario.", "As I said, proposed changes to the Family Law Act will help ensure that the new administrative child support service is as effective as possible in assisting children to receive appropriate levels of financial support from their parents. Quite frankly, as parents, we should be looking after our children.", "Amendments to the Courts of Justice Act: These proposed changes will help to effectively implement new federal family legislation in Ontario.", "Amendments to the City of Toronto Act: The proposed change will help make it easier for the Toronto Transit Commission to expand service to York region. I know my colleague from Newmarket–Aurora is happy for that, and other neighbouring municipalities will benefit from adjusting provisions in this act. This will allow for greater transit collaboration between transit agencies across the greater Toronto and Hamilton area. I know, Speaker, you’ll like that.", "Why are we making these changes now? We’re always looking at the many aspects of government, trying to modernize processes and make systems easier to navigate. While some of these proposed amendments were part of the previous strengthening-and-improving-government bill, we also found new ways to make improvements through our ongoing review processes.", "Our goal is to meet the needs of Ontarians, and public services require a solid foundation. We’re taking action through this act to strengthen and update, as I said, existing legislation. This is not new legislation; it’s improving previous legislation. I really think that all of the aspects of this bill, including the amendment about making provincial offences documents electronic—these amendments do not have cost implications. They clear the way legally for Provincial Offences Act courts to manage cases more efficiently. We all want that to happen; we know how those things can get dragged down. Municipalities run most of the Provincial Offences Act courts and so would bear any costs of additional modernization they choose to implement.", "It will be necessary to make minor amendments to regulations to align this section of the Provincial Offences Act numbering, ensuring consistent language and making other minor housekeeping amendments in consultation with the municipal stakeholders. The six-month time period will allow these steps to occur.", "I urge you to support this bill." ],

This is an important piece that I wanted to highlight. I’m sure that Nathalie, who is in my office, will be happy that, if passed, this bill will help those children and those families in Ottawa–Orléans, in my neck of the woods, but I’m sure in some other ridings of my colleagues here in the House.", "Another component—I’m not sure if people have talked about it, but I just want to highlight it. As a former business owner, something we take very seriously is the Occupational Health and Safety Act. Seriously, the worst thing for an employer is when their workers get injured. Certainly, Mr. Speaker, this is something that the government is taking very seriously. This particular bill will actually help improve workers’ health and safety. Employers and workers will have access to a broader range of information about hazardous workplace chemicals. Everything that is currently in place will not change, but I want to highlight, and I only have a few seconds, that what will be most important is that there will be a portion where the employer will be required to identify chemicals and that the safety data sheet shows the chemicals in the workplace. But now the education component will have to be part of the employer’s work.", "Mr. Speaker, I need to end, and I wish I had a little bit more time, but certainly this is an important piece of legislation, and I hope that all members will agree with me." ],

They know it, so they’re trying to cloud the air and muddy the waters with bills that they’d like to call the good governance bill.", "The tradition in this House is that you have the opportunity to speak to a bill, and we’re told, “You can speak to what’s in the bill.” But the nice thing about the other side of the convention here is that you can speak to what the bill doesn’t talk about and maybe it should in order to justify the title “improving government.”", "Let me start with hydro rates in this province. They are killing this economy because of hydro rates. I’m sitting in estimates this week—my partner from Prince Edward–Hastings as well as I—and we’ve been asking questions of the Minister of Energy. My God, the answers—we don’t get answers; we get a diatribe about how wonderful it is under the Liberals, but never a direct answer to the question, questions that I ask like, “What are you supposed to say to Mr. And Mrs. John Doe who can’t afford to heat their homes because they’ve got electric heat?” They’re in their late seventies, maybe their early eighties. They built a home in the 1970s when the world was telling them to heat with hydro, and they can’t afford the hydro bills anymore. On top of that, they installed air conditioning because their physician has said both of them have respiratory issues—and we want to keep them at home. “We want to keep them at home”—this is what the government says. They want to keep everybody at home as long as they can, which is the best place for them. They want to keep them at home, so the doctor has told them, “You must have air conditioning in the summertime. You will not be able to live in that home under the heat and humidity of Ontario.”" ],

I understand that there are expenses associated with that that range from as low as 0% overhead—for example, our ER docs or those that practise in hospitals—to a higher amount that may be 30% or so in terms of those overhead costs.

Each year for the past 11 years, runners have set off from the police memorial at Queen’s Park to embark on the 460-kilometre, three-day relay run to Parliament Hill in Ottawa.", "This relay run was created to raise awareness of the annual Canadian Police and Peace Officers’ Memorial Service in honour of fallen peace officers, held in Ottawa on the last Sunday of September. The run also helps raise funds to help support surviving spouses and children of those fallen officers.", "I was proud to join our Premier, the leaders of the opposition, Canadian icon Don Cherry and almost 300 runners to help kick off this year’s run. Runners included representatives of police services from across Ontario; members of the Canadian Military Police; the Ontario Provincial Police; the RCMP; the Canadian Border Services Agency; Ontario correctional services; and Survivors of Law Enforcement, also known as SOLE, who are the spouses and loved ones of fallen officers. SOLE was an inspiration to the runners throughout the run, and their spirit and strength helped make every mile seem shorter.", "I was honoured to run alongside almost 300 runners, Ontario’s finest police and peace officers. I was part of an 11-member Ottawa police team. I would like to thank them for their participation, their camaraderie and for welcoming me within their ranks over the three days. It was truly an honour to run with them.", "I want to give a special thanks to the members of the Ottawa police team: Acting Staff Sergeant Alison Cookson, Constable Cindy Cybulski, Clint Eastop, Constable Danielle Gammon, Constable Lisa Grison, Constable Lisa King, Constable Peter Koch, Constable Amanda Larche, Sergeant Debbie Palmer, Constable Cathy Wood and Renee Viel.", "I also want to acknowledge the team members from Ontario correctional services for participating in the run. I want to thank Paul Chmurzynski, Scott Willey, Dana Falconi, Derek Huisman, Stephen Laidlaw, Joe D’Andrea, Tijana Lakovic, Aleasha Shorts, Carol Povse, Raj Toor, Kimberley Ridgers, Scott Jones, Larry Shorts, Andrew Boden, Derek Morgan, Martin O’Grady, Zdenka Mijatovic, Suzanne Gadoury, Matthew Berti, Rose Beauchamp, Sherry Loiselle, Lisa O’Brien, Jesse Barrette, Kellie Walker and Kristy Baynton. Not to mention, Speaker, huge gratitude to the 25 OPP officers from detachments across the province, along with uniformed and civilian members of police services from all corners of Ontario.", "Speaker, this run was started in 2005 by a Peel Regional Police running team called the Pacers. Twenty-four runners took part in the inaugural run. This run reminds us of the important job that police, correctional services personnel, and all peace officers do every day to help keep our communities safe. It acknowledges the sacrifices they make on our behalf. It is our assurance to their surviving family members, their former colleagues and to all peace officers that we will never forget their service as they undertake this dangerous yet noble task.", "The run has generated more than $215,000 in contributions to the Ontario and Canadian police memorials to date.", "Over the course of the run, I was honoured to have the opportunity to speak at the Chris Garrett Park in Cobourg, where a memorial pays tribute to one of Cobourg’s finest, killed in the line of duty. We also had the opportunity to stop in Brockville to pay respect to RCMP Constable Douglas Scott, whose funeral I attended in late 2007. It was a great pleasure also to see the member from Leeds–Grenville, and the former member from Leeds–Grenville, now Senator Runciman, also attend the ceremony.", "The run took us across some of the most beautiful and picturesque vistas in Ontario and, indeed, anywhere in Canada. Imagine leaving Brockville early in the morning, running along the St. Lawrence River. As we get close to the nine-kilometre mark, the only thing you hear, besides the footsteps of runners running along the road, is a bagpipe in the distance—yes, Speaker, a bagpipe in the distance early in the morning as you’re running. As you get close to the nine-kilometre mark, you see Mr. Stewart Nimmo who, year after year, has been playing the bagpipes to welcome the runners and pay homage to those who are fallen. A big gratitude to Mr. Nimmo for participating in the run in a very special way every year.", "Hundreds of Ontarians come to wish us well along the route and to show their shared commitment to honour the memory of our fallen peace officers. A special thanks to many of the ministry’s staff and their friends who joined the runners for part of the route to show their support.", "None of this would be possible without the hard work and dedication of the organizers. From Peel Regional Police comes the core organizing team made up of Staff Superintendent Randy Patrick, who is the founder of the run and chair of the committee; Inspector Brian Smithson; Inspector Magdi Younan; Sergeant Matt Small; and detective Rob Hackenbrook. All these individuals are instrumental, not only in organizing the run but throughout the run, in making sure that everything runs smoothly and we pay due respect to our fallen police and peace officers.", "In addition, teams of organizers in Toronto and Ottawa worked on the logistics of the kickoff and closing ceremonies. In Toronto, a special thanks to Detective Jon Ling and Sergeant Darren Laing. In Ottawa, huge gratitude to Staff Sergeant Gina Rosa and Acting Staff Sergeant Alison Cookson.", "I also want to salute Erin Ochakovsky, the president of Survivors of Law Enforcement, also known as SOLE, herself the widow of a fallen police officer, and all the members of the organization of SOLE, including all the surviving family members of fallen police officers, for their tireless efforts in keeping alive the memory of the fallen. They were truly an inspiration throughout the Run to Remember.", "I wish to express my sincere thanks to all those police and peace officers from Ontario who participated in the Canadian Police and Peace Officers’ Memorial Service also that Sunday.", "I got the opportunity to run 89 kilometres over the three days, and I must say that every step I took was worth it. It was a reminder of the risks our police officers and peace officers take to keep us safe, and we will forever honour the memory of our fallen peace officers." ],

I have had the chance to address this venue before, when I was in the federal House, on behalf of the federal government, and participated in the run myself in past years.", "I wanted to recognize the incredible work, as the member for Ottawa Centre did, of Randy Patrick, who is the founder and the driving force behind this incredible success over the last 11 years. Randy is a Peel Regional Police staff superintendent and has certainly made this his passion. The memorial run is a wonderful way to raise awareness and focus attention on the annual police and peace officers’ memorial service. It serves the community extremely well to recognize these fallen heroes.", "In 1998, a federal proclamation declared that the last Sunday in September each year be Police and Peace Officers’ National Memorial Day, and holding this run preceding that observance has only built more recognition for this important date. I applaud all the participants who have participated in all the legs of the run.", "I’d also like to take a moment to acknowledge some of the fallen heroes who I had the opportunity to encounter during my service in Simcoe county. I’d like to acknowledge our fallen heroes 41-year-old South Simcoe Police Constable Alan Kuzmich; 43-year-old father of three Detective Constable Rob Plunkett from Midhurst; and Peel Regional Police Constable James Ochakovsky, 36, who lived in Barrie. His wife, Erin, as the member for Ottawa Centre mentioned, has made it a personal mission to continue to support the families of these fallen heroes.", "I was very proud to run last year with Gloria Kovach. Gloria was a long-time city councillor in Guelph and lost her own daughter. I’ve certainly heard from Gloria about the incredible sacrifice and the never-ending impact that this tragedy has on the family, the community and the neighbourhood.", "I want to especially recognize the fact that over $215,000 has been raised over 11 years for the National Peace Officers’ Memorial Run.", "The reason I wanted to speak to this item myself today is because, as you know, on my first day in this Legislature as the new MPP for Simcoe North, I mentioned that we need to do more to honour our fallen heroes. It’s one thing to have this run, but I think we can do more as parliamentarians from every side in recognizing these fallen heroes. With the Canadian Forces, we have compensation for the families, a small benefit to help them after this tragedy. I think it’s only appropriate that we do that in Canada. I said on my first day in the Legislature as the MPP for Simcoe North, and I repeat it today, that I think it’s entirely appropriate for us to have an Ontario heroes’ fund to recognize these fallen heroes.", "Today, I want to say that the run is wonderful and an important recognition, a deserved recognition. I would hope we can all work together to move the yardstick forward and actually have something similar to what the Canadian Forces have. And I wanted to say, on behalf of the Ontario Progressive Conservative caucus: Let us never forget our fallen heroes and the incredible and immeasurable sacrifice they have made for our safety and for our security in our communities." ],

Many are unable to attend the memorial service in Ottawa, and the run gives peace officers and citizens along the route the chance to participate and reflect on the sacrifices of the officers whose names are etched on the memorial wall in Ottawa.

Now, every year on the last Sunday in September, a memorial service is held on Parliament Hill honouring both fallen peace and police officers.", "The Run to Remember started in 2005 and has grown ever since. The run starts at the Ontario Police Memorial in Toronto and ends at the national monument in Ottawa. The core group of runners who participate in the full three-day relay—including some people in this room—has grown to over 250 and includes supporters and surviving families of fallen officers. Many others join the run for part of the journey, sharing in the journey of remembrance.", "This is engraved on one of the three stones at the memorial in Ottawa: “The Canadian Police and Peace Officers’ memorial honour roll pays tribute to the sacrifice of these brave men and women killed in the performance of their duties.”", "We have a police monument in Ontario. We don’t have a monument, however, to our fallen correctional officers or peace officers. It was my privilege to speak at our corrections memorial service last fall, but we are missing a place, a monument, a permanent tribute to those who have given the ultimate sacrifice: those killed in the performance of their duties. I know the government recognizes this and I hope that they will help to speed the bureaucratic process along.", "We must recognize and remember those who have been killed in the line of duty, but we have to start talking about those who are no longer able to perform their duties but are still with us. We have to recognize the very real sacrifice being made every day by officers when it comes to their own mental health and wellness. We have officers damaged, struggling and tormented by the trauma and threat faced in their work environments. We have peace and police officers, first responders, constant responders—those who answer the call—who can be forever changed, and some forever damaged, during the performance of their duties. We must recognize their sacrifice and honour it with a strategy to help them through. We in this Legislature must acknowledge that post-traumatic stress disorder is a devastating reality for many and must be supported and treated.", "We have passed Bill 2 through second reading, and now it is stuck in the government channels. My colleague from Parkdale–High Park has started this conversation, but what say you, government? Will we commit to our first responders, our police officers, peace officers, correctional officers, firefighters, paramedics, 911 operators, Ministry of Labour investigators and more? So many more need to be part of the conversation and final strategy and solution. Will we put our money where our mouth is and take action? People who keep us safe are struggling, suffering and dying by suicide. Will we remember them? Will we defend the health and well-being of those who keep us safe and secure, and pledge to support them now with preventative and appropriate services and support?", "We know PTSD is real, but so is the struggle leading to that diagnosis. We must commit to supporting our officers, our friends, neighbours and family members so that they can continue to perform their duties and keep us safe and secure.", "As it is engraved on one of the stones of the memorial, “They are our heroes. We shall not forget them.” Speaker, we shall never forget them but that isn’t enough. We must protect and support them so that they can healthily protect and support us." ],

I will be sharing my time with my colleagues on this side: the Minister of Community and Social Services, the member from Etobicoke Centre and the member from Scarborough Southwest.", "I’ve had the chance, over the last few days, at various times, while being here in the chamber to hear some of the other debate that has taken place with respect to Bill 113. Obviously, as was mentioned, it’s at second reading.", "This is one of those bills that I find—in listening to the debate in this House, it is, in many respects, encouraging. Of course, from time to time in this place there can be a bit of a partisan cut and thrust, which is perfectly appropriate. Some would argue that I have occasionally practised that myself, but on this particular legislation, I’ve been impressed so far that the level of discourse and debate has actually been quite sincere and quite genuine, which is heartening to see, of course.", "I want to begin with my time to congratulate the minister who has brought this forward, someone who has spoken on our side of this House in the past, and certainly amongst all stakeholders, very passionately about the importance of making sure that we do proceed with legislation in this regard that strikes the right balance, and make sure that we get it right.", "I believe this has probably been referenced at various times in debate, and I’m sure it will be again, but I had the opportunity to read over a joint statement that was produced by the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, the John Howard Society of Ontario, the Ontario Nonprofit Network and the Ontario Association of Chiefs of Police—the comment or the statement that they made with respect to this legislation around police record checks: “Good news for Ontario workers, volunteers, students, non-profits and businesses that will now see more consistent information released in police record checks.”", "I think that actually goes right to the heart of the importance of this legislation; in fact, in particular, the word “consistent” that is in that quote from those four organizations that I think would have universal respect amongst all members of this Legislature. When you take into account what Bill 113 will be doing, it is that word “consistent” that I think is the most appropriate way to describe the outcome that will be achieved with this legislation.", "Of course, we are very proud as a government to have tabled Bill 113 last spring. If passed, this legislation would develop the province’s first-ever clear, consistent and comprehensive framework for how police record checks are conducted here in the province of Ontario. It builds on a number of guidelines that have been developed by law enforcement, policing, civil liberties’ organizations, mental health, community safety, non-profit and business partners. Again, I think that goes right to the heart of why this is important legislation and also will be effective legislation, because the consultation has been comprehensive, because it’s taken into account that there are a number of important stakeholders and partners that have very strong feelings about making sure that we as a government and that we as a Legislature get something that’s so important to people right—and that’s why the consultation has been comprehensive.", "It’s also important to note that this kind of approach is already being followed by approximately 70% of the police forces across the province of Ontario. This bill, if passed, will ensure a consistent approach across the province, from the Ontario Provincial Police right down to the smallest police force. Again, this is one of those bills that will give us, if passed, the opportunity to apply that consistent standard across the entire province of Ontario. Most importantly, from the perspective of the people that I represent, it is legislation that will ensure that we get the balance right, so that we produce that consistency that is so important to the people we represent, but we also get the balance right with respect to public safety and the respecting of privacy.", "When I think of the people that I represent in Vaughan, and I’m sure that this will be the case for the other three speakers on our side of the House that are to follow—in fact, I know the Minister of Community and Social Services, given that she represents the neighbouring riding to mine in Vaughan, will feel just as passionately about making sure that we strike that right balance. I look forward to hearing her remarks following mine.", "I can say, again, with respect to the minister who has brought forward this bill and the ministry and the hard work that they have done and the consultation that they have done, I’m very, very happy to support Bill 113. I look forward to it continuing through debate at second reading, getting to committee, seeing the work that will come from the committee process itself and having it back here for third reading.", "I am very happy to have had the chance this afternoon to speak strongly in support of Bill 113." ],

As he mentioned, of course, what we have done here is strike an excellent balance between human rights, privacy and public safety.", "I was very much struck by what Ruth Goba, the Interim Chief Commissioner of the Ontario Human Rights Commission, had to say on the subject of Bill 113: “We are delighted that the proposed legislation will address so many of our concerns. The” OHRC “has long advocated for a record check system that respects human rights, privacy and public safety. We are glad that individuals will be able to see their records and ask for reconsideration—two very important steps forward.”", "What does this legislation propose to do? I think it’s very important—my colleague made the comment regarding consistency. What we’re doing here is standardizing three types of police record checks to be offered in Ontario so that there is going to be clear direction on the types of information that must be released or withheld for each type of police record check. There will be direction that an individual can only consent to the release of his or her record checks results to a third party after he or she has reviewed the results. There will also be standards set to ensure that the individual can request reconsideration of the release of certain records. There will be a provision that, five years after passage, the Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services will review the legislation and evaluate its implementation—some very strong measures, obviously, in this particular bill.", "What are the three levels of record check?", "The least intrusive level of record check would disclose basic criminal records, which include criminal convictions.", "The next level of check would include the same records, plus certain additional judicial findings such as discharges and judicial orders, as well as outstanding matters such as pending charges and warrants.", "The most intrusive level of check—this is where public safety is so important—would be limited to employment and volunteer positions of trust or authority over vulnerable persons; we’re talking about children, seniors and those with developmental disabilities. In this type of record check, there would be some additional records included, but these are some that I think are essential in terms of public safety:", "—There would be the release of cases of not criminally responsible by reason of mental disorder. This isn’t just incidents involving a mental health contact; this is where someone has been found not criminally responsible by reason of a mental disorder.", "—There would also be records such as suspended records of sexually based offences, formerly called pardons.", "—Only in exceptional circumstances, when they show a pattern of issues with vulnerable people, would certain additional non-conviction records be included.", "At all times, there will be the decision that certain types of records could not be disclosed. This will apply across the province; all police services will abide by these. The types of records that will not be disclosed are things like diversions, convictions under provincial statutes, Ministry of Transportation information, Family Court restraining orders, local police contact information: as I said before, mental health contact, references to contagious diseases—that sounds quite archaic. These things will not be included.", "I think it’s especially important, for those who simply suffer from an illness related to mental health, that we have ensured that this type of information is irrelevant in the types of reasons why people will require record checks. It is something that I know a great deal of consultation has occurred on with individuals involved with the mental health community, stakeholders and so on.", "This is an excellent step forward. As my colleague has said, I think we have heard that there is wide support for this legislation, and I urge all members of the House to support it." ],

  "text" : [ "It’s an honour to join this debate. Like the Minister of Transportation alluded, I think this is a debate that has been relatively substantive. One of the things I think, when I think about this bill, is the fundamental rights we are trying to defend. Let me share with you what I mean by that.", "When I think about our role here, one of the components of our role as members, as MPPs, as representatives, is to defend the fundamental human rights of Canadians. There are several, what I would consider, fundamental human rights that this bill seeks to defend, which are the right to privacy and the presumption of innocence, but also public safety. I think this bill strikes an effective and pragmatic balance.", "What does the bill do?", "If the bill were passed, this legislation would develop the first-ever clear, consistent and comprehensive framework for how record checks are conducted in our province. It builds on the LEARN Guideline that was developed by policing, civil liberties, mental health, community safety, non-profit and business partners. It’s always great to see a piece of legislation put forward that has been put together where a range of stakeholders have weighed in and where we have taken that thinking and brought it to bear in a piece of legislation. So it’s an excellent collaboration.", "This has already been followed by approximately 70% of the police forces across the province. One of the factors we have to consider here is that this is about ensuring consistency in terms of how we administer and how we defend those fundamental rights across our province. This will touch everyone, from the OPP to the smallest police force.", "Like I said, I think it draws a balance between public safety, but also respecting privacy. There are people who have unfortunately faced unnecessary barriers due to inappropriate non-conviction and non-criminal information such as mental health records— the minister referred to that just a few moments ago—that were disclosed during routine police record checks. There are people who have had their schooling and their careers placed in jeopardy because of this. Literally about a half an hour ago, maybe an hour ago, I introduced a private member’s bill that I think will help young people in selecting a post-secondary path and help students to select the post-secondary path that will help further their objectives and their goals. Here we have a situation where there are people who have had their careers and their goals subverted and potentially damaged because information was released that shouldn’t have been released, and it influenced a decision that did harm to that individual. This bill seeks to address that. Like I said, people have lost out on employment. They’ve lost out on career opportunities unnecessarily. We need to limit those cases where that is unnecessary and where that shouldn’t have happened.", "This legislation would help to remove those unnecessary barriers and therefore increase employment, volunteer and educational opportunities for a lot of people. How it works is that it prohibits the release of non-criminal information such as mental health records, and strictly limits the release of non-conviction records. When we think about the presumption of innocence, when we think about privacy, what this bill is doing is ensuring that non-conviction records—situations where there are records pertaining to somebody who has not been convicted of a crime—not get misused, not used to harm a person. It’s important that we respect that presumption of innocence that each of us enjoys and should enjoy. We should enjoy it not only in theory but in practice, and that’s what this bill is trying to ensure that we implement.", "The bill is also establishing a specific test to ensure that all necessary information is provided in vulnerable sector checks so that those who need it most, those like our children and seniors, continue to be protected. Earlier, I was referring to the fact that this bill draws a pragmatic balance. One of the things that we do need to do is make sure that those who are working with our children, with our seniors, with those who are vulnerable in our population—that the appropriate level of scrutiny is applied to their hiring and their engagement with children and seniors, because we need to make sure that those vulnerable populations and others are protected. What this ensures is that information can still be accessed where needed in those specific instances.", "The bill ensures that individuals will have a chance to review their non-conviction records and seek a reconsideration of the information contained in their check. I think it’s a really important thing to consider. If there’s information out there pertaining to an individual, and that information could be harmful, but also could be inaccurate or could be misrepresentative, the individuals to whom it pertains will have an opportunity to review their non-conviction records and seek reconsideration of the information. Obviously, that has to be based on merit, and there’s a process for that. That’s an important thing, to ensure that, again, people’s presumption of innocence is protected, that their privacy is protected, and that future opportunities are not unduly limited as a result. These changes in the bill will make Ontario a leader in Canada, with a clear, consistent and comprehensive framework to remove the unnecessary barriers to success for individuals while making sure that our communities are safe.", "What I wanted to do for those of my constituents who are watching and who may not be familiar with record checks and what I’m referring to—a record check is a search of police-held records related to an individual. Currently, these records could include things like criminal convictions, judicial orders, charges, acquittals, and apprehensions under the Mental Health Act. Most often a record check is requested by an individual who is seeking employment or to volunteer with an organization. The organization is the one who actually requests the check. Record checks can also be used, among other things, as part of a screening process in education, to approve rental housing, to obtain insurance, or to adopt or gain custody of a child.", "As I mentioned earlier, there are obviously instances where people are going to be dealing with vulnerable populations and additional information and scrutiny are appropriate, but in many cases that additional level of scrutiny is not required and unduly can limit someone’s opportunities in life. It’s important to make sure that we find that pragmatic balance, and I think this bill certainly attempts to do that.", "One of the things that I wanted to mention—and I think my colleagues who were speaking earlier were referring to some of the voices who had supported this—is that there’s a joint statement from the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, the John Howard Society of Ontario, the Ontario Nonprofit Network and the Ontario Association of Chiefs of Police. They had a joint statement, and I think that speaks to the collaborative nature of how this bill that I was speaking about earlier was developed, how it engages all stakeholders. I just want to read that to you, Speaker: “Good news for Ontario workers, volunteers, students, non-profits and businesses that will now see more consistent information released in police record checks.”", "I think that’s really good news. They talk about the consistency there. The consistency is important, to ensure that people know what they can expect, and what’s been done here is that this is going to apply to jurisdictions across Ontario, which is really critical.", "One of the things I also wanted to speak to was the specifics of what the bill does. I’ve talked about it at a high level, but the specifics are built in here.", "I think I’m going to pass on my time to the member for Scarborough Southwest, to finish off the time I have." ],

There was a concern that the police were keeping records of everything, and that they would last forever and could be released at any time.", "This legislation basically standardizes the procedure, not just in Toronto but in all of Ontario, which is only fair. People sometimes look at the police with—they’re afraid, or they don’t like the police, and they are afraid that records or information will be released: for example, carding, or also that people will be arrested but not convicted. We have to protect that fact, to make sure that if someone is arrested, it doesn’t come out automatically to anyone who wants that information. An arrest is very different from a conviction.", "If I have more time to speak later, I will talk about other aspects of this bill." ],

The Toronto Star broke this story back in May 2014, where the abuse of records was happening. Personal information was being collected. In some instances, a person’s name would be attributed to a criminal activity even when they were just a witness to that activity. That’s particularly worrisome for youth in our society today.", "It’s noted that school boards across the province would definitely like to be part of the guidelines going forward.

That has caused a lot of problems. We’ve had public consultation, and we’ve heard the problems they’ve caused numerous people, many in terms of seeking employment, volunteering or even trying to obtain entry to an educational institution. It has caused a lot of difficulty for the public. This is an important piece of legislation for the government, because we will standardize the process across the province: what can be released in a criminal record check, a criminal record and judicial matters check, and a vulnerable sector check.", "Mr. Speaker, I will tell you that in my own riding, I’ve heard from many young people. I’m sure every member of this House has probably had the same experience over the years that they’ve been in office, where a young person has graduated from university as a social worker and they’re attempting to obtain employment, and a record released by the institution to an employer had information where they’ve had contact with police just for questioning or been brought in as part of an investigation because they had information that helped the police. For that to affect someone getting employment—none of us pictured that that would have happened, but it was happening.", "I think this is something that the public will embrace, and they’re looking forward to us implementing it as soon as possible." ],

Volunteers are the heart and core of our communities and do an awful lot of the work of looking after the needy citizens in our communities, and we don’t want to discourage that. We don’t want to embarrass people and therefore discourage them.", "Sometimes a little indiscretion in somebody’s life in the past that is no true reflection on their true character can be destroying to them in the case of where it’s revealed to an employer looking after needy people, and it becomes something that’s totally unacceptable. Word like that can get out in the community and can be very destructive to a person’s reputation, and that needs to be stopped. We have to be very careful with what information gets released.

In cases like when we have children involved or seniors involved and a person is going to be working with children or seniors, it’s important that that person undergo additional scrutiny. But in many cases, that additional scrutiny is not necessary.

As the honourable member from Ottawa Centre noted when he introduced this bill, the intent of the police record check is to create a province-wide standard for police record checks and eliminate the practice of disclosing non-criminal records.", "Rather than keep the members in this House in suspense this afternoon, I’ll tell you off the get-go that we will be supporting this bill when it’s called for second reading vote.", "I certainly believe, as do my colleagues in the official opposition, that it is our duty in this Legislature to put forward legislation that supports the rights of all Ontarians to be treated fairly and equally.", "Bill 113 has been drafted with the intent of ending the unnecessary sharing of non-conviction information that is stored in the ever-growing information databases of our police and security services. It is my understanding that once this bill is passed, only information pertaining to convictions under the Criminal Code of Canada or information that can be justified as relevant for those individuals who will be interacting with the vulnerable sector will be accessible through police checks.", "Further, this legislation is based upon recommendations by the Ontario police chiefs, the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, the Canadian Mental Health Association, the John Howard Society, Legal Aid Ontario and many others too numerous to mention. My office hasn’t been contacted by any of these groups, or others, to voice their opposition to this act. I would hope this means that these groups are satisfied that they were listened to during the consultation process, which I would note is the exception rather than the rule with most of the bills that this government has put forward.", "However, during my eight years as member of provincial Parliament for Sarnia–Lambton, my office has heard from many constituents, on a number of occasions, who have had difficulty with the police check system.", "The requirement for job applicants and volunteers to have a police check completed before they can move forward in the selection process is becoming more and more commonplace in Ontario. Many organizations seem to be requiring police checks from applicants as a way to mitigate the risk when taking on a new employee or volunteer. Mr. Speaker, I think that many organizations have put this policy in place with good intentions, but the application itself may be leading to the best candidates for positions not always being selected. However, this practice will most certainly continue, and will likely grow in the future.", "It probably won’t be long before organizations are asking for some sort of social media background checks, and if we’ve followed the news in recent weeks, we’d understand why.", "That aside, it is important that the provincial government take the time now to make sure that police record checks are being handled appropriately, that an individual’s personal information is being carefully protected, and that only the relevant details are being shared by police agencies with employers and organizations.", "I had the chance to make a few comments on Bill 113 when it was debated in the Legislature recently. I want to reiterate what I said then, like many others: that this legislation could be strengthened even further by adopting, as an amendment, the private member’s bill put forward by my colleague the member for Dufferin–Caledon. This member has done a lot of great work on the issue of police checks for those wishing to volunteer. Her bill, Bill 79, the Helping Volunteers Give Back Act, states:", "“An organization that retains the services of a volunteer is prohibited from requiring a criminal record check for the volunteer, as a condition for the volunteer’s starting work with the organization, if the organization receives a criminal record check for the volunteer that is dated within the year before the day on which the volunteer starts work with the organization and that is the most recent criminal record check that the volunteer has obtained. The criminal record check must meet the authenticity requirements specified by the regulations made under the act. The organization can also require the volunteer to provide notice of all pending criminal proceedings and the final disposition of those proceedings.", "“After a volunteer starts work with an organization, the organization can require a new criminal record check from the volunteer dated at yearly intervals. In addition, the organization can require a criminal record check for a volunteer at any time if the organization has actual notice or reasonable grounds to believe that a conviction for an offence has been added to the volunteer’s criminal record since the date of the most recent criminal record check for the volunteer that the organization has received.", "“When a police force releases a criminal record check for a volunteer, whether to an organization or to the volunteer, the police force is required to release a maximum of five additional originals of the check to the volunteer at no additional charge if the volunteer so requests.”", "It’s my understanding that these record checks can cost upwards of $40 and $50, and you have to have an original. If someone was doing a job search, it could be quite expensive for them to get these original police checks. I think there has to be some leeway there.", "I know that the Helping Volunteers Give Back Act is not what we’re debating today, but I believe that if its principles were added as an amendment to this bill, Bill 113, during committee, the resulting piece of legislation would better serve the residents of Ontario. At the end of the day, that’s why we’re all here.", "Right now, a regular police check in my community of Sarnia–Lambton, by the Sarnia Police Service, costs an applicant $43, and you’re only given one copy of that police check for your use. For individuals who may want to volunteer with multiple organizations, or if they are job-hunting and are lucky enough to get multiple interviews, having to pay for multiple police checks will quickly become an expensive proposition.", "In his comments during the introduction of this bill, the honourable member from Ottawa Centre indicated that this bill would increase employment and volunteer opportunities. For that truly to happen, I think that something needs to be done to reduce the financial burden that is associated right now with police checks.", "I would also like to point out that there is a history of members from this side of the House putting forward great ideas to strengthen government bills. I was fortunate enough to put forward an amendment, during committee work on the Local Food Act, to create a tax credit for farmers who donate to local food banks. The government, the third party and the official opposition debated that, voted on it and that amendment was adopted. As a result, I understand it is making a dramatic impact in communities across the province.", "In my own riding of Sarnia–Lambton, the local food bank has indicated to me that this year alone they have agreements with six local farmers who now are providing fresh produce to the food bank and its mobile market, which makes many stops throughout Sarnia–Lambton. In addition, there have been very generous donations by the local pork producers, chicken farmers and dairy farmers, so clients now have access to healthy protein as well. That was a result of that amendment being adopted by the government from my private member’s bill.", "Back to the Police Record Checks Reform Act: As it stands, Bill 113 seeks to establish a framework around police checks for the first time, after years of calls for legislation from police and civil liberties groups. Hopefully, by creating a standard framework for all police forces to follow, we will see a reduction in the time it takes to complete a police check.", "I had my staff look into the calls we received in our office about police check issues. The majority of concerns had to do with the amount of time it takes to receive a police check once an application is submitted. Some constituents are facing waits of up to six weeks or more for their police checks. This could certainly be detrimental for those who have a standing job offer, for whom wait times of over a month and a half or more are certainly not helpful. In fact, that would likely produce a lot of anxiety for both the applicant and the potential employer.", "The spouse of one of my staff members actually went through one of these extended wait periods a few years ago. After securing a job offer at a local children’s treatment centre in Sarnia–Lambton, the spouse of my staff member contacted the Toronto Police Service, where they were living at the time, to obtain a police check. It took over four months for the Toronto Police Service to complete the check and return it. When the organization that was waiting on the police check called the Toronto Police Service to find out why the process was taking so long, the desk officer told the human resources manager—get this, Mr. Speaker—that they found it suspicious that someone would actually move from Toronto to Sarnia, so a more thorough check was being conducted.", "For those of us who spend most of the week here, Toronto is a great place. But I find it hard that someone would suspect someone wanting to move from this great city to a great place like Sarnia–Lambton or some other great community like Hamilton or Ottawa.", "I hope this story illustrates just one of the frustrating aspects of the current police check system. Right now, there is no guide for police departments to follow. Each department decides what it wants to do, and citizens who are forced to go through the process are left to wait and wonder what is going on. By establishing a clear framework for police services of what to include in a police record check, I am hopeful that the processing time for police checks can be reduced.", "Back to the points on Bill 113, the government is proposing three types of checks through this legislation. These checks would include the following information:", "(1) The criminal record check itself: criminal convictions and findings of guilt under the Youth Criminal Justice Act. That’s a criminal records check.", "(2) Criminal record and judicial matters check: a criminal record check plus outstanding charges, arrest warrants, certain judicial orders, absolute discharges, conditional discharges, and other records as authorized by the Criminal Records Act.", "(3) A vulnerable sector check: a criminal record and judicial matters check, plus findings of not criminally responsible due to a mental disorder, record suspensions or pardons related to sexually based offences and non-conviction information related to the predation of a child or other vulnerable person—that is to say, charges that were withdrawn, dismissed or stayed, or that resulted in acquittals.", "The definition of a vulnerable person:", "“a person who, because of his or her age, a disability or other circumstances, whether temporary or permanent,", "“(a) is in a position of dependency on others, or", "“(b) is otherwise at a greater risk than the general population of being harmed by a person in a position of trust or authority towards them.”", "A vulnerable sector check is performed in cases where an individual would be in an employment or volunteer position of trust or authority over children or other vulnerable persons.", "This bill would also put into place rules for how police record checks are released. My colleague the member for Chatham–Kent–Essex touched on this aspect of the bill earlier this week in his remarks, and I believe it bears repeating. There have been numerous stories in the Toronto newspapers and happenings in my riding regarding non-conviction records being placed on an individual’s file in various police databases. These records may include charges that were laid against an individual but were later dropped or could not be proven in court. It was noted in a previous debate on this bill that as of 2005, there were more than 420,000 people—almost a half a million people—listed in the RCMP’s Canadian Police Information Centre, otherwise known as CPIC, but there being no conviction on their record.", "We have also learned through media reports of situations where a person has received attention for mental health issues and they now find themselves with notations on their file—notations that can and are negatively impacting their lives.", "By and large, I believe the general reaction of Ontarians when they learn of these sorts of non-conviction police records—they are concerned. Most individuals would assume that if an individual has not committed a crime or if they were cleared of any wrongdoing, their record would be wiped clean. That, unfortunately, is not the case in Ontario.", "As part of this bill, an individual will have the opportunity to review their police record check for information before deciding to release it. This would certainly be helpful for those interested in finding out what is on their record. Most people would not be aware that they had a non-conviction police record until it’s too late. For example, one may find out when they are rejected for an employment opportunity or turned away at the American border. As I come from a border community, again, this is an issue that we have heard about in my constituency office.", "I told this story the other day during a hit, but it’s relevant to this point, so I’ll tell it again. A number of years ago, my wife and I and a number of other couples went for a vacation in the Caribbean—long before I got elected, because now we don’t have time to do anything like that, my wife would say. On the way back, we crossed the border at Sarnia with a number of individuals in a van. We cleared customs quite easily. It was only after we got home—and I’m glad I didn’t know beforehand, because it might have made me a little nervous—I found out from a now-retired border patrol officer, who I actually went to school with—I won’t say any more about that—that someone had made an anonymous call to the bridge and said that a number of individuals were returning from a trip. I was one of them and they named some of the other people—I won’t go into their names—and that we were probably smuggling something back.", "This person, who knew me very well, said, “Look, I know Bob Bailey and he wouldn’t be doing anything like that,” and they threw it aside. I was fortunate that that happened—" ],

Researching this and going through this made me think about that again. I hadn’t thought about it for probably 15 years or more. But that’s how someone could make mischief anonymously, on some people who were very innocent. Thank God that they didn’t follow through on that.", "It’s troubling to learn that it’s simple for someone to have a suspicious note like that added to your personal file, so that every time you go through Canadian customs, it gives the officer a reason to pull you in for an inspection.", "I would certainly be interested to know if that is on my police record, and I think I’ll check it when I get this done. I think it’s probably not on there, because I held a number of different positions, prior to being elected, where you had to have an RCMP check. So I don’t think it’s probably on there, because I had some order-in-council appointment positions that I have filled, and I don’t think I would have got them if that was on my file.", "Mr. Speaker, everyone who is watching today should be asking themselves what could possibly be on their file that they don’t know about. Imagine the shock of being rejected on the basis of your police record if you have never been convicted of a crime, or if you have paid for a trip with your family and you’re prepared to go across the border, and all of a sudden you’re turned back. We’ve heard about that in the media lots of times recently. This is an issue that concerns a number of Ontarians right now under the current system. There’s often no way to know if you have a record until one day you find out with such a rejection.", "A record with a non-conviction could impact your ability to find a better job, volunteer, obtain higher education or even rent an apartment. That is why I am encouraged to see, as part of this bill, that section 10 includes a provision that will allow an individual to file for reconsideration of a decision to release non-conviction information that may be set to be released to the public.", "Subsection 10(4) states: “If the individual submits a request for reconsideration in accordance with the regulations, the provider shall, within 30 days after receiving the reconsideration request, reconsider its determination in accordance with any requirements prescribed by the minister.”", "The bill goes on to say, at subsection 15(1): “Every police record check provider shall create and implement a process to respond to a request from an individual to correct information in respect of the individual if the individual believes there is an error or omission in the information.”", "Mr. Speaker, these avenues of appeal are a good thing. However, the bill does leave the matter of how the reconsideration process is handled to the individual police departments. That could create a greater degree of variance between the different departments in the province, and of course the intent of this bill is to standardize the process of obtaining a police check for the individual, but also for the police departments, so that unnecessary and irrelevant personal information is not released.", "In summary, Mr. Speaker, I would like to say that I will be supporting this bill at second reading. I believe there has been great work done in listening to the various police services and civil liberties groups to address their concerns with this legislation. I think that when we get it to committee, we can probably make even more improvements to it. It should remove the guesswork and reduce the frustration associated with a police record check. More importantly, it will do a better job of protecting the very personal non-conviction information of individuals that is housed on these various police service databases.", "All that being said, I still believe there is room for improvement in this bill. I am hopeful, Mr. Speaker, that the government will allow that discussion to take place at committee, and that they will be open to some of the opposition members’ suggestions.", "Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for your indulgence." ],

Sometimes people need police checks for that as well. Insurance—that can impact you as well. So there are various parts of people’s lives where you might think it is incidental, but it really will change the outcome of some things you enter into.", "Speaker, the other part of that: Different police forces in different cities, perhaps, have different procedures, and there are inconsistencies, maybe, in what one force would put on a police check compared to another. The same thing with the Ontario Nonprofit Network: They talked about their organization receiving this information, how it’s interpreted and how it’s stored in their facilities.

It just takes a long time, in many cases.", "More importantly, he brought up that the issue is when it’s a requirement for getting a job that they have a check done. As he mentioned, it can sometimes take up to six weeks, which, really, I think, is far too long. It’s problematic if someone is waiting around to get that check done in order to get their job.", "The other issue he brought up was cost. He says that, in Sarnia, it’s $43 for each check. If you have to get a bunch of checks done for various positions, it can get pretty expensive. I think the timeliness is one that I hope is improved upon by this bill. I’m not sure that is the case.", "As has been stated, the PC caucus does support the bill, and the PC caucus supports the rights of all Ontarians to be treated fairly and equally. It does not support the release of non-criminal information, such as mental-health-related information. These matters are personal and private and should not be disclosed when no charges have been laid against an individual.", "Mr. Speaker, that’s all I have time for now. Thank you to the member for his comments." ],

He did bring up a lot of good points.", "I know in my constituency office where it comes to pass most is with the volunteers. It’s hard to get volunteers in my part of the country, I think as it is in most of the province, perhaps all of the province. And when you get people who want to volunteer, and the record check system is very lengthy, is sufficiently costly—because many volunteers do volunteer at two or three or four organizations. People who like to volunteer, they volunteer a lot. They are pillars in their community, and they end up paying quite a bit of money.", "A complaint I’ve had come to my office a few times is that with some of these checks, fingerprints are involved and they’re asked to re-fingerprint after three years, I believe, for some of the checks. The question is, why? Did the people’s fingerprints change? It’s a good question, because where I live, you have to go a fair ways to get this done. It’s a good question: Do they really need to be re-fingerprinted after three years for a routine check for a volunteer organization?", "It’s a fine balance. We want to make sure that with people who volunteer, there are no bad apples and everything is safe. But we also want to make sure that people who really want to do good in their community aren’t overburdened by things that don’t really make it safer." ],

I looked forward to it. As the one member said, it’s hard to get volunteers anymore, anyway, and with liability, it gets people thinking about risk, when you have to go through these police record checks. You might think that some issue from your misspent youth might come back to haunt you—you know, that you forgot about, yourself. So I think it’s good that we’re able to access these now, if this bill comes to fruition. People will actually have the ability to see what’s in their record, have it corrected if it’s wrong—work some way of forgiveness, somehow to get it corrected; and if it’s wrong, look to have it removed, have it corrected. Because we do need volunteers. We couldn’t run the province without them.", "I got thinking about that $43 cost—whatever it is, $43 or $50—for a record check. That’s another thing. Imagine how much that’s being subsidized by the taxpayers, because there is no earthly way that those OPP officers, in the case of Sarnia–Lambton—or whether it’s the metro police or whatever—could do that, because I know how long they take to do those things. I have family members who are involved, and I never really thought about it before, but I know $43 or $50 wouldn’t touch it. It’s probably three times that for their time, because they don’t get it all done on the first day; they might be doing a half a dozen.", "Anyway, thank you again, Mr. Speaker, for the opportunity to speak to the bill.

It’s not often that I feel the need to do that, but this is a very important bill. I’m very happy to see it coming forward. The government has done good work by introducing this bill, and I would like to acknowledge that.", "I’d also like to mention the member from Bramalea–Gore–Malton, who has done a lot of great work around this issue as well.", "This bill seeks to right a wrong that has been going on in our province for too long. This bill will ensure that when the Canadian Police Information Centre does a record check, in most cases, only conviction records will be passed on in our communities.", "That’s a good thing. Too many people have been denied opportunities because of interaction with police that did not result in a conviction, when a non-conviction record wound up on a criminal record check. People have been denied opportunities for housing, for employment, for volunteering and opportunities to simply try to better themselves.", "What is a non-conviction record, and why is it important to keep them off of criminal record checks? A conviction record is pretty straightforward: Any time someone is convicted of a crime through the due process provided by our court system, a record of that conviction is put on file under that name. That makes sense. If you have your due process and a judge or a jury has decided that, on balance, there is evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that you committed a crime, you should be convicted. We should keep that on record.", "According to a report by the John Howard Society entitled Reducing Barriers for Ontario’s Youth with Police Records—this is kind of staggering; I was surprised at this number myself—over 4.1 million Canadians have a record of criminal conviction that is on their record. That’s a pretty staggering number, which raises a whole host of other issues, but it makes sense to record who those people are and what they’ve been convicted of.", "On the other hand, non-conviction records are not so straightforward. The same report by the John Howard Society notes that each year in Ontario, our criminal court system processes more than half a million charges. Think about that: half a million charges. But of the half-million charges that are processed annually, close to 43% of them result in stayed or withdrawn charges.", "That’s important, because it’s the first type of non-conviction record that we think about. If you are charged with a crime, then have those charges stayed or withdrawn in the courts, a record of that is still created. That means that each year in Ontario, more than 200,000 people are having non-conviction records put on their files. I believe that that creates a problem, and I’m proud to stand here today to speak on a bill that will help address the problem that it creates.", "If it were just 200,000 Ontarians every year who were having non-conviction records attached to their file, this would still be an issue. Unfortunately, it’s bigger than that. There are more ways that someone can have a non-conviction record put on their file.", "I’ll refer again to the John Howard Society here, who have given us a short list of what we are talking about when we talk about non-conviction records. Those records can be from a 911 call for assistance, from the fact that you are a victim of a crime, from a mental health crisis that involved contacting the police, from being questioned by the police in relation to a crime or, as I already mentioned, from arrests or charges that did not result in a conviction.", "Now, it is currently the last three issues I mentioned that are causing the most concern for civil liberties groups, community organizations, police chiefs and not-for-profit organizations: the issues of police contact in a mental health crisis, being questioned by police not in relation to a crime and arrest or a charge, again, that didn’t result in a conviction. Let’s not kid ourselves about who that is impacting. In the majority of cases, those street checks are done on young people living in poor areas of Toronto. Often, those young men are first- or second-generation Canadians whose parents work multiple jobs and still struggle to keep food on the table and a roof over their heads. I think we can all agree that those hard-working Canadians face enough barriers in trying to build a better life for themselves and their children already. It is the least we can do to stop adding barriers in their lives, and I really do mean it’s the least we can do.", "Now that we know what non-conviction records are, I think it’s time we talk a little about why their disclosure on police record checks is such a problem and why this bill is so necessary.", "First, the disclosure of non-conviction records seems to violate one of the fundamental pillars of our justice system. In Canada, we all have the right to presumption of innocence. It is very clearly laid out and protected by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Section 11(d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms states, “Any person charged with an offence has the right ... to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law in a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal....” I want to draw your attention to the fact that this clause relates to someone charged with an offence. Someone who has been charged with an offence must be presumed innocent until proven guilty. The problem we are facing here today is that the people who have not even been charged with a crime are facing barriers in their lives because of it. We all understand that, for those who are listening. We all understand that, Mr. Speaker, about the barriers to their lives.", "They are facing barriers to get jobs. We’ve heard this a lot here this afternoon, from the Conservatives, from the Liberals and from every speaker who has spoken on this issue—barriers to jobs but also to accepting volunteer positions and going to school, not because they have been charged, let alone convicted of a crime, but because the police had stopped them. I believe, and I believe most MPPs think the same way, that that is such a blatant disregard for section 11(d) of the charter that it’s almost astonishing.", "I don’t want to give the impression that I think the police or employers or schools are purposely disregarding the charter; quite frankly, far from it. All those people do great work and help a lot of people, and we certainly shouldn’t take that away from them. But what is now common practice, the disclosure of non-conviction records as part of police checks, is a serious problem, and partially because it conflicts with the charter. It really and truly is something that we need to address now.", "If you are someone whose life experiences taught you not to trust the police, if you live in a community where a police presence seems threatening rather than seeming to increase your safety, and you have issues, is that going to help you trust the police? Is that going to make you more likely to call police officers if you need them? Think about that. If you have a mental health issue and you call the police to get help, it’s then going to be put on your file, so when you go to volunteer or you go to coach a hockey team or you go across the border, that’s going to show up. So you end up not calling the police and getting the help you need.", "Of course, those are all somewhat abstract concepts when what this issue is really about is the human impact of this policy. The impact of disclosure of non-conviction records is what this is all about. The barriers that have been created that stop hard-working Ontarians, especially young people, from pursuing their dreams of a new job, a better education, or even the opportunity to volunteer and help out in their communities—something that is very rewarding, that most of us in this room probably do. That is the human impact of the disclosure of non-conviction records on police checks, and that is what needs to be stopped from happening in our great province of Ontario.", "Applause." ],

Remember those stories—because that is what this bill is working to fix. It’s going to put a stop to the disclosure of non-conviction records on police checks. That is going to help eliminate barriers for employment, for volunteer opportunities and for education that are faced far too often by the people of this province.", "This bill gets a good number of things right. It prohibits the disclosure of non-conviction records in most cases, while recognizing that in some cases, those records could be disclosed as an exceptional disclosure. It governs three types of record checks: criminal record checks, criminal record and judicial matters checks, and vulnerable sector checks. It sets out a framework for police non-conviction record checks, though it leaves much of the substance of that to regulations. And it sets time limits, which is equally important, on the non-conviction information released.", "These are all good things, and I’m happy to see the government finally bringing them forward.

The government is listening to the people of this province and taking action to right a wrong.

I would like to use my last few minutes to discuss one of the areas where that improvement would be most beneficial. The area that I want to draw your attention to is around the exceptional disclosure provision for the release of non-conviction records. This provision provides that in some circumstances, records that would otherwise not be allowed to be released can be released.", "I understand why this is necessary, and I don’t believe that the provision needs to be entirely removed. In fact, I was glad to see that the bill already provides for time limitations on how the provision can be applied. However, this provision still does present an issue that is twofold: First, there is an issue of transparency and accountability in the decision-making process about when those records can be released. As it stands currently, those records are created by the police, stored by the police and would be evaluated and released by the police. Unfortunately, that practice is plagued by a lack of transparency and accountability. There is no independent body that can say, “Hold on a second. Something isn’t quite right here.”", "Now, that is not to speak ill of our police services. The police in this province are some of the best in the world. They do incredible work every single day and are some of the bravest and hardest-working women and men I know. But through no fault of their own, they are being put in a situation that, as I said, lacks transparency and accountability.", "The other side of this issue around the provision for exceptional disclosure relates to what records are released as part of that disclosure. The issue here is that there might be some cases where an exceptional disclosure is looked at and the records that are then disclosed have nothing to do with the position being applied for.", "Let me give you an example. Let’s say someone is applying to work with a senior—I see my time is going to run out.

I’ve sat in the House and listened to several people, across the way and in my own party, and they’re all complimentary of the bill.

The person whose record is being checked may not get a copy of it and may not be aware of what has been released. The legislation in front of you ensures that the person whose record is being compiled receives that record first, gets an opportunity to review it and also has an opportunity to request a review from the issuing body. Then there’s an appeal process if they’re not happy.", "I think this particular legislation goes quite a ways to correct something that was out there that affected the young people, especially, in our community, and some adults, but I would say mostly the young people who were trying to volunteer or get a job or enter an educational institution. They would have had problems in the past and they will no longer have that, so I think it’s a good thing." ],

It is something that we all need.", "Volunteers are truly the backbone of everything we do in our communities. We could not function as a province the way we do without our volunteers. Most of this, I believe, is really for the intended purpose of protecting our children and our youth. A lot of us in our volunteer capacities have interaction with our youth and with our next generation. I think the whole intent of all police checks at one point was probably for making sure that we have people who are appropriately there to be governing them.", "What I hear in my community is that there are needs to amend some of those. Some of the things that I’m going to talk about are the duplication of efforts, the duplication if you happen to volunteer for a lot of activities. I know, Mr. Speaker, that you were very involved over your years in your community; you have played a lot of key roles. One of the things we want to do is not unduly burden the system with a lot of repetitious checks. We don’t want to have to go back 15 times if you happen to be a volunteer for 15 different organizations. We want to streamline that, so that obviously there is due diligence, to ensure that there’s a proper check done, but we don’t want to overburden the police services and all of their employees, whether they be civilian personnel or actual police officers. A lot of time and energy can be spent doing these types of checks.", "The one thing I’m going to talk about a fair bit in there is the non-conviction records. People don’t even realize what’s in a check or what could be part of a check, and that could have the unintended consequence of creating some negative challenges.", "I applaud the speaker.

I’m going out maybe either to a Sabres game or a Bills game, or just going to buy dinner, and I get stopped at the border. Now they’re asking those types of questions because it comes up, and I get turned back. This is what we’ve got to fix. The embarrassment is incredible.", "I just want to say, once again, thanks very much for all of your comments. And congratulate yourselves for, actually, a pretty pleasant half-hour here, listening to us all talk about the importance of doing something right so that more people can volunteer in our communities, so they can do something right. We all know volunteers are what make our communities happen.", "We really have an issue—I have 15 seconds left. I’m going to put a quick 15 seconds out: We need more volunteers. We need more young people at the Lions, at the Legion—it doesn’t matter what it is. Get out and volunteer. It’s the best thing you can do—it makes you feel good—for your communities. Thank you very much." ],

We are doing it because we want to encourage volunteers to volunteer. I think everybody in this Legislature has a strong history in volunteerism. I can’t imagine any of us would have been elected to this place had we not been active members of our community.", "I know I’ve been involved in many organizations, but the one I had the strongest relationship with was Big Sisters of London, now Big Brothers Big Sisters of London. I was on the board several years ago; in fact, I was president of the board. One thing we really struggled with, as an organization that matches young girls with women, was the whole issue of safety. It’s one thing to have a group activity where several people can keep an eye on the safety of the interactions; it’s another thing altogether when a woman and a girl go off and do whatever activities, often at each other’s homes. We really needed to work hard to have confidence that the volunteers we were matching with these young girls would keep them out of harm’s way, would keep them safe.", "So we did institute the practice, which is now pretty well universal, I think, of doing the police checks. It’s not something we’ve always done; it is something that is relatively recent, that we would do police checks. But that gave us a certain comfort that the young girls would be safe with the volunteer Big Sisters. Sometimes, though, those police checks did put in place a barrier to volunteering.", "Now we will have consistent police checks across the province based on the evidence, based on the work of the LEARN guidelines, the law enforcement and records managers network—work that’s been done, developed by policing, civil liberties activists, mental health stakeholders, community safety, non-profit, business partners. They all got together and said, “What should a police check include and what should a police check not include?”", "I’m delighted, and I think all of us agree—it’s a unanimous and enthusiastic agreement—that this is the direction to go. So let’s get this job done. But, again, to follow from the member from Niagara Falls, this is a really good opportunity to encourage people to volunteer.

It is absolutely the truth that the more you give, the more you get. The more you volunteer, the more you want to volunteer. So whether it’s—whatever organization in your community—visiting at a long-term-care home, whether it’s engaging with kids at Big Brothers Big Sisters, the Boys and Girls Club, there are so many opportunities to volunteer and to actually learn more about yourself and learn more about your community. The thing that I always loved about volunteering is you met people who you might not otherwise meet through your work or your neighbourhood. It exposes you to other kinds of people facing other kinds of challenges. We do want to encourage that.", "I know that one of the highlights of my year is going to the Volunteer Service Awards that happen across the province where we get to acknowledge those volunteers who cross the stage and accept their pins in recognition of their volunteering. I tell you, every time I go to that event with my colleague members from London and area, it’s just inspiring to see how those long-service volunteers have contributed to the community.", "I always say, if you don’t think volunteering is important, just imagine if we had no volunteers. Imagine that our hospitals were operated without those volunteers who help us as we enter the hospital, who work in the gift shop to help fund things in the hospital that otherwise would not be covered. Imagine if our kids weren’t able to go to Scouts or Girl Guides. Imagine if our schools didn’t have the volunteers in them to help kids learn, to support the Student Nutrition Program—whatever it is.

Unfortunately, sometimes people who wish to do harm to children gravitate towards them, and you cannot tell by looking at them or talking to them that they are this kind of criminal, so it is very important that we do keep criminal record checks in place.", "However, we have heard from our partners, stakeholders, police services, businesses and volunteer organizations that there’s a need for consistent practices and policies across this province. For instance, I know a young woman who was applying for part-time employment in two different school boards in the same area. So she applied for a police record check for the one board and got it, and then took it to the other school board and showed it—it was still timely—and was told, “No, no. You have to apply for another police record check.” So she had to put out the money and apply to the same police service for another record check. That isn’t fair. First of all, the person had a good police record check. There was no reason to have to apply, particularly from the same police service—although it is important, as I said, that we get people in the schools who have gone through the record checks.", "The other thing that happened when I was president of the teachers’ federation and this procedure first came in place is I had, I would say, a middle-aged teacher call me almost in tears. He had done something in another province when he was a juvenile, and he was petrified. Here he was, 20 years into his teaching career, and he was worried that he was going to get fired because of that conviction. It had nothing to do with his job as a teacher. We were able to make sure that his record had been expunged. He is one of the very special teachers who works with special-needs children and helps children who are having difficulty in society and perhaps having some issues with discipline. Thank heavens, the good news was that yes, it was expunged, and he got to keep his job.", "The other thing was that back then, teachers would call—there were a few of them, and there are probably some people in here, who, in their younger days, had perhaps been driving when they shouldn’t have—those kinds of things. Very clearly, that has no bearing on volunteering or working in the school system, and those are the kinds of things that need to be consistent across the province.", "If passed, this legislation would help remove those unnecessary barriers and increase employment, volunteers and education opportunities. It does this by prohibiting the release of non-criminal information such as mental health records and strictly limiting the release of non-conviction records. As the member from Niagara said, there are certain times when records such as those need to be divulged—I’m not going to go into any examples—in order to keep children in schools safe.", "I urge everyone to support this bill; I think we need it to be consistent. I hope this means there will be consistent prices and that if you have one police record check, you will be able to use it when you’re volunteering in several different places.", "We are ensuring that individuals will have a chance to review their non-conviction records and seek a reconsideration of the information contained in the check. I think that’s only fair, too.", "These changes will make Ontario a leader in Canada—with a clear, consistent and comprehensive framework to remove unnecessary barriers to success for individuals, while making sure that our communities are safe.", "In the schools, we have parents, grandparents, uncles, aunts—people who come in and read with the children, people who help out with crafts, special activities, going on field trips, all of those kinds of things. We would have a hard time doing all the wonderful things that happen in the schools without those volunteers, so I urge everyone to support this bill." ],

He volunteered with youth; he volunteered in many other aspects. To really acknowledge Constable MacDonald, Sudbury created a youth football league in memory of him: the Joe MacDonald Youth Football League. If you think about that league today, there are so many volunteers who are needed to make it run. I can think of Dr. Mike Staffen, who I played football with way back in the day, who has been instrumental in keeping that organization going. But there are so many volunteers who keep that organization going.", "The President of the Treasury Board spoke about it earlier: I know many of us get the opportunity to go to the Volunteer Service Awards. Just this past year, I was able to attend. I believe we had about 200 volunteers from my great riding of Sudbury there to receive an award. As the President of the Treasury Board was talking about, if we just imagined those 200 people not being there, who would be affected? It’s the seniors in our community, who actually rely on great organizations like Meals on Wheels, and many other organizations in my riding that I could talk about that relate to volunteer service and provide service to seniors.", "Boards: We forget about volunteer boards, Mr. Speaker. There are so many great boards within my community, within I know all of our communities, that do great work. They sit and have to go through Robert’s Rules and learn all of those processes, but they stick through it, and they make decisions that truly benefit all of our communities.", "For five years prior to being elected in politics, I was involved with the United Way as the executive director and the campaign director. I can truly speak to how, if it wasn’t for volunteers, the money that we raised in Sudbury or as any other United Way across this great province or our great country—we wouldn’t be able to do that. So today, for us to be able to stand in this House and speak to the importance of this legislation, and make the changes necessary to ensure that we can help all of these charitable organizations, not-for-profit organizations, I think is commendable for all of us. Truly, I’ve had the experience, as being an executive director or working in a charitable organization, where we’ve had people come forward and want to volunteer. They really wanted to. But the process for them to get their police record checks in on time to meet a deadline, to meet an opportunity or whatever that charity or organization was doing, would pass because that timeline was so long.", "I know we’re talking about more and more police record checks coming forward. I believe—just the OPP, if I’ve got the statistic here down correctly, does more than 200,000 checks annually. Although there is no accurate data on the total checks province-wide, anecdotal evidence suggests demand for record checks is increasing. So we’ve got the OPP having to do 200,000. I don’t know how many the Greater Sudbury Police Service needs to do, but if we went through every police service across the province, I’m sure those are significant numbers. If we can compile all of this and streamline this to make it easier for those who are being affected by trying to get their police record check, I think we’re doing the right thing, not only as a government, but as a Parliament in general.", "I know our stakeholders—police, businesses, volunteer organizations—are talking also about consistent practices and policies across the province. This legislation will do just that. Also, prior, I think it’s important to recognize that before my days at the United Way, I was also a manager within the residential field in terms of providing services to individuals with developmental handicaps. Once again, lots of people with great big hearts wanting to volunteer, and I was always so honoured and humbled to see so many people wanting to come out and work in some difficult areas.", "This legislation still addresses the area in which we need to protect some of our most vulnerable citizens. I know my colleague from Barrie was speaking earlier about the importance of getting police record checks in school systems. There are also many in vulnerable situations who still need to have the kind of police checks that would require specific information for them to ensure that they can do their job effectively, but at the same time, make sure that they fit the criteria of what type of person needs to be working in those sectors.", "I’m very happy, again, to be able to say that we’re moving forward with this legislation. I was very happy to hear that all parties are in support of this legislation to ensure that we can continue to think about all of those volunteers who come to those service awards, but also think about all of the volunteers who are in our province who actually make our province what it is, both economically and socially. They do a fantastic job, and I think all of us here acknowledge the great work of our volunteers, thank all of our volunteers.", "It truly was my honour to be able to speak to this this afternoon.

When I was researching that bill, it came up in discussion that a lot of people who suffer with mental health and addictions issues reach a crisis point, and the only resource they have left is to call 911 and they get the police. Sometimes that isn’t always the most appropriate response to what they’re going through.", "This is the scenario that I’m trying to portray here, Speaker. Someone has a mental health issue; there may not be the timely access to the resources they may need in the community or in the health care system—because of doctor shortages, wait times—and then they’re in crisis and they call the police. That’s their only thought in an emergency situation.", "It’s good to see that the police record checks bill is now going to look after some of those mental health issues, because sometimes it’s a result of the gaps in our system, where people didn’t access that mental health and then they’re left at a stage where they reached out to the wrong organization and find themselves perhaps with a police check that, really, was unnecessary. I’m glad to see that that is going to happen, because people get ill, and if that’s who they call for help, it shouldn’t affect them for 20 years if they want to become a volunteer in an organization.", "So it’s good to see that this bill is here.

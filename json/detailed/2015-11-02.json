This is the 37th year that representatives from the mining industry and government will gather here to better understand and appreciate the vital role of mining in Ontario’s history and in our economy.", "I don’t think there’s any argument that Ontario is fortunate to have an abundance of natural resources, including rich mineral deposits. Our government certainly understands this, and we also understand the importance of the mining sector to the province’s economy, that particularly being the case in northern Ontario.", "We have worked very hard to ensure that our mining sector remains strong and able to handle the challenges of a highly competitive and very dynamic global market. Some important facts: Ontario remains a top-10 mineral investment jurisdiction in the world. We lead Canada in spending on mineral exploration and we remain a destination of choice for mineral developers. We have 43 mines currently operating in the province of Ontario. We are a leading jurisdiction for both exploration and the production of minerals in Canada, and, as I said earlier, we are a major player across the world.", "In 2014, we saw our value of mineral production reach a record $11 billion, securing Ontario as Canada’s lead province in mining and production. May I say that, even in the very uncertain global economic times that our province faces—the European debt crisis, the downturn in China, and certainly I think we need to acknowledge the depressed commodity prices—Ontario continues to be one of the most attractive destinations for mineral exploration in North America. So, Speaker, we are very optimistic about the future of mining in Ontario, as I know all members of this House are.", "Today, there are approximately 200 companies undertaking more than 300 mineral exploration projects here in the province. Nearly three dozen of those are at the advanced stage of that process. New mine construction includes KGHM’s Victoria mine in Sudbury, Goldcorp’s Cochenour gold mine expansion in Red Lake, New Gold’s very exciting gold mine in Rainy River, and Rubicon’s Phoenix Gold Project as well. In addition, there are a number of other mine expansion projects, such as Goldcorp’s Hoyle Pond winze project in Timmins, that are actually under way. And we are very confident that several new mining operations will come into production over the next number of years. May I say, I include Noront’s Eagle’s Nest nickel mine in the Ring of Fire in that category.", "Important facts, again, Speaker, that I think people need to know: Ontario has about 25% of the mining sector jobs in the country. In 2014, the total number of direct jobs in mineral production was 26,000 in the province of Ontario, and some 50,000 jobs in related manufacturing and processing industries. May I say, the mineral sector is also the largest private sector employer of aboriginal peoples in Canada.", "Our ministry is continuing our work on developing export markets for the mining supply and services sector, which is a huge economic driver in the province of Ontario. Over the last year, our ministry has led trade missions to a number of strategic destinations, including Chile, Sweden, India, Australia and Mexico, all with positive results. Since 2009, trade missions led by the Ministry of Northern Development and Mines have resulted in millions of dollars in sales of mining supply and services. Again, we are top of the grade in that regard.", "We’re also helping companies in northern Ontario’s mining supply and services sector enter new markets and diversify their client base. They are learning and at the front end of advancing their innovative products and services across Canada and around the world. It’s measures like these that promote long-term sustainability and global competitiveness in our province, and that, of course, is what is key to our success.", "We also are doing very substantial work. Work is under way on the renewal of Ontario’s Mineral Development Strategy—something we first brought out in 2006. We think a renewal, a revitalization, of that is absolutely crucial. Our new strategy, which is expected later this fall, will help our government ensure that Ontario remains a global leader in mining, so that our mineral sector continues to provide significant social and economic contributions for the people of Ontario.", "We’re also working very hard on modernizing the Mining Act to help Ontario remain at the forefront of mineral exploration and production. Our Mining Act modernization will encourage prospecting, staking and exploration, and the development of mineral resources in a way that affirms aboriginal and treaty rights, is respectful of private landowners and minimizes the impact on the environment. Our plan to modernize includes an online registration system for mining claims which will replace the current ground-staking process. An online claim registration system will make the staking of mining claims more efficient and significantly reduce the environmental impact of mineral exploration.", "Our government also recognizes very well that the cost of electricity represents a significant challenge for mining operations. Large industrial users of electricity, including mining companies, certainly have become significantly more competitive with the support of the Northern Industrial Electricity Rate Program, which everyone in this Legislature knows so well. That NIER program is helping the largest electricity consumers reduce their energy costs by up to 25%. That, of course, is helping them to create and sustain jobs and maintain long-term global competitiveness. Certainly, many people who will be here tomorrow for our Meet the Miners Day will be happy to tell you how important that program has been to the success of their companies.", "What we’re very excited about—and I’m very proud of and certainly proud of our government—is that our government has made support of this program permanent, with funding averages of about $120 million annually. That was a hugely well received announcement. Again, I’m grateful to the Premier and to the Minister of Finance for making that program permanent. Under that program, since 2010, we have distributed more than $484 million in rebates to qualifying participants.", "It’s such a huge part of our economic structure, Mr. Speaker, that we remain committed to investing in mining research through organizations such as the Centre for Excellence in Mining Innovation, or CEMI. These investments very much drive innovation and help ensure that Ontario remains a global leader in the mines and minerals sector.", "There is no question that mining enriches our lives, from the salt on your table to rare earth metals for cellphones. Not everyone realizes how each and every day they are touched by the mining sector itself. It’s a pillar of our provincial economy and it certainly provides social and economic benefits for all Ontarians.", "Our government remains very committed to supporting mineral development in the province so that we can ensure that we continue to be that world leader for both exploration and mining investment. This does mean promoting mineral production and development in Ontario in a balanced manner. I use that expression frequently, Mr. Speaker, and I have from the moment that we introduced the modernized Mining Act. We need to do it in a balanced manner which very much includes protecting—I see my colleague across the floor is agreeing with me on this, how important it is to bring it forward in a balanced manner—protecting public health and safety, and minimizing the impact on the environment.", "Meet the Miners Day is a day that helps us all to reflect on the role of the mines and mineral sector in our lives. So on behalf of the Ministry of Northern Development and Mines and the province of Ontario, I am really very pleased that we are going to be having this very special 37th annual Meet the Miners Day here at the Legislature. I do want to invite all of the members to a reception, which will be happening tomorrow evening, Tuesday evening, in rooms 228 and 230. It’s always extremely well attended; it’s a lively gathering. I know there will be opportunities throughout the day to meet with many of the industry leaders.", "I think the key thing, Mr. Speaker, for all of us here at the Legislature, is that together we can recognize the valuable contributions of our friends, our colleagues and our neighbours in the mining sector.

I’m proud to say that after becoming PC leader on May 9 of this year, one of the first things he did was to tour the Ring of Fire. We in the PC caucus hope to make the Ring of Fire mining project a reality, with mines coming into production and creating jobs in Ontario’s northwest. Patrick certainly sees the opportunity for Ontario and the importance of moving this generational project forward.", "Tomorrow, representatives from mining companies all across Ontario will be here in Toronto to bring their unique perspective to legislators.", "It is truly amazing how much mining has contributed to Ontario. It has provided thousands of jobs, contributed billions of dollars to our provincial economy, and provided the identities for some of our most recognizable cities and communities.", "Today, mining is getting safer, cleaner and more effective. New technologies continue to make Canada a world leader in mining. Here in Ontario, many former mines have been revisited and redeveloped for another generation.", "All told, it is estimated that mining contributes $10 billion per year to the Ontario economy and employs over a quarter of a million Ontarians in what is referred to as Ontario’s mining cluster. Mining is also the largest sector employer of aboriginal workers.", "When I was Minister of Northern Development and Mines, almost a decade and a half ago, the Fraser Institute Annual Survey of Mining Companies ranked Ontario the number one mining jurisdiction in the world. I don’t mind pointing that out. Today, we sit at 23, so obviously I say to the minister, the Liberal government has a lot of work to do to get us back to number one. I wish you well with that because I wish we were number one again in mining. It would be great for the economy.", "At this time, I’d like to also highlight the work of the Ontario Mining Association, in particular the So You Think You Know Mining annual contest for high school students. It’s a tremendous initiative that helps educate a new generation on the opportunities presented in the mining sector. Open to high school students across the province, these annual awards reward creative videos that tell the positive story of mining in Ontario. I look forward, Mr. Speaker, to the 2016 awards in June.", "We in the PC caucus appreciate the value that mining provides. Whether it’s through getting electricity rates under control or improving the process of approvals and permitting, we believe more can be done to champion our mining sector. Ontario has a rich history, and again, I look forward to—along with, I’m sure, all members of the Legislature—making Ontario the number one mining jurisdiction in the world again.", "In closing, I look forward to the 37th annual mining day tomorrow, and meeting with the Ontario Mining Association." ],

Mining plays such an important role in our economy. It fuels cities and drives employment. As many of you know, as MPP for Algoma–Manitoulin and also critic for northern development and mines for the NDP, so many of my constituents—of our constituents—across this province we represent, so many of our families I know and so many of the workers in our communities work in the mining industry and resource development. I look forward to meeting with many of you at your reception, and over the coming months and years as we work together. I encourage all of my colleagues here at the Legislature to welcome the many delegations that will be going through our offices, and also to come by and enjoy the evening.", "While the mining industry makes enormous contributions in many sectors in our society, we often hear about the struggles they are facing. Year after year, we hear of your struggles of inadequate infrastructure, lack of framework and high energy costs, making it difficult to operate in this province. With the government’s plan to sell off Hydro One, I have no doubt that the mining industry is concerned for what this will mean for the future investment, operations, processing and manufacturing opportunities.", "After a lack of action on the Ring of Fire and countless other mining projects in our province, and a vague announcement of creating a development corporation, this Liberal government gave itself a deadline of 60 days to create that corporation, which was to include partners in industry and in First Nations. What the government produced in order to meet its self-imposed deadline was a board comprised of five government bureaucrats sitting at a table all by themselves. I really haven’t seen anything else coming forward from this corporation.", "On a more positive note, New Democrats are encouraged that the government is accepting the recommendations of the mining health and safety review. We, alongside the United Steelworkers and the group Mining Inquiry Needs Everyone’s Support, have been front and centre in calling for major changes to how mines in Ontario are regulated and made safe. Changes that will improve safety in the mines are welcome. There have been 11 deaths since 2007; another seven last year. Last week, the death of Richard Pigeau at the Glencore Nickel Rim was a stark reminder that toughened rules that may prevent injuries and deaths in the future are badly needed and long, long overdue.", "This government has failed to bring industry together. They have failed to bring First Nations together. The facts speak for themselves. Industry is unable to continue working under these conditions. Some have left, taking good jobs with them elsewhere. Other companies are fighting our own government in our court system.", "When it comes to First Nations, the minister claims they reached a historic agreement with the chiefs of the Matawa tribal council that lays the groundwork for future discussions.

I think what makes it most important is that it will ensure that Ontarians are represented fairly in this Legislature, and what could be more important than that?", "If passed, the Electoral Boundaries Act would create 15 new ridings in southern Ontario. This adjustment would be aligning with the federal electoral boundaries for southern Ontario that were put in place last year. We saw, in the most recent federal election, that they were indeed part of the new electoral reality. Increasing the number of ridings in these areas will ensure that this Legislature can better reflect the interests of those wonderfully diverse and very much flourishing regions of the province. So in that sense, those 15 extra ridings represent very much representation by population and how important it is. It’s a core democratic principle. Certainly, that’s the case.", "We also need to ensure—and we feel very strongly about this, and I think there’s agreement on all sides of the House—that there needs to be appropriate political representation in all parts of the province, and that obviously very much includes my part of the province: northern Ontario. Effective representation for northern Ontario would be maintained by retaining 11 seats in the north. This is something that all of us in the Legislature take seriously. Particularly those of us from the north may recall that, as redistribution took place the last couple of times, the number of seats was diminishing. We made a decision as the government to retain 11 seats, in the last piece of legislation, all across northern Ontario—again, something that’s very, very important. That’s why, again, us being able to retain the 11 seats in northern Ontario is very important.", "I’m one of the members who has the great honour and privilege of representing a large northern riding: Thunder Bay–Superior North. I think that geographically it’s only the fourth-largest riding in the province. Certainly as someone who is absolutely so grateful to have the opportunity to represent my constituents, I know, very much, what it’s like to have a riding where you are frequently travelling 200 kilometres or 300 kilometres to go to an event and returning the same day for that reason. I’m very grateful that the Attorney General, who has put this legislation together, and our government continues to support maintaining these 11 ridings—unlike the federal boundaries, which means that there are only 10 federal ridings.", "With the exception of retaining these 11 seats in the north, which, again, I am very pleased that we are putting in this legislation, the boundaries here reflect very much those set out by the Federal Electoral Boundaries Commission, which was done after extremely extensive consultations. I know it’s the case that all parties in this Legislature have stated that they will be supporting this bill during second reading.", "I will, actually, if I may, use some quotes that were offered to us in second reading by a number of the members. The member from London West stated: “New Democrats support the changes that are proposed in this bill. We are fully supportive of ensuring that people who live in northern Ontario continue to have a strong voice in the provincial Legislature.”", "Also during second reading debate, the member for Lanark–Frontenac–Lennox and Addington stated: “We’re in favour of the bill. We’re in favour; that’s what it was all about. We’ve said very clearly that we’re in favour of changing the riding boundaries. I haven’t heard anybody opposed to it, and I’m sure I won’t.”", "Let me reference one other, if I may, Mr. Speaker. The member from Bramalea–Gore–Malton stated: “I think it’s important to note that this is a good step forward and something that’s necessary. The federal government moved on this, and naturally we needed to address this issue as well, so I’m happy to see the government doing this. This is not a controversial issue, so this is something, certainly, we support and will be supporting once it comes to the vote.”", "What I’d like to submit is that, with all-party support for second reading, I think it is time that we move forward with Bill 115 and bring it before a committee. Certainly, we want to continue to move forward with some very important legislation here in the Ontario Legislature.", "In June of 2014, the voters in the province sent a very clear message. They certainly made it clear they wanted our government to get on with the business of governing in their best interests. Certainly, in terms of this bill, there has been considerable debate on this bill and the ideas that have been brought forward in this bill. We have heard a wide range of viewpoints, opinions and perspectives, so I think it’s fair to say that I believe it’s time that we do end second reading and refer the bill to committee.", "Clearly, committee is an important part of that process, Mr. Speaker. I think we all agree on that. This is where stakeholders will have the opportunity to present their views. We will be able to hear directly from the public, related to their thoughts on this particular legislation. May I say also, in committee, as the members of this House know well, they will have an opportunity to move amendments to the bill.", "At the same time, I think that will allow us to move to substantive debate on other matters that are before the Legislature. There truly are a number of important pieces of legislation that have been already introduced which the government would very much like to debate in the House and move through the legislative process. I think, later this afternoon, we are going to be bringing forward the debate on Bill 122, the Mental Health Statute Law Amendment Act; I believe that will be our next order of business. Other pieces of legislation that we want to move forward with: Bill 109, the Employment and Labour Statute Law Amendment Act; Bill 132, the Sexual Violence and Harassment Action Plan Act; and Bill 135, the Energy Statute Law Amendment Act.", "We really would like to spend some time to debate some of the other important pieces of legislation currently before the House, but the fact is, Mr. Speaker, we cannot do that until Bill 115, the legislation related to electoral boundaries, is dealt with. Again, I certainly sit here as a member who is very strongly supportive of this legislation and am very pleased that, again, it really does reflect the needs of this province, particularly from a northern Ontario perspective, considering the challenges that those of us who are fortunate enough to represent northern ridings work with on a daily basis, and look forward to that.", "I urge all members in this House to support this motion and help pass this bill as soon as possible." ],

In my office, my assistant Jena prepared and did a lot of research on some parliamentary traditions.", "I’d like to read a document that was prepared by the parliamentary library, The Opposition in a Parliamentary System. It says this:", "“Parliament, after all, is fundamentally about debate—‘rhetoric’ in the classical Greek sense—and the transacting of the people’s business in public. It is also about the right to dissent in a civilized manner. Genuine political opposition is a necessary attribute of democracy, tolerance, and trust in the ability of citizens to resolve differences by peaceful means. The existence of an opposition, without which politics ceases and administration takes over, is indispensable to the functioning of parliamentary political systems. If these systems are perceived as not working well—as being ‘seriously overloaded,’ to quote a distinguished Canadian opposition leader, the Hon. Robert Stanfield—it may be the rights of political oppositions which are immediately and most visibly at stake, but ultimately the threat is to democratic rights and freedom generally. The following paper is an attempt to come to grips with the” changing and “challenging nature of the opposition’s role in Parliament, specifically in the Canadian context.” I’ll go into more detail about this document pulled from the parliamentary library.", "But Mr. Speaker, yet again, here we are debating another time allocation motion under the Liberal government. We keep seeing these time allocation motions in this House. The ministers are taking turns to stand and insist that there is a pressing need to cut off debate and move the legislation of the day forward with all urgency. The truth is, this is either a case of the government wanting to stifle debate in this House or it’s a case of poor planning on the government’s part.", "Given that this government has been in power for well over a decade, there’s no excuse to be introducing legislation like this without enough time for full debate. The bill we’re talking about today, Bill 115, sets out to mirror the federal boundaries that were established in 2011. This didn’t happen a few months ago; in fact, I think it happened about five years ago. If the Liberal government had a deadline in mind for when this legislation needed to be passed, they should have made it a priority and brought it forward in a timely way. That is the responsibility of government. Poor planning is not an excuse to distort the legislative process by pushing through overdue bills with these time allocation motions.", "I want to be clear, and I know the members on the opposite side understand this: The Ontario PC caucus supports this bill, because the people of this province deserve to be fairly represented. We’re speaking in the strongest terms against the excessive use of time allocation motions for the same reason. This government loves to say how great it is to consult and have conversations with everyone about everything, right up until it’s public debate in this House. Conversation behind closed doors does not make for an open and transparent government. The democratic process is about having unfettered debate in this very chamber, with every elected member of provincial Parliament having the opportunity to speak on behalf of the people who sent them here.", "Bill 115 upholds the democratic principle of fair representation by reflecting the population shifts of the province of Ontario so that each elected member here represents an equal constituency as they work on behalf of the people of Ontario. That work should not be tempered by the allocation of debate time, which leads to only a token few members from each party weighing in on particular legislation—in this case, Bill 115.", "In this case, again, we are in favour of this bill. We have said very clearly that we are in favour of changing the riding boundaries to more or less mirror the changes made at the federal level. I don’t think anyone is opposed to this, because it makes a lot of sense; it will make it easier for our constituents, who have to navigate three levels of government. But we do have further suggestions and recommendations that the government could contemplate and consider incorporating in these statutes that they are visiting and revising.", "We don’t often get perfect bills coming through this House. Debating bills, even ones that enjoy support from all parties here, is an invaluable part of the process, because it provides the opportunity to sharpen and polish a particular piece of legislation. When everyone has the opportunity to speak to a bill, we can get a better perspective on the bill and a better appreciation of its actual implications. There is valuable insight that comes from the debate we have here, but taking this “parent knows best” approach and not even bothering to hear what members in this House have to say is not conducive to good governance.", "The work done in committee is, of course, critical as well, and it is unfortunately another casualty of this government’s agenda. This government is prone to limiting the amount of time a bill will be in committee. We don’t generally see more than a few days of hearings and clause-by-clause, and then the bill is back here for a couple of hours of debate at third reading.", "When you remove scrutiny from this process, Mr. Speaker, you end up with shoddy legislation. When you end up with shoddy legislation, valuable time and resources are used up down the road, trying to go back to resolve the problems you have created.", "This government is not demonstrating respect for our parliamentary system. The people of this province who elected opposition members still expect that their voices will be heard. They have every right to expect that, but this government seems ready to write them off. In this system, the majority Liberal government can bring forward and pass whatever legislation they please. They have made it abundantly clear that they don’t need to consider amendments put forward by the official opposition or the third party. When they start cutting off debate left, right and centre, they are basically saying that they intend to govern as if they have absolute rule of this province.", "Mr. Speaker, there is a form of government where political authority is monopolized by a person or political entity that utilitizes various mechanisms to ensure that the entity’s power remains strong. But that isn’t democracy. Yet that is the impression this government is beginning to leave with the people who sent all of us here as MPPs. They give us time for a few token members to speak, and then they shut down debate. These time allocation motions are a way to facilitate this government’s aversion to working with the other parties.", "This government has become the most closed in the history of the province of Ontario. Even Dalton McGuinty, when he got elected with a bigger majority than we see today, didn’t shut down debate like this Premier’s government. There was some respect for the role of the opposition and the value of co-operation. The goal of this government to continue to talk about openness and transparency is truly amazing, when it is clear that avoiding openness and transparency is the Liberals’ number one priority.", "When it comes to passing legislation, they cut off debate. In question period, it is all about not answering questions, whether it is about why they paid millions of dollars to teachers’ unions or what kind of twisted math they are using to get to the conclusion that selling off Hydro One makes any kind of sense for the hard-working taxpayers in the province of Ontario.", "In a democracy, you can’t just say whatever you want to get elected and throw it all out the door when you get into office. This Premier promised the people of this province openness and transparency. Mr. Speaker, it’s what she owes them. Yet we see closed doors, police investigations, debates cut short, committees that are open to very limited public input and no financial statements to justify how millions in taxpayer dollars were spent.", "Accountability is eroding under this Premier. The watchdogs of this province are ignored and have found that they can’t trust this Liberal government. Our Financial Accountability Officer had a report leaked just last week and found that the government was not forthcoming with information he needed for his report. In fact, he said the government refused to show him its calculations and the financial effect of selling Hydro One.", "Beyond that, our Auditor General has been subject to demeaning comments from a minister of this government. This government has also asked for more wiggle room when it comes to what constitutes a partisan government advertisement. I could go on and on and on with examples.", "I ask the members on the other side of this House: Are you okay with this? Are you fine with being associated with a government that operates this way? A recent article characterized this government by saying that some of their recent actions suggest that “the Liberals have lost any hint of rectitude when it comes to the handling of public money—though they did do their best to hide the transaction.” I’ll repeat that: “they did do their best to hide the transaction.”", "What part of this is in the best interests of the people of this province? It’s actually extremely ironic that we’re discussing a time allocation motion for a bill that we support because it is about fair representation. We want the electoral boundaries of this province to better reflect the principle that every vote is equal and every vote counts. When we have variances in population, riding by riding, of up to 100,000 people, the value of a single vote can change pretty dramatically.", "The ability of a single vote to influence the result in a riding of 50,000 is much greater than a vote in a riding with 150,000 people. After election time, the time and resources of a member will be spread much more thinly in a riding with 150,000 people. Unfortunately, it’s becoming apparent that if you voted for someone who isn’t in this Premier’s government, the likelihood that your elected representative will be able to speak on your behalf in the Legislature is greatly diminished as well.", "I believe it was the Attorney General, if memory serves me correctly, who supported this bill with the comment that it is to address inadequacies in our representation. I would say that another inadequacy in representation would be the repeated use of these time allocation motions.", "I would also like to say that if the government really and truly had convictions and was committed to improving representation, I think we would be discussing changes to third-party advertising and spending in elections. I would think that the government would be making that a real priority, given the uncomfortable questions they are having to answer these days about how many millions of dollars they were given by entities that got millions out of the public purse for unspecified expenses.", "Bill 115 is essentially a copy-and-paste job of the federal legislation, with a few variances in northern Ontario. They want to think about doing something similar for third-party advertising. I thank the Attorney General for bringing it forward, but it is a small part of what needs to be done in the greater scheme of things.", "Again, we support this bill because the people of this province deserve to be fairly represented. We’re speaking in the strongest terms against these time allocation motions for the same reason. This is the second week in a row that I’m speaking to a time allocation motion, and I know a number of members are doing the same. I hope that the streak doesn’t get extended. If this government continues to escalate their usage of the motions, I’m not sure what the role of opposition at Queen’s Park will be.", "I have an amendment to add. I move that the motion be amended by striking out everything following the second paragraph up to and including, “Monday, November 30, 2015,” and replacing it with the following:", "“That the committee be authorized to meet on Wednesday, November 25, 2015, from 9 a.m. to 12 noon and from 1 p.m. to 6 p.m. in Ottawa; and on Thursday, November 26, 2015, from 9 a.m. to 12 noon and from 1 p.m. until 6 p.m. in Thunder Bay, for the purpose of public hearings on the bill;", "“That the Clerk of the Committee, in consultation with the committee Chair, be authorized to arrange the following with regard to Bill 115:", "“Notice of public hearings on the Ontario parliamentary channel, the Legislative Assembly’s website and Canada NewsWire; and", "“That the deadline for requests to appear be 12 noon on Friday, November 13, 2015; and", "“That following the deadline, the Clerk of the Committee provide the members of the committee with a list of requests to appear; and", "“That a member from all three recognized parties prioritize and return the list by 6 p.m. on Friday, November 13, 2015; and", "“That the Clerk of the Committee schedule witnesses from these prioritized lists; and", "“That each witness will receive up to 15 minutes for their presentation, followed by nine minutes for questions from committee members; and", "“That the deadline for written submissions be 6 p.m. on Thursday, November 26, 2015; and", "“That the deadline for filing amendments to the bill with the Clerk of the Committee shall be 12 noon on Friday, November 27, 2015; and", "“That the committee be authorized to meet on Monday, November 30, 2015, at its regularly scheduled time for the purpose of clause-by-clause consideration of the bill.", "“On Monday, November 13, 2015, at 5 p.m., those amendments which have not yet been moved shall be deemed to have been moved, and the Chair of the committee shall interrupt the proceedings and shall, without further debate or amendment, put every question necessary to dispose of all remaining sections of the bill and any amendments thereto. At this time, the Chair shall allow one 20-minute waiting period, pursuant to standing order 129(a); and", "“That the committee shall report the bill to the House no later than Wednesday, December 2, 2015.”", "I’ll send this to the Clerks’ table with the page.

  "text" : [ "Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Imagine that: We’re time-allocating a bill that is going to deal with a riding redistribution that doesn’t take effect until two and a half years from now. What’s the government in a hurry about in passing this bill through the House? Why is it having to do this by way of time allocation?", "I’m sure if there was an opportunity for having public hearings around the province—and that’s what this motion is trying to do. It’s trying to allow some public hearings to happen outside of Toronto. Normally, the way that would be done is that, in the intersession, there would be some time allocated for hearings and then the subcommittee would decide with a motion in committee where it is they’re going to travel to around the province to deal with this issue. Because there are issues with this particular bill that members want to speak to, but, more importantly, that the public wants to speak to in regard to which parts of which ridings should be changed, which community should be part of what riding etc.", "There’s a number of other issues that would need to be dealt with, and it would be in keeping for this bill to do some travelling. But how do you do that when a government brings forward a bill to do riding redistribution and then says, “We have to have time allocation because—darn—it’s so important to pass this bill before the House rises before Christmas”—that the world is going to come to an end, even though the ridings are not going to be affected until the next election.", "You’ve got two and a half years till the next election. Why is the government in such a rush to pass this bill? One can only conclude that it’s because they’re getting used to doing everything by time allocation motion. The member just previous spoke to that and said that, more and more, we see governments relying on the rules of time allocation, more so than ever before. What’s now happening is that the government’s not even in the mode of having a discussion with the opposition parties to say, “What bills do you support? Which ones would you be prepared to allow to happen at a natural sort of evolution of a couple of days of debate and then into committee for some public hearings? What bills do you have strong objections on?”—and allow those bills with strong objections to have a little bit more time in the House, to have some fuller debate and to allow some public hearings to happen. You can’t even have those discussions because the government, quite frankly, is doing most of everything by time allocation.", "I’ll say what I’ve said here before, and that other members have repeated in this House. If the government thinks it’s clever in bringing forward time allocation as some sort of grand strategy for moving their agenda forward, let me remind them of one fact: They won a majority government in the last election. They’re going to win every vote in this House, so in the end, you’re going to get your agenda. It’s a question of how quickly you are going to get the agenda.", "I will argue that, at this point, from what I can see on the order paper, the vast majority of what’s on the order paper the opposition parties would have not have a problem giving to the government, in some sort of a quick method, to allow some public hearings, because the public may have some issues with some of these bills. But we, in no way, shape or form, as an opposition, would be party to filibustering those bills if we had some sort of an agreement with the government to say, “Okay, here are the one or two bills that we’re more interested in and that we think the public needs to have more time to consider and some more time in committee. So let’s make a deal to allow that to happen in exchange for those bills that have less opposition to move more quickly through the process.”", "Now, that’s not to say there wouldn’t be committee hearings. I will argue that a bill should always go to committee. It should always have an opportunity to give the public some debate. I think there are very few cases where you don’t need to do that. For example, sending a bill to Committee of the Whole was not the exception in this place at one time; it was the norm. But even at that time there was an opportunity for public hearings. It just referred itself back to Committee of the Whole for amendments, rather than doing clause-by-clause in committee. But that’s a whole other debate.", "The point is this. If the government House leader and the Premier’s office were to come to the conclusion that, “You know what? The opposition has a role in the House, as does the government,” the government proposes legislation, and we in the opposition then look at that legislation, and we either support it or we oppose it, based on what the bill is. As I said, as we look at the order paper, which is pretty thin gruel, by the way—there’s not a lot on this order paper, considering that this is a majority government—most of what’s on the order paper could be supported by the opposition in exchange for some hearings on some of the bills.", "On this particular bill, in regard to the issue of changing electoral boundaries to resemble the federal boundaries that we just went through in the last federal election, yeah, I think there is some debate that needs to be had, and I think the public would like to have their say. The member kind of touched on it in his comments: It is an opportunity to have a little bit of a discussion about our democracy and whether our democracy works and what, quite frankly, can be changed to make it better.", "I’ll just give you this one reality: A number of us here—actually, a number of those who happen to be around me today in the House—represent northern ridings. As a result of redistribution, the percentage of seats in this House for northern Ontario will go down, because the seats in the rest of the province are going up. We’re going to be up to 122—" ],

The problem we have in the north is that we in the north—and I will argue the same for rural Ontario—become less and less a percentage of this House. As a result, the make-up of the House is that the urban centres—I think specifically of Toronto and Ottawa, being the two biggest ones—end up becoming pretty predominant in the House.", "Now, I’m not arguing for one second that Toronto shouldn’t have more seats; obviously they have to.

It’s a huge part of the province. My riding alone, Timmins–James Bay, is larger than France. Vive la patrie, I say.

When I was first elected in 1990, bills used to travel for at least two weeks. There was hardly a bill that didn’t go into committee in either the summer or winter intersession and travel around the province for two weeks. The committee would get together and they would say, “Okay, where are we going?” If there was a bill like this, I would argue that a bill like this probably would have got two weeks of hearings. It probably would have travelled to three, maybe four places in northern Ontario—maybe three, maybe four, depending on the committee membership and the demand—and the rest of the time travelled throughout the rest of Ontario, except for Toronto, because you would do your committee hearings here in Toronto when the House was sitting.

We’re responsible for the day-to-day, everything from forest allocation—how many times in our constituencies do we deal with forestry companies that are having difficulty, especially the smaller ones, the independent family ones, to be able to deal with having access to the forest? They don’t deal with that federally; we deal with that provincially. Dealing with health issues, education issues, the Family Responsibility Office—you name it. There are all kinds of it. If you had hearings, you’d have an opportunity to at least speak to those particular issues as a constituent in northern Ontario or a constituent anywhere else in the province.", "The other thing that I think you need to take a look at is that it would allow us to deal with a couple of other really fundamental issues and something that I’ve long felt, and that is the issue of First Nations. Look around this House. Is there anybody who’s a First Nations member in this House? No, not one, and I’m not blaming the government. I’m not blaming the opposition. It’s just a fact of our electoral system. Our electoral system makes it that in fact there’s very little in the way of representation of First Nations in this House. So I argue: Why don’t we, in the hearings—if you had hearings across Ontario to look at representation and size of ridings, why couldn’t we have a discussion about what we need to do with boundaries in order to encourage First Nations members to be elected to this Legislature? Who better to respond to First Nations issues than somebody from the First Nations community, somebody who has walked the walk and talked the talk, who gets what it’s all about? But it’s hard to do in this current electoral system.", "If you look at the New Zealand model, which is quite interesting—mind you, they’re a PR model—they’ve actually put into their structure through the constitution a mechanism by which First Nations communities are represented by way of their own membership in their federal Legislature. It’s not a bad concept, and I think it’s something that we need to look at.", "Now, it’s hard to do, and I’m the first to accept that it would take some pretty heavy lifting to be able to deal with this issue, but, God, we have to start the conversation somewhere. I listen to Premier Wynne saying she wants to have a conversation with Ontarians. How about a conversation with First Nations about how they’re able to find a way to increase their representation in the—", "Interjections." ],

You may not fix it through this bill; I’m the first to admit that some of these issues are outside the scope of this bill to a degree. But sometimes we utilize committees in order to start these discussions, so that we can try to figure out how to address this in such a way so that the legacy we leave our children is not the legacy that we inherited. That’s all we’re doing here: We’re just passing on from one Parliament to another the same problems by not dealing with it.", "So, when the member moves his amendment and says he wants the bill to travel, take it for what it is. There’s a genuine need in a democracy for the public to be heard. Governments and legislatures should never be afraid to hear what the public has to say, even when what they say may not be very nice towards the politician or the political party that’s proposing the change of whatever it might be.", "Most of you around here who have been lucky enough to be re-elected are here because you did some listening, right? I look at my friend the Minister of Northern Development and Mines across the way. I’m sure you’ve had people come to your constituency office mad as heck. What do you do? You hear what they have to say. You listen. That’s what it’s all about, and hopefully you take some action. Even if you don’t take action and you try, they say, “Well, at least I was heard, and he tried.” It should be the same with committee. It should be the concept of, the public has the right to say; the public has a right to participate in our democratic process.", "A wonderful thing about the British parliamentary system—how did they get this system right? It’s always a source of fascination for me, because, you have to remember, this system was built out of a monarchy that, at the time, had all of the power. You go back and look at some of the biggest tyrants or kings in the history of Britain, and they just did it on their own and didn’t listen to anybody, until some people decided, “Ah, we want to give our Parliament some real teeth.” They developed this parliamentary system that allows the public to have their say. One of the things that they invented is brilliant, when you think about it. They said, “We will travel our Parliaments around the country, so that people have a right to present to the legislators what it is that they’re preoccupied with.” It’s pretty smart, when you think about it. How did that all happen? It happened because there was a recognition by parliamentarians some years ago that the public has to be part of a democracy. The public has to be part of a parliamentary system. The way that you do that is by way of committee.", "Now, I will argue strongly that committee should not just be about having hearings in Toronto. Toronto is a wonderful city. I think we’re probably one of the luckiest countries in the world because Toronto is probably one of the best cities in the world, as far as a place to live and as far as what the city has to offer, its diversity, and just overall as a city. But this is a large province, and this province is a great place as well. We need to listen to the people in other parts of the province who also want to have their say when it comes to legislation, such as amending legislation having to do with boundaries. So I say again, because I know a couple of members—I’ve probably gone on far longer than I should have, but I wanted to make the point that the parliamentary process should be that we actually do have travel on committee, and that we do, in fact, allow people to have their say outside of this place and into the communities of Ontario.", "The last point I will make, and I’ll repeat what I said at the very beginning: Why is the government time-allocating a bill that deals with boundaries and that is not going to take effect until two and a half years from now? Why was the government in such a hurry? What’s the point? What’s the winning side of that one and what’s the logic? If anybody can tell me why it was so important that you had to time-allocate this bill by the month of November, please tell me. I’m just a lowly guy from Timmins; I don’t know a heck of a lot. I’m sure there’s somebody in the Premier’s office who’s going to explain this to me. There are two and a half years to the next election. The government could have gone out on the road in the intersession, which would have been February or January sometime, heard some people, heard what they had to say, taken the good ideas, amended their legislation and then gone forward.", "With that, Mr. Speaker, I look forward to hearing what the government has to say." ],

We’ve only ever shared those same boundaries, and I think it’s a good thing, from that perspective, that the people of our riding are not confused. They know we both represent exactly the same geographic area, the exact same municipalities and the exact same people on every issue that we both take to our respective Parliaments.", "Some people, of course, may be unhappy with being moved into a different district, and that may happen. In our case, Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound is not going to change, so that’s not a challenge, but certainly in lots of other parts of the province, that will happen. If someone has been part of a riding for a lot of time, and they happen to get moved because of a change of a map or an electoral boundary, I can understand that and appreciate that. But I think, at the end of the day, we have to always be about fairness and equal representation and democracy.", "I will say, and probably most people out there will agree that it certainly isn’t generally something that the public is excited or fond about—seeing more representatives added to Queen’s Park or to the federal Parliament—but at the end of the day, that is what democracy is. We need to be able to ensure we have the size of a constituent base that we actually can represent effectively. If we become out of touch or they become too large, then that’s not a good thing. Certainly, if we have a disparity of size of the people we’re representing, that’s not necessarily fairness either. So I think it’s good to ensure that we do that.", "I like most parts of Bill 115 and am in agreement with most of the changes proposed to the Election Finances Act and the Legislative Assembly Act, as well as the Representation Act. Namely, I support streamlining our electoral districts with our federal counterparts, as I’ve already talked about, as it will be less confusing and ensures that people really do understand.", "I’m sure you, Mr. Speaker, in your esteemed career here, have gone to the door where people still think you’re the federal member, or they think an issue that’s provincial is federal, or vice versa. I think the more that we can do to make sure that those are as simple and as consistent as possible, the better off we are for the benefit of the electorate, so that they understand even more.", "I support organizing by district so that each of us has about 100,000 constituents. Allowing constituents to get better service from their elected official is a fair approach. In Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound, I currently serve about 106,000 residents. There’s going to be a bit of a buffer on either side of that, but I think, generally, the intent of the expanded boundaries is to ensure that we all have relatively the same number of people. Certainly the size and geography is going to change. I have a relatively large riding compared to many in urban Ontario, certainly nothing like the member from Timmins–James Bay. But, at the end of day, I think what we want to do is make sure we have the same amount of people that we can represent.", "My riding of Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound, as I said, will stay the same.

It contains parts of Bruce and Grey counties; the Saugeen number 29 reserve; the Chippewas of Nawash Unceded First Nation; aboriginal reserve number 27; Fathom Five National Marine Park—again, a huge draw to the people and something that is well known across the world.

After all, we have to always ensure that what we’re doing here is representing their interests and their wishes. As such, I think this is where the Attorney General has failed.", "The Attorney General said in her leadoff debate on Bill 115 that she was fixing third-party advertising rules. She said, “Finally, we will tackle the issue of third-party advertising. Ontario currently has rules in place to ensure transparency and free speech in our election campaigns. Third-party advertising rules were introduced in Ontario for the first time in 2007. Currently, third parties that spend $500 or more on election advertising are required to register with the Chief Electoral Officer. They must also report to the Chief Electoral Officer on election advertising expenses. If election advertising expenses are $5,000 or more, these reports must be audited.”", "She went on to say, “[We are] committed to strengthening the province’s rules around election-related third-party advertising.” In the end, however, she forgot to write it into the legislation, or just chose to trivialize it. Either way, it’s offensive. In fact, under her rules, speaking out and voicing concerns during election time will continue to cost millions, ensuring that just those with the deepest pockets have their voice heard; in my estimation, Mr. Speaker, unduly influencing the outcome and usurping fairness and democracy, which we all stand for.", "We made it clear to this government that we expected meaningful changes. They had at least two bills from our side of the House to utilize, and thus ensure that free speech remains free in Ontario. Just last month, on October 8, I argued for these changes during debate on my private member’s bill. My proposal was that we cap third-party advertising at $150,000 per election cycle or $3,000 per riding, to reflect the federal rules and caps in other provinces, and reflect what a political candidate is currently able to spend. That is fair. Considering this, I’ve got to tell you that there’s nothing more discouraging than seeing this government skirt on oversight and accountability, and again limit debate. It is just unprecedented how much they do this.", "We’re debating this as part of a time allocation motion. It’s more appropriately called a gag motion, which is even more insulting.

Just last week the Financial Accountability Officer’s report put a stop to their spin and proved what we have been saying all along on the Ontario Hydro One fire sale: It’s a bad deal for Ontarians, it will put each one of us in a worse financial situation, and the fact that the Liberal government is ignoring—" ],

I want to remind them that Bills 101 and 96 merely reflected what Ontario’s Chief Electoral Officer, Greg Essensa, identified as one of his top priorities: making elections fairer by capping third-party advertising.

The current governing party, the Liberals, by time-allocating motions, are trying to usurp that process. They’re trying to take advantage. They’re trying to steamroll their agenda that hasn’t necessarily been given to them by the electorate.", "At the end of the day, I want to see that this bill goes through. I want to ensure that the electoral boundaries are certainly representative and fair and democratic. At this point I’ll end, so that my colleague from Elgin–Middlesex–London can have his say." ],

  "text" : [ "Speaker, I will start by saying that the amendment to the motion which was brought by the member from Lambton–Kent–Middlesex makes sense. He says there are two and half years left before we will need this piece of legislation. All we have to do is travel this bill. This is a very small ask. It is a bill that I think everybody should have an opportunity to be heard on.", "I will speak on behalf of people in my riding, but I would much rather that people from here get an opportunity to listen to them directly. For the people of Nickel Belt to come down to Toronto—I’m sorry, Speaker—is tough. It is expensive; it takes a lot of time. So rather than getting everybody interested in participating in the democratic process, they feel shut out, they feel disrespected and they feel as if what they have to say doesn’t matter; nobody wants to hear them because nobody is coming. The amendment corrects that. The amendment says, “Let’s go around the province and see if people have something to say about this bill.” There is no rush whatsoever as to getting it through; we have two and a half years. I’m not saying that we take two and a half years, but how about we take two and a half months and travel around? The outcome is going to be a more robust democracy, an opportunity for people to be heard. That doesn’t mean they’re going to get what they wish for, but at least it means that we give them an opportunity to be heard.", "One of the people who wants to be heard is the chief of the Wahnapitae First Nation, which I would love to say is in my riding, but it is not in my riding, because, for reasons unknown, they decided to put it in the Timiskaming–Cochrane riding. It makes no sense. Wahnapitae First Nation is on the shore of Lake Wanapitei, which is within the city of Greater Sudbury’s boundaries. Wahnapitae First Nation is just a teeny-weeny, little First Nation. It’s just one mile square. This is where Wahnapitae First Nation is. Mind you, they have huge ancestral territories all the way around, but their First Nation itself is one mile square. They border Lake Wanapitei.", "If you’ve ever been to Lake Wanapitei, it’s just a beautiful, beautiful lake. Some of the southwest shore of the lake has natural beaches. Every year, new sands get pushed by the ice and by the flow of the water. We also have the sandbanks on the north shore of Lake Wanapitei, very close to Wahnapitae First Nation. There is the North River that is full of fish. It is a very nice area.", "The people who live on Lake Wanapitei are all part of my riding. They are part of the riding of Nickel Belt. I support them, and they support me, and we work together. When it comes to the Wahnapitae First Nation, this one kilometre square, for reasons unknown, somebody decided that those people were going to be part of part of Timiskaming–Cochrane. To put that in perspective, Speaker, there’s about 20 kilometres max between Wahnapitae First Nation and my constituency office, and they go to Capreol, which is also in my riding, for their mail, for their groceries, for everything they need. They are part of the community of Capreol. But for voting purposes, at the federal level, they are part of Nickel Belt and they vote with Nickel Belt. At the provincial level, they are part of Timiskaming–Cochrane. On a good day, when the traffic is not too bad, when the construction is not too bad, when the weather is not too bad and the plowing has done what it is supposed to do, it will take you at least six or six and a half hours to go there and back. They could come to my constituency office in 15 minutes, or they could go to John’s constituency office, there and back, in six hours. That makes no sense. It has to be changed.", "In the bill we have in front of us, they’re not changing the boundaries for the northern ridings; they’re only changing the boundaries for the southern ridings. I know that some changes were done in 2005, but, again, the situation has been going on for some time. The situation has been like this since 1996, Speaker. It will be 20 years pretty soon. There have been bills that have come through this House, and there have been changes to riding boundaries during that period of time, but Wahnapitae was always forgotten.", "Wahnapitae First Nation, not that long ago—maybe 30 years ago—consisted of two people: Mr. and Madame Recollet, who stayed there. But now they have grown. They are a really, really nice, strong community. They have beautiful homes on the side of the lake. There are more and more people whose ancestry is with the Wahnapitae First Nation who want to move back onto the First Nation. They have a top-notch environmental consultant. Most of the descendants of the Recollets have university degrees, a lot of them in the environment.", "Anyways, it’s a thriving First Nations community. There are more and more people living there, and still nobody wants to hear what they have to say. Nobody wants to listen to what I can only consider an error that was made, because somebody wrote someplace that the riding of Nickel Belt will end at that particular junction on the northern boundary of the city of Greater Sudbury. But the boundaries of the city, of course, do not include the First Nation. The First Nation stands on its own, so you have this boundary with that little one-kilometre square taken out, and somebody who has never set foot in northern Ontario decided that this little square was going to be part of Timiskaming–Cochrane." ],

We’ve done time allocation motions on Bill 112, the Strengthening Consumer Protection and Electricity System Oversight Act; Bill 113, the Police Record Checks Reform Act; Bill 37, the Invasive Species Act—which, by the way, took over two years to pass; Bill 52, the Protection of Public Participation Act; and Bill 66, the Great Lakes Protection Act.", "Essentially, when the government does these time allocation motions, it shuts down debate in the House, when there are numerous members in the opposition who are representing their electorate, who are elected to bring their thoughts and views to this party, no matter—I know the Minister of Northern Development and Mines brought forth that we all agree with this, so we should just move on. I think having these open debates actually brings up some ideas that maybe this government didn’t hear, because basically, they just took the federal government’s bill, copied and pasted it, rejigged the north and brought it forth as a bill. I’ve mentioned, in my debate on the bill previously, that they could have done some meaningful electoral reform at the time, either recall legislation or third-party advertising, which we think is in desperate need on this side of the House.", "However, the member from Lambton–Kent–Middlesex brought forward an amendment to this motion. He brought forth this amendment because we know the government is going to use their majority and vote through this time allocation motion. Since they don’t really want to have an open debate and talk with us, the member from Lambton–Kent–Middlesex brought forward an amendment saying that maybe we can compromise, that you’re going to put through this time allocation motion but maybe we can take the committee out and tour Ontario and hear what people have to say from around the province. He has put out that he wants to have the committee go to Ottawa and Thunder Bay to help cover the north. I’m assuming Toronto is being used to cover the south; however, I know quite a few people in the London area who probably do not want to drive all the way through Toronto traffic to come downtown, if they find a parking spot and if they’re able to get a time to actually speak in committee, because that time is going to be shortened. Not everybody from the public who wants to speak on this bill can speak. So, apparently, the Toronto area still isn’t going to be covering southwestern Ontario. I’m sure that’s part of the compromise as well.", "We will be covering the Ottawa area, and Thunder Bay, I guess, is going to cover the entirety of northern Ontario. As the member from Timmins–James Bay has noted, that’s not really covering the entire area as it should be.", "If the government is going to use its majority and time-allocate everything that it wants to get through, even though, as the member from Nickel Belt did say, we still have two years and six months until the next election—we have plenty of time to make the changes to the electoral boundaries; there’s not a rush. We would have time to tour. I would think the government would at least listen to our amendment on our side of the House and let us have committee travel to Ottawa and Thunder Bay to hear the considerations of those that are being affected throughout this province.", "As I said, my area of Elgin–Middlesex–London is being affected slightly. I’m losing a little bit of south London. I’m still retaining the Lambeth are and the newer development heading into southern London, which I’m quite proud to continue to represent, but my area of the White Oaks Mall area will be going to the member from London–Fanshawe. She will be getting those constituents into her riding. Maybe those people wanted to have a discussion about what that change means to them. Maybe they’re happy with being included with the Lambeth area and the area between St. Thomas and London, the Glanworth area, definitely.", "As I said, I’m speaking quickly on this amendment, and I hope the government listens. It’s a compromise. It’s kind of our olive branch out there. We realize you’re going to use your majority and time-allocate basically every legislation because you don’t believe in true debate in this House. At least they can listen to us and let committee go out and hear the people of Ontario before we go further.", "I’m just quickly wrapping up for the party. I appreciate that we were actually given this time to debate. As I said, I was going to focus on the time allocation motion but I thought that with this amendment coming forward, we have an opportunity. There are a few cabinet ministers here who can talk about this at the cabinet meeting or a pre-meeting they may have. I know the backbenchers are silenced; they don’t have a voice in this government. The backbenchers sit there quietly and don’t say anything. However, I hope the government listens to what we have to say." ],

This will be our last chance to say this before the hearings, which are going to be very short. Even with the amendment proposed by the Tories—if it passes—they’re still going to be very short. This is a case, in the Wahnapitae First Nation, where the residents agree and both MPPs agree. Actually, the riding boundary change would simply, in this case, match the federal riding boundary. That’s an issue I hope the government is listening to, that we are really trying to actually make government responsive to the Wahnapitae First Nation. It’s not an earth-shattering issue for most of the province, but for the Wahnapitae First Nation it would make a big difference.", "Regarding time allocation, the way it’s supposed to work for those people—the way I used to understand government is, people who were elected would have the ability to speak for a certain time, and when no further members of the House wanted to speak, the debate would die a natural death, as happened on Thursday afternoon with Bill 85. Everyone had spoken, the bill collapsed, and we voted on it this morning—a fairly innocuous procedure. What was funny was, after Bill 85 collapsed—I’m the whip for the party—I was in the whip’s office, and the first thing we got was a notice of time allocation for this bill. So although the process can work, this government chooses not to follow the process, which is really odd, specifically with a bill where you’re talking about electoral boundaries across the province.", "This time allocation motion, coupled with the Conservative amendment, gives a couple of more meeting dates. But let’s look at what the government proposed: one afternoon in Toronto to discuss all the riding boundaries and all the electoral concerns from people across the province. Really? I think Chief Ted Roque is committed enough that we could try to get him on that agenda, but for a lot of people it’s impractical—no, the word is “impossible”—to actually participate in this process. It doesn’t have to be done tomorrow. It’s not like a health issue. No one is going to die if we don’t get this law in before December. We’re talking about our democratic process, which is something very important, and we’re talking about issues that are going across the province.", "An issue that I think this government should take heed of—although I’ve heard the Premier say several times that we are one Ontario, we are not: There is a huge divide between rural and northern Ontario and urban Ontario, specifically the GTA. Instead of taking our differences and making us stronger—because there’s nothing wrong with having differences. That’s what could make our culture, our province, very strong. We have to acknowledge those differences. An example of how a government talks about, “We are one Ontario,” but actually in its actions takes a totally different take—because we’re talking about changing the electoral process across the province, yet one afternoon in Toronto, folks, should be enough for everyone in rural Ontario to express their concerns, which is what is obviously a rural-urban divide.", "People in rural Ontario and northern Ontario are concerned. They don’t begrudge having more seats in the urban part of the province because there are more people. The urban part is growing. No one in rural Ontario begrudges that, but rural Ontario wants to know that they will be represented in this new system where their proportion is less. We in rural and northern Ontario are really nervous about that because, specifically, of an example like this: “We’re going to change the boundaries. We’ll keep the same seats in northern Ontario, and everything’s going to be fine, but we’re going to have one afternoon of meetings in Toronto,” the centre of the universe for Ontario.", "Why do you think people in rural Ontario are nervous? If they had seen, “We’re going to hold hearings where there’s enough interest,” as my colleague from Timmins–James Bay suggested, and if they advertised, “The committee is about to sit on this bill, and if a lot of people express interest from Wahnapitae or from Peawanuck or from”—and they would work something out so that these people could actually express their concerns, and perhaps the government could make better legislation because they had input from the public. But that’s not what this government has chosen to do. It has chosen to fast-track legislation which doesn’t need to be fast-tracked. It’s chosen to time-allocate, to stop people from talking about legislation that isn’t time sensitive but that is regionally sensitive. It’s very sensitive, and the government has chosen—it isn’t by happenstance, this isn’t by accident—to ignore northern Ontario. It has chosen to ignore rural Ontario. There is a huge rural-urban divide. It’s created by this government and perpetuated by this government, and it needs to stop. That is why this time allocation motion is absolutely disastrous for the province." ],

Some of the most fundamental rights are enshrined in our charter of rights, and that’s what this bill is all about. In this bill, the government is taking action to comply with the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal, which declared that part of the Mental Health Act is in breach of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Court of Appeal gave the government until December 23 of this year to make amendments to the Mental Health Act that comply with the court’s decision. Specifically, Speaker, the court struck down the provision of the act that allows a person to be detained in a psychiatric facility for longer than six months. This was because the Mental Health Act did not provide for a regular review of the conditions of the patient’s continued detention to ensure it would be the least restrictive within the circumstances that required that detention.", "Bill 122 is designed to address the concerns that the court expressed. The amendments would enhance the ability of the Consent and Capacity Board to make certain orders in relation to patients who have been in a psychiatric facility as involuntary patients for longer than six months. A factor that the board would have to take into account would be, of course, that any limitation on a patient’s liberty be the least restrictive commensurate with the circumstances requiring the patient’s involuntary detention. The board would make a decision based on the evidence before it. Basically, what I’m saying here is that this bill would allow us to make sure, and allow the board to make sure, that they would find the appropriate level of care for those folks who are facing these circumstances.", "The amendments would make it possible to detain a patient on a new form, a certificate of continuation, after the expiry of the patient’s third certificate of renewal; that is, after six months and two weeks. A certificate of continuation will allow a patient who has been detained in a psychiatric hospital longer than six months to be detained for an additional three-month period, similar to the current certificates under the Mental Health Act. Subsequent certificates of continuation would allow a patient to be detained for further three-month periods if the patient continued to meet the test for being involuntarily detained under the act. To ensure that long-term involuntary patients are not detained in a manner greater than is necessary to meet the important objectives of the Mental Health Act—that is, ensuring community safety and helping patients get the treatment they need—the Consent and Capacity Board would also be given the power to make a limited range of additional orders, in specific circumstances, when it reviews a long-term involuntary patient’s certificate of continuation. These would be things such as transferring a patient to another psychiatric facility if the patient does not object; placing a patient on leave of absence on the advice of a physician; directing the officer in charge to provide different security levels or different privileges within or outside the psychiatric facility, etc.", "Basically, Speaker, what we’re doing here today is making sure that we continue to provide the appropriate level of care to people with these mental health conditions, but also making sure that we’re abiding by the court’s ruling and respecting our charter of rights, which is fundamental to why we’re here in this Legislature." ],

One of the therapeutic areas that I worked in was mental health. During the time that I worked in Europe, I had the privilege to work with many thought leaders in the area of psychiatry and mental health, and all of them agreed on the importance of the de-stigmatization of mental health issues and on the early diagnosis of mental health illness and challenges. We know that one in five Ontarians will experience a mental health illness in their lifetime. That’s why our government created the comprehensive mental health and addictions strategy: to support Ontarians from childhood to old age with mental health and addiction issues, to provide the early detection of mental health issues and provide the appropriate course of action.", "Since 2003, funding for mental health and addiction services has increased by over $506 million, to a total of $1 billion. Our government’s plan is to increase funding by $220 million over three years as we renew our commitment to our mental health and addictions strategy. In November of last year, our government announced phase 2 of our expansion of Ontario’s mental health and addictions strategy, which will address better access, quality and value by focusing on five strategic goals that will help our system. It is aligned with our government’s Poverty Reduction Strategy. This phase, phase 2, will provide $138 million over the next three years to community agencies. This is great news for organizations such as Madison Community Services in my riding of Davenport, which promotes the independence, health, recovery and community integration of people with mental health or addiction challenges. Madison Community Services does this great work through advocacy, education, and the provision of a broad range of community-based and housing support services.", "Mr. Speaker, when I met with the many mental health and illness thought leaders while working in Europe, one of the important things they would often raise is the reintegration of these patients with mental health and addiction issues back into their communities and back to contributing to society. So I’m pleased that our government also sees this as an important issue and that it will be investing $16 million over the next three years and work with the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing to create 1,000 new supportive housing units. Our plan will improve access to services, reduce wait times, and fill the gaps in our system.", "So many Ontarians have been touched by mental health and addiction challenges in some way. Having worked in this therapeutic area for a number of years and having worked with top psychiatrists all across Europe, I am proud of the work our government is doing to improve the quality of life for people experiencing mental health and addictions, proud of the changes being made by this bill to ensure that our patients are getting the right care at the right time at the right place, and I’m proud to have stood up in this House today to support this bill." ],

  "text" : [ "Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I am very pleased to add my voice to the debate on Bill 122. I think that this bill brings the proper balance between patients’ rights and the public interest, trying to ensure access to treatment when the patients need it. The measures would be commensurate to the situation that these patients are in, giving at the same time more tools to the Consent and Capacity Board.", "As you have heard already, Mr. Speaker, we are taking action to comply with the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal, which declared that part of the Mental Health Act is in breach of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Court of Appeal gave us until December 23 of this year to make amendments to the Mental Health Act that complied with the court’s decision. More specifically, the court struck down the provision of the act that allows a person to be detained in a psychiatric facility for longer than six months. This was because the Mental Health Act did not provide for a regular review of the conditions of a patient’s detention to ensure that it would be the least restrictive within the circumstances that required this detention. The amendments would make it possible to detain a patient under a new form called a certificate of continuation after the expiry of the patient’s third certificate of renewal; that is, after six months and two weeks. A certificate of continuation would allow a patient who has been detained in a psychiatric hospital for longer than six months to be detained for an additional three-month period, similar to the current certificates under the Mental Health Act.", "To ensure that long-term involuntary patients are not detained in a manner that is greater than necessary—because this is really the intent—to meet the important objectives of the Mental Health Act, the Consent and Capacity Board would be given the power to make a limited range of additional orders, in specific circumstances, when it reviews a long-term involuntary patient’s certificate of continuation. These orders would be, for example:", "—transferring a patient to another psychiatric facility if the patient does not object;", "—placing a patient on a leave of absence on the advice of a physician;", "—directing the officer in charge to provide different security levels or different privileges within or outside the psychiatric facility;", "—directing the officer in charge to provide supervised or unsupervised access to the community; and", "—directing the officer in charge to provide vocational, interpretation and/or rehabilitative services.", "Similar to the current regime in the Mental Health Act, the long-term involuntary patient would be entitled to request a review of his or her involuntary status after each certificate of continuation is issued. There would be a mandatory review of the patient’s involuntary status when the first certificate of continuation is issued at six months and two weeks, and every year thereafter. The long-term involuntary patient would also be able to apply for an additional order at any time they seek a review of the renewal of their certification, where they have not applied in the last 12 months or where the Consent and Capacity Board is satisfied that there has been a material change in circumstances.", "As we’ve heard, so many Ontarians have been touched by mental health and addictions in some way. As a government, we are committed to supporting the most appropriate care for people who are experiencing mental health and addiction challenges, and we need to comply with the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal within a limited time.", "So I would urge all members to support the proposed amendments because they aim at improving the lives of the most vulnerable Ontarians, the ones who need our help the most. This would allow them to have more flexibility. It would really balance, as I said at the beginning, the patient’s rights with the public interest, so I hope that everyone in this House will be supporting these amendments." ],

Our concern on this side of the House, as I mentioned earlier in my debate—and it’s something that we need to discuss further when this bill reaches committee level—is the fact that they’re making changes to the Consent and Capacity Board, the members who actually make up the committee. There have been concerns from a group of psychiatrists that I’ve been corresponding with. The fact is that the change to the Consent and Capacity Board has nothing to do with the court case and why changes had to be made to this bill. It’s unfortunate that the government has snuck this change into this bill when there are other substantive issues with the Mental Health Act that probably could be addressed.", "Perhaps it would have been the opportunity to bring that change which they want to bring forward in an all-encompassing change to this bill. It’s been close to 15 years since the Mental Health Act has been modified or changed to fit the needs of Ontarians today. We would think that it would be positive if the government could bring forth a bill that does encompass the changes to the Mental Health Act to ensure that it’s up to date. At that time, it would have been the appropriate time to bring the changes to the Consent and Capacity Board that they’re proposing today.", "I’ve also been in contact with a group of psychiatrists who said the hospital psychiatrists weren’t even consulted on the changes to this legislation. It’s unfortunate. The government had a year to make the necessary changes to this bill, and unfortunately, it’s being rushed near the end. Maybe something held them up somewhere along the line; however, they had eight or nine months before they proposed this bill to actually sit down and consult with hospital psychiatrists who deal with the treatment of patients with mental illness day in and day out. Unfortunately, that didn’t occur. Hopefully, during committee we’ll have the time to meet with those people." ],

They will follow through and they will get that treatment.", "To do the copy and paste into the health care system looked like an easy way to comply with what the court had to say, but on the ground, this is not going to work, because on the ground there aren’t the resources within the institutional mental health system, or any part of the mental health system for that matter, to be able to comply with what the courts impose. In this instance, it will be what the Consent and Capacity Board will impose.", "We have such a unit in Sudbury. Some of the people who have been held there have been held there for 50 years. That’s a long time. The people there are the best psychiatric nurses I have ever met. They deal with people who are very sick; they are severely mentally sick. On a good day, they are just really sick; the rest of the time, they are really, really sick. They need the support of those highly skilled nurses to be able to cope with their disease. That the Consent and Capacity Board would be able to say to somebody who is not able to go outside unsupervised without two nurses, “From now on you will be allowed”—it’s to ask the health care system to do something that there aren’t the resources to do. The people there do the best they can with the resources we give them. Without a huge influx of money, this will look good on paper and will fail our community." ],

I see this timeline as a bit of a problem, in my view; so much for any semblance of any citizen participation or consultation. I just heard about this a few weeks ago. In fact, this Legislature wasn’t informed about this until September 23 of this fall, and here we have a deadline of December 23.", "I also get the impression that this legislation has been dropped on us as a fait accompli. The judge has decided, obviously, a year ago; the government has decided—no one in this chamber is a psychiatrist. The Minister of Health is not a psychiatrist. I haven’t received any phone calls about this or emails alerting me to this required change, certainly not from the general public and not from the media. I assume this government sent out news releases about this legislation. I really can’t find anything in the media about this. Maybe they didn’t send out news releases.", "As far as my riding—it’s 100,000 or 110,000 people—we do not have a resident psychiatrist. We may have a private practice; I’m not sure. It’s certainly not for a lack of trying over the last 30 years.

But we still have 80 psychiatric facilities in the province of Ontario. Again, I question the deinstitutionalization.", "When government is not on top of these issues, when we find out just a few weeks ago something they knew last December with this court order, it’s obviously been a low priority for most of the past year. I know that there has been other pressing business in this Legislature. We spent I’m not sure how many hours debating save the whales. That was important for some people.

Given their influence on public opinion on government policy with respect to human rights and psychiatric institutionalization, I feel it’s incumbent on government to also communicate.", "Nellie Bly wrote a piece that became a book. She wrote it in 1887, and it was titled Ten Days in a Mad-House. It chronicled her undercover journey through Blackwell’s Island in New York City. What she did, as a journalist, was feign insanity, and she was committed, and found out that sometimes it’s harder to get out than it is to get in. That’s what we’re talking about today, 100 years later. That had a big influence at the time.

This was made into a film in 1975. I feel that people don’t know what goes on in our psychiatric institutions. My worry is that they may think that they know. Many of us, of a certain age, will certainly remember that Jack Nicholson film that was made from the Ken Kesey book. People will have another image of our psychiatric institutions once they see the film that’s going to come out in 10 days, the story of Nellie Bly.", "So here we are debating Ontario’s Mental Health Act. We know that a person can be detained involuntarily in a psychiatric facility—as was the case back in the 1830s—in this case, for an initial two-week period, an additional month on first renewal of the involuntary admission and an additional two months on a second renewal and an additional three months, and it goes on. Nellie Bly was only incarcerated for 10 days. She was able to get out again in 10 days, thanks to a lawyer.", "Under the current Mental Health Act, unamended, a patient is entitled to a review of their involuntary status after the certificate of admission, the first one, and after each certificate of renewal is issued. After an involuntary patient has been in the hospital for more than six and a half months, and every year thereafter, there is a mandatory review of the involuntary status of the particular patient. This is held before what’s referred to as the CCB, the Consent and Capacity Board. There are some amendments being made to this board, and I don’t know whether—the judge didn’t call for that. I don’t know whether that’s necessary or not, but we do know the purpose of the bill is to come into compliance with an Ontario Court of Appeal decision.", "Currently, the Mental Health Act allows for repeated renewals of a patient’s involuntary status. There appears to be no mechanism for civilly detained patients. These aren’t ones like Jack Nicholson in the film, who was transferred from a correctional facility. In fact, he volunteered—he was up on gambling charges and, I’m not sure, assault—to go to the mental institution rather than a correctional institution. In the end, it cost him his life, if you remember the end of the film. But there’s no mechanism here for civilly detained patients to challenge the conditions of their treatment.", "In order to provide a bit of background, involuntary patients are detained in psychiatric facilities because they have a mental illness or there’s a risk of harming themselves or harming other people; there are other criteria for involuntary committal. The long-term patients are those who have been detained for more than six months. The majority of the people who are detained longer than six months, by and large, suffer a number of ailments: mood disorders, depression, bipolar, manic depression, or psychotic disorders like schizophrenia or psychogeriatric disorders, and it comprises something like 330 long-term and voluntary psychiatric patients. That’s held over our heads if we don’t pass this. There’s the spectre of 330 patients arriving on the street, and many would be suicidal. That puts pressure on us. I think that puts pressure on this government. Perhaps it puts pressure on that judge who set a one-year deadline, knowing this government doesn’t do anything in a hurry.", "According to today’s Mental Health Act, a physician may examine a person and determine whether or not they meet the criteria for an application for an assessment. An assessment is effective for seven days. This is the form 1 we’ve heard about during debate. That’s the form that gives any person the authority to take a person to a psychiatric facility. Again, the person, as attending physician at the facility—it can’t be the same doctor, of course, who issued the form 1. They must examine a person within 72 hours, and then they can release them or admit them, either as voluntary or involuntary.", "Going back to that film with Jack Nicholson, I assume the main characters were all there involuntarily. Half of those characters were there voluntarily. They just became subject to the psychological influence of the head nurse and of the institution itself.", "We’ve got a bill that’s here to comply with a court order that indicated there was a breach of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It’s regrettable that the Court of Appeal ruled in December of last year that the deadline is December 23. We really don’t have much time on this one, Speaker. The court struck down the provision that a person is detained in a psychiatric facility for longer than six months. This was because the Mental Health Act did not provide for a regular review of the conditions of the patient’s continued detention. Again, this was mentioned: The purpose of this legislation is to ensure that it would be the least restrictive within the circumstances that required the detention in the first place.", "So since December of last year, this government knew we had to do something. They knew we had to bring changes to this act because the court ordered them to do so. We’ve really just begun debate on this piece of legislation.", "There are other amendments people have asked for with this legislation. Think of the Select Committee on Mental Health and Addictions. That was five years ago, something like August 2010. They asked for something like this, as I recall, five years ago. Here we are, we’ve got to go through second reading—this is Inside Baseball—committee, third reading and royal assent. All have to be done by December 22, because on December 23, we are told, the door swings open and 330 or so severely mentally ill people get out.", "The Legislature sits another four weeks. We don’t sit next week. That’s remembrance week. The calendar indicates that we rise on December 10. I see this as a really bad example—this is very poor planning.", "I think of the field in front of my house. We combine soybeans at the end of September, and within days—and this is called planning—we put in winter wheat, because you grow winter wheat, and it continues to grow through most of the winter.", "You have to plan ahead. In farming, industry, business and everyday life, you plan ahead. When you were told by a judge to bring in this legislation last December and you didn’t let anybody know about it until September of this year, I consider that poor planning. We’re not just dealing with grains of wheat or with soybeans; we’re dealing with people detained in psychiatric institutions involuntarily, people who have trouble speaking for themselves.", "The Select Committee on Mental Health: We should have been working on that for the past five years. I think that’s really quite regrettable. I just regret the fact that many of us didn’t know about this sooner to maybe push the envelope a bit. I don’t want to go through a lot of what has been said already in debate. Much of the debate seems to be essentially reading out parts of the legislation.", "When people are released—I think of, in my community, many people that I speak with who have schizophrenia. This is a good thing: They come in under the umbrella of our local Canadian Mental Health Association. Many of these people can’t live on their own. We also have outpatient counselling, which was referred to adult mental health services. My wife was a psychiatric social worker for a number of years with that agency. It is now merged with addiction services. Unfortunately they’re probably going to go out on strike. They’re looking for a 5% raise over the next two years.", "This kind of legislation does have an impact on all of us. It’s not something people phone us about, as I indicated. But we do have the Mental Health Act. It’s based on consent and substitute decision-making. The ticket in is a form 1. I am heartened, from a human rights perspective, that we have legislation that will provide people with more options for that ticket out, if it is justified.", "People have the right to retain a lawyer, to instruct a lawyer, and they have access to a telephone. People have access to a rights adviser to, again, let them know about any change in their legal status. They do have the right to challenge the doctors’ decision. As I say, access to a lawyer and legal aid—but as an involuntary patient, that means you’re not free to leave the hospital without permission. The Mental Health Act lays that out, the two reasons: where the person is a danger to themselves and other persons, or may unintentionally injure themselves; and secondly, where the person’s condition is deteriorating and they do require hospitalization.", "It’s very difficult to explain this to the general public.

Thanks to the member from Haldimand–Norfolk for some of his insights into this bill.", "The member from Nickel Belt, just before she spoke on the last round of two minutes, talked about how she didn’t think the government was actually going to be able to accomplish what they need to do with this bill. Although it’s a good thing to give more authority to the Consent and Capacity Board, the Liberal government is not giving them the funding to go along with that. They’re expanding their scope to add four or five more things that I’ll talk about more when I actually have my 20 minutes, but at the end of the day, when the courts order something, the funding goes with it. With the Consent and Capacity Board, even though they’re giving them more authority, even to order treatment for people who are incarcerated, they’re not giving them the funding to go along with it.", "In 2013-14, they were allocated $4.8 million, but they actually spent $6.4 million—a significant amount more—and the actuals showed $6.2 million. This year, in 2015-16, the government is once again allocating just the same amount of money. So even though the government is expanding the mandate for this board and its authority, how does the government actually expect the CCB to carry out this expanded authority if they’re not going to give them any funds to go along with it? So that, just to start, is problematic.", "With respect to this recommendation and only having nine months, well, in fact, one of the recommendations that came out of the select committee five years ago was to make sure that there were these treatments available to patients who were incarcerated in the psychiatric system." ],

The movie One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest changed a lot of attitudes about mental health. We can thank Hollywood for not too many things, but that’s one I think we can thank them for. I was pleased to hear that reference.", "Some of us who have been involved in mental health boards and mental health education committees locally for years have, I think it would be fair to say, always felt that governments of all levels have been moving far too slowly with respect to recognizing the stigma attached generically to mental health issues and, more pointedly, the folk who are nameless and faceless and in an involuntary kind of setting. Government has a responsibility to move to protect people from themselves, and if they’re a risk to others.", "I have a nephew—I should say had a nephew—who was schizophrenic. He didn’t get the services he wanted and committed suicide out in BC. It was very tragic. A number of us came together from that experience and formed a group in Hamilton some 20 years ago, which is still functioning, called the Friends of Schizophrenics. So a big part of this is education.", "Government moves slowly, too slowly at times, but at the same time, it moves slowly for a reason. Particularly on something as delicate as this, you want to get it right, because if you get it wrong, then you’re creating more problems than you started out with. I offer that up for what it’s worth." ],

The economic burden of mental illness in Canada is estimated to cost $51 billion a year, so in all of Canada, a billion dollars a week.

As you know, there is an immense amount of stigma attached to mental health. He did call upon the government to use this opportunity to open the Mental Health Act to actually act. It’s a burning issue in all of our ridings, and I think that we, as MPPs, have a responsibility to bring those voices here to this place.", "He touched on the issue of incarceration, and of course he used the movie One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest as a means to actually tell the story. I recall watching that movie, and it still has significant impact. I think that’s the power of art and the power of movies. But what also became very clear in that story was the power imbalance between the patient and the institution.", "I think that Bill 122 aims to try to address that power imbalance, because those who are actually on the other side of the door—usually a locked door, Mr. Speaker—usually have no power. They have no voice, they have no one to advocate for them and they are vulnerable. They are made vulnerable by their mental illness and by the sickness, whatever it may be, that affects them, but there are few people in society who actually have strong advocates.", "We have an opportunity today to actually accelerate this discussion—I think this was the message of the member from Haldimand–Norfolk—because that is needed in the province of Ontario. We have a lot of evidence to prove that there have been missed opportunities to address the issue of mental illness and mental well-being in the province of Ontario, and it’s not enough just to stand up in the House and say we can do more. We actually can do more. We have the opportunity to do so. That’s the privilege we hold as members of provincial Parliament." ],

Back in the late 1880s, when Nellie Bly’s report came out and later became a book, it was a bit of a scandal and she was back in there within a few weeks with a panel. In the short run, it cleaned up the place. Some people disappeared, and the psychiatrist apologized for diagnosing her as delusional and a hopeless case. She was a good actor, obviously.", "The New York City of the day allocated a tremendous amount of money to that institution as a result of—I guess it must have been—a real bombshell at the time. We’ll get to see this story in 10 days—anybody who wants to buy a theatre ticket. You can see the trailer for the film on the Internet. It looks like it’s exaggerated quite a bit—the cold showers and things like that—but that stuff used to go on in psychiatric institutions as well. I guess they had not invented lobotomy at that time.", "The same with Ken Kesey and the film Cuckoo’s Nest: I think many of us remember Nurse Ratched, “Big Nurse.” She was “remorseless.” She was described as “a social dominatrix, a steely ... controller of her environment.” When you’re in a situation like that, even the voluntary clients, or patients, didn’t know how to break free until Jack Nicholson did his thing and somebody got fired and some of them were able to sign themselves out." ],

  "text" : [ "It’s such a pleasure for me to actually be part of this debate today. For me, personally, this is probably one of the most important debates I’ve been part of in this House. It has been a long-standing issue, ever since I was first elected as a trustee in 2003. One of the first people who approached me was a mother of a young daughter who was struggling desperately with mental health issues. She was frustrated with the school system, Mr. Speaker.", "Now remember, this is 12 or 13 years ago. The system was not responsive to those needs. There was a level of compassion and there was a level of empathy, but there certainly was never an understanding of the pain the entire family and, indeed, the community would experience when those issues were not addressed with some level of dignity and with some level of compassion. I followed that mother’s journey through seven years before her daughter took her life. There were actually no words to describe it, except that mother turned into one of the strongest advocates I’ve ever met, and that is how she dealt with her grief. Every time we have the opportunity in this House to address the issue of mental illness, I believe we have a moral responsibility to bring the truth to bear.", "When I was president of the Ontario Public School Boards Association, I had the opportunity to chair the mental health coalition for the province. That brought teacher unions, public health, legal counsel and emergency personnel to the table to say, “How can we be part of the solution on mental health?” I think speaking truth gives youth great power. Youth were represented at that table through the Student Trustees’ Association, and they gave us a lesson that we will never forget. They said, “You must listen to us. If you don’t listen to us, you will lose us.” They were speaking on behalf of every student across the province of Ontario, and it was very powerful to have them at that table.", "The lesson that I learned was that it was such a unique perspective on mental health issues, and addiction was a huge component of that. To listen to the need to self-medicate with drugs was powerful, because it was that missing component, I think, back in 2008-09, where we didn’t have a full understanding of why youth were self-medicating. We didn’t have a full understanding of the issue of youth mental health issues. I think that this bill, by opening up the Mental Health Act—I think this is an opportunity we’re missing.", "I do acknowledge that we are here and we are debating this issue essentially because of a court order. In 2014, a ruling of the Court of Appeal found that some provisions relating to the long-term involuntary detention of mental health patients were inconsistent to the Charter, which related to involuntary patients being committed, with the result that committals of indefinite length are possible. While the Consent and Capacity Board is authorized to confirm or rescind the detention order and can transfer the patient to a different psychiatric facility, the Consent and Capacity Board does not currently have the authority to change the conditions of detention or the manner of treatment of long-term patients.", "Why I pulled this out of the act is that we in this House are elected to represent the comprehensive needs of our entire communities, but we have, I think, a significant duty and responsibility to represent those who have no voice, who live on the margins, who have no advocates. In this instance, there are 338 individuals who have been caught in this legislative gap, if you will. We have a responsibility to make sure that they are going to be dealt with in a humane way, with integrity and with dignity, that also finds the balance in protecting the public good. There are obviously some who have some serious concerns about those individuals coming out of institutions, not having due process and due diligence not being followed through, if you will.", "The fact that the courts have had to order this Legislature to deal with this, and that it has been on the order book now for now over a year, provides an opportunity for us to speak openly, and I think honestly, about the issue of mental health in the province of Ontario.", "These are not new issues. They are not new to the more experienced—I mean, I’ve only been here for three years, but who’s counting. This has been a long-standing issue. We now have a fuller understanding of the economic impact of not addressing the issue of mental health in our province. We have a broader and comprehensive understanding of not addressing mental health issues and the impact that they have on our health care system. And for the first time in a long time we have a very clear picture of the cost—the fiscal cost—of not addressing the issue on our justice system.", "I was very proud of our local paper, the Waterloo Region Record, which recently did an exposé, if you will, because there are inconsistencies across the province in how each community addresses mental health issues. A lot of that has to do with resources and with local leadership, but the provincial framework that was put in place back in 2010—it was an initial investment of $246 million. There was such hope when that money was released. It was a three-year pilot project rolled out to school boards so that mental health leads could take those school boards, pull them along—understanding, of course, that not every school board was in the same place. I think that the understanding at the time was that school boards in the north were dealing with very different issues, and we know that through the relocation of First Nation students from on-reserve to off-reserve to major municipal centres, that transition proved to be quite deadly. The transition teams around mental health and support were not there to help those students with the resiliency, and there was a cost. There was a human cost, and there was obviously an economic cost. I would argue, though, that the human cost is higher.", "In the Waterloo region, though, this exposé—this just came out, actually, October 23. It says, “Mental Health Crisis in Waterloo Region: ‘Let’s Get At This As A Community.’” It’s an acknowledgement that—and this has been a long time coming—one’s mental health in that family affects this family and their mental health; it impacts the workplace; it impacts the community as a whole. And so to finally have a clear picture, that 54 Waterloo region residents died by suicide last year, was a huge wake-up call to people, because you think of the lost potential. You think of the youth that are encapsulated in this 54 and how they took their own life, and that potential will never be realized.", "That’s a hard thing to measure, but it’s an important thing to think about when you’re trying to reallocate resources, when you’re making the case for resources around early intervention and prevention—because that’s where the smart investment is, and that’s where the compassionate investment is, as well. I commend our chief of police, Bryan Larkin, who’s in his first year in Waterloo region. He said that we’re going to have to get to this issue, because his police officers are spending a huge amount of time as they approach calls from, usually, centre downtown. He says that from 2011 to 2013, Waterloo region police responded to 4,516 calls about a mentally ill person and 3,520 calls about an attempted suicide, not a suicide death. On the whole, each one of those calls takes up to three hours. I would hazard a guess that those calls are basically just about crisis management and don’t get to the heart of the very issue.", "This entire debate, though, leads me to this excellent report: the Select Committee on Mental Health and Addictions. This was an all-party committee: The Chair was Kevin Flynn; Bas Balkissoon was there; France Gélinas; Helena Jaczek; Christine Elliott, who’s no longer here; Liz Sandals; Jeff Leal; Sylvia Jones; and Maria Van Bommel. They travelled across the province. They heard from 333 people. I can’t imagine the work that went into this, Mr. Speaker, and it is five years old—I will point that out.", "They say in their original report: “We began our investigation of mental health and addictions care in Ontario more than 18 months ago, when the select committee was created in February 2009.”", "We are calling for and are “convinced that a radical transformation of mental health and addictions care is necessary if Ontarians are to get the care they need and deserve.", "“From the parents sleeping by their front door to prevent their son from slipping out to buy drugs, to the daughter who dealt with more than 20 health care providers and social service agencies on her mother’s behalf, to the husband who was in the room when his wife committed suicide, we have listened to your stories. These were extremely difficult moments for families to share with the select committee.", "“There were uplifting moments as well”—which shows the power of intervention, which shows the power of resources being invested. “But it is fair to say that these positive stories” obviously “were in the minority. In general, Ontarians wait too long for treatment. Youth are caught in the gap between programs for children and adults, repeating their case histories to a series of unconnected service providers. First Nations people struggle with above-average rates of mental illness, addictions, and youth suicide owing in part to a history of poverty and the consequences of residential schooling. Francophones are misdiagnosed because they are not treated in their first language. Linguistic and cultural barriers may also affect newcomers and refugees. Seniors unnecessarily languish with depression, often undiagnosed, while society as a whole must face what has been called the coming tsunami of Alzheimer disease.”", "So here we have this report. We have evidence that there is a desperate need for action, and yet there seems to be—this court order came in over a year ago to deal with some of the most vulnerable people in the province of Ontario, who are institutionalized involuntarily and have no recourse whatsoever. They are voiceless. They are almost non-citizens in the province of Ontario. If we were to look at this instance in any other jurisdiction across the world, we would be writing Amnesty International to fight for their rights, Mr. Speaker. They have no voice; they have no recourse. You can’t argue; the courts already found this to be true.", "It is about priorities in the province of Ontario. It’s about being clear and honest about where this province wants to go with the mental health system, particularly those people who are incarcerated. This report, as it relates to those people who are incarcerated—and the evidence is pretty overwhelming that more and more of those with mental health issues, across the entire spectrum, from eating disorders to psychotic episodes, find themselves in our jails and our institutions. Those institutions are becoming more and more crowded, those conditions are becoming more and more unhealthy, and those institutions are therefore compounding the mental health issues in our community.", "It’s hard not to think of the select committee’s recommendations from five years ago, in that—this is recommendation 19, just for the record: “The Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services should direct police forces across the province to provide training for officers who may encounter people suffering from mental illnesses and addictions.”", "Mr. Speaker, we most recently heard of—actually, there are so many examples, but for the province of Ontario and the city of Toronto, the story of Sammy Yatim and the videotape that just came out last Monday. To their credit, every media news outlet gave us fair warning before we saw that. As the mother of a teenager, it was incredibly hard to watch. I can’t even imagine the pain that the mother would have to experience to watch her son in that condition, which was drug-induced, compounded by mental health issues that were long-standing, and yet one of the recommendations here asks correctional services and police forces to actually have training. That’s a reasonable and rational request by all members of every party in the province of Ontario, asking for the skills to be transferred, that knowledge transfer around dealing with mental health issues in extreme cases be part of the mandate of every police officer.", "This transfers over to the education system as well, because when I was part of the coalition for mental health—there is obviously a need and a desire for knowledge from teachers across the province to deal with how behaviour issues will be manifested in mental health issues and how best to diagnose, because you need a solid diagnosis. You need a clear assessment of a child’s learning disabilities and mental health issues before you can actually be true to that child and be true to that student and make sure they reach their potential. You need that assessment and, therefore, you need that training. This is not new information, Mr. Speaker.", "One other issue based on the select committee as it relates to Bill 122, the Mental Health Statute Law Amendment Act, is recommendation 20. The committee asked that a “core basket of mental health and addictions services should be available to the incarcerated population, and discharge plans for individuals with a mental illness or addiction should be expanded to include the services of a system navigator and appropriate community services.” So these are folks who are incarcerated, who are dealing with mental health issues, and they have no advocate on their side, as has already been determined by the court system as it relates to the Consent and Capacity Board.", "For me, one of the first things I did was tour a women’s federal prison and I spoke to the staff who are part of the jail system where Ashley Smith actually took her own life. If there was ever an example of the justice system gone wrong as it relates to mental health issues, we should always remember Ashley Smith in every debate that we have on mental health as it relates to incarceration, because that’s a young woman whom the system failed. It failed, and it’s hard not to imagine that of the 338 individuals whom this piece of legislation will directly affect as it relates to their rights, as it relates to the charter, there isn’t an Ashley Smith in that mix. The stats probably would be very supportive of that.", "So here we are. We have this opportunity to move this legislation very quickly. I see no reason actually for us to delay it. The court has ordered the changes, and yet this debate still continues on.", "For my part, I’m happy, though, to have the opportunity to raise the issue of mental health issues in the province of Ontario and draw attention to the fact that when you have individuals who are court-ordered as it relates to their direction as a patient and as a prisoner, those court orders have funds attached to them as it relates to when the consent and the capacity division makes a decision as it relates to patient care—there is no funding or resources attached to that. That’s a huge issue going forward, and it needs to be addressed through amendments to this piece of legislation and, at some point, before it gets too late, this government, which has a majority, which by all accounts supports the recommendations by the Select Committee on Mental Health and Addictions, which in the second session of the 39th Parliament endorsed this—this was a unanimous endorsement. To date, though, we have only endorsed half of one of the recommendations as it relates to pain medication. We can do more. That’s part of this debate, and I look forward to doing more." ],

There are great opportunities to partner in communities, as we’ve done in Ottawa with the school board, the city of Ottawa public health and the federal government, in some circumstances, to provide addictions counselling and treatment in schools, and some suicide prevention as well." ],

You could have a child, for example, with a threat of suicide, who will get to Pathstone for an initial assessment, but they will never get back for treatment for six, eight or 10 weeks. Parents are taking their kids from Niagara to Hamilton, to McMaster, because they hope that their child will be able to see a child psychiatrist there at the hospital and perhaps be admitted to one of the 10 beds that are available in the south end of Niagara, for their child who is cutting themselves, threatening suicide or attempting to hang themselves.", "I know Teresa Armstrong, the member from London–Fanshawe, brought forward Bill 95 a few months ago, which would see a committee of sorts, a panel set up with experts from the mental health field, all coming together and making sure that these 350 or 400 agencies for adults, and another 300 or 400 for children, all come under one umbrella, so that we make sure that the resources are equitably distributed where the greatest need is." ],

I know we’re talking about a very specific and narrow amendment to the Mental Health Act, but a number of MPPs have discussed today the importance of children’s and youth mental health. As the Minister for Children and Youth Services, I just want to talk a little bit about that, because we want our children and youth in the province to have all the support they need, and their families to have all the support they need when it comes to their mental health.", "We know that 750,000 more kids and their families are benefiting from quicker, easier access. There is more work to do, but more investments began to roll out in 2011, increasing to $93 million a year, part of the greater than $444 million a year we invest in children’s and youth mental health.", "I know it’s not just about investing the money. As members opposite say, it’s about coordinating the service. So what my ministry is in the process of doing is that we have named lead agencies for children and mental health across the province—33 in total, I believe. It’s not to replace existing service providers; it’s to coordinate services, so families can navigate better, so they can get the information they need, they can get the assessments they need. It’s also for those lead agencies to work with other partners, such as school boards, hospitals and community groups, to make sure that we’re doing the very best we can for children and youth in this province.", "We’ve helped hire 770 new mental health workers in Ontario for young people, and our Tele-Mental Health Service has provided over 4,800 psychiatric consults to children and youth in our rural and remote areas. That’s something I hear a lot, Speaker: Sometimes access is better in the urban areas, but we need to do more, and we are doing more to help children and youth throughout the province." ],

The minister referenced this. Kids Help Phone is one of those resources. One of the first things I did when I was chair of the mental health coalition was to write a letter of support for additional ministry funding, because the Kids Help Phone line is available across the entire province. No matter where you are, in the northernmost remote community, it’s a free line, and it’s a proven, researched, evidence-based resource for children and youth. It proved to be very successful. Those are the kinds of programs, Mr. Speaker, that we continue to need to be supportive.", "I also think that we do need to address the stigma attached to mental health. To that end, when my daughter was younger, eight or nine years old, she had early onset anxiety. We went to Mosaic family counselling and there was this amazing program called Setting Free the Butterflies. As soon as she walked into that room, with those other young children, and she saw that she wasn’t the only one that had this anxiety, it was like the weight of the world fell off her shoulder. So the smart money and the compassionate investment is on early intervention and the prevention and the focus on what mental well-being is. The school systems are definitely a part of that." ],

I think that no party or individual has a monopoly on compassion. We all have experienced mental illness, whether it’s ourselves, our families, our circle of friends, or, indeed, our constituents. I think we have all had people come to our constituency offices and share their stories of trying to navigate our mental health system, with advice on how to make the system work better. I think all of us have listened very carefully to those people. We have acted on that advice that we have heard, and our mental health and addictions strategy demonstrates our commitment to continuing to improve the services available to people.", "One of the things where we’ve made the greatest improvement when it comes to mental illness in this country in the past decade is the stigma-busting part. I don’t think a decade ago many people would have stood up in a place like this and talked about their personal experience with mental illness, but we’ve heard that today. Certainly, I have had within my family, definitely, encounters with mental illness. I’m pleased to say that people did get the care that they needed, and they are off again on that productive life where they can contribute, where they have the ability to contribute to the community and participate in the community.", "Whether it’s somebody like Michael Wilson standing up after his son committed suicide to talk about the importance of at least beginning the conversation—I heard Clara Hughes interviewed on CBC Radio this weekend with Shelagh Rogers. She talked about her experience with depression and mental illness. Those conversations have taken us a long way to recognizing that there is no family that is not touched by mental illness of some regard.", "What I did want to bring to this conversation is how our Poverty Reduction Strategy is actually addressing mental illness. Particularly I wanted to talk about our commitment that I announced last week, our commitment to end chronic homelessness over the next decade. We know we can do that in this province, Speaker, because across the province, we’ve seen municipalities partnering with community organizations and other partners, and actually, one by one, getting people housed, using primarily the Housing First philosophy, which really states that if you are homeless, it’s pretty hard to deal with the issues that you’re dealing with, whether it’s addiction, mental health or whatever the issue is, when you are not in a stable housing situation.", "So the Housing First philosophy has proven to be extraordinarily successful at getting people housed, first, and the supports they need to stay housed. We’re seeing remarkable success.", "I thought I would share one story from my community. A gentleman, Fred, had been homeless for 15 years. He had significant mental health and addiction challenges. For 15 years, he slept under bridges, in tents, in shelters sometimes. In the year prior to getting housed through London CAReS Housing First organization, he had been to the emergency department of the hospital, often by ambulance, 250 times; for two out of every three days, he was in the ER. He had over 400 encounters with the police; more than one a day, on average. In the year following his housing, he had no encounters with the police and had two visits to the emergency department. So, obviously, his quality of life was far greater, but the community was better off too, because those other resources—whether it was the ER, the police or the justice system—could be used in a way that we expect those resources to be used.", "We do know that with the right supports, a lot of people struggling with mental illness and addictions can get the treatment they need, can get stabilized, and can become contributing members of our community, which is, of course, what they want and what we all want as well. This particular bill does not deal with that, but I think we’re all giving ourselves licence to talk about some of the successes that we’re having and some of the challenges that still remain.", "Speaker, on that note, I will pass it over to my colleague the Minister of Community and Social Services." ],

Not only are they aligning with the charter as, in fact, the Court of Appeal has required that they do, but there are a number of efficiency measures in relation to the powers of the Consent and Capacity Board so that, in fact, that board will be able to make a limited range of additional orders in specific circumstances when it reviews a long-term, involuntary patient’s certificate of continuation. It will allow that other physicians—not just psychiatrists—and also nurse practitioners will be able to sit on the Consent and Capacity Board panels for less complex hearings. This will free up existing psychiatrist capacity for the more complex hearings anticipated by the amendments.", "As was mentioned here today by a member of the former Select Committee on Mental Health and Addictions, I think that we continue to see the work that we did on that select committee influence government policy. The President of the Treasury Board, the Deputy Premier, made reference to the fact that our 10-year mental health and addictions strategy has addressed what we heard in the over 300 hearings that our committee held—because we need to recognize that one in five Ontarians will experience a mental illness in their lifetime.", "Our strategy: The first three years did specifically address children with mental health issues, those suffering with addictions. But as we move forward into phase 2 of the comprehensive mental health strategy, we are looking at more community supports. In fact, our government has, overall, doubled the funding for mental health and addictions services in Ontario, so that it is now at a total of over $1 billion. In phase 2 of the comprehensive addiction strategy, some $138 million over three years will be going to community agencies to address better access, quality and value, so that, again, people have these supports if they move out of an institution and into the community.", "As the Minister of Community and Social Services, I do have the mandate to support and provide services to individuals with a dual diagnosis. I’m sure, Mr. Speaker, you know that these are individuals with a developmental disability who also suffer from mental health issues. Specifically, I need and continue to work with my colleagues to support these individuals. We have many great agencies doing wonderful work in the community and we need to make sure these sorts of supports and services are more generally available to individuals suffering with a dual diagnosis, specifically.", "I urge all members to support Bill 122.

I originally served on a committee on poverty reduction with the President of the Treasury Board, and I also served on the Select Committee on Mental Health and Addictions with my colleague the Minister of Community and Social Services, but on top of that, I had the privilege to serve on the Select Committee on Developmental Disabilities. I have to say to you, Mr. Speaker, that those were three committees that I served on where I gained a lot of knowledge of this particular issue.", "If I could say, this bill in front of us is responding to the Ontario Court of Appeal decision for those who are involuntarily detained for more than six months in one of our institutions. To understand why this bill is here and why it’s progressive, one probably has to go back about 40 or 50 or 60 years. I was astonished, when I served on the Select Committee on Mental Health. We had the opportunity to tour some of the institutions in Ontario at the time. Many decades ago, families used to actually commit their children to these institutions, never to return home. It was a permanent committal to these types of institutions because, back then, society did not know how to deal with mental health. They did not know how to deal with some of the issues surrounding behaviour. We have come a long way, as you can see. The courts have decided that if somebody is going to be committed to one of these places, you must have a regular review of that process—that that person is not capable of moving back into society and living a life like everyone else.", "The important thing here is that we have learned, over the last couple of decades, that there are varying forms of mental health issues. As we heard from the other speakers, one in five will suffer some form of mental health issue—depression, stress, behavioural patterns, etc.—as we go forward.", "This particular bill is in front of us because it was ordered by the court. It’s very technical in nature, if you read it, but it provides the board that is in the Mental Health Act, the Consent and Capacity Board, more opportunities to review someone who is involuntarily committed to an institution of psychiatric care or some other mental health care—that there is constant review, and the family or the individual or even the practitioners who are dealing with this particular person’s problem would have an opportunity to review their state and whether they belong in the right institution. The board will also have the opportunity to deal with transferring them to an institution of higher care or lower care, all at the same time.", "Mr. Speaker, I would say that if you look at how we treated those with mental health and addictions four or five decades ago, what we’re doing today is very progressive. I would say that our own government has come a long way in the last 10 years to make sure we are addressing the issues of mental health and addiction. In fact, the first phase of this government’s plan was to address children, especially in early identification of behavioural problems that would lead to serious mental health issues in the future. Mr. Speaker, I would say to you, based on the knowledge gained serving on these committees, that I’m proud to support this bill, because it’s one step better in the system, and I urge everyone to support it." ],

Certainly, the increased resources we are putting into the mental health system are really important.", "I’m glad to have a chance to speak about it, perhaps a little bit from the perspective of being a member from northern Ontario, where some of the challenges of providing those resources are somewhat more demanding. I know that is certainly well understood by many members of this Legislature. I also appreciate the comments made by my colleagues the President of the Treasury Board, the Minister of Community and Social Services and the member for Scarborough–Rouge River. I think the member for Scarborough–Rouge River is so right in saying that we are very much a different society now than we were 25 or 30 years ago, as well we should be.", "I am very proud of the work the select committee did. Again, I think that was a great example of all three parties in this Legislature working together with common cause and a real goal. I’m very proud of the comprehensive strategy that we’re bringing forward here, particularly as we move into phase 2. I think that’s going to be crucial.", "I’m also actually very excited—and I don’t mean this in a partisan way at all—but we now have had a federal election, and my federal colleague from Thunder Bay–Superior North, MP-elect—I guess she hasn’t been sworn in—is Patty Hajdu, H-A-J-D-U. She was a wonderful candidate. She’s been elected. She was the former executive director of Shelter House Thunder Bay, somebody who is focused very much on many of the issues that we’re actually discussing today. I’m very excited about working with her on these kinds of issues.", "From a northern Ontario perspective, we are grateful for the resources that are being added to the strategy, but there’s no question that there are larger issues that can very much relate to the geographic realities of being from northern Ontario. I live in the city of Thunder Bay, but I represent a much larger riding that includes 11 First Nations and many communities outside. Sometimes being able to provide those resources—I mean, I’m proud of the rather extraordinary work that’s done by organizations like the Children’s Centre and many other organizations in northwestern Ontario. I think we need to continue to understand that putting those resources in place is so crucial and important.", "The debate today is about an amendment—a very specific amendment—to the Mental Health Act, and it’s an important discussion. But again, I think that having the opportunity to at least stand here and express my support for the strategy that’s been put in place, eagerness to continue to work with the federal government on continuing to see more resources being put in place, and also to have a chance to speak about some of the challenges we have in northern Ontario is important to me and to my constituents.", "I will tell you that I have frequent discussions, actually as recently as yesterday, with one of the senior medical officials in Thunder Bay—a psychiatrist, in fact—who talked about the need to continue to try and find more resources for those particular kinds of positions that are more difficult to fill in northern Ontario, and how important they are.", "Ultimately, what it comes down to, is, I believe, again, the statistic is—and I think it’s an accurate one—that over the course of time, one in five people will be dealing with a mental health issue. It’s incredibly important that we find a way to not just find the resources to help them so we can work toward prevention, so we can work toward some of the solutions, but also to have the compassion and the kindness that we really need, I think, in order for all of us to be able to work together in a more caring fashion. Ultimately, I think that should be a goal for all of us in life. Certainly one of my goals as I age is to become a kinder human being simply because I think that the benefits are not just mine but there are many others as well. Regardless, I certainly am pleased to have had a chance to say a few words related to this important piece of legislation." ],

Certainly as an Ontario PC, I and my caucus colleagues recognize the devastating effects mental illness and the attached stigma have on the lives of thousands of Ontarians.", "To us, it’s about inclusion, about challenging people’s attitudes to mental health. As we’ve heard a lot about here today, stigma is one of those things that for many years kept this in the backrooms, kept it in the dark, and it’s great to see that people are willing to step out and actually acknowledge and be there to support. One of the things that I certainly talked about a fair bit last week in my discussion was a plea to everyone out there, that everyone can be involved. To the person who’s struggling and challenged, for them to feel comfortable to step out and ask for help: that’s one of the biggest things I think we can do. As a friend, a family member or just a colleague, maybe even a stranger, if someone actually extends that hand, to be prepared to say, “We’re here to help. We’ll do what we can”—just an ear to listen to those people who are struggling and challenged.", "Mental health, in my mind, is just as important as physical health, but for many years we have always looked at the physical because you can see it, you can feel it and you can understand it. Mental health is much more challenging to diagnose, to really understand and to even perceive if someone is struggling with that. So I think it’s important that we need to treat it as importantly and definitely move forward. It affects Ontarians of every age and demographic, and yet services, in my mind, remain inadequate. It’s good to see legislation coming forward so that we can do that, and definitely to be there for our most vulnerable.", "In my own backyard, Wes for Youth is a program started by Yolanda and Jamie Cameron which I have talked about here many, many times. It’s an honour and a legacy to their son who had committed suicide. Wes for Youth Online—it’s open to the world, really, to be able to be a resource. Certainly, Keystone Child, Youth and Family Services—Phil Dodd is the executive director—the Canadian Mental Health Association, and Victim Services are all agencies in my own backyard of Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound that provide those very critical services.

I still have people who come into my constituency office who are having problems with this situation and the funding is not there. You can increase the ability for people to look into these situations by a governing body, but if you cut the funding at the same time, it’s counterproductive.", "Mental illness has always required extra financing throughout the decades, and it always falls short. It’s one of the last social services that gets the funding required. Now, with the state of things in the world and our country and the increased stress in the world and more people facing financial difficulties, it becomes a bigger problem—a bigger problem that requires bigger funding. Hopefully, with the new federal government that’s in place, they may consider some transfer payments to help the health system in Ontario as well as many other things—housing and things like that, which also has an impact on mental health, as the deputy leader put out. She said that she had a guy who was taking up police resources in his community because of his illness, plus the hospitalization and things like that. Those are the types of situations that have to be addressed to alleviate some of our special-needs people from being counter-productive to the system, not through fault of their own, but for lack of attention. I’m hoping that as they look at this new jurisdiction level, they also would look at increasing funding for this thing that’s been an ongoing problem for decades." ],

The biggest point of this thing is why are we waiting until now to do this? It was a year ago that the court ordered this to be changed. So here we are; it’s the first week of November. Next week, we have a break in the Legislature for Remembrance Day. It doesn’t leave us a lot of time to get this bill through the House and done before, possibly, there could be many people turned out on the street and released from institutions, and maybe they shouldn’t be out on the street.", "It’s interesting that this has happened the way it has happened, the timing of this bill. I sometimes wonder if the government is spending so much time addressing their scandals that they haven’t had time enough to do stuff like this. I think that maybe that’s the problem here. They have had to manage all these scandals—they’ve had a number this year—and they haven’t had time to address important bills such as this, and that’s really too bad; it really is. Because we’re talking about people who—I have known a number of people who have committed suicide—have issues that need to be addressed. This is very important. Through no fault of their own they have had these issues—had some mental problems—and yet, the government has taken all this time to do it.", "I would suggest that the next time something important like this comes along, they take a harder look at things and maybe assign somebody to do this for them, because this really is silly, that it’s taken a year." ],

  "text" : [ "I am here today to speak in support of Bill 122, An Act to amend the Mental Health Act and the Health Care Consent Act, 1996.", "Every day, we here at Queen’s Park wake up, perhaps have a cup of coffee, maybe a bit of breakfast. Some may head to the gym or even out for a jog. Others may delve into the newspaper or respond to emails while they wait for their day to begin. We congregate here every morning and stand before our supporters and protesters, strong and seemingly undaunted.", "Now imagine, if you will, not being capable of doing this. Imagine waking up in the morning and being immediately apprehensive about just getting out of bed. Imagine having every possible scenario of what could go wrong in your day enter your mind in a flood of overwhelming and crippling emotion. Are terrorists going to storm the Legislature? Will we be bombed? Will there be another fire like there was in 1909? What about the commute over to the office? What if I get mugged on the subway?", "Then you begin to think of what could happen if you continued to stay in bed. Would the apartment catch fire? Could I be robbed? Are terrorists going to come to my dwelling? Will I be able to pay the rent this month if I don’t go to work? Will I lose my job if I don’t go to work?", "When and if you finally do get the courage to go outside, you begin to wonder: Is everyone looking at me? I don’t think that ticket booth person likes me. Which door should I go in? If I go in the west entrance, everyone could see me from their windows. The east entrance means a very long walk, with people staring at me inside, while I go to the west tower elevator. Should I take the elevator? What if it malfunctions and I get stuck in it?", "These thoughts seem completely irrational and unbelievable to some, but for someone with a mild anxiety disorder, this is just a regular day. The feelings felt in this example are real and were given to me by a constituent of mine who suffers from a very mild form of anxiety. I cannot imagine starting every day like this, much less having it last all day, every day, for a lifetime.", "Anxiety isn’t always something that is programmed into your brain when you are born. It can be brought on by media and world events, personal encounters, or even traumatic brain injuries. As a result of an aneurysm, a person from my riding suffers tremendously. Not only does she have physical pain and noticeable cognitive and physical impairments from her trauma but she also has anxiety. She spends most of her days protected behind the four walls of her home. Going into public makes her feel naked and vulnerable. She excitedly makes plans to meet with family members months in advance, and when the times comes to follow through with these plans, the excitement subsides and the debilitating fears consume her. Although they only live 30 minutes apart, she has not seen one of her sisters in over a year. She does not go shopping, attend family functions or visit with her daughter anymore like she used to. This woman was considered the lively, outgoing sibling in her family and now she has become a hermit who is limited by a hidden illness.", "The symptoms of anxiety and those of depression can sometimes be confused. When you suffer from anxiety, you feel that you struggle to do the things that most people do with relative ease every day. With depression, you may no longer be interested in participating in the things you were once capable of and enjoyed doing.", "When a person with depression reveals their illness, the question they dread hearing most is, “What are you depressed about?” This is where education of mental illness is so important. A person who suffers from clinical depression rarely, if ever, has a say in what they are depressed about. Depression is very different from normal sadness in that it totally consumes your day-to-day life. It interferes with your ability to work, study, eat, sleep and have fun. The feelings of helplessness, hopelessness and worthlessness are intense and unrelenting, with little, if any, relief. Some have compared depression to being in an overwhelming rut that is so deep, you feel you will never escape. The walls are tall, slick and closing in on you. Sadness is not always a symptom of depression. For some men in particular, anger, aggression and restlessness are common signs of depression. Some begin to engage in unusual or reckless behaviour, which may include excessive alcohol or drug abuse.", "A mental illness we recently hear about a lot, especially since the war in Afghanistan, is post-traumatic stress disorder or PTSD. Soldiers, police officers, firefighters and paramedics are who we generally think of when we think of persons who experience this kind of mental illness due to the dramatic things they have witnessed in their lifetime. But, really, any traumatic event can cause you to suffer from PTSD, as everyone copes differently with stress and traumatic events.", "Again, I will use examples from my own riding. A young man from one of our area school boards is a custodian on the night shift at a downtown Ottawa school. He stepped outside one spring evening to relax while on break from his shift. Moments later, he was attacked from behind, knocked to the ground, assaulted, had his wallet and cellphone stolen and his glasses broken.", "This gentleman was from a small town on the west side of Ottawa. Just being downtown working was a fairly new experience for him, much less being assaulted and robbed while he was at work. After all, training to be a custodian in a school system doesn’t exactly prepare you for the effects of being mugged. To go back to that school and surround himself with the same atmosphere and the possibility of it happening again was quite terrifying to him. He did return to work, but only for a few days.", "With the encouragement of his friend and a co-worker, he approached his supervisor about the fear he felt with coming back to this location. After being evaluated by a board doctor and being diagnosed with PTSD, and treated for a few weeks, the young man was sent to work at a different location while he continued to receive treatment. Thankfully for him, this option was available and he could continue to work. Luckily for this man, he noticed he had an issue, was diagnosed and treated.", "Too often, this is not the case for individuals who suffer from PTSD. Being attacked by a burglar or having been surrounded by a hail of gunfire are not always necessary to suffer from PTSD. This rang true for one of my constituency assistants one January evening in 2002, when her car was hit head-on by a sport utility vehicle while travelling home from work. Her lower leg was shattered and severed. Every bone in her face was broken and both jawbones fractured several times. One of those bones from her jaw protruded from her left cheek. She hung upside down, strapped to the seat for over an hour before she was put into an ambulance, fully conscious, and rushed to the Ottawa Civic Hospital.", "While on the way to the hospital, her blood pressure dropped twice to the point that the paramedics thought they would lose her. Once at the hospital, she was in shock and had her superficial wounds stitched up and was then placed in a medically induced coma for the next week, while she underwent extensive surgeries. Her parents stated that, after the accident, she knew what happened and even named the type of vehicle that had collided with her. Once she was allowed to awake from the coma, she knew nothing of the events that had taken place to put her in the hospital.", "Doctors say that her brain blocked the trauma and, some day, she may recall the accident—though to her dismay, she still has not to this day. After her accident, she had bad dreams and several flashbacks pertaining to the accident. The sound of glass breaking, of being swept off the floor, would make her heart race and cause her to nearly break into tears. She was diagnosed with PTSD. She was diagnosed early, treated and, now, has minimal effects from PTSD, though she does still suffer from a mild traumatic brain injury.", "One of the most frighteningly named disorders under the mental illness umbrella is dissociative identity disorder, or multiple personality disorder. I was once told a story about a young person who, while they were in high school, battled depression and suicide. Guidance counsellors, psychiatrists and psychiatric hospital stays didn’t seem to help the child, so she sort of fell by the wayside. She continued on, struggling her way into and through adulthood. She told stories to her friends of having brain tumours and a child no one had ever met. She would show up with bumps and bruises and slashes on her arms and legs. There were stories of abuse and groups of men attacking her and kidnapping her.", "She had friends on Facebook whom no one else knew, but would request friendships with a few of her friends and have Facebook friendships with them. Eventually, one of these mysterious people began to threaten the friends of the woman. Soon, the woman thankfully confided in her friend and told her that she had been diagnosed with multiple personality disorder. The friend was relieved and now understood that all the lies were not really lies. They were merely her illness acting out. The multiple Facebook accounts of random friends that were befriending and taunting her friends were actually accounts that the different personalities had set up. Unfortunately for this person, she will struggle for the rest of her life because there is no cure for this disorder.", "Mental illness affects more people in Canada than any other type of health problem. People suffer in so many different ways, from extreme and permanent mental illness to intermittent to recurring illness, to occasional or even one-time troubles.", "Mental illness can include everything from severely criminally-inclined schizophrenia to postpartum depression for new mothers, to lack-of-self-esteem-driven depression in maturing teenagers, to chronic, lifelong recurring depression, to one-time, event-driven depression such as physical trauma, job loss, divorce or death in the family.", "Depression in developing teenagers as they struggle with growing from a child to an adult can be traumatic and, for some, unbearable, with the tragic ending of suicide, which is devastating for families and communities. It is so terrible to see young lives lost; and for those who live with depression, so terrible to see the anguish, the suffering and the sadness; so terrible to see the complete lack of joy and accomplishment.", "Depression can drive people to live on the streets and become street people, caught up in the vicious cycle of prostitution, drug and alcohol abuse, and crime. These are often young people from middle-class families, but they are trying to cope with mental illness and they are not doing well.", "The Ottawa police chief said at a public meeting in Ottawa that 60% of policemen’s time on the streets is spent with mentally ill people. He said that we need more people properly trained in mental illness to work with mentally ill people on the street; that it would be better care; that policemen are not specifically trained in mental illness and therefore are not necessarily the best people to be on the streets with mentally ill people.", "Schizophrenia is a devastating disease. I know two sisters who are well educated and respected as experts in their field of work. They started and operated a successful not-for-profit business that was much used by many families, and they were successful at fundraising to keep the business going. The business was growing. Then they were both struck with schizophrenia. They imagined that their homes were being broken into, that there were spies, that there were people trying to hurt them or even kill them. Their lives were destroyed, and it was all in their heads.", "There can be a seasonal depression from the short, dark days of winter. It is documented that in northern countries like Canada, there is more depression in winter than in summer because of our shorter winter days. Christmastime can be a depressing time for some people, especially people who are alone, people who are divorced or had a spouse die or a parent or family member die, or are just alone at a time when everyone else seems to be happy and celebrating the festive season.", "Job loss and poverty can cause great anxiety and unhappiness, resulting in broken families and mental illness.", "Mental health can be a fragile thing, and sometimes needs special attention to preserve and protect it. Mental illness affects many times more people than physical illness. Mental illness is a huge cost to employers because of the high cost of absenteeism on sick days. The total financial cost of mental health care in Ontario is about $15 billion per year. The biggest cost of all is the cost of sadness and anguish to mentally ill people and their families.", "Living with mental illness is a courageous battle, as only the sufferers and possibly their families know the true agony they are in. So we must do better. We must do more. As a caring society, we have a moral obligation to help those who cannot help themselves.", "Mr. Speaker, our party supports this bill strongly." ],

Now, the appellant also, in this instance—and this was the motivator for this court case—is deaf and has only had limited and sporadic access to interpreters throughout his 19–year confinement, inhibiting treatment. What has actually happened is that the Consent and Capacity Board has reviewed the appellant’s involuntary detention on a yearly basis, and they have concluded that he does not belong in a maximum security facility. But the reason why this legislation is on the floor of this Legislature today is because the Consent and Capacity Board has no powers to do the right thing for this particular individual.", "Now, this individual obviously has other diagnoses, multiple diagnoses. The member actually referenced the complexity of cases such as this, but we have a duty in this House to ensure that the legislation and the law are working for all Ontarians, regardless of how they came to be in these circumstances. The broader issue of mental health in the province of Ontario—the act is open; we should take the opportunity to address the long-standing systemic issues that pertain to mental health in the province of Ontario." ],

In particular, the MPP for Carleton–Mississippi Mills, I want to thank you for your heartfelt comments. One thing that comes to me is that every one of the members in this Legislature has experienced constituents who have had difficulties with mental health issues. There’s nothing that’s more despairing than when you’re trying to help and you’re sometimes challenged to find solutions.", "In my riding of Kingston and the Islands, I had a mental health town hall that was absolutely packed. At that time, in the spring, in April of this year, I decided to create a task force or an advocacy group to look at the various, different aspects of mental health care in my community. We have many program providers that are extremely good at what they do, but as has been stated, sometimes we don’t always collaborate the best we can with each other, or we’re not aware of a particular program that a service provider has in our riding.", "The amendments would, if passed, ensure that the Mental Health Act would align with the charter and, at the same time, enhance the rights of involuntary long-term patients who have been committed to psychiatric facilities. I think this is extremely important. Every Ontarian should enjoy good and the best possible mental health and well–being throughout their lives, and Ontarians with mental health or addictions can recover and participate in welcoming supportive communities." ],

I hazard a guess that many of these assaults are happening on psychiatric units.", "Being a nurse and representing nurses for over 40 years—it is common for staff to be assaulted on psychiatric units. There’s an imbalance there, as well—making sure, when we’re looking after patients with mental health issues, that there are enough staff in place on units all the time; not just during those working hours, but during lunch breaks and coffee breaks, to make sure that nurses and psychiatric workers in our hospitals are safe and that they can go home at the end of the day to their families without being injured—in some cases, dead. I know that there were 760 cases in Ontario alone over a six-year period and only three charges laid by the Ministry of Labour, so something more certainly needs to be done on that aspect, as well." ],

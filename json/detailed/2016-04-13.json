I support Bill 100, but I do understand why people are suspicious, and they have cause and they are justified to be suspicious. For the last 13 years, rural Ontario has been hurt and injured with legislation that has steadily eroded property rights, steadily devalued our properties, diminished our prosperity, and it has all been done through legislation. Typically, the legislation sounds good, things like the provincial policy statement, the greenbelt, the Clean Water Act, a number of things. So I do understand why there is fear about Bill 100.", "But after over a decade of intrusive legislation, the Liberal government has actually introduced a bill that is beneficial and helps rural Ontario. It promotes and improves property rights in Ontario. This is the first bill I have seen from this Liberal government that actually helps and promotes property rights. I’d like to take a few moments to tell people why. I do understand that it is as if the world had been turned upside down by this Liberal government and Bill 100. People don’t know what to make of it.", "The facts for private property owners are simple. Presently, property owners are prevented in law from suing for more than $1,000 if there are damages to their property caused by trespassers. Under Bill 100, that unfair limitation of $1,000 is removed. If Bill 100 passes, there will be no arbitrary limit on how much people can seek for damages; definitely an improvement, and it adds to the protection of property rights. Presently, the fines for trespassers on private property are set at a maximum of $2,000. Under Bill 100, that maximum is raised to $10,000; certainly another benefit and another added protection for private property owners.", "At the moment, when there are trail agreements, the covenants on those agreements are not legally enforceable. Bill 100 permits covenants, such as time of use, duration of the covenant, who can access the trails and what types of vehicles. A whole host of covenants can be placed, but they also now become legally enforceable by the property owner; another benefit and another protection for property rights.", "One thing that many people have found to be the scariest of all with Bill 100 is voluntary easements. They can only be created by mutual consent of the property owner. There is no imposition, there is nothing arbitrary, there is no coercion and there is no liability with those easements. But it does allow choice; indeed, a very scary thing to allow choice with legislation in Ontario.", "But I think something else has been missing in this discussion, and that is the benefits and the case for rural Ontario. Trail associations and businesses that benefit from trail use are extensive and expansive. Expanding the use of trails helps our rural and small-town restaurants, motor sport dealers, motels, bed and breakfasts, and stores. Every business in rural and small-town Ontario benefits from trails as people come to rural Ontario for recreation and tourism.", "The corollary of that, of course, must also be true: Reducing access to trails reduces business opportunities, reduces revenues and reduces prosperity for rural Ontario.", "Certainty and security of tenure and use for both the property owner and the trails association is needed to permit and encourage greater investment and expansion in trail infrastructure, such as highway overpasses, river and stream crossings, and bridges. Certainty and security of tenure and use must be there to encourage expansion.", "Rural Ontario would largely be empty and unpopulated without transferable easements registered upon title, as we have throughout Ontario today. Deeded access, rights of way and utility easements: All are registered on title, and all are transferable—nothing scary. Indeed, without easements, we would all be living in the dark without electricity and without phones, and very few would have access to their cottages without transferable easements registered on title. I would suggest that there are very few people here today, very few people in Ontario and very few people watching this who don’t already have some form of transferable easements registered on their properties.", "In closing, Speaker, it would really be a dystopian world where voluntary and mutually beneficial easements are viewed as dangerous, as suspicious, as harmful for property owners, and where improving rural business opportunities is seen as a negative.", "I do hope the government has learned some powerful lessons with Bill 100—powerful lessons: that it is not bad—that it is indeed good—to protect property rights, to strengthen property rights. This is a good thing.", "I have to commend the Minister of Tourism for being the first minister in my time who gets it, who understands that if we promote and protect property rights, we will all be better off.", "But I will also say this: I hope the rest of the ministers in cabinet understand what this minister has done, and I hope the Liberal Party understands what has happened. This great outcry over Bill 100 is because of the lengthy assault on rural Ontario in the past, the continuous, never-ending and relentless erosion of property rights, and the suspicion and fear that this Liberal government has fostered and cultivated over the last 13 years. I hope this Liberal government is now on a new trail." ],

For those of you who may not be familiar with this place, this is an extraordinary moment—an extraordinary moment.", "I want to say that I had an opportunity to look over the comments from our critic the member from Hamilton East–Stoney Creek, who in fact said “Yes, this bill does some very useful things for trails, for people in Ontario who like to wander through the countryside and for property owners.”", "The decisions about the trails are in the hands of the landowners. As far as I can tell, and I stand to be corrected, there’s no expropriation here, there’s no action to alienate people from their land. There’s an opportunity for landowners to be protected in a way they may not have been protected in the past. There’s an opportunity for access to trails in a way that’s more predictable than has been in the past.", "Frankly, Speaker, for those of us who enjoy the extraordinary landscape that we have here in Ontario, to be able to go out and actually roam around that landscape, and for those who own the land that we happily tread upon to have protection as well—those are all good things.

I’m getting a little bit of fearmongering in some of the statements that have been made. Despite the fact that he has said that everyone benefits from trails, he also mentions, on the other hand, that this legislation is going to turn the world upside down and that it’s harmful for landowners.", "This piece of legislation has been worked on by many organizations for many years, and I’m sure that the guest in the gallery would attest to that. We also have numerous other positive comments of support from organizations like the Association of Municipalities of Ontario. They represent an enormous number of people across the province. They’re very supportive of the trails act.

I have to commend the member from Lanark, because he brings up a good point: We’re already seeing trails in our area that have been lost this year. It’s unfortunate, because I think the bill was there to add some clarity and to put some tools in place that should enhance this. But with the lack of consultation with the different people involved, it seems to have had the opposite effect. I think it’s a lesson, and I think the government needs to get out there and do a little bit of healing of some of these groups and landowners that are going to take away a very important resource of ours.", "I think it’s important, especially in the wintertime, to get out and have something to do and be out in the outdoors. We’re seeing, in area after area—and unfortunately, with a trail that goes across multiple properties, if you lose one, you lose the trail. I know that it supposedly might have been a bill, hopefully, with a good goal in sight, but we see it’s not there—and the unintended consequences.", "We encourage the government to do a little more consultation and get out there. It’s a little after the fact—we would have liked to have seen this done earlier—but the end result is what’s important here. I don’t think we want to lose these important trails. It’s good for tourism, and it’s good just for the community. As the mayor of South Glengarry—we purchased a railway track that could be used for trails.", "But it really takes the multiple trails being put in place. The volunteers that work at getting these trails—it’s a lot of work. They’re seeing the loss now, so it’s got to be hard on them. I think we have to go out and give them a little bit of moral support and help them out on this one. Hopefully, we can do something that gets back and actually enhances the trails, not takes away from them.", "We’re looking forward to seeing some of that consultation and some work with the government with these owners." ],

There have been several municipalities who have passed resolutions on this bill.

The minister has authority to designate special designation to trails. I’ve heard through some discussions that landowners who have these trails on their property are not sure what that means and what that’s going to look like for them. If the minister has power of designation, how does that translate into seasonal use or promotion under tourism and things like that? So that’s a question; if anyone has an answer, I’d love some clarity on it." ],

The minister can make a pronouncement that this is a really, really special trail, and maybe put a plaque up. They would even have to ask the property owner to put a plaque up for a really special, special trail. But there are no underlying authorities in the bill for the minister to, like I say, infringe or impinge on private property.", "I do hope the Liberal government is listening and that they stay on this new path, this new trail of bringing legislation that benefits rural Ontario, and that they bring their listening cap when they come to the Legislature for debate." ],

I want to thank my colleague the member from Lanark–Frontenac–Lennox and Addington—LFLA, as we like to refer to it—because he’s certainly done his homework on this. Although we typically expect a really critical eye and critical comments coming specifically from him, this morning we’re hearing some positive comments that I think should all call us to support and promote the bill—with, obviously, cautious reservation, as we tend to do as opposition members, as we are charged to do.", "So, the bill itself: Speaker, our trail network in Ontario really is an important cultural, social and economic component of the province; something that anyone in this House who has had the opportunity to partake in and enjoy would understand not only is it a way to be further connected with the beauty of this province—the supernatural beauty, certainly, in all quadrants of the province—but also a way to connect to people. Along these trails, you’ll find little hamlets that people rely on for their economic welfare and for their livelihoods. I can’t name them off the top of my head, but I know they exist, and I know they’re really important components to rural Ontario and remote Ontario. Sometimes they’re even lifelines, when all else fails. It’s important that we pay some attention to them and promote them, and ensure that they are safeguarded and continue to play the vital role.", "As opposition members and as members in the House, we have reviewed the bill. A couple of things stand out that I think could be easily remedied. One is simply in the naming of the bill and the intent of the bill. Very clearly, the bill has six schedules, one enactment, and amendments to five acts.", "It proclaims Ontario Trails Week. That corresponds with the international equivalent, which is the first Saturday of June of every year.", "It requires the minister to maintain an Ontario trails strategy; that’s a good thing. It creates a regime for the creation of easements for the use of privately held land to be used as part of the Ontario trail network, and for the users of trails—for instance, snowmobile associations—to use a portion of the landowners’ property.", "Now, that’s not in the description of the bill. If I might steal this from my colleague who, very helpfully—thank you. The purpose of the bill: What I’d like to do, for the benefit of the members, is to match this schedule that creates a regime for creating easements, which is really the most mechanical portion of the bill, to the purpose.", "The purposes of the bill are:", "“1. To increase awareness about and encourage the use of trails.", "“2. To enhance trails and the trail experience.", "“3. To protect trails for today’s generation and future generations.", "“4. To recognize the contribution that trails make to quality of life....”", "Nothing in the introduction of the bill states the creation of this easement portion. That should be clearly articulated. That, I guess, is what we’re talking about today. The bill should have had broader consultation. In the description of the bill, that should have been clearly articulated. That’s where I think there has been a lot of confusion.", "We’ve heard clarity from the member from LFLA, but even some of those in his own caucus have been confused about it. I hope that those members themselves will, at some point, take the lead from the member and dispel some of those myths, because it’s really important that people understand what this bill does.", "Speaker, we have in Ontario somewhere around 30,000 kilometres of trails in the trail network. That’s enormous; that is a huge network of trails that connect communities.", "One thing that I think we should be cognizant of is the competing jurisdictions that also have wonderful trail networks. My riding is in southwestern Ontario. In Windsor and Essex county, we’re able to easily connect with trail networks in Michigan. Just a little cursory research that I did, just prior to getting up here: If you buy a Michigan trail pass, it costs you somewhere around $45 a year to access their network of trails. I’m not exactly sure how many kilometres it would be, or miles, but it certainly could be comparable, given the size of the state of Michigan.", "In Ontario, an annual fee for a trail pass ranges somewhere from $180 to $260 a year. That’s a little bit cost-prohibitive, especially when you’re trying to entice folks to come here. Visitors from all jurisdictions, when they look at the cost of the trail pass—it’s prohibitive to access it. We should look at somehow making it, potentially, a little bit more affordable for those to come in. We could probably increase the numbers of people who take advantage of these trails, and, again, get a lot more recognition and promotion of the trails.", "I’ve even heard some criticism from folks from Ontario who say, “Listen, they just keep jacking up the price on the trail passes, and we can’t afford to go,” given the cost of gas and the cost of buying machines—snowmobiles, ATVs and UTVs—these days. You’re looking at tens of thousands of dollars if you’re going to get a decent machine—something that, at some point in my life, Speaker, I’d love to be able to take advantage of, although I don’t have the time to enjoy it.", "I know there are those in Ontario who really make it a family event, something that they all partake in and something that they invest in. Again, if we look at the contribution to the economy that our ATV, snowmobile and UTV associations and users make every year, it’s quite large. It’s something that deserves our attention, something that deserves our promotion.", "I’m happy to see that this bill adds some clarity to the use of the trails for landowners and those who use them. Again, the member from Lanark–Frontenac–Lennox and Addington did a really good job in dispelling some of those myths.", "One of the things that we would like to see—and I think members get the sense that this will receive all-party support; at least, it certainly will from our party—although the bill creates legal clarity in the relationship between landowners and trail users, there’s poor communication and confusion that has prevailed around the relationship between owners and trail users.", "We’ve seen this time and time again. I was walking out of here the other day, contemplating the job that we do and wondering when we can ever get to a point where the government can get a bill right the first time. It’s so rare in this place that we see that they get it right. We’ve seen bills come back just months after they were introduced and passed by the majority government, where they’ve missed a couple of words and it’s totally transformed the intent and the mechanisms of the bill. This is getting pretty close, although we think with a little bit more consultation, they could have actually gotten it right, right off the bat—something that doesn’t waste any of our time, something that doesn’t waste the time of proponents or opponents of the bill because there’s been broad consultation, and all of that has been worked out prior to it hitting the floor here in the Legislature.", "We don’t think that that is quite where this bill is. We know that it’s going to need some minor tweaking, but after that, we’ve proposed—and our critic for agriculture from Timiskaming–Cochrane has asked—that the government be strategic about where they potentially travel the bill to talk to those stakeholders. We know that there has been a long history of rural Ontario being shut out of consultation when it comes to provincial decisions and land utilization. This is a way that they can make amends and show that there is some good faith and some partnership with rural Ontario.", "That’s something, again, that my colleague from LFLA was very clear about. He hopes that this ushers in a new era of consultation between the province and rural Ontario, something that’s desperately needed because it avoids the confusion and the backlash that has the potential of derailing important bills like this.", "I’m happy to stand in support of the bill today. I’d like to see it go through with some minor clarifications, a little bit of tweaking; but ultimately, we’re quite happy that this is seeing its way through." ],

Our family used the trails along the Humber River quite often and quite extensively. In fact, I have a picture that hangs in my mum’s home of me as a kid—I’ve got to be about 10 or 11 years old, posing with my sister in this photo—and we’re along the Humber River with the trails in the background.

I think protecting private property rights is also very, very important, so I appreciate that those measures are in the bill.", "There’s a lot of comment from the opposite side about lack of consultation.

Who is an “eligible body?” Who is “another eligible body?” That should be clearly identified. It should be, I guess, broad enough to make sure that it’s not prohibitive to folks who currently use and plan to use the network of trails and make sure that the process is technically clear and easy to take advantage of.", "That being said, again, I’m happy to stand in support of Ontario trails, the network, and those who maintain them and promote them.

It is not that hard to end a trail system.", "I’ve been on the Bruce Trail—a gorgeous place—and I know there were times that I was going through farmers’ fields. People, happily, have been pretty respectful. I didn’t see litter; I didn’t see any damage. Frankly, if the farmers hadn’t allowed people to be on their land, the utility of that trail would have been dramatically reduced.", "So putting in measures that will actually ensure comfort and confidence on the part of the landowners makes tons of sense for the landowners and for those who have the great and wonderful opportunity—the privilege—to wander through that countryside." ],

And as the member very reasonably articulated, there is a solution. We’re already hearing rumours about cabinet shuffles and people being moved around. So while we have a statement from the current minister, it would be very helpful to actually put it in legislation. We all know that ministers move beyond their current portfolio.

  "speaker" : "Mr. Todd Smith",
  "text" : [ "Good morning, Madam Speaker. I’m pleased to join the debate on Bill 100 here this morning.", "I have heard a lot about Bill 100 in my riding. As you know, I represent a beautiful riding in eastern Ontario, Prince Edward–Hastings, which stretches from the limestone shores of Lake Ontario in Prince Edward county all the way up through Belleville, through beautiful Centre Hastings and the Tweed, Madoc and Marmora area.", "We’ve got some beautiful lakes there. Stoco Lake: There are some great trails around Stoco Lake, in the GTA—the other GTA, the greater Tweed area, we call that. And then stretching up north into North Hastings as well, there are some magnificent trail systems stretching all the way through there.", "The entire system is actually managed by the Eastern Ontario Trails Alliance. I know they have received some funding in the past from upper levels of government, and they’re doing a great job of making sure those trails are some of the best trails not just in Ontario but in the world. They are very, very important for businesses in my region, for tourism in my region, and for sportsmen in Prince Edward–Hastings as well. People come from far and wide.", "I heard the member from Essex talking earlier this morning about the fact that he can just go across the top of the lake, because he doesn’t have a trail system there, but he’s more than welcome any time. I know he’s been to my region before for some walleye fishing, but the trail system in eastern Ontario is unbelievable as well. There are actually 700 kilometres of trail in the Eastern Ontario Trails Alliance, as I say, stretching from that limestone bed all the way into the granite in the north of North Hastings and Bancroft, the mineral capital of the world.", "I was very pleased to have the Bancroft chamber of commerce here earlier this week on Prince Edward–Hastings day to talk about the Rockhound Gemboree, which is world-famous. If you have a four-wheeler, you should stop up in the summer, take the trail to Bancroft and check out the mineral museum that’s there. It’s first-class and you can see some of the great minerals that have been mined over the centuries up in North Hastings.", "The thing is that this bill, Bill 100, has created a little bit of confusion out there—a lot of confusion, in some cases. I think what needs to happen is that there needs to be a public relations strategy on behalf of the government to ensure that all landowners understand exactly what is being proposed in Bill 100, because the confusion does exist.", "I agree with the premise of Bill 100, that there should be a little bit more surety on behalf of landowners, and the trails organizations as well, when it comes to the easement issue. There are those in certain segments of the community that believe that the easement is going to be forced on them as a result of Bill 100. That’s not the case. They’re not going to be forced to agree to anything that they don’t want to agree to.", "As was mentioned earlier by the member from Parry Sound–Muskoka, if we didn’t have the agreements with the landowners, we wouldn’t have the trail system that we have in eastern Ontario right now. But, again, I just want to stress: No one is going to have their arms tied behind their back and be forced to sign an easement to have a trail running through their property. For decades, these landowners have agreed. What this bill intends to do, as far as I can tell, is add some confidence to the groups that are running the trails or maintaining the trails and add some confidence for the landowner as well in agreeing to an easement over a set period of time.", "One of the stories that I was told by one of the organizations that operates the trails is this: There was a beautiful piece of property that a trail was running through, and on that piece of property there was a stream or a small waterway that went through the person’s property. The snowmobile organization wanted to build a bridge over that stream so that the four-wheelers or the snowmobiles in the wintertime could pass over that. There’s quite a cost involved with that, Madam Speaker. It’s not just a couple of hundred bucks; it’s several thousand dollars to build a bridge up to code over a stream like that.", "What happened was, the club had an agreement with the landowner to build the bridge over the stream. I believe it was a couple of hundred thousand dollars to build this bridge. After the bridge was built, the landowner said, “No, we’re not going to let you use that property anymore.” So as you can see, the organization has put out the capital—a lot of money—-and the next thing you know, we’re not allowed to use this section of the trail any longer. We want to protect the clubs from this type of thing happening.", "On the other hand, we want to protect the property owners as well, and future property owners. If you own a glorious piece of land up on Stoco Lake, Madam Speaker, and you have a handshake agreement with a trails club to use that piece of property, and then you decide you’re going to leave Stoco Lake to move back to the city—I don’t know anyone who has ever done that; it usually works the other way around. But if you were going to sell your property, that actual easement would be registered with the land registry office so that when that potential new landowner comes in to purchase that property, they’ll see that there’s an easement on that property for five years, if that’s what the agreement was, or 10 years.", "If you bought that property and then you found out there’s a trail system running through your property and you have an easement on your land registry, you won’t be surprised. You’ll know when your lawyers, who are doing the real estate deal, look up all of the details on that piece of property at the land registry office. They’ll know that there is an easement there and no one will be surprised by that.", "Unfortunately, I think what happened in this case is that—the government did it with the best of intentions, again. They brought forward Bill 100 with the best of intentions, but maybe didn’t communicate early enough in the process with those who were integral to making sure that this worked. That allowed a couple of groups to spread some information out there that wasn’t entirely correct and has a lot of people worried and contacting my office. I haven’t had droves of people, but I certainly have had a few concerned landowners who have written and called my office with really strong concerns about their land being taken away from them. That’s not the case when it comes to this bill.", "I’d like to thank my colleague the member from Lanark–Frontenac–Lennox and Addington. He’s my neighbour. We share trails in that Eastern Ontario Trails Alliance. Of course, he’ll promote Silent Lake or some of the other great lakes that are in his area—mine are better—but the trail is beautiful and it stretches all the way through. He’s done a lot of work on this bill and he’s also done a lot of work in trying to correct some of the issues that are being miscommunicated to the public in regard to this bill. I really think, in a lot of cases, the member from Lanark–Frontenac–Lennox and Addington has done a better job than the government has in straightening out some of the miscommunication that exists in the community.", "I give him full marks for his efforts in making sure that this bill, which is well-intentioned, ensures that we continue to have the best trail system in Ontario, in North America and even in the world—something that is a little bit more concrete and something we know is going to exist—and that those agreements are going to be in place. It gives some surety to the whole process so that our sportsmen can enjoy those trails. They’re great for walking, for horseback riding and, of course, for the use of all-terrain vehicles and snowmobiles.", "People in my neck of the woods, that’s what they do. They buy a four-wheeler, they buy a utility vehicle, they buy a snowmobile and they look forward to the fact that when the snow comes, they’re going to get out their Arctic Cat or their Ski-Doo and they’re going to have a great time on the trails in our region. It’s big business. There are people who come from all over to use the trails in eastern Ontario.", "I commend the government for bringing forward Bill 100 to make sure that the agreements that we have with our landowners are there for years and years to come; that those who are promoting Prince Edward–Hastings, North Hastings and Centre Hastings as a great place to come and spend their tourism dollars—that those are there for years to come; and that we can continue to support our local businesses in our region. We have many, many bed and breakfasts, hotels and restaurants that depend on people coming in on their snowmobiles and their ATVs, or just enjoying the great outdoors in one of the most beautiful places in Ontario to spend a long weekend. That, of course, is Prince Edward–Hastings, Ontario.", "Thank you for the time this morning." ],

The women were called Kaur, meaning “princess,” to emphasize dignity, and men were called Singh, which means “lion,” a reminder of the need for courage.", "The Guru created five articles of faith which all Khalsa were required to wear, all beginning with the letter K. Each of these articles of faith is rooted in Sikh philosophy.", "The turban is also a central tenet of Sikh faith. The turban represents the Sikh’s commitment to service to others and to uphold equal rights for all, with accountability only to God.", "Vaisakhi is also a Punjabi harvest festival. This day is also observed as a thanksgiving day by farmers to pay tribute, thanking God for the abundant harvest and also praying for future prosperity.", "Mr. Speaker, over 600,000 Sikhs live in Canada. The festival of Vaisakhi has a tremendous religious significance for over 350,000 Sikhs who reside in Ontario. Every year, Ontario Sikhs take great pride in decorating gurdwaras and organizing Nagar Kirtans. This year, the Nagar Kirtan will be held in Toronto on April 24 and in Mississauga on May 1. I want to extend an invitation to all my colleagues to attend these functions." ],

The city of North Bay and the municipality of Powassan both recently passed resolutions regarding this concern. They note that five provinces—PEI, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador, New Brunswick and Quebec—now utilize a form of gas price regulation, with a system that sets a maximum price and a scheduled change where customers know what they’re paying week to week, with province-wide price ranges in place.", "The city of North Bay also points out that drivers in northern Ontario often see wide ranges in gasoline prices compared to other areas, particularly in southern Ontario. As a result, North Bay and Powassan councils both resolved to “request the provincial government to investigate benefits of such regulation for Ontario.”", "Speaker, the fact that these resolutions come at a time that gas prices are much lower than they have been in the recent past I believe reinforces the level of concern being expressed here, and the government should take that concern seriously.", "I thank you for the opportunity to speak." ],

With students forced to rely on loans to finance their education, many are graduating with debt loads of $27,000 or more.", "At the same time, interest on student loans charged by the Ontario government means that many graduates pay as much in interest as to pay down their principal—in a labour market that offers little or no job security, or offers unpaid internships that earn nothing at all. The prospect of years of debt prevents these graduates from even thinking about the normal milestones of adult life, like buying a house or a car, getting married or starting a family.", "Speaker, interest on student loans is effectively a poor tax. It disadvantages those from the lowest-income families, who carry the largest loans. I urge this government to listen to the 60,000 students who have signed the petition and provide debt relief and eliminate interest repayment from student loans." ],

I’ve reached out to my local municipal leaders for their feedback because they’re the ones that are going to have to work with the proposals that we’re bringing forward.", "The overarching goal, of course, is to ensure that our democratic process is fair and efficient concerning local elections, all the while keeping up with modern perspectives. I would say that Bill 181 does exactly that.", "The proposed changes will provide clear rules that will govern how municipal leaders are elected while reflecting how to run a modern campaign and election. With each municipal election, the ministry does review the Municipal Elections Act. This is how we ensure that the needs of Ontario communities are being met during the election process. These reviews are done with extensive consultations. I can tell you that we received over 3,400 submissions, and they came in from the public, from municipal councils and from their staff. So we are listening to the needs of Ontario communities.", "In my riding of Kitchener Centre, the impact of these consultations is very evident. I contacted and heard from my mayor, Berry Vrbanovic. He is very happy that our government listened to municipalities, and he’s especially happy to see the shortened election period—we’re going to be moving from January 1 to May 1.", "Many of us who ran in the provincial election that ran for five to six weeks in 2014 would agree that it can be mentally and physically exhausting. Imagine what our local politicians who run for six months must go through. At my level in Kitchener, they’re very happy to see the shortened period. Ken Seiling, the Chair of Waterloo region, told me that he also believes the shortened election period is a great idea, and he fully supports this proposal.", "This is a very positive process of this government. We listened and we consulted, as we’ve always done. These consultations led to many other elements in this bill that I believe are important to talk about in some detail. Another issue mentioned by Kitchener mayor Vrbanovic is that the low voter turnout at local elections has him concerned. This was echoed throughout the consultation process, and looking at ways to try to reverse this trend is important. We are providing municipalities with the option of introducing ranked ballot voting in their communities. By giving councils this option, they can facilitate public input and open meetings. This method is favoured by our regional Chair, Ken Seiling. It’s going to allow municipalities to determine the best possible course of action for their own communities. We know that many jurisdictions have already adopted ranked ballots, and they have seen better engagement, better debates and a higher voter turnout. This directly addresses the issue brought before us through consultation.", "We’re also proposing changes to campaign financing, ensuring that the rules are clear, simple to follow and easier to enforce. This increases transparency and accountability at the local level. To ensure better transparency, the bill proposes to regulate third-party advertisers for greater accountability. This includes setting contribution and spending limits. Any discussion regarding modern elections must also include a discussion of whether to ban corporate and union donations. These changes do provide municipalities with a choice—again, we’re giving them a choice—to allow this to occur or not occur. It is up to them to make the best decisions for their communities.", "Clerks are also going to be required to make public a report of which candidates filed financial statements and which ones did not. This again serves to increase accountability.", "As of right now, Ontario has the longest-running nomination period of any province. This is shown to contribute to campaign fatigue among candidates and voters—I mentioned earlier that the length of the campaign is perhaps the reason why people are disengaged. By shortening the period that candidates can run for election, we’re also listening to the feedback we’re getting from municipalities and cutting down on campaign fatigue.", "We’re also seeking to help make elections more accessible by requiring accessibility plans prepared before the election and made public before voting day. This is going to help people who want to get to polling stations but may have some difficulty because of physical disabilities.", "Finally, we’re proposing improvements to the voters list, making it easier for voters to add and edit their information.", "Bill 181 improves our municipal electoral process. This is supported by municipalities, because we listened to their needs. I heard some members of the opposition objecting to this. I want you to know that I contacted my local municipal leaders, and they support this bill; they’re behind it.", "I hope that all my fellow members here are going to join me and help to bring the Municipal Elections Act into the modern age with this legislation." ],

We’ve heard many things about what this bill will contribute. But as someone who is passionate about disability and the progress we’ve made through the AODA, I’m extremely pleased to see that we will be looking at reducing barriers for those with disabilities.", "When I was engaging many communities last year, on the 10th anniversary of the AODA, I heard of the good work we’ve done but the journey we must continue. This is why I’m extremely pleased that this act specifies that city clerks would prepare accessibility plans to identify and remove barriers that could affect both voters and candidates with disabilities. This plan would also be available to the public before the election. So I am extremely glad that we are continuing to look at how to engage those with disabilities and make it easier for them to exercise their right.", "Speaker, as a member who had one of the highest voter turnouts in the last election, I am hopeful that the tools this bill gives to municipalities will encourage voter turnout at the municipal level. This voter turnout is affected by many factors, and this bill, if passed, will give the tools to municipalities to encourage and support voters and candidates.", "As part of the consultation following the 2014 municipal election, PA Rinaldi came to Ottawa, and I had the pleasure of sitting in on this meeting. I heard from candidates, both successful and not successful, on the unnecessarily long length of the writ period. This was one of their major concerns, and I am happy to say we’ve heard this concern and are taking action. Entering a potentially 10-month-long contest is a daunting task and potentially could sway many people to not enter the race at all.", "Also, from a female politician, I feel this long writ period is an impediment for females seeking a seat on council or running for mayor. I do hope that this bill will lead to more women entering the political area because while we have strong female mayors, many of whom I had the pleasure of meeting at AMO and OGRA/ROMA each year, the councillors themselves are heavily male. In fact, I have to say that of the 23 city of Ottawa councillors, there are only four women.", "This act, if passed, will help our municipalities also conduct efficient elections. I have to say—and I’m going to give a plug to my councillors—I work with three great councillors: Bob Monette, Jody Mitic and Stephen Blais. While we don’t always agree on who provides the most services to citizens, I do agree that they do fantastic work. This bill will help my councillors continue to do their great work. I hope that they’re watching right now, and I’ll say, “You’re welcome, guys.”", "We are allowing municipalities, if they so choose, to introduce the ranked ballot system. We are allowing our municipalities to decide how to conduct their electoral business, and we’re giving them a new tool to ensure that they can better engage their citizens.", "In any democracy, the success of elections depends on voters and candidate engagement, so we hope that these increase through the actions we are taking and by the tools we are allowing municipalities to use, if they so choose.", "I just want to finish by stating that these changes here are needed to help strengthen our democracy. If one more voter votes, or a candidate—and I have to give my plug—especially a female candidate, runs, then this bill has served a tremendous purpose for the continuation of our strong democratic system." ],

The ministry reviews the Municipal Elections Act following each municipal election to ensure that the act meets the changing needs of Ontario’s communities. We’ve heard for many years, especially in my neck of the woods, that that time had come.", "Relevant to that is the fact that the government received some 3,400 submissions on how the act can be improved, by the public and by municipal councils and staff from across the province, as part of the consultations that dated back to 2015.", "It goes without saying that municipalities provide important front-line services. They’re the level of government that is closest to people. I can attest to that, being a town councillor. I got the phone calls about potholes. I got the phone calls about sports facilities. I also got phone calls about wild turkeys, but that’s a whole other issue; I was glad to come here and deal with MNR. I have nothing to do with wild turkeys as a town councillor. We get all the calls because so many people really don’t see the difference between the levels of government.", "It’s vital to make sure that people have faith in their municipal governments. They account for a significant amount of our tax dollars, and people need to be assured that they’re transparent and accountable. Allowing more choice in municipal elections is part of the government’s plan to build Ontario up.", "I’ll say that I’ve had the pleasure of being able to talk to municipal councillors from both of the communities that I represent here at Queen’s Park: Newmarket and Aurora. They’re similar communities, but still different and apart.", "For example, in Aurora, we don’t have a ward system; we have first-past-the-post. We have a very vibrant democracy that takes place there every election year. I think, in our previous election, we had 28 people running for eight spots, which made for some very interesting all-candidates debates. I think there were three or four or five people running for mayor. You had to book the better part of an afternoon and an evening, if you were going to an all-candidates debate, by the time people stood up. But I thought it was the hallmark of a good democracy when you got that number of people interested in what’s going on.", "In Newmarket, we have a ward system, so it’s a little different. I think in Newmarket, they’re not quite sure whether or not a ranked ballot is the way they want to go, but certainly they’re having a good look at it and there’s some good discussion going on. And the same with Aurora; I think they’re leaning towards the ranked ballot system.", "This bill really has provided the impetus for that type of discussion that is so important.", "Just for a quick review, ranked ballots—at a time when voter turnout is going down in many communities—and I can say that that’s ours as well—it’s really time to look at ideas that can reverse that trend. I think that Bill 181 is the right step in the right direction at the right time." ],

These proposed changes will improve our electoral process and ensure that Ontarians’ voices are heard when it comes to grassroots municipal issues. This bill, proposed by my colleague the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing, would make a series of important amendments that will change municipal campaigns for the better.", "Our government received over 3,400 submissions from the public, municipal councils and staff about how the Municipal Elections Act could be improved, and we listened. This input was very important and has helped guide the changes that were laid out in Bill 181. People told us that they want these proposed changes. They want an increase in transparency and accountability, efficient elections and more choice to municipalities.", "Bill 181 will allow for municipalities to introduce ranked ballot voting in their communities if they choose to do so. Those who are in favour of ranked ballots believe they will make campaigns more civil and can encourage public engagement, better debate and higher voter turnout. Those are important things. Ranked ballots will allow more Ontarians to be heard. At a time when voter turnout has decreased in many Ontario communities, it is important that we give municipalities this option. Our government must continue to look at new, innovative options to ensure that our electoral system, at all levels, is relevant to the public.", "Our world is changing and growing. Our rules must change and evolve as our communities do. So I applaud this amendment in Bill 181. I believe that leaving room for electoral change at the municipal level is a step in the right direction for all communities in Ontario.", "In addition, the changes to the campaign finance rules that are proposed in this bill will ensure that they are clear, simple to follow and easier to enforce. These new regulations will ultimately increase transparency and accountability in municipal elections.", "By proposing a framework to regulate third-party advertising, this bill would increase accountability for advertisers and ensure more fair and transparent support for candidates. I used to work in the media and I can’t stress enough just how important it is that the regulations on advertising be looked at closely during campaigns. Setting contribution and spending limits, as well as ensuring that third parties identify themselves on signs and advertisements, will make for a more reliable and clear electoral system. Voters need to know who is behind media campaigns and what their interests are.", "These changes will benefit not only municipalities and Ontarians now but create a fairer system for future generations to come, and for our children. This is about making it easier and clearer for voters to cast their ballot and make choices for their municipalities, while making this process more transparent.", "These amendments will also ensure that elections are more accessible for everyone. All Ontarians entitled to a vote must be able to cast their vote. This is a pillar of our democracy. Bill 181 proposes changes that would require clerks to prepare accessibility plans to identify, remove and prevent barriers that could affect voters and candidates with disabilities. We all know that a better Ontario is a more accessible Ontario, so I’m very pleased that this bill will ensure that this is a priority for municipalities.", "The proposed amendments to the voters list will also ensure that it’s easier for voters to add their names to the list, or if they need to make changes to their personal information. Things in life change: where we live, our contact information and even our names sometimes. The ability to more easily change this type of data will definitely be beneficial to all municipalities in Ontario.", "Mr. Speaker, the changes in Bill 181 are necessary to modernize the system and will bring the Municipal Elections Act up to date with our changing province. I hope that all members of this House will see the many benefits of this bill, because it’s a piece of legislation that will make a difference and ensure democracy." ],

Will it be the system where all boxes have to be ticked or the ballot would be spoiled, or will it be the ranked ballots that allow for only one individual to be chosen? I haven’t heard that.

Certainly, you can see that this would be unacceptable, at best—intolerable, really.", "But, it also permits and allows a council to devise its own electoral system in advance of the election. A council could say, “I think we would be better off with a ranked ballot, or maybe we’d be better off with a first-past-the-post ballot, or some combination and variation of.” Elections are too important to allow the council of the day to make choices and variations of the election system.", "I’d like to have a response from the members who have read the bill." ],

There was a grassroots initiative that emerged prior to the last municipal election called 123London that has been working on this issue for years, actually, at this point. So this bill was greeted with some enthusiasm by people in my community and by progressives everywhere in the province who do see some of the benefits of ranked balloting.", "However, the ranked ballot provisions are packaged in Bill 181 with a number of other initiatives that do raise concerns. In particular, we are very concerned about the third-party advertising provisions. The bill links the right to promote an issue to the right to make a campaign contribution. So if a municipality decides to ban corporate and union contributions, corporations, unions and civil society organizations within a community no longer have a right to freedom of expression; they have no right to raise concerns on issues during a campaign period. We are concerned that this bill could, in fact, stifle democracy rather than enhance democracy." ],

We need to excite the public to come out and participate in voting and in the democratic process. History shows us that only about 25% or 30% of the members of the public come out and vote.

Specifically, the bill would give municipalities the right to implement a ranked ballot system without any consultation with the public, beginning with the 2018 election. I’m sure there are some viewers at home wondering, “What is a ranked ballot system and what does it actually mean?” Well, for those of you who actually thought of that question, thank you for asking that question because I’ll tell you, from the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing’s website page on the matter, it says, “Ranked ballots allow a voter to rank candidates in order of preference—first choice, second choice, third choice etc.—instead of just voting for one candidate.”", "The site goes on to clarify that the changes found within the bill would not impact how school board trustees are elected. It goes on to state, “Please note that ranked ballots are not being considered for school boards. If a municipality decided to use ranked ballots to elect council positions, voters would still use the current voting method to vote for school board trustee.”", "Barry Kay, a political science professor at Wilfrid Laurier University, said, “Parties that are seen to be more towards the centre, the Liberal Party in our federal system, probably would do somewhat better” under a ranked ballot system. Interesting. This may explain why this specific electoral system is the preferred method of choice for the Liberals compared to the number of potential options for electoral reform that are out there.", "Which party would benefit the most from moving from first-past-the-post to ranked ballots? What about various models, about proportional representation or other electoral systems? That’s why I believe that no individual party or person in power, be they Liberal or PC or NDP, should be able to make unilateral changes to the system under which they will be getting elected.", "Speaker, I’d like to rewind the clock and go back in time. This was the year that Ontario faced a referendum question on electoral reform. That was back in 2007. What they did was, they were asking if the province should abandon its current first-past-the-post system in favour of a mixed-member proportional representation system, which thankfully has a short form of MMP.", "Back then, the minister who introduced the bill publicly endorsed a transition to a mixed-member proportional—MMP—representation system, but is now in favour of ranked ballots. It’s amazing what can happen in just maybe nine years. One wonders why the minister flip-flopped on this issue, as they are two radically different electoral systems. Did the minister fall out of love with the MMP system because it didn’t help the Liberal Party as much?", "At the time, the minister responsible for democratic renewal said, “Our democracy belongs to its citizens, and it is the voters of this province that should decide how their representatives should be elected.”", "Linda Jeffrey, who was a parliamentary assistant at that time, said the following back in 2007 in regard to potential electoral reform—" ],

Even if the door is left open to the possibility of such actions, it should be closed by requiring the support of the people.", "The Liberals required 60% of Ontarians to vote in favour of changing our electoral system back in 2007 and by 50% of the vote in each of at least 64 of the 107 electoral districts. This threshold was decided by the Ontario cabinet despite the recommendations of a select committee that it require only 50% support in 71 of the 107 ridings. Imagine that. This is very intriguing.", "When it came to implementing a proportional representation system, one that typically is less kind to incumbents, the Ontario Liberal cabinet decided that they needed to go above and beyond the level of consent recommended by the select committee. Fifty per cent consent was advised, but the Liberals required 60%.", "When it comes to ranked ballots, a system that experts say would benefit the Liberal Party, they’re perfectly fine with having no consent whatsoever. Why did they require such a high level of public support to change to a system that stood to hurt them, but now require no public support for a system that benefits them?", "There is far from unanimous support for ranked ballots. In the 2007 referendum, the provincial government set the threshold for electoral change at 60% support, which is consistent with British Columbia and Prince Edward Island. Now, according to the latest poll, in Toronto, there is less than 60% support for ranked ballots.", "But we know now why the Liberals are singing a different tune. As dictated by their leader, electoral reform doesn’t need to bother with actually asking the public what they want. No, no, no; it’s a lot simpler than that, according to the Liberals. You simply just have one person who is in a position of power make up a few new rules by themselves. But does the Ontario Liberal definition of democracy match the actual definition?", "Let’s talk about some Greek words here. The ancient Greek word for democracy was actually a compound word, a combination of two words into one. The first is “demos,” which in ancient Greek means “people.” Note that it does not mean “person” or “Premier sitting at a kitchen table over the weekend.” It’s a pretty key component to the whole thing; it has to be plural. The second word in democracy is “kratos,” meaning power. If you combine the two words—" ],

We also need to ensure that the people do have a say in their electoral system, not just the people in power.", "If this bill passes as it currently is written today, it could have a damaging impact on many municipalities and towns that rely on volunteer firefighters. A question for you is this, Mr. Speaker: What if a fire breaks out during a debate in a municipality where a volunteer firefighter is running for local office? A fire truck pulls up outside to pick up the volunteer and firefighters who are inside to support their colleague who is running for office. The front door flies open and the volunteers in the crowd jump up to head outside, but as they look back at the stage, they notice that their friend isn’t able to help them join the fight. One of the volunteers calls back, “There’s a fire. Let’s go. Come on. Why aren’t you coming to help?” The volunteer firefighter candidate, according to this bill, says, “I can’t help because the Liberals passed Bill 181 without an amendment.”", "Speaker, that may be a bit humorous and hypothetical, but this type of situation would be possible if the bill passes as is. Bill 181 seeks to remove the leave-of-absence exemption for volunteer firefighters, meaning that if they run for municipal office, they are unable to volunteer for their community for a minimum of 13 weeks. We don’t want to see people forced between serving or saving their communities and their neighbours.", "In my riding of Chatham–Kent–Essex, we rely on approximately 325 volunteer firefighters across the municipality, specifically in Chatham-Kent. It takes a tremendous amount of commitment to be a volunteer firefighter in my riding, as it would take a tremendous amount of commitment for a volunteer firefighter in any of the ridings, really. You have to be willing to put in the work before you can be a volunteer.", "The auxiliary firefighter program is approximately seven months in duration and consists of 14 training sessions that are attended by all auxiliary candidates and rotated amongst Chatham-Kent’s volunteer stations. Sessions consist of minor to moderate firefighting knowledge and techniques. Once you’ve gotten that out of the way, you still need to meet the rest of the eligibility criteria before you can be considered for a volunteer position. It can take roughly a year, from start to finish, to become a volunteer firefighter.", "We don’t want to keep good people from seeking public office. In the case of a volunteer firefighter, their commitment to their communities is very clear. Considering the amount of time it takes to become a volunteer firefighter, forcing them to give up helping their community for a minimum of over three months if they want to seek public office seems somewhat ridiculous. The message this would send to these individuals would essentially be, “We’re glad you want to serve your community through public office, but to do it, you first have to stop serving your community.” Wait a minute: “We’re glad you want to serve your community through public office, but you have to do it by first stopping to serve your community”?" ],

Either way, we don’t want to force people to choose between volunteering for their communities to save lives and trying to make their communities better places by running for office. We do not want to see the leave-of-absence exemption removed for volunteer firefighters, and we are hopeful that the government will be willing to address this with a sensible amendment in committee.", "I’m hesitant to support any bill that has the potential to take volunteer firefighters away from any of the communities in my riding of Chatham-Kent–Essex. You know what, Speaker? I’ll bet you dollars for doughnuts—the old saying—that there isn’t one member in this Legislature who wouldn’t be hesitant to support taking away any volunteer firefighters from their riding as well. I sincerely hope that the other side—the government—hears this and sorts out that part of the bill. We cannot force people to choose between serving their communities and saving them.", "It isn’t just volunteer firefighters who should be concerned with other elements of this bill as well. Another major concern this bill has attempted to address is that municipal election campaigns are simply far too long. I remember being here in Toronto at Queen’s Park back in 2014 as the Toronto mayoral election campaign kicked off. I was taken aback at how early the campaign seemed to start.", "Despite the fact that the election itself took place on October 27 of that year, the campaign essentially lasted nearly a year, because registration of candidates began back on January 2. Then began the seemingly endless speculation about who would or would not be running. John Tory registered in February, with the eventual third-place finisher, Olivia Chow, entering the race a month later. By the time October came around, the city had been in campaign mode for 10 months. Clearly that’s far too long.", "Election campaigns of such great length discourage new participants from seeking office, as many are unable to fund a campaign for that long. That’s not what we want to see. Even the average person who has no intention of running for office deserves a break from campaigns from time to time.", "Numerous groups raised concerns about the length of municipal elections, including members of the PC caucus, with many saying, like I just said, that they’re far too long. Under Bill 181, registration for municipal elections will now begin on May 1 instead of January 1. That’s certainly less ridiculous than a 10-month campaign period.", "We support the move to shorten the length of municipal elections through moving the registration date forward a few months. However, we do have some significant concerns about the decision to move the nomination cut-off date to the fourth Friday in July instead of the second Friday in September. That’s roughly an extra month and half—close to two months. This will have a direct negative impact on people who want to run for council, and will actually result in an even longer writ period.", "Campaigns unofficially begin when candidates register, but other than what takes place in Toronto, most of the activity starts once the field of candidates is finalized after the registration cut-off date. Moving the cut-off date more than 13 weeks, or three months, ahead of the election date will have a couple of serious consequences. Firstly, it will mean that many qualified candidates simply will not seek office.", "I want my fellow members to recall when they first registered to become a candidate for public office. Some of my colleagues, in fact, may have great difficulty remembering that long ago, but there was still a time when each and every one of us decided to take that leap of faith and register as candidates to run for our party. We were fortunate, as all of us in this Legislature are, to have been voted in by our constituents. As I look around the Legislature, I just wonder how many current members registered their candidacy as far in advance as this bill would require. How many of us would not be standing here today if we were subjected to these requirements? A lot of deep soul-searching goes into deciding to run for office. It’s a decision that should not be taken lightly and is not an easy one to make.", "As our critic, the member for Oxford, astutely pointed out during his lead, this change would have an especially strong impact on municipal employees. By moving the registration cut-off period from six weeks prior to the election date to an outstanding 13 weeks, it will force municipal employees to be off the job for over three months if they want to seek public office. That would include firefighters and even police officers. In addition to municipal employees, this will have a negative impact on community leaders and other citizens who are considering seeking public office.", "We should be doing everything in our power to make running for office more accessible. We should be breaking down barriers, not building them up. These changes are incredibly worrisome. How many people actually take a three-month leave of absence from their job? How many people can afford to go unpaid for three months? This means that the vast majority of people will be unable to run for public office. This, Speaker, is incredibly concerning.", "What is also rather worrisome about this is that it will mean that even less people will consider seeking office, which narrows the pool of potential elected officials even further. Perhaps the government only wants certain types of people to be able to run for office: a political class with the resources to take extended leaves from work or the financial ability to go without pay for a few months.", "Maybe the government doesn’t want to make it easier for the average person to run for office. But if they truly share a commitment to open up public office for the entire public, not just a certain political class that can afford to run, then the Liberals will address this portion of the bill. The bill proposed by the Liberal government seeks to implement a method of determining governments that experts describe as typically benefiting parties like the Liberal Party, all of this without any required consent from impacted citizens. No individual or party can be trusted with single-handedly changing our electoral system, especially if it may have been written on the back of a napkin.", "Bill 181 would create new barriers to people seeking out public office, when we should be doing all we can do to get new ideas and perspectives in government. We need good, qualified people who care about making a difference—municipally, provincially, perhaps even federally as well. Speaker, unless there are, in fact, significant amendments made to this bill at the committee stage—and now I’m appealing to the government, because all committees are stacked with Liberals who can either say yea or nay to amendments; and if past performance is an indication of future performance, a lot of those amendments will be turned down if they’re offered by either opposition party.", "Again, having said that, I would be very much hesitant to support moving forward." ],

Certainly, from my perspective as an MPP for London, I know that my community is enthusiastic about the prospect of moving forward with ranked balloting for the municipal election in 2018. But that municipal election is more than two years in the future, and the timing of this bill raises some questions, quite frankly. It was introduced on April 4, in the midst of the maelstrom of controversy that we saw over the Liberals and their campaign donations—the questions that were asked about what big money buys from the government in terms of responding with policy changes or legislative changes. Some people have asked whether this bill was an effort to change the channel, to deflect attention away from campaign donations at the provincial level and instead focus at the municipal level.", "The bill does include an option for a municipal council to introduce prohibitions on campaign donations by unions and corporations. This is only an option, however, and there is some concern that municipalities may not want to take up that option because the bill also links campaign donations to the right to express an opinion on an issue. So only those who are eligible to make donations are eligible to express an opinion on an issue, which could actually stifle public expression in this province." ],

The question is about math. Now, I’m not suggesting that I’m a math expert, but I fail to understand how starting an election campaign on January 2 versus May 1, with the same election date, lengthens the time of the writ period. I hope he could explain that, because frankly, we saw in the last election where people were campaigning from January 2 right to the last minute, which they’re allowed to do. Now they’re not going to be able to register or spend any money until May 1. So if he could please explain about the Tory math that he’s using, it would be helpful.", "He talked about ranked ballots. It’s probably not something that they would support, but we’re leaving the option to the municipality. Many times, I’ve heard members from the opposition say that they do respect municipal government as a fair level of government, a mature level of government. That’s exactly what we’re trying to do: We’re trying to allow that option, but those municipalities will have that option to exercise it. There are a number of ways they can do it: by having a public meeting, an open house, and, if they so wish, even a referendum.", "So those options are there.

I’m not standing here and saying that because we’ve had it that long, it’s perfect and there’s no need for it to change. We’ve had changes in many minor ways. But when you’re going to change dramatically, I mean completely, the method by which you elect representatives, then you need to go to a referendum, which is what happened—to the credit of the former Premier, Dalton McGuinty—in 2007, when there was this big hullabaloo about mixed-member proportional, and they went to a referendum. They allowed the people of Ontario to make the determination as to whether we would make those kinds of dramatic, critical changes to how we elected representatives to this chamber.", "The people of Ontario said no—not the government; not the Premier; not the Premier’s office; the people of Ontario said no. So we need to have the same system in place if you’re going to have ranked ballots.", "No municipality is asking for the ranked ballot. Toronto had asked, and they’ve withdrawn that request.

My constituents are more concerned about the cost of hydro rising, the continued sell-off of Hydro One, the cuts to health care, the cuts to education, the cuts to autism services. This particular piece of legislation is really not on the radar. I’m hoping that after some discussion today, it might spark some interest from my constituents, so I’ll be able to get some feedback, but really, at this time, my constituents have pressing concerns around access to health care and education and such.", "I think members of this chamber will agree that this is an ambitious piece of legislation, but the objectives are, overall, good. New Democrats support reforms that strengthen our municipal democracy and that get the influence of big money out of politics. Now, as they say, the devil is in the details. Decoding these details, consulting on legislation—all of this takes time. And I’m not talking about the nine days that we’ve had since they tabled this legislation.

We hear the government side say they’re consulting; we hear them stand up with their speaking notes and talk about who they’ve spoken to and how these people are in support. They don’t actually talk about the number of people they’ve spoken to or those people who aren’t in support. They tend to play the game so that everything they bring up is in their favour, and then they try to silence the opposition members who are charged with bringing forward the voice of our communities. Really, that’s saying to the people in our communities, “Your opinion doesn’t matter. We only want to hear from the people who are going to take our side, the people who are going to say that we’re right and are going to back us when we ram this legislation through.” I think that’s really unfortunate, because it’s the government’s job to listen to the opposition, to listen to our constituents and act on behalf of all Ontarians, not just those who agree with them and not just the party faithful, those members of their own government. I think it’s really important that they listen to everybody.", "I also think it’s interesting that, as other members have mentioned, this legislation came forward April 4, right in the midst of a controversy over the Liberal government’s own fundraising practices. So again we see that something bubbles to the surface, something they don’t want people to know about, and so they make a big announcement or they bring through legislation to try to hide the fact that something’s coming to the surface that people aren’t going to be very happy about. I think that’s really unfortunate. That’s not really being open and transparent, as they like to claim to be.", "Speaker, Ontarians, stakeholders and other organizations impacted by this legislation need to be consulted, and once they’re consulted, they need to be listened to. Too often, this government participates in surface-level consultations. This is when they’ve already made up their mind on an issue and then simply go through the motions of consultations, without actually listening to the people in the province or listening to the elected members in opposition that are bringing forward the voice of people in this province.", "There’s a saying that says, “Just because we have spoken doesn’t mean we’ve communicated.” I think people are getting really tired of feeling like they’ve come to government, and they’ve spoken to the government, but they haven’t really communicated because the government side, the Liberal side, is not willing to listen to them. They’re not willing to take into consideration those people that don’t support their ideas or those people that come forward and say, “That seems like a good idea, but we would like to see changes. We’d like to see it tweaked a bit.” So I think people are getting really tired of wasting their time and their energy, frankly, speaking to a government that seems to want to do whatever it is they want to do, and they’re not willing to listen to anybody else.", "I think we just have to look—just recently, in fact. There are many examples; for instance, the pre-budget consultations. The consultations took place. The government pretended to be listening to people. People wasted their time, energy and, in some cases, money to travel, to prepare for the consultations, to come to these consultations, only to find out that, before the report came from the committee, the budget was not only already drawn up, it was printed, it was translated into French and it was ready to go. We didn’t receive the report until after the budget was already tabled. I think that’s a clear example of the government ramming through their agenda rather than listening to the people of Ontario.", "Another issue: provincial and demonstration school consultations. Now, I’m happy to announce that, today, the minister said that she would reopen enrolment for these schools for the 2016-17 school year. But I do have to point out that when she was speaking to the media earlier, she would not commit to actually keeping these programs open for that entire school year—" ],

You get a lot of exercise, up and down out of your chair, when he’s in the room.", "I was tying it back to the bill, in fact: We’re talking about consultation with the public—talking to municipalities, talking to voters, consulting and actually listening. I was tying that into the fact that, when we’re looking at school closures, there’s a process that they say has taken place with consultations, but they haven’t actually been listening to those people they’re consulting with, just like they haven’t really given people an opportunity to consult on this particular piece of legislation. The same thing has happened with the child care regulations that they were going to ram through: They weren’t going to listen to the people of Ontario, just like with this bill.", "They bring it forward during a controversy—one on their side, around fundraising—and nine days later, we are on day 3 of second reading. In nine days, we’ve made it to second reading, day 3, on a bill that—there is no possible way that the broader public could possibly have been made aware of this bill, read the bill, formulated questions or concerns or given appropriate feedback. There’s no way the municipalities have had time to look at these and give feedback. So I think it’s really important, as much as the Minister of Transportation likes to get up on a point of order and try and get me to stop talking about it. There is no way that people have had an opportunity to really consult on this. I think that’s a clear example of trying to stifle conversation on it, in fact.", "The provisions in this bill allow municipalities to use ranked ballots. School board trustees will not be subject to the option of ranked ballots at this time, but the door has been left open for that to change in the future. Municipalities have the options of banning corporate and union donations. Clerks must prepare an accessibility plan before election day as well as post an election accessibility report. There are simplified campaign finance rules and shorter campaign periods—starting in May instead of January.", "Talking about third-party advertising, there is no lower threshold below which smaller third parties would be exempt from the third-party advertising restrictions. All other Canadian jurisdictions set a lower spending threshold of $500 or $1000 in their third-party advertising laws. So there has been no adjustment here. Third parties that incur advertising expenses, including those that spend just a few dollars, face compliance obligations similar to those of a candidate.", "There are concerns that a municipality may be less likely to ban corporate and union donations if they must silence community groups at the same time. I think that’s a key piece when people feel they can’t express an opinion. If something comes forward that they don’t agree with, this legislation could potentially stifle their ability to come forward and say, “We have concerns about that.”", "It’s really muddying the waters between a person’s ability to freely speak about what they support and don’t support. I think that ties back perfectly to something I said earlier about the government only talking about people who have come forward—their friends, maybe—in support of proposed legislation, but they don’t talk about people who don’t support it. My concern is that this is going to stifle the voices of Ontarians, rather than opening up opportunities for them to be fully consulted and make a difference in legislation that comes through this House.", "There are other provisions. There is no tightening of enforcement to stop candidates from overspending and no consideration of voting rights for permanent residents. To not even consider voting rights for permanent residents is very problematic, especially for people in my riding of Windsor West. When I’m in the community campaigning, or even just knocking on doors checking in on my constituents, I hear how frustrated permanent residents are about this issue. They are members of my community and want to participate in the democratic process, and it’s really frustrating when their spouses are citizens and are able to vote. You have some members of a household who are able to participate in the democratic process and others who cannot.", "I can tell you that my riding—Windsor itself is very diverse, but I think that we in Windsor West probably experience the most diversity. We have a lot of people who choose to come to Canada and live in Ontario—more specifically, in Windsor and in my riding of Windsor West—and I can tell you that my office gets many calls from people who are of the impression that because they can’t vote, it means they don’t have representation. I think it’s unfortunate for them to think they don’t have a voice because they are not able to vote in a provincial election.", "I think it becomes even more confusing for people, and frankly more disappointing, when they’ve chosen Ontario as their home and are made permanent residents, but they don’t have a say in the decisions we make in this House or the decisions that are made at the municipal level. I think it’s a very important piece of democracy that those people who choose to come to Ontario and choose a city to live in—whether it’s Windsor or Toronto or a northern city, wherever they choose to live—feel like they’re part of that democratic process and get to say, “This is who I would like to be my representative provincially, this is who I’d like my city councillor to be, and this is who I’d like my mayor or my school board trustees to be.” I think it’s very unfortunate that that wasn’t considered in the legislation.", "Again, we shouldn’t be giving people the idea that they can’t have a say or that they don’t have a say. We want a government that claims to be open and transparent, and we actually want them to be open and transparent. We expect the same from our municipal partners. We need people to know that if they’re not happy with the performance of someone who is an elected official, they have the right to cast their vote for someone else the next time around. They need to know that they do, indeed, have a say in democracy.", "Part of the issue is that third parties that incur advertising expenses, including individuals who spend just a few dollars, face compliance obligations that are similar to those of a candidate. If they make a mistake with their paperwork, an individual or small community group could be banned from advertising in the next election and could even face a fine of up to $25,000 for an individual or $50,000 for a corporation, as well as a six-month prison term. Imagine that, Speaker: Someone who doesn’t really know the legislation, someone who’s not clear on the legislation, makes an honest mistake, and there are very stiff penalties for that.", "People need to know that the government is doing everything possible to make legislation clear and make the rules clear, because I think you will find that the majority of people really want to do the right thing. They want to follow the rules, they want to do the right thing and they certainly don’t want to be breaking the law. I think that when you’re ramming through legislation like this, and there hasn’t really been fair consultation and it’s not clear what everybody’s rights and obligations are, you may find more and more people who are inadvertently breaking the rules. They’re facing very stiff penalties: $25,000 for an individual who might just accidentally break the rules, and they could end up in prison for it. We could go on about the prison system and how it would be unfortunate for someone to accidentally break the law and not even realize they’ve done that, and end up in a prison system that is already overcrowded and understaffed, but if I was to go on about that, I’m sure the Minister of Transportation would get up on a point of order and point out that I’m out of line—because they don’t want to hear about those issues either, frankly.", "The other unfortunate piece of this, the flaw in it, is that Bill 181 inexplicably links the right to promote an issue to the right to make a campaign contribution. Since Toronto bans corporate union donations, Bill 181 would silence all Toronto NGOs, charities and community groups that speak out on an issue during a six-month campaign, to oppose the proposal. Again, this is actually potentially stifling democracy, by not allowing people to voice their concerns. It’s the government’s way of saying, “If you’re in opposition to something, we don’t want to hear about it.” I think that’s unfortunate, because that’s how we grow and we learn. That’s how you come forward with better legislation. That’s how municipalities make better decisions for the people that they represent. They want to hear the good and they want to hear the bad, and often, out of the bad they get suggestions. They get good suggestions, and sometimes they’re not-so-good suggestions. But often they’ll get good suggestions from the people who live in that municipality on how to make the municipality better, and I think to put rules in place that are actually banning people from being able to say, “I don’t like something,” is a little heavy-handed. I think it’s our obligation, as elected officials, whether it’s at the municipal level, the provincial level, the federal level, school boards—our job is to listen to both the good and the bad, listen to those people who agree with us and those people who don’t agree with us.", "Not everybody has the opportunity that the Minister of Transportation does to stand up and say, “Point of order: I think they’re out of line. Let’s bring it back.” We need people to have that right to say, “I don’t agree with what you’re saying. Let’s sit down and talk about it. Hear my side of it and maybe, just maybe, you might change your mind.” Every elected official needs to be open-minded, willing to listen to the people. Whether it’s someone who has voted for you or not, you are elected to represent them. We need to make sure that when people are voting, they have the opportunity to say to candidates, “I don’t like something that you’ve spoken about. I don’t like a position you’re taking. I’d like you to explain it to me. I’d like to explain to you why I don’t like it,” and give a candidate the opportunity to change their position on something.", "I think that a municipality would be far less likely to ban corporate and union donations if they must silence community groups at the same time. I don’t think any municipality really wants to shut down the voice of their community, the people in the community. We wouldn’t have city councillors, we wouldn’t have mayors, we wouldn’t have MPPs, we wouldn’t have MPs, if it wasn’t for our constituents. I don’t think that any municipality wants to completely shut out the voice of their communities; maybe the Liberal government does, but I don’t think the municipalities want to, and I think that would be a very unfortunate side effect of this legislation here.", "Again, there’s no tightening of enforcement to stop candidates from overspending their limit, and there is no consideration of voting rights for permanent residents. I think that putting an idea forward is one thing; follow-through is another. If you really want to reform the way elections are run, the way campaigns are done, it really has to be a democratic process. You need to have a lot of people at the table and take the time to have these conversations. It’s not something you do on a napkin at your kitchen table; it’s not something you do when you have friends over for dinner: figure out how you’re going to change the laws that affect thousands of people. It’s something that takes a great deal of thought and a great deal of consultation. I don’t think, nor do many of my colleagues, whether in my caucus or the PC caucus, that there has been any real consultation done on this bill, considering that it has been nine days since it has been introduced. It couldn’t possibly have been vetted properly through the municipalities and through the constituents that it’s going to affect.", "Thank you for your time, Speaker." ],

Though it was my first time running as a candidate, I did get to—not surprisingly—experience the ins and outs of a number of the issues that are addressed in this legislation first-hand, in that case.", "I can tell you, Speaker, that a number of the initiatives that will empower our municipal partners—for example, some of the campaign finance reform initiatives, the timing of the electoral calendar and other initiatives that are contained in Bill 181—will actually go a long way, perhaps, in a most transformational way, towards making that system of municipal campaigns across the 444 communities—well, I’ll say “443” because, in some respects, the city of Toronto already has some of these powers. For the remainder of the communities across the province of Ontario, bringing about a level playing field and bringing about a certain degree of equality and parity with respect to what already exists, in some respects, in the city of Toronto is a good thing.", "I don’t have enough time to get into the issue of whether or not we should be considering extending voting rights to permanent residents, but I will say that I don’t personally support that. I think the bar to becoming a citizen in this country is relatively low for those who are interested in seeking that outcome, which then, of course, gives you the chance to vote in our election campaigns.", "I look forward to the rest of the debate." ],

I spoke for 20 minutes yesterday, and I’m going to just repeat a few things here.", "It’s definitely a big, big concern that I want to get on the record again: No government should be making unilateral changes to the system under which they would be getting elected. It’s just inappropriate that one party would ever think that they should be able to do this and that they actually have the knowledge and the wisdom. It should certainly be a case where all three parties are around the table. Very similarly, my leader, Patrick Brown, has asked to make sure that we have a select committee to talk about fundraising and third-party advertising going forward.", "I find it very interesting, Mr. Speaker, that this government has proposed a bill that actually talks about third-party advertising and yet they voted it down three times. My colleague Ted Arnott, my colleague Rick Nicholls and I have all presented third-party advertising private members’ bills in this House, and that government, under the leadership of Premier Wynne, voted unanimously against them. Yet now, all of a sudden, they think that they should bring this out and that there are issues. So I’m a little torn about why, all of a sudden, it’s a thing they want but they didn’t do it when they had the opportunity back in October. As recently as October, the elections officer for Ontario, Greg Essensa, had brought that in two or three of his reports, saying it was a key priority.", "I’m very concerned that they would actually think that anything that’s going to change the fundamental democratic right of a voter voting for who is going to be representing them could be done by one party anywhere, regardless of what political stripe might think that—but especially with the trust of this government and what we’ve had over the last number of years that I’ve been here.", "Mr. Speaker, this bill with ranked ballots—our fear, again, is that it’s not something that should be done overnight. There’s suspicion that they would be doing it for their own advantage. I don’t necessarily say that, but that’s what I hear in Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound. So we definitely want the people to have a referendum and a say." ],

There were a lot of interesting things happening and interesting characters in the race.", "From time to time, even at a small radio station in eastern Ontario, we would have polls. I know that one of the things we experience on a larger scale at the provincial level and, of course, the federal election that we just went through a few months back, is that there’s a lot of polling that goes on. It’s fun for broadcasters to follow the polls; that’s for sure. I think it probably drives people crazy in their homes—all the phone calls they’re getting from the myriad of pollsters that there are out there. But the bottom line is that these horse races are kind of fun. They make great fodder for radio talk shows and political panels. We get to talk about who is up and who is down in the polls. We get to talk about those polls over the water cooler as well, and who is leading in each electoral district and these kinds of things.", "Who didn’t watch with a little bit of nervous anxiety a couple of years ago when John Tory fended off challenges from both the right and the left? Who doesn’t like talking about the momentum that pollsters are observing as they incessantly bug us in our homes by calling night after night? The answer to all this, really, is the voters. While the talking heads on radio and TV love it, most voters really don’t think too much about it.", "I’ve been here for close to five years now, and the only meeting or communication I ever had on this issue was with the people from the Ranked Ballot Initiative of Toronto. They’re the only people I’ve ever talked to about this issue in this building, and I’ve never talked to anybody in the riding. It’s just not something that people are interested in talking about.", "My constituents ask me about a whole bunch of other things. They talk to me about the state of our hospitals. They talk to me about the state of health care or soaring electricity rates. They talk to me about keeping demonstration schools open. I actually can’t remember a single time that a person who wasn’t making money in the political world talked to me about changing the rules of the game. When a news outlet in Thunder Bay took a poll on this issue, only 17% of people wanted the system changed.", "There are multiple instances in the United States where a municipality has unilaterally changed its voting system, fought an election under that system, and then, the first opportunity after the election, went back to the first-past-the-post system, because it works.", "As we’ve seen in this House repeatedly, this government comes down on the side of those in power instead of ensuring that our democracy is protected against being manipulated by those in power. That’s why I can’t see myself necessarily supporting this bill, although there are some good things in this bill. But I can’t see myself supporting this bill unless municipalities have to have a referendum before changing the voting system. It only makes sense; these are the rules of the game. If whoever gets the thimble automatically gets hotels on Park Place and Boardwalk, there isn’t a lot of point in playing Monopoly if those are the rules that we’re playing by. We’re here to reflect the issues, concerns and values of our constituents that we hear about on a daily basis, not to rig the rules to protect the right of a precious few with the levers of power.", "Is our democracy perfect? It absolutely isn’t; of course not. We’d like more people to vote. On this, I agree with the mayor of Belleville, who said, “I don’t think the system is broken.... Someone has to figure out how to get more people out to vote. I’m flabbergasted that people don’t exercise their right.”", "This isn’t going to do it. This has nothing to do with getting more people to vote. As a matter of fact, and we’ve heard a lot about it here this afternoon in the House, it’s probably going to make it more complicated for people to vote.", "There are some good issues in this legislation—" ],

We all do, even if that means that it takes a little bit longer to canvass a poll at election time. My volunteers get on my case all the time because I’ll have 10- and 15-minute conversations on the doorsteps when I’m canvassing. I know many members in the House are probably the same way. You’ll be out knocking on doors, you meet a fine gentleman who’s mowing his lawn, and you end up talking to him for 10 or 15 minutes about whatever it is that concerns him. I can tell you that it’s never about changing the electoral system. It’s always about something else: the price of gas for his lawn mower, or the fact that he can no longer use Weed Man anymore to make that grass grow green and get rid of the thistles. It’s always something, but it’s never, never about electoral reform.", "The reason I love to go door to door and talk to people during an election campaign is because those are the real conversations—and those are the conversations that this government hasn’t had when it comes to developing or modernizing the electoral system in Ontario. You have to meet with real people and have those real conversations. It’s one thing to talk to AMO, the Association of Municipalities of Ontario, and get a general theme as to what they might like, but at the end of the day—and I keep coming back to that R-word—it’s all about the referendum, before we actually put changes in place, and it shouldn’t be up to a majority government in Ontario to decide which way that happens.", "Nothing I do better informs my work than actually meeting with real people and having conversations on people’s doorsteps, and I suppose many of us would say the same thing. So if we can agree that we’re best informed by the people who send us to this place, and if we can agree that they should be the ones whose interests are served by the rules of the game, then why don’t we let them decide if they want the rules to change? What better, more important decision can we seek the public’s opinion on than whether the rules of democracy should change?", "We have a hard enough time now getting people to vote. We have a hard enough time convincing people that the operations of the political system are done in their interest. If the members opposite are so sure that the number is greater than the 17% who told Thunder Bay News Watch that they support the change to ranked ballots, then they can prove it.", "In 2018, every municipality is printing ballots. Those interested in changing their electoral system can add the question to the bottom of the ballot and let the voters decide. How could there possibly be any objection to this? It would be right there at the bottom of their 2018 municipal election ballot: “Do you believe that we should adopt da da da da?”—and I can’t wait to see how Hansard puts that in the Hansard.", "There is one thing, though: We’re being told that we can’t hold a referendum because there’s a referendum bias. We’re told that referendums favour the status quo. People who oppose referendums on electoral reform tell us that we can’t have a referendum because it’s unfair, and if you believe that government is the solution to literally every problem, then I suppose that makes sense. I certainly don’t believe that, because in order to believe that government is the solution to literally every problem, you have to believe that the people running the government know better and that only they are capable of solving a complex problem.", "There’s no doubt that informing voters about electoral reform is difficult, but since when has difficulty ever been a reason not to do something? “It’s hard” is a description but it’s not an excuse. We all live and die by this rule every election cycle. It’s hard to convince people the deficit is important or that it isn’t. It’s hard to convince people to reform the beverage alcohol system or not. Anyone who has lived through a 36-day writ period knows that convincing people is hard. It puts miles on your boots or your shoes and puts lines on your face, depending on how the campaign goes. It takes time, it takes money and it takes a heck of a lot of effort to get elected. “It’s hard” has never been an accepted reason anywhere not to do something. If you really believe in it, you tend not to care how hard it is to do, which brings me to why we end up talking about this issue.", "Recent examples in the United States have demonstrated that electoral reform discussions tend to pop up when people get election results they don’t necessarily like—I know Aaron Sorkin has been quoted quite a bit in the House by different members of the Legislature—but sometimes, in a democracy, other people win.", "Traditionally, when we change the rules of our democracy, we try to do so in a way that advantages or disadvantages no particular party. That’s to keep those who may have a massive conflict of interest from unilaterally rigging the system. But as I said earlier, we’re seeing this as part of an emerging trend whenever the rules of democracy are discussed.", "All three parties in this Legislature agree on reforming election financing laws, and there is a section in this bill on election financing—I’m sure there is—third-party advertising, anyway. Does the Premier allow it to be an organic process? Of course, we’re talking about something completely different here, but I know the Speaker will give me a little bit of latitude. All three parties agree on reforming election financing laws. Does the Premier allow it to be an organic process developed by a committee with equal partisan representation?" ],

I think that’s what we’re seeing here. A number of speakers here this afternoon have talked about the fact that, when a sitting government changes the rules, they’re obviously going to be tempted to change those rules to benefit them down the road.", "The other thing is—and I go back to what I was saying earlier—this is not a priority for people. I know it’s something that has to be done, as the member opposite indicated, at the end of every municipal election. There was a lot of talk about the idea that maybe the Legislature would be prorogued after this three-week period. I think a lot of people were believing that that was where we were going to head, that the Legislature was going to be prorogued. There wasn’t new legislation on the order paper for us to discuss. And, then, all of a sudden—boom—there’s Bill 181, which appears out of the blue. There wasn’t a whole lot of consultation or discussion with the people of Ontario about this. But here we are, debating it.", "What generally happens when we have bills here in the Legislature is that we have the initial debate at second reading; then we have a closure motion; then it will be rushed into committee; then it will be even more swiftly moved out of committee, with as little consultation or input from the public as possible; and, wham, Bob’s your uncle, the next thing you know, we’ve got this passed into law in Ontario, with very, very little consultation. I fear that’s what might happen here.", "That’s why we’ve been talking about select committees and equal representation on these committees, or committees that would have the Chief Electoral Officer having some input as well, or even, in some committees that we’ve been talking about, the Integrity Commissioner involved in that as well.", "The member opposite talks about wishful thinking; it really is wishful thinking.

The bottom line here is that the SS Liberal battleship is taking on water. There are a lot of holes in that ship right now. They’re making it up on the go; they’re making it up on the fly. They’re quickly running out of life preservers; they’re pulling them from anywhere they can possibly find one of those life preservers.", "They’re not just making it up on the fly, they’re making it up at the kitchen table. We had a couple of flip-flops today on daycare and demonstration schools. We’ve had different changes being made over the last couple of days on other issues as well. Suddenly, we had this come-to-reality moment when we decided that we had to change the election financing reforms in the province of Ontario.", "Everything that we’re seeing is that last grasp. We’re hanging on to the railing of the SS Liberal battleship as it’s starting to go down. We’re doing everything we can to hold on to power. We’re throwing legislation in when everybody thought we were going to prorogue just so that we don’t get a bad story about proroguing. Now, we’re getting bad stories about all kinds of other things.", "This Liberal government is taking on water so fast, they’re doing everything they can. In this case, they’re afraid to consult the people on a referendum on major electoral change in Ontario." ],

  "text" : [ "Thank you, Speaker. It’s always an honour to be able to stand in this House and debate issues that are of importance to the people of the province and the people of Timiskaming–Cochrane. Today, it’s Bill 181, Municipal Elections Modernization Act. I can honestly say that since I’ve been elected—for five years—I have only had one person approach me in the riding regarding any changes to the Municipal Elections Act. That person—I’ll give a shout-out to the Green candidate in the last election—was really enthused about things like this, but no one else. And again, the Green candidate, Max, was in the political class. Politics is really important to Max.", "This isn’t, in my opinion, an issue that is burning in the hearts of the people of Timiskaming–Cochrane. I hope that it is an issue that is burning in the hearts of other areas, because it’s not in mine. Having said that, Ontario is a vast province with vast issues, and I’m happy to be able to lend my voice to it for a few minutes.", "But first, before I start on the issues about it, I’d like to give a shout-out to municipal politicians, and specifically the mayors, reeves and councillors across the province. In my riding, I have 26 mayors and reeves, and I’ve got a bunch more roads boards, because I have, as a lot of people in northern Ontario have, unorganized townships that have no government, which is a whole other concept.", "I’d like to give a shout-out to all of them and specifically to some of them—in one case, the mayor of Cochrane, who represents his town. He also ran provincially. He was a worthy opponent. We don’t always agree, but Mr. Politis and I always work together for the benefit of the people of Cochrane, as I do with my other mayors.", "I’d like to back up for a second. I heard the chief whip of the Liberal side, as I was listening today, say that she hopes this bill would bring more female representation into municipal politics. I really don’t know how this bill is going to do that, but I would like to give a shout-out to Joanne Savage, the mayor of West Nipissing, and to be the first to announce that—you know how in the fall we shut the Legislature down and we go to the plowing match? Well, in 2019, we might have to shut it down for a bit longer, because we’re going to go to West Nipissing to the plowing match. That’s due in large part to the hard work of Mayor Savage and her council. I would like to give a shout-out for that, because that will be the second time the plowing match comes to northern Ontario. It was great the first time, and it might just be greater the second time. It’s a really great achievement.", "I spent a bit of time as a councillor in a small township. I was a councillor for 12 years. There have been a few comments here that municipal politicians are the closest to the people, and they are. I recall, when I first got elected here, that we had a class come—I believe it was a grade 6 class from Cochrane. I’m sure all of you will know this picture: They go to the ground staircase, they line all the kids up, and we talk to the kids. I don’t know how everyone else does it, but usually I ask, “Do you have any questions?” And this teacher had prepped the kids, because this grade 6 guy—I think it was grade 6—asked me what the difference was between the three levels of government. The teacher had done some prep work there, because in grade 6, I really didn’t care about the three levels of government." ],

I think I can handle that.” I said, “If there’s a pothole on Railway Street in Cochrane, who do you call?” They said, “You call the mayor,” because that’s municipal. That’s a municipal road. I said, “If there’s a pothole on Highway 11, who do you call?” They looked around, and I said, “You call the province. You can call me.” I said, “If there’s a pothole in a country you’ve never heard of, who do you call?” You call the federal government. The tour guides thought it was funny. The kids got it.", "But the moral of that story is, the people who are the closest to the voter are municipal politicians. And this bill makes a lot of changes to how these politicians, or how these people who are candidates, who put themselves up for office—it makes a lot of changes.", "I was very encouraged, and I’m going to hold the Minister of Agriculture to this—in his response, he said that this bill is going to hit the road and travel to all corners of Ontario. Well, it should, because—and the member for London West has mentioned it a couple of times—consulting before the draft is written is a good thing, but consulting with the draft is much more important.", "When I read that there is some question of whether a volunteer fireman can be a volunteer fireman and campaign as a candidate at the same time, that is a huge issue in my riding, because there was a couple of reeves who would have had to pick. That’s something you might not pick up on in Toronto. I talked to the CUPE people today, and they’ve got a couple of issues with the professional firemen. Quite frankly, I didn’t know anything about that issue, because we have very few professional firefighters in my riding. Out of the 26, I think I’ve got two municipalities with professionals. So that’s something that might not get picked up on here.", "I’m sure that there’s a bunch of other things that maybe didn’t get picked up. That’s why all bills should travel but, specifically, this one, because it affects people. They might not even know how it impacts them until after it’s done. A few of the things that have happened with this government in the last couple of days, changing—people rising up and saying, “Wait, this is wrong,” and then backtracking: I don’t think that’s necessarily a bad thing. It would be a lot better if you identified the problems before you announced them. It would be better if you figured out the seniors prescription problem before you announced it. Hopefully, with bills like this, you will actually travel and take the time to do it right.", "One thing I have to put on the record with this bill is that most people don’t—and I don’t blame them for this. People don’t really think about the difference between the levels of government; they don’t. As we’re talking about changing the finance rules for the provincial sector—and we certainly have our disagreements on how the government is proceeding with that. This bill, throwing it into the mix as an issue, muddies the waters. Now, whether that’s intentional or not, I don’t know, but it does.", "The average person out there does not really—when people come to my office and they want something fixed, they really don’t care if it’s municipal, provincial or federal. They have a problem; they want it fixed, right? So when you throw this bill in the mix, as that other stuff is floating around, it’s going to muddy the waters. Whether it’s intentional or not, I don’t know. Why I wonder if it could be intentional is—well, look at some budgets. Beer in grocery stores; sell Ontario Hydro. Beer in grocery stores—oh, by the way. Was that intentional? I don’t know. I really don’t know, but it’s the same type of issue.", "We’ve got election finance issues provincially, and we’re going to muddy the waters by throwing this in: “See all the good things we’re doing municipally.” The people outside are not going to recognize the difference. If that’s intentional, it’s truly scary, and I hope the government will take that very seriously." ],

In my own community, there is a very similar situation. The vast majority of fire protection/suppression occurs through the use of volunteer firefighters. I think it would be a terrible shame if these volunteers—these leaders in our communities—were basically shut out from running for public office, simply because there’s an arbitrary rule of a three-month ban. I have issues with that, as well.", "I have been elected since 2007. For those of you who were around during the 2007 general election, you will recall that there was a referendum. We had a very public debate and discussion about changes to the electoral system, and the public spoke. I think that call for referendum, that need to make sure that people are hearing all of the debates—pro and con; for and against—needs to happen when you’re making these kind of fundamental changes to how we elect our municipal representatives.", "I do have concerns that, again, this bill would allow that to proceed without that very important step. To me, that’s probably the biggest concern that I have with this piece of legislation. There is an arbitrariness to sitting politicians, who, by their very nature, are going to make it easier for themselves, not for people who are seeking additional office." ],

So they welcomed that provision of the bill.", "The unfortunate thing is that they have not had an opportunity to comment on the other sections of the bill that really raise concerns. We have heard from stakeholder organizations and from legal experts that there is a possibility that the provisions of the bill that deal with third-party advertising and restrictions on third-party advertising could have the potential of silencing individuals, NGOs, charities and community organizations who want to express an opinion on an issue that they are concerned about during the municipal campaign period. We will need to do a lot more analysis and research to understand the implications of those provisions.", "The member from Timiskaming–Cochrane and others in this House have talked about the danger of rushing through legislation when you have a majority Parliament. I myself responded to Bill 132, the Sexual Violence and Harassment Action Plan Act. I brought in 32 amendments; not a single amendment passed.

Is he aware that over 3,400 submissions were received on this very issue? We listened to the public, to municipal councils and to their staff across the province.

I was interested in knowing what my mayor, Berry Vrbanovic, had to say, as well as our regional chair—we have two levels of government there—Ken Seiling. He’s the chair in Waterloo region. They both told me that they very much support many of the proposals that are in Bill 181. In particular, they are looking at shortening the election period—rather than having to start on January 1, moving it to May 1. They’re looking forward to a shorter campaign period, and I can’t say that I blame them. That came from Berry Vrbanovic. Ken Seiling, our chair, also believes that a shortened election period is a great idea. I contacted them myself and I listened to them, and I’m happy to share that information with you, and I encourage all of my colleagues to do the same. Reach out to your local municipal politicians and find out what they think, if you haven’t already.", "Another issue that they’re very concerned about is the low voter turnout in local elections.

This is also favoured by my regional chair and by the mayor in my community.", "They are very supportive of many of the other items that we are talking about.

What I’m saying is, if you want true consultation on something like this, people have to be able to see what’s being proposed, and then they can have an educated discussion on what is being proposed, and then you could make amendments that would make the bill better. But that hasn’t been the practice of this government, as far I’ve seen, because amendment after amendment is wiped out, rejected summarily without discussion—just bang, bang, bang. That’s how committee goes: bang, bang, bang. Well, that’s not really how good legislation is made.", "They’re a majority government. They have won the right to govern, but they should have won the right to govern responsibly, and that is what’s being missed. If they were truly governing responsibly, at this point they wouldn’t have to do all this backtracking; people wouldn’t have to get so upset about demonstration schools. Hopefully, the government will realize it with autism and grandfather these people—because you don’t get rid of the list by just throwing the people off and saying, “Oh, the list is gone.” That’s not how it works. Change how you do things—that’s fine—but the people who are stuck in the middle should be grandfathered. You can’t just eliminate them.

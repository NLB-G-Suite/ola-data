Cheri, of course, knows a lot of talented musicians. She told her caucus that she had a band coming. Her caucus thought it was the Barenaked Ladies. I think they were shocked when one by one we came down the staircase and they saw these three Tories standing in Cheri DiNovo’s living room to sing a very-off-key song. But you know what? John Yakabuski knows 6,000 songs right up here, so it was really good. We came down and we had this song, and it was our group that came back together again. It was the three of us as well as three New Democratic members, and we sang for the caucus. They still laugh about it. Taras and I were talking about it last week—I apologize for using the member’s name, Speaker. But we came down, and they actually said we were better than the Barenaked Ladies. I can’t tell you the song because it was at the expense of the governing party. I don’t think they would be surprised.", "I just wanted to say that one of the things that the Premier and the leader of the third party talked about is the humanity of this woman, this wonderful MPP, who has—right up until the last week that she served here—passed a private member’s bill that I was proud to co-sponsor. So to you, my friend, I look forward to seeing you grace these halls as a clergyperson, but also as a friend to every member here.", "To that, I want to conclude by wishing her a merry Christmas as well as to all my colleagues." ],

  "text" : [ "Mr. Speaker, to you, your wife and your family, I extend a merry Christmas and happy holidays.", "It’s an honour to rise in the House today to acknowledge the over 800,000 hard-working Ontarians who wake up each and every day to work in our province’s innovative agri-food sector. The people who work in Ontario’s agri-food sector are innovative, passionate and, indeed, determined.", "That passion was on display earlier this week when the Premier and I welcomed more than 100 representatives from across our province’s agri-food sector at the 13th Premier’s Agri-Food Summit. The theme of this year’s summit was “Growing Ontario’s Agri-Food Sector at Home and Abroad.” The summit reinforced how important two-way agri-food trade is between Ontario and the United States, and how our province is poised to become a global hub for agri-food research and innovation. The United Nations tells us that by the year 2050, there will be nine billion people in the world to feed.", "We were delighted to welcome United States government representatives, and friends of mine, director Jamie Clover Adams from the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, and Russell Redding, the Secretary of Agriculture from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. We also welcomed a very special guest, Canada’s deputy ambassador to the United States, Kirsten Hillman, to Toronto to participate in a panel discussion on two-way trade, where we’re continuing to foster our strong and productive trading relationship. We also extended an invitation to my colleagues from Haldimand–Norfolk and Timiskaming–Cochrane.", "Our government recognized the work of local innovators whose ideas and passion are helping to grow and strengthen the province’s agri-food sector.", "As we do every year, we also took the opportunity to recognize the many different ideas and innovations that begin on the farm, through the Premier’s Award for Agri-Food Innovation Excellence program. At the summit, we announced the top five recipients chosen from among this year’s 50 award-winning innovations. I’d like to share their stories with you.", "The Premier and I were very pleased to present three Leaders in Innovation Awards at the summit. We recognized Paul Moyer of Moyer’s Apple Products for developing a new sanitizer for produce that is even more effective than water-based systems. This innovation takes cleaning to a higher level and positions Ontario as a leader in food safety technology.", "We also recognized Jay Barnard of Freshwater Cuisine, from Ontario’s Kenora district. Freshwater Cuisine has helped reduce fish waste by creating new, tasty appetizers that incorporate all parts of freshwater fish. Over the past year, the business has established relationships with more than 50 harvesters in nearby First Nations communities, who supply them with 100% of the wild-caught fish.", "Mr. Speaker, I’d also like to acknowledge this year’s third leader in innovation. Through his Fresh Air Media videos, Andrew Campbell is an inspiring young man on a mission to help urban populations learn more about where their food comes from and how it’s produced. By leveraging the power of modern technology, he is sparking important conversations on food production, animal welfare and environmental sustainability, and helping to establish trust from gate to plate.", "I also had the pleasure of presenting the Minister’s Award to Peter Wheeler of SunPillar Inc./Two Bridges Vineyard, which is in beautiful Prince Edward county. Beekeepers will soon be buzzing about their new product that monitors bee health. Designed to fit in a commercial hive, Hive Health gives producers the essential information they need without having to disturb the bees. The sensors for this project can easily be adapted to monitor plants for growth and disease so that crop producers can also benefit from this innovative Ontario technology.", "The Premier had the opportunity to present her award to Michael Curry and Ian Adamson of Greenbelt Microgreens. Greenbelt Microgreens has developed an eco-friendly process for growing organic microgreens such as lettuce, arugula and wheatgrass. They grow them year-round right in Ontario’s greenbelt. Today, the company has become the largest grower of organic microgreens in Canada, supplying fresh produce to hundreds of retailers, such as Longo’s, Sobeys and T&T Supermarket. This is a real home-grown success story.", "Mr. Speaker, these are just a few stories that show us how great ideas are being generated by farmers and food processors. I want to thank each and every one of this year’s 50 award-winning innovators who are inspiring the next generation to be innovative and to drive our agri-food sector forward into the future. Congratulations on those achievements.", "In closing, Mr. Speaker, as we wind down the year and look forward to celebrating the holidays with our families, I encourage everyone to support Ontario’s farmers and include local food, beverages and foliage in their festivities. I wish everybody a merry Christmas and a happy holiday season." ],

  "text" : [ "“The Premier’s Award for Agri-Food Innovation Excellence” has got a real nice ring to it and it’s a very important ceremony to pay tribute and to recognize those who are out there at the forefront.", "As the minister mentioned, a major agenda this year was NAFTA, with presentations from deputy ambassador Kirsten Hillman, Michigan’s Clover Adams and Pennsylvania’s Russell Redding.", "As we’re fully aware, the change in administration south of the border has really put us in Ontario and across Canada in a position where we’ve got to up our game. Last May, US trade representative Robert Lighthizer gave notice of intent to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement—NAFTA—with both Canada and Mexico. He cited outdated regulation and standards. He stressed the need for high-paying jobs in the United States.", "President Trump has repeatedly stated he would tear up NAFTA. Such a move would require a sign-off from Congress; however, the President can unilaterally sign executive orders regarding tariffs.", "Last spring, our federal government and many of the provinces scrambled to put together a bit of an effort to persuade US states and the Trump administration to leave Canada out of these protectionist measures, and we recognize the work of this Ontario government visiting many of the states that we work with and compete with.", "Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall offered up his explanation of the importance of the cross-border supply chains we benefit from: “Saskatchewan farmers buy John Deere tractors, made in Iowa, to harvest oats that are then sold to General Mills in Cedar Rapids, turned into Cheerios and exported back to Canada.” That’s how it works.", "The US remains Ontario’s primary destination for international merchandise exports, representing over 80% of our provincial total. As part of Canada, we in Ontario are part of the largest trading relationship in the world. No other country buys more goods and services that are made in the USA than does Canada, to the tune of something like $322 billion a year, and through that—and this came up at the ceremony the other day—Canada supports nine million jobs in the United States.", "NAFTA is not only about buying and selling, it’s also about co-operation and integration. The factories and the farms in both countries are linked through just-in-time supply chains that criss-cross the border. Investment, productivity and competitiveness in both countries are by and large supported by harmonized regulation and common rules.", "I’ve attended, as has the minister, a number of meetings in the United States over the past year. I find state elected representatives, farmers and ranchers are with us. We’re of a like mind. They realize the importance of trade certainly in agri-food. Any growth in the agri-food economy in North America has been based on exports. That results in good-paying jobs.", "Bear in mind, however, that we see the problems. We’ve lost on all sides of the border. We have lost hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs. We are competing with obviously much lower wages in countries like Mexico and China.", "NAFTA negotiations started August 16. The uncertainty has been huge. It remains unknown where we’re going. I hope in a positive sense that it’s really a modernization of the agreement and, in my view, essentially moving free trade to a system of fair trade. Isn’t this really how our trade relationships are supposed to work? Trade dollars flow back and forth across the border, but in a balanced way and in a very fair way.", "There are so many statistics on the trading relationships between Ontario and the various states across the union, and our trading relationship with Mexico. Trade is a good thing. Like they say, the only bad trade agreement is the one you’re not in." ],

  "text" : [ "It’s always an honour to be able to stand in this House and speak on behalf of the residents of Timiskaming–Cochrane and my NDP colleagues in response to the minister on the agri-food summit and the Premier’s Award for Agri-Food Innovation Excellence", "First, I’d like to say it’s our job to be critical of government policy, but it’s also our job to recognize when we can work together. I’d like to thank the minister for his invitation to the conference and for his invitation to many other things. We understand and he understands that in agriculture, although our benefit to the province is very large, our numbers are small and we need to work together, and I’d like to recognize the minister for that.", "The focus of the conference and the focus of much of our thoughts on all sides of the House is trade. Often, throughout our history, we have had issues with our trading partners, and one of our most important trading partners is the United States of America. I think the biggest issue now, with the current administration, is the uncertainty of what their positions are. Having spoken to secretaries of agriculture in other states, they have the same issue, because both people at the farm level and people at the state level understand how important trade is. From our side, we are all wanting to work together to ensure that we can come up with trade deals that not only benefit the farmers and the agri-food sector, but benefit all Ontarians and all Canadians. We continue to work together on that.", "Furthermore, on the part about the award for agri-food innovation excellence, I’d like to thank and congratulate all the winners. I’d like to thank the Premier for doing this. But most of all, I think we need to recognize that at all levels of the agri-food sector—but specifically, because I’m a farmer, at the farm level—almost all farmers are innovators. That’s how we get innovation excellence, because they have to innovate on a constant basis to deal with nature, to deal with weather and to deal with political policy. They have to innovate and change their farming practices, and I think that’s one of the strengths.", "At this time of year, I would really like to recognize—often we recognize essential services like police and firefighters, people who have to work during the Christmas season. I’d like to take a minute and recognize the people who work in the food sector, from the farmers to the processors to the retailers. But when you’re dealing specifically with livestock, you have to care for livestock 365 days a year.", "This is our last day here until February. I’m sure I can speak for all legislators: We’re all looking very forward to not having to be here tomorrow. But when you’re a farmer, you don’t have that option, and that’s why they have to love their job, because they’re there every day.", "I remember that the cows always had to be milked on Christmas day and New Year’s day. Even on larger operations, most times you’ll find it will be the farmer himself, because the people he works with, they want Christmas off. So they’re doing it themselves. I also know, from personal experience, that Christmas and New Year’s are the days that things are going to break on the farm and the days that you’re going to be there all day. It’s those kinds of days. Stuff always breaks on a Sunday.", "Farmers pray a lot on Christmas day, because we also want to be with our family for the big Christmas dinner. Sometimes it doesn’t happen, because the cows have to be fed, or a cow will have a calf. I’m a dairy farmer, I talk about cows, but there are all kinds of livestock.", "Anyway, I’d really like to take this opportunity to thank the farmers out there and everyone in the system, but specifically thank the farmers. On behalf of, I’m sure, all the legislators in Ontario, merry Christmas to our farm community and those people working Christmas day." ],

Without hesitation, I said, “Absolutely, yes.” I thank him for his encouragement and trust.", "As many in this House already know, “fetal alcohol spectrum disorder” is an umbrella term used to describe a range of cognitive developmental disorders that are caused by exposure to alcohol in utero. When a woman becomes pregnant, alcohol consumption can pose significant risk to the fetus and result in fetal alcohol syndrome, partial fetal alcohol syndrome, alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder and alcohol-related birth defects. It is estimated that one out of every 100 people may have FASD, meaning that as many as 130,000 Ontarians may be affected.", "FASD is a lifelong, debilitating neurological condition which is largely unrecognized and has no cure. It is also largely misunderstood. There is a great deal that is not known about FASD. For example, sometimes people who have FASD have particular facial features. However, the majority of people with FASD do not display the physical indicators of FASD. The presence of facial features depends on whether alcohol was consumed between day 19 and 21 of pregnancy, to be exact. The common myth that all cases of FASD involve the presence of facial features is completely false, yet it is widely considered a fact.", "That this is considered to be a truth can lead to some devastating impacts. Anyone who may work with individuals living with FASD in any capacity, be it service providers in various fields, teachers or educational assistants, for example, may simply assume that a child or an individual without these facial features doesn’t have FASD, or may have a different behavioural issue. This may lead to improper and ineffective support of that child or individual, hampering their ability to succeed in a positive environment that understands them and their disorder. This is just one example of how misinformation can impede individuals with FASD from receiving the best possible support. We have a collective responsibility to ensure that children with FASD get the best possible support they need.", "In my conversations with families and caregivers, they have expressed concerns that there are many myths that are taken as fact, which has led to a great deal of misunderstanding, stigma and shaming. FASD is particularly hard to diagnose because children and adults might display a wide range of behavioural issues that are symptomatic of other conditions.", "Adding further complexity is the fact that some women don’t know they are pregnant until further along in their pregnancies. In fact, just this summer, the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada reported that a survey conducted in 2016 found that 61% of women had unintended or unplanned pregnancies, and as such, women may unknowingly cause harm to their unborn child.", "Contrary to many myths and misinformation, there is no safe amount of alcohol that can be consumed during a pregnancy. The stigma associated with FASD and the tendency to blame mothers often lead to situations where families and mothers are afraid to come forward because they fear being judged and/or they might not know what their options are. Mr. Speaker, it’s important not to blame women or expectant mothers, but instead extend as much support as possible.", "A focus on awareness would go a very long way toward prevention efforts. We need greater awareness to not only help prevent FASD, but to approach this very important issue in the most compassionate and informed way possible. The fact is that individuals with FASD and their families face difficulty in society when it comes to equity, inclusion and well-being.", "In MPP Anderson’s report to the minister in 2015, it was noted that cultural knowledge-building is essential toward ensuring that communities in the north and remote locations can develop solutions that best help individuals with FASD. That is why simply raising awareness is not enough. This motion calls for greater collaboration between parent groups, service providers and educators who are involved in the everyday challenges of those with FASD.", "Learning from lived experience is a critical step that we need to take in order to develop and implement a strategy to assist in the recognition and treatment of those directly affected by this condition. Since the beginning of my journey on this issue, I have been overwhelmed by the level of engagement, resilience and deep commitment across the province from advocates, families, communities and organizations like FASD Connection Peel, FASworld and many others that I wish I had time to list.", "In recognizing September 9 as Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder Awareness Day, this motion will help create opportunities to elevate the discussion of FASD in the public realm. It would provide an opportunity to acknowledge FASD in the province of Ontario every single year, and it would ensure continued advocacy on behalf of those who have lived experience. Importantly, an awareness day should signal the government of Ontario’s continued commitment to the FASD community in order to enhance awareness and prevention.", "I am very proud that budget 2017 included $26 million over four years earmarked specifically for FASD and that it was specifically included in the budget. This strategy, which is currently in its development and rollout stages, includes six major initiatives that the government will focus on. They include a one-stop, full-access hub; more than 50 new FASD positions to support 2,500 people with FASD; boosting the number of parent support networks and assisting those already in existence; and we also have initiatives with our indigenous partners.", "It goes on. The motion is but a small step within a movement that has already been in motion, a movement that has been the result of literally thousands and thousands of individuals over decades; many of them are here today. Yet in many ways, FASD continues to fly under the radar.", "Mr. Speaker, before I close I would like to ask all of the members of this House to acknowledge the real heroes on this issue, those individuals with FASD and the incredible challenges that they face, but also those heroes—the parents, the support network and service providers—who are with us today. Thank you for all of your hard work on this issue.", "In closing, this motion would establish the ninth day of the ninth month as Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder Awareness Day—which symbolizes the average period during which a woman is pregnant—and as a day of recognition, education and awareness of FASD.", "I would like to once again thank everyone who has contributed to this motion and those who are here to support it. I hope that all members will give their full support to this motion. I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for your work. Job well done." ],

In fact, it’s a subject that the member for Kingston and the Islands and I have spoken about many times.", "As she knows and as she mentioned earlier, FASD advocates in my riding have formed the Lanark, Leeds and Grenville fetal alcohol syndrome disorder working group. I want to thank them and commend them for their work, and I want to thank Ms. Kiwala for acknowledging the local and regional members right across Ontario who are here today following this motion.", "I had the opportunity to meet with Diane Greer, Shelley More and Erin Bertrand from the working group in June. I know that they met with my colleague MPP Randy Hillier from Lanark–Frontenac–Lennox and Addington. MPP Hillier and I share many organizations, so it’s natural that we would take a keen interest in a new working group in our community.", "I know that some of the members couldn’t be with us today. They’re watching the proceedings, so I hope that they’re going to have the same excitement that I think they’re going to hear from all parties this afternoon.", "Speaker, it’s estimated that 4% of the population is affected with FASD, and the stories of Ontarians living with it are heartbreaking. I go back to the meeting that I had in my constituency office in Brockville with the local members of the working group. It really is something to hear the stories from those parents.", "And for all of the families and individuals who have come forward with their painful experiences, many more suffer in silence due to the stigma associated with FASD. That stigma results in people being reluctant to seek out help, even where it exists, for a condition that’s very chronically underserviced in our province.", "Again, I want to commend the member for helping raise awareness to combat the stigma and by recognizing September 9 as FASD awareness day in Ontario. I know she did not really have a long opportunity to talk about that component of her motion, but it’s just so important what a declaration of a day like that means to parents and families dealing with FASD.", "This discussion is also important, Speaker, for letting families in my riding know there is a strong support network for them with the Lanark, Leeds and Grenville FASD working group. I want anyone who picks up on this debate today that is from my riding or from my neighbour’s riding in Lanark to know that there is a working group out there for you that is able to provide that outreach that I think many people need.", "I agree, Speaker, with the member from Kingston and the Islands. We need more conversations to create a better understanding of what has been called an invisible disability, and the devastating impact it has on individuals, their families and our society.", "But awareness is not enough.

We need more funding, we need more resources—resources that are desperately needed to make us the leader in early diagnosis and also in intervention and in properly supporting those with FASD.", "I know that the members of the Lanark, Leeds and Grenville working group would want me to express their concern—which I share with them wholeheartedly—that those supports have to be easily accessible in rural Ontario. My constituents and those that Mr. Hillier represent shouldn’t always have to travel to Ottawa or to Kingston to access services. Transportation in a riding like mine is so very difficult for so many of my constituents. We need those services to be accessible close to home. So I do want to express my local working group’s concern that having support available is not always support in Kingston or Ottawa. We need to have services available in Lanark, Leeds and Grenville.", "Yes, Speaker, I want to acknowledge that there is a cost to our province of being a leader in FASD recognition and support. But if you consider, Speaker, the cost to society for us continuing to fail those with FASD, I think that we have to be able to afford those investments.

This was also an opportunity for me to recognize and understand the issues that children with FASD face, along with their parents.", "I feel it is important to outline what causes FASD and what it is. It is caused by women who drink alcohol during pregnancy, who later give birth to babies with FASD. As the member from Kingston and the Islands pointed out, not every woman knows when they are pregnant, and therefore those things can complicate the situation.", "FASD is an umbrella term for a range of disorders, as mentioned. These disorders can be mild to severe, can cause physical or mental birth defects, and have been found to be the leading cause of developmental disabilities among Canadian children.", "The FASD ELMO Network is a group of community agencies, individuals and service providers in the Thames Valley area whose mission is to enhance the community’s capacity for advocacy and provide support to children and parents impacted by fetal alcohol spectrum disorder in the areas of community awareness, education, diagnostics, justice and support.", "Recently, a story was shared with me: I know a couple who adopted twin girls—really adorable twin girls—when they were two years old. Shortly after they were adopted, they soon found out that there were some complications. The twins fought with each other every day, and one of the twins would scream daily on a regular basis for 20 minutes. As they grew older, some of the problems worsened. One of the twins violently attacked the mother and therefore had to be given to foster care. That just escalated problems with that twin, and she soon became a teenage runaway, at 15 years old, and had nine children starting from that time.", "What had happened is, when they adopted these twin girls, they tried to get help dealing with the problems that they were facing, but they kept being told that it was their own fault as parents. They took many courses on parenting that were suggested, but none of them recognized the special treatment that children faced with FASD needed. That was well over some-40-odd years ago. We’ve come a long way in some ways, but there’s still a lot of work to be done.", "The organization in London also collaborates with the Thames Valley District School Board in order to have discussions on ways to support children in the school system. That is a very important piece that has been missing and that parents have talked about. I spoke to several members of these community agencies and service providers, as well as parents, grandparents, caregivers and other loved ones who adopt children with FASD.", "FASD ELMO says that there is an urgent need for action in preventing, diagnosing and serving FASD and individuals who are impacted. The parents I spoke to feel that there is a need for awareness and urgent action, so thank you to the member for bringing this motion forward. Education and action needs to happen because people need to access resources that will help them with the treatment of their children, as well as with how to handle the behaviours.", "As treatment for a child with FASD is an around-the-clock job, these parents are looking for easier access to resources and supports. Children who are born with FASD grow into adulthood and continue to experience life challenges. With Health Canada’s estimate of more than 300,000 people living with FASD, it is vital that we recognize the magnitude of the issue and that it is a nationwide concern. We need to truly understand the ways in which we can discuss, educate and prevent FASD, because FASD is preventable.", "Currently, there is widespread ignorance and a taboo around discussing FASD, but that needs to change for the sake of the children with FASD and their parents. Population studies show incidence of FASD as high as 4.8%, with an average life expectancy of 34 years. With FASD being completely preventable, it shows that the current prevention methods need to be improved. We need to do better, and we need to do more.", "I want to thank the government for having the $26-million funding piece in the budget.", "We must increase awareness and education for both men and women, because this is where we can make a change. For young women now, we can educate them and their partners about alcohol consumption when they’re expecting.", "There are over 400 conditions that occur with FASD, which shows that accurate and early assessments are needed in order to treat and support these children. Those early assessments can help identify which support programs are best suited for the child, including: physicians and pediatricians, speech and language pathologists, occupational therapists, psychologists and psychiatrists, physiotherapists, social workers, educators, and training for parents and caregivers. Speaker, as you can see, it’s not a one-agency or silo approach to FASD; it’s a collaborative approach, a team approach, with those professionals and people involved with FASD all working together to make a difference.", "Again, I just want to express my thanks to the member for bringing this motion forward. This motion offers a real opportunity for us to do work together in this Legislature. It’s apparent that we need to continue to acknowledge this and take further steps in order to make sure that people with FASD feel supported. We can talk about the prevention piece.", "I fully agree with this motion and look forward to supporting it later this afternoon." ],

I won’t mention any names in case I miss anyone, but I really have to commend them for their advocacy on this matter.", "MPP Kiwala is a really strong advocate for this. She knew I did a report on this, and she came to me several times and asked about the funding for this. We advocated to the minister. I have to thank the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Health for their assistance in providing funding for this. I said to the minister, “If it’s a matter of money, if we can’t find funding, why don’t we just take a percentage or two from the sale of alcohol to fund this? It should be funded.” And 1% or 2% would be a significant amount, given that alcohol sales in Ontario are in excess of $2 billion a year.", "The funding that’s there is not nearly enough, and we have to do better. We can do better, and we will do better. But it’s a start, and we are heading in the right direction.", "This motion, Speaker, would recognize September 9 of each year as FASD Awareness Day across this province. I have been to Nathan Phillips Square on September 9—so I didn’t realize that it’s recognized, but not officially, in the province of Ontario. That’s what this motion does today. It provides that recognition which it so richly deserves.", "I am so honoured to be able to speak to this motion. As I said, this motion would establish the ninth day of the ninth month, which symbolizes the average period during which a woman is pregnant, as a day of recognition, education and awareness of FASD in the province of Ontario.", "Additionally, it calls for collaboration between parents’ groups, service providers and educators who are involved in the everyday challenges of those living with FASD, in order to develop and implement a strategy to assist in the recognition and treatment of those affected by this condition.", "As the member from Leeds–Grenville and the member from London–Fanshawe alluded to, it’s preventable. It’s something that doesn’t need to happen. To do that and to enhance that, this funding will go towards awareness and prevention.", "Speaker, it’s estimated that one out of every hundred people may have FASD, meaning that as many as 130,000 in Ontario could be affected by FASD—and most people think that’s a conservative estimate. To put that in context, that’s as many people who live in my riding of Durham. It’s more than the population of the town of Ajax, or Pickering, or Whitby, for that matter. It’s similar to the amount of people living in Oshawa, to put it in context. That’s the amount of people who are affected by FASD.", "While FASD is preventable, it often goes undetected and can be very misunderstood and misdiagnosed, as I have learned through my travels throughout the province during the development of a strategy for FASD in Ontario.", "Speaker, I previously served as parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Children and Youth Services, who at the time was the Honourable Tracy MacCharles. She isn’t here today, but she is to be thanked for her contribution to this and her passion in going forward with a strategy for FASD. Minister MacCharles recognized the importance. I also have to give a shout-out to my colleague Soo Wong, who is a very strong advocate on this file as well.", "Recognizing the importance of the FASD issue in our province of Ontario, Minister MacCharles asked me to host province-wide round tables to listen and learn about what is needed to better meet the needs of individuals with FASD, their families and caregivers. Speaker, to be quite honest, I wasn’t quite aware of the enormity of the problem in Ontario and the number of people who are affected by FASD, so I said to the minister, “I will gladly do this.” Upon further investigation and further review of what it entailed, when I realized that there are over 130,000 people who are affected by FASD, I said, “I will do this on one condition: that the report is acted upon—that it’s not placed on a shelf to gather dust—and that it’s going to be fully funded.” With that assurance, I decided to take this task on.", "I did 25 round tables all across Ontario. Some of what I heard is that it was preventable. I heard that a stigma existed. I heard that it can go undetected and misdiagnosed. I also learned that it is a shared responsibility. It’s not just a woman’s responsibility; it’s shared between men and women alike. We all have to work together to create better awareness and to remove that stigma.", "It was apparent from our first-round table session that it was a very complex issue. I learned that public knowledge of FASD was very limited, and several women and men, being unaware of the risk of alcohol use before pregnancy, would drink. It wasn’t purposeful. It’s just to have a drink—and even doctors, when you’re pregnant, advise folks that they could have a drink or two. They also need to be educated that it should be zero tolerance while pregnant or if there is a possibility that you could get pregnant.", "I could speak on this for hours. My colleague wants to have some time as well, so I am going to cut this short and say that I am honoured to be able to contribute to this here this afternoon. Thank you for the opportunity." ],

I acknowledge and welcome the members of the public who are here as strong advocates for this bill as well.", "Many countries around the world have put in place their own fetal alcohol spectrum disorder awareness days to assist in their public education efforts about the dangers of drinking during pregnancy, while communities across Ontario have implemented their own programs to help families deal with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder; for example, Waterloo region’s Reach for It! program.", "The first fetal alcohol syndrome day was recognized on September 9, 1999. This day was chosen so that on the ninth day of the ninth month of the year, the world would remember that during the nine months of pregnancy, a woman should abstain from drinking alcohol, as there is no known safe amount of alcohol to drink while expecting.", "This public education campaign is important, as there is still a poor understanding of the risks of drinking during pregnancy. Just as an example, in a survey of Grey Bruce residents, the local public health unit found that 25% of respondents felt that it was safe to consume alcohol during pregnancy. Another local study revealed that four babies in every 100 born in Grey Bruce were significantly exposed to alcohol while in the womb. With that in mind, it’s critical to start the public dialogue on ultimately reducing the incidence of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder in Ontario.", "According to the Institute of Health Economics, the government could save somewhere in the area of $800,000 for each prevented case of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. More importantly, it could save a life—a life free from physical, mental, behavioural and intellectual disabilities, as FASD is a lifelong brain development disorder that can occur if a baby is exposed to alcohol in the womb.", "According to the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, CAMH, one in every 13 women who consumes alcohol while expecting will have a baby born with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, and nine in every 1,000 Canadian children are born with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder.", "These statistics highlight the need for more awareness. That really begins with a strong public education campaign about addictions. Members will know that this is exactly why my colleagues in the PC caucus have called for a dedicated advertising fund to fight addictions. We think it’s fair and responsible to spend money on an advertising campaign to raise awareness, to give people knowledge of the risks and to fight addictions that are either taking or ripping apart people’s lives, instead of spending money on government vanity ads. After all, don’t we want to protect women vulnerable to addiction? Don’t we want to help fight addiction to alcohol, which is known to lead to poor health and poor educational outcomes, and is a major contributor to mental health problems?", "Earlier this year, a report published by the University of Manitoba found that women who give birth to children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, FASD, are at an increased risk of attempting suicide and dying by suicide. That study looked at health data over a 34-year period, comparing 700 mothers who had children diagnosed with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder to 2,100 mothers whose children didn’t have fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. The study also found the mothers had higher rates of poverty, single parenthood, mental disorders and alcohol use.", "This raises the need to reduce stigma, as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder can be stigmatized because there can be a tendency to mother-shame. That is simply unacceptable, and truly is shameful in any way, shape or thought. I think it’s important to recognize that pregnant women don’t drink to intentionally harm the baby; they may drink alcohol to cope with other stressful life circumstances and other addictions.", "This is why our party has committed to the largest mental health investment in our province’s history: $1.9 billion in additional new funding to make sure we close the gap on mental health services in Ontario. This is our guarantee, because we do not accept the current wait times—18 months on average—for someone suffering with mental health and needs.", "As fetal alcohol spectrum disorder has become the leading cause of birth defects and developmental delays in the western world—including Canada, where at least one child is born with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder every day—we have to do better to help the plight of individuals and families who struggle with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder.", "Mr. Speaker, I commend the efforts by the member for Kingston and the Islands, MPP Sophie Kiwala. She is certainly a passionate advocate on behalf of those living with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder.

I want to give a shout-out to the members of FASD—Elgin, London, Middlesex, Oxford Network, a network that was created in 2009 in my community that has been doing significant work to raise awareness of these issues and to advocate on behalf of families and children with FASD. In particular, I want to acknowledge the co-chairs of FASD ELMO, Craig Read and Juanita St. Croix, and also my friend Tracy Grant, who was a trustee with me at the Thames Valley District School Board around the time that FASD ELMO was established, and who has really been an incredible advocate and champion on this issue.", "Currently, FASD ELMO has about 57 members. They come from 23 different agencies across health, mental health, education and justice—and parents of children with FASD. They are working on a shoestring to raise awareness in my community and to host events like International FASD Awareness Day, which is held on September 9 and, thanks to this motion, will be recognized by the Ontario Legislature on an ongoing basis.", "The network sent a letter to members of this government in November highlighting their top three priorities, based on the needs of our community. Those are around prevention, assessments, and family-focused supports and interventions.", "Certainly, we know, as has been mentioned here, that this is a preventable condition. Prevention efforts are absolutely critical. There needs to be consistent messaging about alcohol exposure. There needs to be training for health care professionals on appropriate advice to give through prenatal counselling and alcohol-use screening.", "There also needs to be inter-ministerial collaboration around these efforts on promoting prevention. We saw, not that long ago, when the government decided to move ahead with the sale of alcohol in grocery stores, that there was a bit of an oversight in terms of adherence to Sandy’s Law, which required the LCBO and other outlets to post warning signs on alcohol use for pregnant women. When beer sales were first rolled out in grocery stores, there was a loophole in that legislation that did not require the warning signs. So this is a clear example of where inter-ministerial collaboration is important.", "The second priority that they identified was around assessments. Through their efforts in London, an assessment clinic was created with funding from the Ontario Trillium Foundation. This enabled the assessment of 10 children and youth per year. I have grave concerns that it took Ontario Trillium Foundation funding to create this assessment clinic. However, the funding has now run out. The only options for people in my community are to pay out of pocket for assessment or to seek assessment services elsewhere. We know how limited the capacity is across the province.", "Assessments are critically important to understand the child’s strengths and areas of challenge, to develop appropriate strategies and plans of care, and to support parents and caregivers in understanding what this condition means for their child. We know, from research that the FASO—Elgin, London, Middlesex, Oxford Network did, that an FASD assessment done properly is very cost-effective. The cost of an assessment is around $6,000. They put together an example of what happens when there isn’t a proper assessment, when there are multiple related misdiagnoses and ineffective interventions. They determined that while an assessment costs approximately $6,000, $94,000 could be spent on trying to secure an assessment for a child with FASD.", "Speaker, I am pleased to speak in support of this motion and look forward to it being fully supported by members of this House." ],

This makes a difference to educators, to health care professionals, to parents and to those who suffer.", "It’s not something that has a cure, but it’s something that needs to be addressed through the measures that we take, not just as the Legislature or as a government governing these things, but in how we react to and understand those people who suffer from that condition and the wide variety of symptoms that exists.", "I want to commend the member, and I’m fully supportive of the motion. I know that the member is also doing a private member’s bill on FASD awareness in the education system, and I think that’s central. I can remember going to elementary school and young people I was at school with who were experiencing challenges. At that point I didn’t know—and even as my children were growing up, I would have to say I didn’t know—that there were young friends, neighbours, people in that classroom who were suffering.", "It’s preventable. It’s something that has to be out in the open. We have to disavow any misconceptions that have to do with people’s appearance.", "Again, I am fully supportive of this bill. I think the member is doing the right thing by bringing this motion forward to create this day, and by following that up with the next step, which is to create a private member’s bill that speaks specifically about how we handle and collaborate to serve those young people who are suffering from fetal alcohol syndrome disorder.", "Thank you very much for this opportunity, Speaker, and I’m very pleased to support my friend the member from Kingston and the Islands." ],

That issue is palliative care.", "The reality is that all of us will die. We may not like to talk about it. We may not like to think about it. We may not wish to acknowledge it until the very end, but we will all die. The Roman philosopher and playwright Seneca once said that “Death is the wish of some, the relief of many, and the end of all.”", "My speech today on Bill 182, the Compassionate Care Act, is not really about death, but rather about life and about living a good life and having a good death, right up to the very end. Bill 182, the Compassionate Care Act, is an act providing for the development of a provincial framework on hospice palliative care. However, at its very core, this act is not really a provincial strategy or a hospice palliative care framework or any other bureaucratic phraseology that reeks of ennui and institutional caution. No, at its very core, at the root of its purpose, the Compassionate Care Act is about people. It is about helping people, honouring people, respecting people and loving people.", "As a Christian, I do not fear death. I remain personally confident and energized in the reality of the resurrection and the assurance of things not yet seen. As we are in the season of Advent, the reminder of this truth is all around us, and I am grateful for it. But I know death is a reality, and, for many, an incredibly painful reality that tears at the heart, spirit and very strength of what makes us human.", "End-of-life care needs to be respectful of this pain and anguish, and it needs to address the hurt that plagues so many across our province and nation, who look for meaningful end-of-life care without finding it. Palliative care focuses on the relief of pain and other symptoms for patients with advanced illnesses, and on maximizing the quality of their remaining life. It may also involve emotional and spiritual support, as well as caregiver and bereavement support, and provides comfort-based care, as opposed to curative treatment. Patients can receive palliative care in their homes, in hospitals, in hospices and in long-term-care homes in a variety of different situations.", "The act that I’m bringing forward today will ensure legislative accountability for the Minister of Health and Long-Term Care, by ensuring that the minister will develop a provincial framework designed to support improved access to hospice palliative care, provided through hospitals, home care, long-term-care homes and hospices.", "This bill will, among other things, define what hospice palliative care is; identify the hospice palliative care training and education needs of health care providers as well as other caregivers; identify measures to support hospice palliative care providers; promote research and the collection of data on hospice palliative care; identify measures to facilitate consistent access to hospice palliative care across Ontario; and take into consideration existing hospice palliative care frameworks, strategies and best practices, as I’m sure the member from Ottawa South will contribute to later in this debate.", "Also, the minister will develop this provincial framework, if this act is passed, in consultation with hospice palliative care providers, any other affected ministries, the federal government and any other persons or entities that the minister considers appropriate in the circumstances.", "A very important aspect of the legislation is the ministerial report. The Minister of Health and Long-Term Care will have to prepare a report laying out the provincial framework on hospice palliative care and shall lay the report before the assembly within one year after the day on which the act comes into force. This is very important, as the report, which shall be published on the government of Ontario website within 10 days after the act, and the subsequent follow-up report about five years after the day on which the report referred to is tabled in the assembly, grants accountability when it comes to this particular issue and ensures that the Legislature will receive a report that will be able to be held up as a benchmark and that will be able to be referred to in discussion surrounding palliative care.", "Dr. José Pereira, the director of research with the College of Family Physicians of Canada says that, “Given a provincial population of 13.5 million, Ontario currently needs 1,300 hospice and palliative care beds.”", "So if Ontario needs 1,300 beds, how many do we actually have, Speaker? We have 341, only 26% of the needed hospice palliative care beds. Quite frankly, I think we can do a lot better. Moreover, overall many hospices have an average daily occupancy rate of about 80%, which means beds can be vacant up to 20% of the time. The occupancy rate means Ontario hospices have the potential to serve more patients. Edmonton, for example, has a 92% occupancy benchmark.", "The demand for palliative care is likely to increase significantly because of three trends: (1) the aging population in Ontario; (2) the growing number of patients with life-limiting chronic conditions and complex care needs; and (3) new advances in health care, promising life-saving and life-prolonging possibilities.", "It is estimated that upwards of 90% of Canadians in the final stages of life could, and should, benefit from palliative care; however, the health system is currently unable to provide palliative care to up to 70% of those in need. Improving access to palliative care is a pressing need across Canada in general and here in Ontario.", "I want to just mention briefly the excellent work that Marilyn Gladu, the member for Sarnia–Lambton, has been doing on this very issue in the federal Parliament where her bill just received royal assent this week, on Tuesday, Bill C-277, which would establish a national framework on palliative care; as well as the excellent work Harold Albrecht, the federal member for Kitchener–Conestoga, has done—it has just been phenomenal; as well as the New Democratic member Charlie Angus, who has also done really good work on this.", "Palliative care in Ontario has been described as a patchwork of services, with very little integration, a lot of overlap and significant gaps. Much good work has been done discussing the need for palliative care, and there has been some improvement because of these discussions. Federally, we saw the Harper government strike a committee. We’ve seen many universities put forward forums with recommendations, such as the McMaster forum in 2013. The Canadian Cancer Society has released comprehensive reports.", "As well, the number one recommendation of the Provincial-Territorial Expert Advisory Group on Physician-Assisted Dying, which released its report in November 2015 said that, “Provinces and territories, preferably in collaboration with the federal government, should develop and implement a pan-Canadian strategy for palliative and end-of-life care, including physician-assisted dying.” It was emphasized that this should never be an either/or scenario for those facing end of life.", "I believe we do have a unique opportunity now in Ontario to make real headway in this battle. The federal government announced in their election platform that they had earmarked $3 billion for home care and specifically mentioned palliative care in their federal platform. In fact, this mention, which has now been hopefully followed up with Marilyn Gladu’s bill, means that we should be seeing some of this $3 billion flowing to the provinces and hopefully to Ontario as well, which we can take advantage of, to use and support this strategy and expansion of care.", "Mr. Speaker, I’ve travelled across the province, visiting various palliative facilities, from Bruyère home in Ottawa with the member for Nepean–Carleton, to McNally House in Niagara—the incredible work that they do. Thank you, Pam. I’ve seen the positive impact that adequate palliative care can have on families and individuals. But I’m not the only one saying this. I hope members of this House will consider some of the endorsements of Bill 182.", "Dr. J. David Henderson said, “There are currently no standards for the provision of palliative care nationally or within Ontario.” He’s the president of the Canadian Society of Palliative Care Physicians, and he said, “We recommend that all provinces have a provincial strategy for palliative care like that being recommended in MPP Oosterhoff’s bill.”", "Dr. Joshua Shadd, director, division of palliative care at McMaster University says, “Commitment on every level will be necessary to achieve meaningful system change, and the proposed legislated provincial framework will be one manifestation of such commitment at the highest government level.”", "Dr. Shawn Whatley, president of the Ontario Medical Association, says, “As a family physician, I understand the importance of a provincial framework for palliative care and the importance of increased awareness and access for patients. I support the objective of this private member’s bill and thank MPP Oosterhoff for his advocacy.”", "Paul Lapierre, executive director of the Ontario AIDS Network says, “In Ontario, we need more hospice beds and a provincial framework on hospice and palliative care. We support the proposed private bill and look forward to the implementation of the framework.”", "I have heard countless stories of the meaning and compassion that palliative care provides to families and individuals on their end-of-life journey. A particular story that I’m reminded of is that of Pieter Harsevoort. Pieter passed away earlier this year from spinal muscular atrophy, yet lived much of his life accessing palliative care while he served as a special education teacher at an elementary school in Hamilton. Pieter was able to bring so much meaning to people’s lives and was able to touch so many people with love, although he suffered from a degenerative disease and needed that access to palliative care.", "This bill is dedicated to people like Pieter and many people like him whose end-of-life experience was improved through palliative care and, through that care, improved so many other lives in the process.", "The Compassionate Care Act is about dignity, respect and meaningful support for families and individuals on their end-of-life journey. Ultimately, I am confident that these goals resonate and are shared by all members of this Legislature, and I hope that I can trust and count on the support of all members in this House. I hope I can count on your support and look forward to seeing the vote this afternoon." ],

Anyway, I’ll talk to the bill, Bill 182, the Compassionate Care Act.", "Mr. Speaker, thank you for allowing me to rise today and speak to the private member’s bill from the member from Niagara West–Glanbrook, the Compassionate Care Act. I know the member has witnessed first-hand the issues we face in Niagara and across the province with access to appropriate health care during the end-of-life stage.", "Let me tell you: It’s a real problem, and it goes well beyond just hospice care. I appreciate that the member’s bill looks directly at creating a provincial framework for palliative and hospice care, but I think it’s also important to address issues more generally in our long-term-care homes in Niagara and across this province.", "Mr. Speaker, right in the member’s own riding we were contacted by a family that had their parents unnecessarily separated in two separate long-term-care homes. They were separated because this province is facing a serious lack of beds in long-term-care facilities. It’s so serious that an aged couple could not even find beds in the same home. Clarence and Jessie were married for 70 years, never separated, never away from their family. In a time of need, they couldn’t get a place at Shalom Manor in Grimsby.", "What happened here is sad; it’s actually terrible, quite frankly. You have parents—it could be our parents; it could be our grandparents—and they’re sick and they’re separated. So what happens is, you put one in Grimsby and you put one in St. Catharines. Think about that: never separated. Every statistic says that when they’re separated from their spouses, they’re more likely to die sooner. Do you know why? Because they worry about each other. They worry about their wife or they worry about their husband. In our system in Ontario, that should never, ever happen. When I’ve been with my spouse all those years, the last thing I’d think is going to happen to me in my time of need is that we’re going to be separated.", "You look at the effect on the parents; now take a look at the effect on the family. You have families trying to take care of both parents in two separate locations, in two separate cities. This is something we have to work on as well. I know that the member is well aware of this case. I know the member has spoken up in this House on this case.", "Fortunately, in this particular case my office was able to work with the minister and the ministry to find a solution and bring this couple back together under one roof. I’m happy to say that they were able to spend time together before they unfortunately passed on.", "Mr. Speaker, while this story does have a happy ending, we know it should never happen in the first place. The NDP and I have been raising the concerns of long-term care in this province for a long, long time, and that’s because there are serious problems that need to be fixed.", "This bill has several motives behind it, but the one that I can appreciate is the need to ensure that seniors are respected in the later stages of their lives. I think that is the least we can do for the people who have raised us and cared for us and have built this great province and country.", "Mr. Speaker, in my riding of Niagara Falls, I can tell you that we regularly hear from constituents who are having issues with the long-term-care system. Their stories always come back to the same two problems that the member talked about: lack of care and lack of beds.", "In the area of lack of care, I have to commend CUPE and Unifor for putting together lobbying days to address the lack of care. CUPE has worked with my colleague the member for Nickel Belt in her attempt to ensure four hours of care for all long-term-care residents—four hours. This would be a wonderful campaign, and I think the member from Niagara West–Glanbrook should take a look at the campaign and support it as well.", "Overall, I truly appreciate the opportunity to speak to this legislation. Ensuring that seniors are respected at the end-of-life stage is incredibly important to me, to our party and, quite frankly, to everybody in the province of Ontario." ],

This means that thousands of Canadians each year are suffering an end that could have been made better.", "The international standard, I believe, Mr. Speaker, is 10 beds per 100,000 people, which means we would need about 1,300. An analysis recently of palliative care by the province’s Auditor General, Bonnie Lysyk, found that we need between 755 and 1,080 hospice beds to meet the needs of patients. Ontario currently has only 271 available.", "In my riding of Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound, it’s estimated that there is only one bed in each of the hospitals outside of Owen Sound designated for use for possible palliative care. There is only one palliative care bed in the Owen Sound hospital, although there were six beds in a separate wing of the hospital about 10 years ago. The closed beds were the result of the government tightening and freezing hospital budgets, which sadly pushed out access to palliative care beds.", "As a result of the lack of beds in hospitals for terminally ill patients, it was essential for facilities specially designed for palliative patients to be created. In Owen Sound, I’m proud to say that we were fortunate to see a hospice community project come to fruition, especially after the Chapman family of Chapman’s Ice Cream in Markdale generously donated $1 million towards this important project. I’d like to acknowledge the Chapman family for all that they contribute to our great community. I’d also like to acknowledge that a number of Chapman’s Ice Cream staff continue to donate, as our community hospice still has a bit more to go, with another $289,000 left to be raised, and certainly the government was very good and instrumental in making sure that this happened in our community.", "Since the hospice originally opened in 2013 and operated out of the Seasons retirement community as kind of a stopgap measure until it was built, it has served nearly 400 patients from across Grey and Bruce. Finally, on June 1 of this year, the Residential Hospice of Grey Bruce opened the doors to its brand new, stand-alone, state-of-the-art, 18,500-square-foot Chapman House facility on 10th Street East.", "My constituents in Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound certainly support making hospice palliative care a priority in Ontario, as the demand for palliative care, as we all know, is growing. With about 25% of all health care costs devoted to caring for patients who are in their last year of life, access to hospice beds is also a sensible cost opportunity. Considering that the cost of providing palliative care in the last month of a patient’s life averages about $1,100 per day in an acute care hospital bed, $630 in a bed in a palliative care unit or $460 in a hospice bed, I would suggest that this is the way we go.", "For all of these reasons, we should support Bill 182 so that we can get a provincial framework for improved access to hospice palliative care. Again, I commend my colleague from Niagara West–Glanbrook and look forward to unanimous support of his bill today." ],

That’s not something you see very often around here, but he did it, and I think what he is putting forward, the bill he is putting forward, is well thought out, well written and certainly worth supporting.", "Why do we need a compassionate care bill? Well, let me quote from Health Quality Ontario. Health Quality Ontario looks at the quality of care in our health care system, and they say: “Currently, we are not always achieving best quality care. In surveys of patients and caregivers in Ontario, most people say that they would prefer to die at home.” But this is not accessible to them. Why not? Because we don’t have high-quality home care, and we don’t have home visits from most family physicians, so what happens is that most Ontarians die in hospital, and very few of them receive palliative care.", "The report goes on to talk about how half of Ontarians begin receiving palliative care in the last month of life. This is way too late. About two thirds of us will die in hospital; two thirds of us who wanted to die at home will end up dying in hospital. About one quarter will spend half or more of their last month of life in hospital when they don’t want to be there. Nearly two thirds will have an unplanned emergency department visit in their last month of life, when, if this care had been available in their home or their place of residence, it could have been avoided. Less than half will receive palliative home care services in their last month of life—again, because the home care system is not there—and about one third receive a home visit from a physician in the last month of life. I think we could do a whole lot better. What the member’s bill does is hold the government to account to do better, to put palliative care at the top of the list and to measure the success.", "Palliative care is not equally accessible to all. I happen to live in the community of Sudbury, where we are one of the lucky ones. We have Maison McCulloch Hospice, which is run by a good friend of mine, Mr. Léo Therrien. The hospice has five major programs. The first one is the residential care program. It is 10 beds that are available for people who need palliative care.", "The home itself, Maison McCulloch Hospice, is just beautiful. It’s located on the side of a quiet little lake that we have in Sudbury. The grounds have all been developed by volunteers. It is a beautiful place and it is a very, very welcoming home. Unfortunately, we only have 10 beds. The member shared some numbers. Well, in our hospice, occupancy is at 100% all the time. People who wish to go to the hospice cannot access it because the hospice is full.", "We have a residential volunteer service. They offer a 30-hour class. It’s 10 weeks in a row for three hours a week, where you learn how to be a volunteer to support people who are going through the end stages of life. I know that a lot of my friends, who are either retired nurses, social workers or just people who want to continue to help, have taken those classes and are now doing friendly visiting to people who have a loved one in palliative care but who still live at home. This program brings a lot to the volunteers but also brings a lot to the people who receive those services.", "They have a shared care team. This is a fantastic program where people whose sole expertise—maybe not sole—is in palliative care. They know how to do symptom management; they know how to support people in physical ways, in mental health and in spiritual ways; and they bring this expertise into the patient’s home and into the resident’s home. You don’t have to be admitted to the hospice to benefit from this shared care team.", "They have supportive care and grief services, which basically help a whole lot with spiritual care, mental health and with the grieving process. Again, they are fantastic.", "They have visiting hospice services. Those are for volunteers who go and do visiting.", "As I said, I’m really proud of what we have in my community, but it’s not available to most of the people of Ontario. What the member’s bill would do is make sure that the government will have to look at best practices, make sure that it is equitably accessible to the people of Ontario so that all of us—as he said, we all know we are going to die, but we deserve dignity, we deserve support and we deserve to be cared for with compassion with our symptoms under check so that we don’t physically and mentally suffer in the end stage of life.", "It is feasible. It is being done in Ontario right now. Let’s make sure it is available to all of us. Let’s pass Bill 182." ],

The fact that this member’s first PMB is on an issue in our health care system to the degree of palliative care just shows how well served the people of Niagara West–Glanbrook are with Sam Oosterhoff as their MPP.", "Palliative care and hospice care is an issue that’s very important to me. I was elected in March 2010, and less than a month later I gave a member’s statement in tribute to Beth Donovan. Beth passed away on April 4, 2010. She was a champion for rural hospice care. She worked for 16 years to establish the hospice in Kemptville that bears her name. It had always been her dream to expand services to include residential hospice beds.", "As my colleague highlighted, funding for residential beds across Ontario is desperately falling short of need. In rural ridings like mine, the need is more than acute. It’s not that beds are in short supply: beds simply don’t exist. For 25 years, the Beth Donovan Hospice and the services that its amazing volunteers and staff provide have received tremendous support from the citizens of north Grenville and Merrickville-Wolford. In fact, earlier this year we celebrated the opening of the hospice’s new forever home in Kemptville. It was a proud day, but there was something missing, something the member from Ottawa South and I have discussed many times, and that’s a commitment from the Champlain LHIN, which continues to stall on providing funding for that hospice to open those residential beds. That means families are forced to take their loved ones away from a community that many have called home all their lives to spend their final days, and I don’t think that’s right, Speaker. That’s why I think this legislation is needed: to hold the government’s feet to the fire to fix the glaring gaps in our health care system.", "Of course, I want to close by talking about another palliative care service in my riding. I can’t speak about palliative care in Leeds–Grenville without highlighting the amazing work of the staff and volunteers of the Brockville and District Hospice Palliative Care Service. It’s yet another example of how our community has stepped up where the government won’t. The program costs more than $575,000 a year to operate, and incredibly, most of that is raised through events like the Friends of Palliative Care Annual Golf Tournament and the 30-hour telethon for palliative care services. I am tremendously proud of what our communities have done to ensure that these cherished programs exist in Leeds–Grenville. But it’s long overdue for this government to step up and support them.", "I want to again give kudos to the member from Niagara West–Glanbrook for presenting this bill. I hope all members wholeheartedly support it today." ],

I want you to know that he is doing a fine job here, and we are remarkably proud of the young man that you raised. He’s going to be a fine, fine MPP. I think it speaks to this, because his first visit outside of his community was to my community in Nepean–Carleton. We visited Bruyère.", "It’s interesting. When we were at Bruyère, Sam had mentioned that he had actually been to Bruyère and Saint-Vincent before. I said, “How were you there?” He said, “When I worked briefly on Parliament Hill, I used to go in and play the piano and sing to the patients.”", "You raised a fine young man.", "That brought tears to my eyes because I have had experience in the palliative care sector before. A decade ago, my father died of cancer, and during the six months that he had cancer he relied on palliative care in Nova Scotia. Sometimes it was for respite for him and my mom, and he would actually go into the hospice at the Aberdeen Hospital; at other times, it was the VON.", "The most compassionate people in the world work in palliative care. They are angels on earth, and I see it every day when I visit Roger Neilson House in Ottawa.", "My father—like you, Sam—was a man of tremendous faith. One day, I had flown in right after it was my one-year anniversary of being an MPP. I flew into Nova Scotia to be with my father. He smiled at me. He had just been diagnosed. He said, “I’m getting ready to meet my maker,” and he had a smile on his face. I thought, “Dad, I am so devastated that you’re going to be leaving me.” But his faith was so important to him.", "The palliative care system was also so important because it gave him dignity in his final days.", "If we are to debate a bill on palliative care, I think that we all have experiences or know someone in our community who has relied on it. So I must say, as somebody who has seen the system first-hand and has seen the positive attributes of the palliative care system in another province but also here at home in Ontario, I wholeheartedly support this legislation and I wholeheartedly support how you’ve approached this. I think it’s remarkable that a young man of 20 years old has touched so many lives in people’s final days before he entered this place.", "I want you to know this—to your parents, Sam: When we were at Bruyère and we were with a man who had not much time left in his life, your son held his hand and prayed with him. Sometimes we don’t talk about our faith enough in this place, and I’m very proud of the member for being an unabashed Christian, as I would be of anybody of any other faith who lives their values.", "So to you: I congratulate you and thank you for this bill." ],

First of all, I want to applaud the member for Niagara West–Glanbrook for bringing forward such an important and thoughtful piece of legislation here today. This bill addresses a serious problem in our health care system.", "Over the last decade or so, the government has been, quite frankly, a poor steward of our palliative care system in this province. The Compassionate Care Act would be an important step towards getting Ontario back on track so patients can get the care they need and deserve.", "I also want to thank—and I know the member from Niagara West–Glanbrook mentioned her as well in his opening remarks—the MP from my neighbouring riding of Sarnia–Lambton, Marilyn Gladu, who led the charge on this at the federal level with Bill C-277. She shepherded her bill, which provides for the development of framework on palliative care across Canada, through to royal assent after receiving unanimous support in both the House of Commons and the Senate. I hope to see this bill enjoy similar bipartisan support here today.", "MP Gladu was clear about why this is such a vital initiative: “Canadians, when given the option, will choose to live as well as they can for as long as they can. Providing better palliative care service across Canada will strengthen our nation and improve conditions for millions of Canadians making important health care choices.”", "Mr. Speaker, palliative care is extremely beneficial for patients, their families and for the health care system as a whole. The support and expertise of specialized palliative health care providers ensure optimal care and comfort.", "Currently, too many acute care beds and alternate-level-of-care-bed days are being occupied by patients with a palliative care diagnosis. The most recent statistic I saw was that two thirds of Canadians die in hospital. That’s not what patients or families want, and it’s not an efficient way to run our health care system.", "I also want to mention that the need for action on palliative care is even more urgent now that assisted suicide has been legalized. No one should feel pressured or in any way compelled to pursue assisted suicide because of concerns about lack of pain management or other end-of-life care or concerns about being a burden to family and friends. As legislators, we need to be working to ensure no one is put in that terrible position. This government owes it to the people of Ontario to improve access to and education about hospice palliative care.", "I wholeheartedly support this bill, and I hope the government will do the right thing and allow this bill to move forward, get it through committee and get it back for third reading before the election." ],

It’s an interest that we share.", "I want to acknowledge his parents and brother being up in the gallery as well today. You should be very proud of your son.", "I think it’s very important issue. Just so you know, it’s an issue that will stick with you for your lifetime, and there are a few people around here who can attest to that. I’ll say a bit about that later.", "I have been fortunate for the past three-plus years to have served as the parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Health and Long-Term Care. My mandate was to support the development of a comprehensive strategy on palliative and end-of-life care and to ensure all patients across all sectors have access to palliative and end-of-life care.", "The mandate also included the oversight of the expansion of hospice care to include 20 new hospices here in Ontario, almost doubling our capacity. It’s a mandate that I asked for, and one I’m very grateful to have. I want to thank the minister for allowing me to have that mandate. It’s not often that you get to do the work you want to do in a field that you want to be in. I’m fortunate to have that.", "My work is informed by my personal experience, as a volunteer and as somebody working in palliative and end-of-life care in my community, to put it forward, but most significantly by my father’s death.", "In October 2013, weeks after I took my seat in this Legislature, my father was diagnosed with an inoperable oral cancer. I was here at Queen’s Park when we found that out. Our family rallied around him and we kept him at home for six months. We had kind of an army of people to keep him there, but it didn’t work. Towards the end it wasn’t working, for a variety of reasons, so he spent the last three weeks of his life at the Hospice at May Court. I like to describe it that, if there are rest stations that exist between heaven and earth, the May Court is certainly one of them. I know that hospices across Ontario share that.", "In that experience with my father, I saw where things really worked and where they didn’t, where the gaps were and where we met angels of care along the way, and how often the path forward was not clear.", "Speaker, I’d like to take a few moments to talk about the work we’ve done together in this Legislature that addresses measures sought in this bill. I want to give a shout-out, first, to Rick Firth, who is over here from Hospice Palliative Care Ontario, for his support. I know Pam Blackwood is here as well from McNally House. Rick is not only a strong advocate, he is a trusted partner who has contributed greatly to the progress we’ve made together.", "It’s also important to remember that the work we have done and that we will embark upon is informed by the work and dedication of many people over decades to support palliative and end-of-life care. They are the coalition and the declaration of partnership and commitment to action, with over 80 organizations signing on. It’s the work of hundreds of health care professionals and volunteers—some of them starting off in church basements—that have brought us to this point.", "Bill 182 mirrors a bill that I understand has passed federal Parliament and that I support fully, and I’m glad that the member from Niagara West–Glanbrook has brought it to this Legislature.", "There are three initiatives that are central to this bill: the first is consultation; the second is creating a provincial framework on hospice palliative care; and third, a report to the assembly.", "I’ll speak to the consultation first. In 2016, we undertook extensive consultation with stakeholders. We did 16 sessions, involving hundreds of people: nurses, doctors, PSWs, volunteers, social workers and caregivers. They came from hospitals, long-term-care homes, home care, pediatrics, those serving vulnerable populations, francophones and First Nations. I visited hospices in Ottawa, Brantford, Sudbury, Windsor and Toronto, to name a few. I had the opportunity to meet with individuals like Dr. José Pereira, Dr. Sandy Buchman, Dr. Darren Cargill and Dr. Scott Wooder, and these consultations led to the palliative and end-of-life care round table report in March 2016.", "I want to take this opportunity to once again thank my staff, the minister’s staff, and everyone in the ministry who worked so hard to support this report. This report here, I’m sure the member opposite is aware, informed and addressed the things that we saw and heard in those consultations. I think I’ve given the member a copy of my report. It talked about what worked, what didn’t work and what we need to do.", "That report informed the development of a provincial framework that captures all of the aspects of Bill 182. It led to a budget investment in 2016 of $75 million over three years, including increased funding to current hospices by 16%, operational funding to support 20 new hospices across Ontario, and increased supports for caregivers at home. It promoted advanced care planning, partnering with HPCO—Hospice Palliative Care Ontario—to provide online training to hospice palliative care volunteers and, importantly, to establish the Ontario Palliative Care Network, which supports the delivery of palliative and end-of-life care across the province.", "Today, OPCN released their three-year action plan, A Plan for Better Access for All Ontarians. I’m really very pleased that this plan is out. Access is the most important issue in front of us.", "I do want to say to the member opposite—not that I want to parse numbers here, because there’s a lot of work to do. We can all agree on that. We fund 386 hospice beds. That does not include PCUs—palliative-care-unit beds—in hospitals. That’s not to say that there is not still work to do.", "This plan: I would recommend that people go and take a look at it online. I think it’s a good, solid plan. It speaks to all of the things that you mentioned in your bill. I’m very proud that they are doing this work and that your bill includes that, because I think it’s important for us to always keep our eye on the ball. This is about the long game. There is a lot of work to do.", "In 2017, in the provincial budget, we made two other announcements. The first was palliative care training for staff working in long-term care. It’s very important. There is excellence happening in our long-term care across this province, but it’s not everywhere and we have to make sure that it’s everywhere.", "Secondly, we announced the first-ever hospice capital program that funds up to $200,000 per bed, or about $2 million for a 10-bed hospice. So far this year, we have approved capital funding for about 11 hospices. That’s totalling somewhere near $14 million. I know that there are another eight hospices that have applied as well. I want to thank the staff at the capital branch of the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care for their initiative on this program and their work right now. We are moving forward on these applications very quickly, I would consider, by any objective standard.", "I want to thank everyone at the Ministry of Health who has ever worked on the palliative file. Without their support, the work that we have done and the things that we have been able to accomplish would not have happened.", "This brings me to the last part, which is the report back. It’s actually the part in the bill that, to me, is the thing we need to do. I keep saying that it’s a long game. There’s a lot of work to do here. We’re addressing hospice care; we’re addressing long-term care. There’s a lot of work there. Even with our best efforts, 35% to 40% of people will still die in hospital, and we have to address it there.", "This is about a culture change inside not just government. One of the things that I learned through the report and through the consultations and through Hospice Palliative Care Ontario is that hospice palliative care is a community-based initiative. It works because it involves community. That’s what drives it. That’s why it worked when it was in church basements, because people understood the need to care for each other.", "This is what informs my thinking on this, and I would like to repeat it—I’m getting old, so I repeat things all the time. Nine months to the day that my father died, our first grandson, Vaughan, was born. I remember thinking—I was really happy—“We’re really ready.” We were ready for Vaughan. We were all waiting. They had the nursery ready. The schools were ready and the health system was certainly ready—we’ve got it all lined up. Then I thought about my dad, because coming and going, living and dying—they’re both ends of the same string. I thought, “We weren’t really ready.”", "What informs me is that I think, as a society—all of us—the care that we provide for each other at the end of our lives deserves the same kind of attention as we give to the beginning of life, and I’m glad the member shares it. But I want him to understand, and I don’t mean this in a—just through my experience. I didn’t say that the right way. I’d like you to know that it’s a long haul, that it’s a lot of work. It’s a lifetime of work. Rick can attest to that. Pam can attest to that. Sandy Buchman can attest to that. There are hundreds of people across this province whose life’s work it has been to take this on in some way, shape or form. There are incredible people out there.", "So you’ve put this bill forward. That’s your commitment. You’ve just made a lifelong commitment, and that’s a really good thing. I want to encourage you to keep doing stuff like this. It takes work. There’s a lot of interest in here that can come in front of what it is we’re trying to advocate for. There’s always something going on. It takes continuous advocacy, continuous work. Keep going. Don’t give up, don’t slow down. I’m very glad to have spoken in support of your bill. Thank you." ],

  "text" : [ "Well, Mr. Speaker, I’ve got to tell you, if there’s an issue that drives motorists and a whole bunch of other people in Ontario—and, I would argue, across Canada—crazy, it is the price of gas. We look at the price of a barrel. When the price of a barrel was $100 or $110, you were paying less for gas then than we are now, with the price of a barrel being somewhere around $50 or $55. If you look at the relationship between the barrel and the actual price we pay at the pumps, there’s no comparison.", "We see huge spike differences when it comes to the price of gas depending on where you are in the province. As an example, the other day I was looking at gasbuddy.com, one of the websites that looks at the prices of gas. In the areas of Hamilton and Niagara, they were paying $1.00 or $1.01 a litre. If you go up to Thunder Bay in northern Ontario, you’re paying $1.40 to $1.42 a litre.", "Nobody is going to tell me it costs 40 cents a litre to transport gas from somewhere in southern Ontario to northern Ontario. It just does not make any sense. Clearly, what you’ve got is very few people who are the refiners and very few people who are the distributors, and they set the price of gas.", "There are a couple of ways that we can deal with this. There is the federal authority with regard to the competition issue—it’s something that both the Liberals federally and the Conservatives federally have refused to deal with—or you can deal with it at the provincial level because, lo and behold, we are the regulators. It is the province of Ontario that’s responsible for the regulation of energy and a whole bunch of other products. So clearly we should be able to look at the various models of regulation that have been put in place across North America and Europe and say, “Is there a model that would suit Ontario better?”", "Now, there are some models that are better than others. Let’s admit that in the debate up front. But the general idea is that you need a regulatory regime that allows you to say it doesn’t make sense that you have a 40-cent-a-litre difference of gas from one part of the province to the other. Even here in the city of Toronto, I have often seen, as I drive out of the city of Toronto going into central and northern Ontario, that at times the price of gas is the other way, where you’re paying a lot more, especially on a weekend, especially on a long weekend—if you’re driving out of this city on a Thursday or a Friday, you’re going to see a 10-cent, 15-cent spike per litre, just because they can.", "I think a government, a Legislature, is measured by how it deals with issues like this with regard to being able to give consumers some protection. Now, I’ve already heard the arguments. The government across the way, Mr. Thibeault, who used to be an advocate of gas price regulation when he was a federal member—I saw him at press conferences. As a matter of fact, I stood next to him at press conferences, and Mr. Mantha did as well, when he was there saying it was unacceptable and that the federal government had to do something, or the province had to regulate.", "Lo and behold, he says, “I think I’m going to come to provincial politics.” I thought, “Well, maybe the reason he’s coming is because he wants to regulate gas prices.” But no, no. He gets here and he says, “Let me go out and do a study and tell you why it is that we can’t do that.” What happened to Mr. Thibeault? He was converted on the way to the cabinet table, that’s what happened. He converted his position from wanting to do something for consumers to not.", "But here’s his argument, and here’s the argument of the government on this particular issue. They say, “It’s really impractical to regulate. Regulating is such a bad thing to do.” We regulate milk, for God’s sake. We regulate milk when it comes to quota for milk, the money that the dairy farmers get for milk. We regulate the price of butter across the border—300% in some cases. We regulate the price of natural gas so that if you live in northern Ontario or you live down in Niagara, you pay close to about the same. There are some offsets for transportation, but it’s all within reason. We regulate many things in our society because we recognize that if you sometimes let the market do what it wants, there are people who will take advantage.", "What we now have is that a lot of the independents that used to be the small independents that sold gas in our communities from Cornwall to Timmins to Sudbury down to the Niagara and Waterloo area—a lot of the independents have been pushed out. The large refiners and distributors have decided, “You know what we can do? We’ll set the price low. We’ll create a little gas war of our own.” The gas war comes and the independent is not able to survive over the longer period of time because they can’t sell at a loss. Mind you, the big guys can. They’ve got the money to do it. So the independents have been dying off, a very fast death, when it comes to having real competition in the system.", "What we have is a system that is supposedly competitive, but it really isn’t. It’s a system by which the larger corporations decide, “Okay, this morning, how much money do you think we can make in Sudbury,” or Timmins or Cornwall or wherever it might be, and they charge whatever the price is that they think the market will bear. It doesn’t relate to anything having to do with the price of the barrel. It doesn’t relate to anything having to do with the issue as far what it costs to move gas and produce gas and get it from the well to the gas pump.", "What we did is we looked at various jurisdictions. Essentially, what we’ve said is there are some models that work better than others. What we’ve done is we’ve established a model that is a bit of a hybrid. It recognizes that you have to regulate both the high and the low on the price of gas, because if you don’t regulate the low, the larger corporation will come in and freeze out the independents, so you want to stop that from happening. You also want to regulate how high, what the price of gas itself could be, a “no more than and no less” than type of thing.", "The other thing that we recognize inside our bill is that there has to be, at the end, some ability to transport gas and recoup your costs. There is going to be some cost to transportation; we understand that. But you’re not going to argue that 40 cents a litre from downtown Petrolia to Thunder Bay makes any sense whatsoever.", "The bill looks at the various models that are out there, both within Canada, in North America and Europe, and says, “Here’s a model that could work for Ontario.”", "I think it’s a question of picking sides. This is what this debate and this is what this bill are really all about. Whose side are you on? Are you on the side of the consumer or are you on the side of the large gas companies? I think that’s what this vote will inform us as we go into the debate that will ensue, and the vote somewhat after. I think you have to pick sides. I think that the public wants to know that you’re on their side, that somehow or other, somebody out there is listening, in government, to what is a huge irritant and a huge cost for individuals.", "Why should I pay 40 cents a litre more for gasoline because of where I live? Why should I pay 15 or 20 cents a litre more because I happen to want to drive away on a long weekend to visit my family or friends somewhere up in the Muskokas or down by Kingston or whereever you might be going? I think people want to know that somebody is watching out for you.", "As I said in the press conference at which I launched this bill on behalf of New Democrats, certainly to God, if we can regulate the price of a case of beer and we can regulate the price of a bottle of alcohol or wine—so that if you are in Cornwall, you pay the same price as if you’re in Kenora—we can find a way to equalize the price, somewhat, of gas across this province. I don’t think it’s an unreasonable thing for us to want or try to do.", "The government may take exception and say, “Oh, we think your model is not”—well, if you think the model needs to be changed, let’s send it in to committee and we can make amendments. We’re not wedded to it having to be a particular version of the bill, as long as we get the result that we want in the end. But I think it’s high time that somebody in the public sees somebody standing on their side and somebody picks them for a change and says, “You know what? That’s enough.”", "These companies have been taking advantage of the system. By doing so, they really stick it to the little guy and the small businesses and large businesses out there that need to buy gas. We need to have a system that equalizes the playing field, as Mr. Mulroney used to say years ago." ],

There has to be a return on investment for the oil companies. I don’t argue for one second. I said it in my press conference the other day: I believe that oil companies, refiners, distributors and retailers have to get a return on investment that makes some sense. But let’s not have a system by which they are able to peg the price—those very few distributors and refiners—based on how much they can pick out of your pocket to put more in their chequebooks.", "I think, at the end, what we need is a system that allows fairness in the system. It allows us to say every week: What should the price of gas be, based on what the cost of the barrel is, what the cost is to produce it and get it to market, and to make sure that there is a fair return on investment for oil companies that is not going to gouge the public in the way that we see it now?", "I have a couple of minutes left, and I just want to end on this note—one of the frustrating things that happen to all of us. How many times have you been in this situation? You’re driving back from some event. We all go to events. You’re driving back from your event. It’s 9:30 or 10 o’clock at night. You look at your gas gauge and you say, “Oh, well, I’m down to a quarter. It’s probably a good idea to fill up now.” You look at the gas station as you’re driving by, and it says whatever the price is. We’ll say it’s $1.20, just as a number. You say, “Well, I’ll do it tomorrow morning.” The next morning, you’re back out on the road at 7:30 or 8 o’clock to go to whatever morning meeting you’ve got to go to. You drive by the same gas station, and the price of gas has jumped up by 10 or 15 cents.", "We see that on a daily basis. I have a large geographic riding, like my colleague here next to me. In Timmins, at one point I think it was $1.21 that you were paying for gas in Timmins. You drove northwest two hours further to Kapuskasing—further away from the distributor, further away from the refiner—and the price of gas was 10 cents a litre cheaper.", "I’m glad for the people of Kapuskasing. I think they were very excited that they got a deal there. But how do you explain that? It’s simply that there’s a market where they could get more money because there are more cars in Timmins and they figure they could jack up the price, and it happens to be that Kapuskasing is on the Trans-Canada Highway. So it is one of those things that irritates.", "I think that in the end, as I said at the beginning, this is a question of picking whose side you’re on. New Democrats want to be on the side of people, to make sure that they get a savings, that they don’t get fleeced at the pump and that they get some respect when it comes to a system that looks at fairness when it comes to gasoline prices." ],

  "text" : [ "It’s a great pleasure to rise here on the last bill on the last day of the House before we recess for Christmas and the holidays, and to have a chance to bring comment to Bill 183, An Act to regulate the price of petroleum products, brought forward by our good friend the member from Timmins–James Bay.", "I understand exactly why the member has brought this bill forward. All the private member’s bills I’ve been successful with have been exactly on this issue of consumer issues. I’m the consumer advocate on this side of the House, on a whole range of bills, from the tipping bill to the daycare fees bill to the Air Miles bill, and more recently the credit protection act, where we tried to make credit protection agencies act more responsibly for the consumer, so I understand.", "We see, Speaker, that this kind of a bill on gas prices is almost an annual event—or maybe more of an election-time event. As the price of gasoline starts to go up, people are confused about it, and members will stand up and bring a bill promising lower prices through government regulation. We’ve seen this act before numerous times, and members on our side of the House are equally responsible; we’ve done it a few times. Dan McTeague out of Ottawa was repeatedly the consumer advocate for trying to get to the heart of why prices were the way they were.", "So what we’re preying on in the bill we have before us now is really consumer confusion. I think the member did a good job of outlining where that confusion comes from: the relationship between the price of a barrel of gasoline and the litre price at the pumps. I remember, probably going back seven or eight years, that the price of a barrel of oil was starting to go up to $50, $60 or $70, and I think the litre price was about 75 cents. My friend said to me, “By the end of this year”—I believe it was in March—“the price of gasoline at the pump will be over a dollar.”", "I laughed at him. I said, “No way. That’s ridiculous. That kind of an increase couldn’t happen.” So we bet a hundred bucks, and of course, I lost. I was shocked and surprised. But then the price of a barrel of gasoline was up to $80, $90, going to $100, and we were seeing $1-plus at the pumps.", "Now, as the member rightly points out, we’re in a situation where we’re still paying $1-plus at the pumps. It’s $1.15 in Toronto right now, and the price of a barrel of oil is $55, so there’s a disconnect between the consumer’s perception of the litre price and the barrel price, and I get that. It is confusing.", "I’m no expert on the retail aspects of why gasoline goes up. Supply and demand, obviously, is a big part of it. What’s in the pipe, what’s flowing through from refineries, is the biggest part. When you have a big fire threatening refineries in the south, in Texas, or hurricanes knocking them out, you watch what happens, and all of a sudden the supply dries up. You have a couple of refineries who are in winter maintenance, in a maintenance situation, and the supply dries up, and the price goes up quite quickly.", "It has always been a concern of mine. I wonder, “Gee, it seems to go up really quickly in response to an event, but it takes such a long time for it to come back down.” You always wonder about what the connection is there. As I said, I’m not an expert, but what I do know is that within the Competition Bureau, within the federal responsibilities that look into these matters, there are some very clear consumer oversights that don’t allow for price gouging, that don’t allow for collusion, that don’t allow for taking predatory positions. The best people to review that within the federal scheme are the consumer advocates who are out there, who are keeping a very close eye on where the pricing is going.", "From a consumer’s perspective, it’s really easy for a bill like this to ratchet up a lot of support, because you’re attacking big oil, and big oil appears an easy target: all these rich fat cats with cigars playing golf who are making money at the expense of the consumer. We all know that’s just not the reality of how we see things out there.", "I had the pleasure, Speaker, of being in Alberta recently for the filming of Political Blind Date. I hope the members have all had a chance to take a look at my debate with Shannon Stubbs, a Tory from northern Alberta who represents Lakeland. It’s actually very entertaining TV, so during the break session I hope you’ll have a chance to sit down and get to know Shannon Stubbs, who is actually a really wonderful individual working hard for her community.", "I was able to share at the time—because they’re angry at Liberals and carbon taxes and such. They’re angry about it. We had a long, great conversation with a cattle rancher out there, as I explained to him not to be focusing so much on the costs of pricing carbon, but on the benefits that come from it as well. I was relieved. By the end of our conversation, the guy had offered me a job, he was so appreciative of the work that I was doing. He said, “If you don’t get re-elected, you come back and work for me on this cattle ranch.” I helped him inoculate a few cattle while I was out there; it’s quite a fun story in itself.", "The feds regulate, and the Ontario Energy Board is there to regulate prices amongst monopolies and oligopolies. There is enough competition in the system that you can have competitive pricing for gasoline in the province of Ontario. It does probably require better explanations for the consumers, so as to alleviate the confusion we see, but there is opportunity for competition.", "The Minister of Energy here, a year ago, recognized that there are some issues around people’s perception, and he did some groundwork and had the OEB conduct a study. I believe it was done by the Kent Group, who are experts in oil refinery issues and such. They went out and did a study and lo and behold, they determined in their conclusions that Ontario’s regulatory competitive regime, without government interference, is actually working quite well.", "When they compared what we are doing with what is happening in other jurisdictions in Canada—the member from Timmins–James Bay referenced it in his press conference. We’re going to follow those provinces who are already regulating—there’s a model out there, in Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick and Newfoundland. They concluded in their report that through the regulatory scheme, consumers were paying more than they would have otherwise in those jurisdictions. So what I see here, quite astonishingly, is an opportunity, a bill, that would regulate gasoline prices in a way that’s going to cost the consumer more.", "When you talk about consumer confusion as being a reason you want to put this bill forward, if the consumer were fully informed about the impacts of paying millions more, paying 10% or 15% more on average at the pump in the regulated scheme that’s being proposed here, I think the consumers wouldn’t be as supportive as the member would have hoped.", "I also want to speak a little bit to how we’re talking here about what I would call a temporary problem, because we aren’t far away from the day when we will not be using an internal combustion engine for the bulk of our transportation in the province of Ontario. We are getting frighteningly close to electric vehicles, hydrogen electric vehicles, being the mainstay of transportation in this province. And it happens for a number of reasons, a number of technologies that are all starting to collapse around the same time. We have a tipping point coming here. If you’ve had a chance to watch the videos or see some of the research by Professor Tony Seba out of Princeton University, we are so close right now to a tipping point. The price of lithium ion batteries is getting so low, and the price of an electric vehicle is getting to a point—the range is getting to a point where you can go 350 kilometres on an electric battery right now that out of financial self interest, consumers across the province are going to be diving in to electric vehicles extremely quickly.", "Now, in Ontario, because we have our cap-and-trade program, which is premised on the basis of a 17% price on carbon—much lower than the Trudeau $50, by the way, so we’re actually doing it in a much better way for the consumer—we’re able to use those cap-and-trade dollars to subsidize the cost of an electric vehicle by up to $14,000 for five seats. This is extremely important to help us move people into electric vehicles. We have a system in place in Ontario right now which could probably, with current generation capacity, accommodate upwards of 50% of the vehicles in the province of Ontario being electric vehicles.", "You are seeing major manufacturers in the auto sector coming forward now with a declaration. Volvo won’t be building an internal combustion engine in 10 years. You are seeing manufacturers like Dyson—they make vacuum cleaners—who have just announced a whole new automotive division to make electric vehicles. And you’re going to see Samsung—they’re all coming forward because we won’t be using gasoline or diesel in these vehicles.", "I had the chance of taking Ms. Stubbs, on my Political Blind Date, to the Electric Vehicle Discovery Centre up on Finch, up in North York, and there were all these cars. I looked at her and I said, “Look at these vehicles. None of them have tailpipes.” Do you know why? Because they don’t burn gasoline. They don’t burn diesel. So what are we going to need your gas for?", "Then we went to Hydrogenics, which is a company that makes electrolyzers that can take surplus electricity, electrolyze water, release hydrogen and then capture it for zero-carbon transportation fuels. So I asked her. I said, “What do we need your natural gas for?”", "We are heading to a world in which the demand for petroleum products is going to be bottoming out, worldwide, into the $40-a-barrel rate. The demand is going to be extremely low because we won’t be using it for transportation at the level that we are now. We will have electric-powered and hydrogen-powered tractors pulling trailers across Ontario and across North America. We will have hydrogen-powered trains not burning diesel. These transformations are coming.", "I say to the member that this concept of starting to regulate gasoline is way too late. You’re five years away from it being a non-issue, because the price will be so low, because there will be so much supply and so little demand.", "When I look at the bill here, what I see is a piece of unnecessary red tape. I know the Minister of Economic Development has gone to great lengths to find ways in the province of Ontario that will reduce red tape across all sectors. We will bring in necessary regulations to protect consumers and protect society, but at the same time we will be taking out one and a half regulations for every one we propose, looking for savings so that businesses and consumers won’t be burdened by unnecessary red tape.", "I’ve got a great copy of the people’s garnishee document here. I notice their plan here for carbon pricing is sort of like they’ve thrown their hands up again and they’ve said, “No, it’s not us. Whatever Trudeau says, we’re just going to go along with it.” The party opposite, the official opposition, are now going to a place, again flip-flopping, to: “Yes, we don’t think we need to do any carbon pricing. We’re just going to tag onto the Trudeau plan. We’re going to use those revenues”—and I see it in the people’s garnishee document. They’re going to use those revenues to give people that little middle-income break, which they claim is 22.5%. They claim everyone is going to get 22.5%, but we know it’s only a reduction in that one segment, so that people aren’t going to see anywhere near 22.5%.", "That being said, I don’t think I can support this bill." ],

I have to give you Christmas points for that one. Unfortunately, it had very little to do with the member from Timmins–James Bay’s actual bill.", "I know you spoke a lot about the carbon tax. I can imagine why you would want to spend your time trying to fluff it up when the Auditor General herself—now, I know you disparage the Auditor General and you don’t speak very highly of her on any occasion, but I can tell you, she told us that $466 million of your cap-and-trade slush fund is on its way to California and Quebec. So we understand why you’re so concerned about trying to give some spin.", "The Auditor General told us also that by 2020, $2.2 billion of your cap-and-trade slush fund will be on its way to California and Quebec, and Ontario, sadly, accrues very, very little of the benefits. We don’t have any greenhouse gas savings here beyond 20% and we don’t have any money. It’s all going to California and to Quebec. So let’s just be clear about that.", "More to the issue of the member from Timmins–James Bay, who was talking about the price of gas: I live in North Bay. I live in Corbeil, actually. I was born and raised in the city of North Bay. I represent the riding of Nipissing. I’m a northern boy. I’ve been there 61 years, and I can tell you that this is a lifelong issue, gas prices in the north.", "When we come to Queen’s Park and we drive by a pump here, we look at it and have to do a double take and think, “What the heck was that?” I think I saw gas that’s 10 or more cents a litre cheaper than what it was when I left home this morning. We know that there is a huge disparity in prices between Ontario’s north—our north, Gilles and others—and southern Ontario. We know that. We understand that there is a huge disparity.", "But it’s not just the fact that there’s a disparity. What really makes this a big issue at home is the fact that in the north, we just don’t have the same transit opportunities, and so we are unbelievably dependent and reliant on our vehicles to get from point A to point B. We don’t have transit options. I live in a riding where I serve 11 mayors, one urban mayor in the city of North Bay and 10 rural mayors. The 10 rural mayors: Not one of them has transit. There is no transit option, so we, collectively in rural and northern Ontario, rely on our vehicles and we rely on hitting the gas station down the street, certainly more than once a week because the areas that we travel are vast.", "This is not the reality in southern Ontario. You work in a very, very different way than we do. You have tremendous transit opportunities; we just don’t. There’s no way to get from where I live in Corbeil, East Ferris, into North Bay unless you drive. You could take a taxi; there is one Callander cab that will come out to where I live in East Ferris. They will come from Callander and pick me up if I have to get to the airport for that 6:20-in-the-morning flight every once in a while. But that’s still driving.", "We depend on this. To have this variation in fuel prices is hurtful to us. When you look at the cap-and-trade taxes that come off of that, when you look at—they talk about a triple hydro rate. Where we live in Corbeil on my street, we don’t have triple hydro rates; we have quadruple hydro rates because we’re medium density. If you go just around the corner on Treadlightly Drive, my buddy Phil—there are only 12 houses on the street—pays low density. If you’re paying 18 cents a kilowatt hour for your power and I pay 22 and a half cents, he pays 26 cents.", "We’ve got these differences in northern Ontario that you wouldn’t even have a clue about. You just would not know that our costs are so very, very much higher. Our distances are longer. It is more difficult to get through a day. But I’ll tell you, as I look at my northern friends, I don’t think we’d give it up for a second—the beauty of it and the joy." ],

Here in Ontario, it was $1.30 a litre. Early in 2015, the price of oil completely crashed across the world. In fact, it crashed more than 60%. In September/October 2017, the price of oil hasn’t rebounded. It’s still around US$50 to US$55 a barrel. Yet the price of the gasoline even in Niagara is $1.20.", "Think about that. Anybody in this room is smart enough to see someone is making a major profit on prices.", "Here’s what’s happened. What they’re doing is they are getting the money from the refineries. The refineries are making all the money. Then they’re keeping the prices high.", "They talk about the north. The north is right: They’re paying more because they got rid of any independent that was up north. Here in Toronto, where most of the MPPs are—the Liberal MPPs—you know what they did? They got rid of all the independents. You can look at Toronto and you can be within one or two cents of the price of a litre of gas today—one or two cents. You come to Niagara, there’s a price war going on on Ontario Street for two years. You know why it’s gone on for two years? They want to get rid of the independents. They want to make sure they have a monopoly so they can keep the gas high. Make no mistake about it: We’re being gouged at the pumps every single day.", "And they’re hiding it around the refineries, the very refineries, by the way—most people will remember from Toronto—we used to own. We used to refine our own oil here in the province of Ontario, creating good-paying jobs. We got rid of that. Remember we used to own Petro-Canada? The oil companies lobbied to get rid of it because they didn’t want it. They wanted the refineries to make more money. That’s what is going on in the province of Ontario, make no mistake about it.", "Then you take a look—my colleagues mentioned this. On a long weekend, you want to go enjoy time with your family. What happens? They raise the price 10 to 15 cents just like that because they can and it’s a weekend. Then you go—and he talked about it; it’s happened to me many, many times. I go to bed at night and it might be $1; I wake up in the morning and it’s $1.15. How does that happen? It’s nothing more than gouging the consumer.", "The member who spoke on behalf of the Liberals can stand up and say all he wants but, I tell you, you go and talk to your constituents and they’ll tell you that on the price of gas they’re being gouged. They’re being gouged more in Toronto than anywhere else because they got rid of the independents. The independents at least give us a chance. We have 11 independents in Niagara and the oil companies are attacking every single one of them every day to put them out of business so they get the same opportunity to gouge the people in Niagara like they’ve been gouging the people in Toronto for years." ],

I have to tell you, I know how mad people get about gas gouging in my riding, but prices in northern Ontario were sky high; there was no question.", "In Leeds–Grenville, motorists have been subjected to wild price hikes in one area while communities that are nearby to us, other communities in eastern Ontario, pay much less. I was telling the member for Timmins–James Bay some of the sayings that we have in Leeds–Grenville when we see severe spikes in gas prices. We have a term called “10-cent Tuesday” when it seems that the price automatically goes up 10 cents, sometimes more. We have a term, “Way-Up Wednesday,” that happens quite often in our riding where we’ll do the story, as the member said, where you’re deciding not to buy gas in the evening, only to find that on Wednesday morning prices have gone through the roof. Regardless of what you call it, Speaker—I’ve given you two names that we have in Leeds–Grenville—people call it gouging.", "There are two other reasons that I want to place on the order paper today—things that Mr. Bisson is not surprised at. I’m concerned about the price controls, and I’m also concerned about the Ontario Energy Board having a role in pricing. So I’m going to talk about those two.", "I think the member, when he introduced the bill in his 12 minutes, talked about the fact that not every system of controlling prices has been successful, the fact that in some cases it’s had a somewhat limited effect on volatility, that people over time in some of those regulated systems find that they’re paying, on average, higher prices than even what we are paying in parts of Ontario.", "Secondly, tasking the OEB to look out for motorists—I have to ask people if they would consider how the OEB has done in keeping our hydro bills down. Speaker, I think you know exactly what I’m talking about. I think people question having faith in the OEB doing a better job with regulating gas prices. I don’t think that we need the OEB on this issue.", "While I do agree that getting the bill into committee is a good step, so that we can talk about it and look at some of the suggestions that the member has talked about in his 12 minutes, I happen to think that the Competition Bureau—which, granted, is a federal agency—exists to be a watchdog for consumers, but it has been toothless when it comes to gas prices.", "I have written to that bureau countless times on behalf of my constituents. I have provided detailed complaints about gas price fluctuations. The response that I got was quite surprising. In fact, they asked me to tell my constituents to gather more evidence and perhaps have conversations between gas company officials about price-fixing. I’m not sure what that means, Speaker. Are my residents supposed to quit their day jobs and go sleuthing, so that they can hear conversations that take place at local gas stations and the gas companies? I just thought it was unbelievable when the Competition Bureau brought that suggestion back.", "I have asked more than a few ministers of consumer services to join with me, to stand with me and ask the Competition Bureau to become more of a watchdog and to have it do its job. I remember a couple of great YouTube videos from question period that I posted with former consumer minister Margarett Best. We had an exchange but, unfortunately, no action by the government.", "I think it’s sadly ironic that the Competition Bureau is asleep at the switch at gas prices, but recently they announced a price-fixing investigation for the price of bread. I will have been an MPP for eight years next year, and I don’t think I have ever had a complaint about bread price-fixing. But on a 10-cent Tuesday or a Way-Up Wednesday, I get lots of complaints about the price of gas. I would think that if the Competition Bureau is so intent with doing its job, a far better investigation than bread-fixing would be to get down on price-fixing—not price controls, not a system with the OEB, but have them actually do their job.", "But I’m happy to support the member, I’m happy to get this bill into committee and I look forward to having more discussions about gas price spikes in the Legislature." ],

  "text" : [ "Thank you to my colleague from Timmins–James Bay for bringing this bill forward. My offices are routinely approached by northerners who are exasperated with gas price fluctuations that seem out of sync with neighbouring communities in other regions across the province, as well as by pump price changes that follow dubious patterns such as spiking around the long weekends, as many have talked about.", "Since prices have jumped to well over $1 a litre, many of us keep at least a somewhat close eye on the price at the pumps, and we’ve all been there, as members already alluded to. We look at the gauge in the car and we realize that we’re low. It’s late at night, and we figure, “Ah, it can wait until morning.” We go to fill up in the morning and bam! The prices have jumped 10 or 15 cents a litre, and we grumble and fill up anyway.", "Northerners in particular can identify with this pain and frustration because we have no choice. It is necessary that we fill up our vehicles, because otherwise we have no means of transportation. Most communities in the northwest do not have intercommunity public transportation, nor do they have intracommunity transportation. We don’t have rail options like the member from Beaches–East York has access to, like GO trains and the TTC. The Greyhound bus that comes through our communities comes through in the middle of the night at 2 or 3 o’clock in the morning, so that’s not very practical. That makes having fair and affordable gas prices a necessity for northerners.", "Yesterday, my offices did some calling around to gas stations in Kenora–Rainy River. What my staff found out is that the prices very closely matched within each community, but the prices differ, sometimes substantially, between communities. Now you may think that that makes sense, but how does it really make sense for gas prices in a community more than 100 kilometres closer to the fuel distribution centre to charge six cents more a litre, where the wholesale supplier is likely the same for the two gas stations in both communities because they’re both owned and branded by the same parent company?", "I’m not wanting to single anyone out, but how can company A justify charging $1.25 a litre in Kenora, a mere 200 kilometres from its fuel distribution centre in Winnipeg, yet only $1.19 or less a litre 135 kilometres further away in Dryden? Dryden is both further away and a smaller community, suggesting that there would be both increased transportation charges and lower demand or volume.", "To be fair, though, not all companies engage in these kinds of questionable tactics. There are examples right in northwestern Ontario where companies cap their profit margins and keep them fixed at a reasonable rate. For them, their transportation costs are also fixed according to location, and their only variable is the wholesale rack price. These companies would not be impacted by this bill because they’re already serving northerners well.", "But for the other companies that seem to play by their own rules and often not in favour of northerners who are at their mercy, this bill is much needed to bring about some fairness to the pumps for what is, to northerners, an essential part of life in the north." ],

It doesn’t matter where I go; the first thing people say after, “My, it’s cold today,” is, “Did you see the price of gas?” So, yes, I do look at the price of gas because, you see, Speaker, it makes no sense whatsoever.", "Today in Sturgeon Falls, they pay $1.12 for gas. Today in Sudbury, we pay $1.23 for gas. The problem with this is that in order to bring gas to Sturgeon Falls, you have to come through Sudbury. How can you justify that people in Sudbury pay 11 cents more a litre for gas than the people in Sturgeon Falls?", "I’ve had so, so many people come to me that I started to look into this. I talked to some of the retailers and I talked to some of the people who sell gas to the retailers and all this, and the answer that I got knocked my socks off. It was, “You know, in Nickel Belt, people have good jobs working in the mines. People have to drive long distances to get to their jobs. Therefore, they have no choice but to buy gas because none of the mines are serviced by a bus. Everybody has to drive to the mines”—which are the main employers in my region—“and if you have a job in a mine, you can pay a high price for gas.” Therefore, they feel justified in gouging each and every one of us because they can.", "That they could say this to my face, Speaker, was jaw-dropping. Really? You’re telling me that you are gouging us at the pump because you know we have to drive long distances to make a living, and this is justifiable? It is not acceptable. This is why we need oversight. This is why we need regulation. People shouldn’t have to drive to Sturgeon Falls to fill up because we’re living in Sudbury, but if you drive out there, you save 11 cents a litre. I can tell you that any time I have to go down this way and anybody who goes down this way, you fill the back of your truck with jerry cans and you fill them up because you know full well that when you get back home, you’re going to be paying more for gas. I’ve had enough of this. It makes no sense.", "I still have a minute? No, I don’t. I still had lots to say, but I have to sit down." ],

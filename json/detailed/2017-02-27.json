  "text" : [ "As the official opposition critic for education and post-secondary education, I appreciate the opportunity to rise in the Legislature this afternoon to speak to Bill 92, An Act to amend the School Boards Collective Bargaining Act, an important piece of legislation which impacts the collective bargaining process in the province as it pertains to negotiations between the government and those who work in the education sector.", "John F. Kennedy, the late president of the United States, a man whom I’ve admired for quite some time, once said the following concerning education: “The goal of education is the advancement of knowledge and the dissemination of truth.” Speaker, this is a quote that is as timeless today as it was in the 1960s and will continue to be relevant so long as history is studied. I would think that all members of this House, and in fact every resident of this province, would agree with President Kennedy’s statement. I believe it’s every young person’s aspiration to become successful as an adult. We have seen, time and time again, that receiving quality education is an effective route to that success.", "As members of this House, it’s our responsibility to ensure that route is always open to Ontario’s youth and that we continue to strive to improve the education system to the benefit of our current and future students. After all, today’s students are tomorrow’s community leaders. So it is up to us to listen regularly and carefully to students, parents and teachers to learn how we can help to put in place the elements that lead to successful outcomes in the schools across our great province.", "In that vein, the benefits of education can be seen everywhere. It has allowed our society to invent an incredible amount of consumer goods that have improved our daily lives and allowed entire sectors to grow out of these new inventions. Take, for example, information technology science. This is a relatively new field in the education sphere and continues to evolve to this day. However, this field began 40 to 50 years ago, when some intrepid inventors wanted to create a device that would address our needs. In doing so, they spawned an entire industry of personal computers, business information technology and even portable communications, like cellphones.", "Each of these developments required a high level of education and the opportunity to pursue post-secondary education. Today, these devices have been integrated into our education system all the way down to the elementary school level, where young children are being taught how to use computers or tablets. This entire industry has had almost a circular effect on education. When new technology is integrated into the classroom, it accelerates and enhances the learning process of students and graduates who want to work in this industry and create more advanced technology that can then be integrated into the classroom.", "But, Speaker, education is not limited to the field of computer science, is it? Engineering education has allowed us to construct immense buildings and bridges. Education in science has resulted in advanced medical procedures to save those who are ill, when as recently as 30 or 40 years ago, those same people would have been subjected to unfortunate diagnoses and outcomes. The list goes on and on.", "All of these advancements would not have been possible if our society did not value education and the pursuit of knowledge. This is why I and my colleagues take our critic roles in monitoring this government’s stewardship of the education system very seriously: because we understand the value that education can bring to our society.", "When I was first elected in February 2016, I came to Queen’s Park to serve the people of Whitby–Oshawa and work hard, like my colleagues in this House do, every day to make their lives better by holding this government to account. Speaker, I was honoured, shortly after my election, to be asked by the leader of the Progressive Conservative Party to serve as critic for advanced education and skills development. Within that context, it’s been my great honour to keep this government accountable, to make sure that they remember to keep in mind the best interests of everyone involved in the education sector, whether it be a student taking classes in high school or at university; the parent wanting to ensure that their child is able to attend a college or university and become successful thereafter; the teachers themselves who are directly responsible for facilitating the learning process; or the administrators who ensure that teachers are able to focus on teaching.", "As a resident, as a councillor for the town of Whitby and now in my role as the critic for post-secondary education and associate critic for education, I have watched in dismay as the government has continued to bungle the education file. Perhaps this is no more apparent than in my own backyard of Whitby–Oshawa. While I was a regional councillor for the town of Whitby and regional councillor for the region of Durham, I witnessed first-hand this government’s ineptitude when in 2015 we saw secondary schools across Durham region shut down—shut down—due to strikes. During that time, I heard from many parents whose way of life was deeply affected by their sons and daughters being out of school. Speaker, as I’m sure you know, these types of situations take a real toll on families, particularly students who miss critical lessons and days in the classroom in such a formative part of their education and, ultimately, their life.", "Now, any labour expert will tell you that the best deal is the one that the parties reach themselves. But during this process, it was becoming increasingly clear that this government had mismanaged that process. This government gave the parties no other option, and the saga eventually led to back-to-work legislation being considered by the House and ultimately a decision by the Ontario Labour Relations Board which ended the strike.", "Regardless of the conclusion of that process, it was clear that teachers were becoming increasingly frustrated with the government’s approach. Teachers like my daughter, with the Durham Catholic school board, are entrusted to shape and mould the minds of tomorrow. They’re called upon to go above and beyond for our children. As the lifeblood of our education system, it is important that we arrive at a process that works both for teachers and the taxpayer.", "Speaker, this government’s two-tiered bargaining system has clearly been a failure, creating chaos for children and parents and leading to the strike in the region of Durham, which was the longest in 25 years—the longest in 25 years.", "Now let’s turn to the changing dynamic in the classroom. As time has passed, the education system has evolved to incorporate more students, more classes and a wider variety of subjects that need to be taught to our students. The unfortunate flip side of this is that the problems we must deal with in the system have also changed and become more complex. Thus, so too must our solutions to these problems.", "A growing problem that our teachers are facing on a daily basis is deteriorating conditions in their workplace. These deteriorating conditions can take many forms, whether it’s violent students, bullying in schools or reduced resources for special-needs students. Everyone in this province is entitled to work in a safe environment." ],

In an ideal world, each student in every class attends their school excited to learn the topics of the day and has a thirst for knowledge that never goes away. Unfortunately, the reality is that sometimes students struggle with the material and, in rare cases, lash out against their teachers.", "In the event that a student does become violent in the classroom, teachers should be appropriately equipped to handle these situations in a way that allows both the teacher and the student to walk away unharmed. Schools should also be equipped to address these situations quickly and safely, with a focus on ensuring that incidents do not reoccur.", "A related issue is that of bullying, Speaker. Bullying has become increasingly commonplace in our schools and is completely unacceptable. The acts of bullies in the 21st century have become even more harsh with the dawn of social media. In the past, children were able to escape from the stresses put on them by being bullied at school by returning home to their families at the end of the day. Today, however, bullies are able to directly access other students from anywhere, at any time.", "I have no doubt that each of us, either directly or indirectly, knows someone who has been bullied in school or has a child who has been bullied in school. This is why it’s more important than ever to equip our teachers with the tools and skills necessary to prevent bullying where possible, recognize when bullying is occurring in their classes and do what they can to stop it as soon as possible.", "We know that a student’s desire to attend school can plummet if they are bullied, and because of that, it is crucial that we address the problem swiftly, because each student should be able to pursue their route to success through the education system.", "Similarly, we need to be able to better recognize the needs of special education students at our schools, and these students have just as much a right to pursue their route to success as every other student in school. More often than not, they simply require more resources and specialized learning plans to do so. We recognize that a significant part of improving the conditions in teachers’ workplaces is providing them with the resources necessary to ensure that all of their students can thrive and succeed. Speaker, we would like to see an education system that truly allows for individualized learning plans for these students and an environment that allows teachers to facilitate the learning process without feeling as though there aren’t enough hours in a day for each student.", "Meanwhile, another substantial area where this government has failed is the state of disrepair of many of our schools. This government has had 14 years to address the state of schools in Ontario. As far back as 2003, when then-Liberal education minister Gerard Kennedy launched the Good Places to Learn initiative, he stated: “Ultimately, a school’s condition reflects the state of commitment of one generation to the advancement of the next.” He confirmed at that time that there was a deficit of over $5 billion with regard to the state of Ontario schools. But this government’s response to the problem was tepid at best. Minister Kennedy recommended an increase of annual renewal funding and a one-time injection of public funds to persuade Ontarians that they were acting on the infrastructure problems in our schools.", "It became clear, in hindsight, that this government’s strategy on the file has been big announcements of Band-Aid solutions or a “move along; nothing to see here” approach. Well, there was something to see, Mr. Speaker.", "In a December 2015 report by the Auditor General, she referenced Ontario’s asset base of schools and recommended that $1.4 billion per year was realistically needed just to keep our schools in good working order. She also went further and noted that the deficit of disrepair in our schools had ballooned from $5 billion in 2003 to $14 billion in 2015. This confirmed that not only were our schools in bad shape, but that the problem was not being adequately addressed and was getting worse over time. Ultimately, the Auditor General stated that her recommendation of $1.4 billion per year to maintain our schools’ infrastructure would keep the ship afloat, as it were, but would not do a great deal to take care of the amount of deferred maintenance that had been allowed to accrue under this government.", "Knowing the full scope of the problem, it cannot be said that this government understands how to address the problem adequately. In June of 2016, this government announced an additional $1.1 billion of public funding for school repairs over the course of two years. However, what that money does not do is take care of the $15 billion that was allowed to accrue in deferred maintenance.", "Speaker, I must give credit where credit is due and commend the Minister of Education on one matter. I’m pleased to see that the Ministry of Education released data on the disrepair figures of all schools in Ontario. What this did was that it increased the transparency on the issue of school conditions and confirmed that the $15-billion backlog of capital repair not only exists in our publicly funded school system but also impacts every single one of our 72 school boards.", "It takes a certain degree of humility to admit when you’ve made a mistake. While I appreciate the minister’s effort to shed light on the problem, it does not excuse the level of inaction—inaction, Speaker—in our school system. But let’s be clear. I’m not here this afternoon to just point out the minister’s mistakes; I’m looking forward to the future and how members of this House can continue to alleviate the state of disrepair in our schools.", "We would expect ongoing transparency about disrepair in the Ontario school system and an annual release of facility condition index data as well as an analysis on the overall capital repair backlog so that we, as members of this House, and the residents of Ontario can see what we hope is a stem in the tide of year-over-year increases in that amount and start to see a decrease in the $15 billion of disrepair instead of an increase.", "Furthermore, we’d recommend that debt instruments need to be explored and that those are the only tools available that will sufficiently, and with the speed required, take care of these buildings in which two million children spend their days—Speaker, that’s two million children.", "We would also recommend guidelines for the desired conditions at which schools should be maintained. At a high level, we need to discuss what facility condition index level would be considered appropriate for classes to occur and what facility condition index level would be required for classes to be cancelled for the safety of our students. Speaker, we would also need to discuss what the average facility condition index level should be across all of the schools in Ontario, the obvious answer being that we should strive to improve the conditions of all the schools in our education system. From a low level, we would expect guidelines for the actual learning and working conditions of children and adults who spend their days in Ontario school buildings, and a plan—a plan, Speaker—for how to reach these goals.", "We would like to see issues not limited to, but including: What is the acceptable temperature range of classrooms for children to learn in, and teachers to work in; what is the acceptable air quality for these classrooms; and what is an acceptable amount of natural light? There are many, many children learning in classrooms with no windows currently, whether it be in detached classrooms or rooms in schools that have been newly converted into classrooms to accommodate expanding communities and enrolment in those communities’ schools.", "This might surprise those of you with no children in the public school system, and actually would surprise many parents also, because we don’t often hear about the problems that happen in schools because our children think that’s normal and are unlikely to speak up about issues that are perceived as such.", "Speaker, we would also like to see a proportionate distribution of the capital costs of maintaining school assets amongst the municipalities. The various provincial ministries and the various federal ministries continue to treat these schools as assets rather than the places of learning that they are, yet we continue to burden school boards exclusively with the capital costs of maintaining those buildings.", "We would like to see an approach to selling schools that recognizes the importance of local schools as community hubs, and focuses on the needs of students, families and communities rather than on an efficient use of assets at all costs. Schools are often in use outside of classroom hours as places where local sports leagues or other extracurricular activities can organize. A sale of any school has the capacity to affect the local community very deeply, and we would expect equal consideration be given to any decision made as to the sale of a school.", "We would also like government to stop promoting the notion that disrepair in schools happened mostly because of an inefficient use of assets by school boards, when in fact many, many documents—including the ones I have cited—would suggest that there have been gross and chronic underfunding to the school boards. Speaker, this has become a pattern under this government and is not unique—not unique—to the education file. Even if they had used every single school as efficiently as humanly possible with the funding given over the last 20 years, they would not have been able to keep these schools up to a standard to which Ontario children should have access.", "Additionally, we would like to recommend a structure where power over education funding and policies and the accountability for actually delivering public education reside in the same place, making passing the buck a non-option. Speaker, increased accountability in our education framework—and by extension, the government at large—is something that we all benefit from. I might add that pointing the finger and blaming others has become quite a sport and more and more common in the education sector under this government when it comes to delivering resources to our school system.", "To build on this expectation of increased accountability, we would like to see a structure where accountability for the delivery of public education reflects the reality and experience of real students and teachers, a structure that is not simply a sanitized look at education quality assessment office numbers and statistics, or high school graduation rates.", "I’ve spoken with many students and parents in the riding of Whitby–Oshawa and others throughout the province. When you actually talk to students and parents, you might hear a very different story.", "We’d also like a review of the funding formula and the benchmark costs which inform most of the grants in the funding formula. The government has promised this in almost every election and has yet to actually do a complete review and rejig of the funding formula. It’s time for the government to finally make good on its promise. It’s time for a complete look at how we’re funding education in this province and how the power dynamic works. This will allow the government to more appropriately and accurately distribute funds and resources to schools and communities, with a focus on improving the experience of students in schools across Ontario.", "In recent months, we have seen several calls to close schools, specifically in rural areas, as a way to improve cost efficiency and deal with enrolment issues. However, I would submit that there are other, more fruitful alternatives, ones that would not disrupt the lives and livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of students, families and education workers.", "For instance, we would ask the government to encourage school boards to further explore shared service agreements as well as shared facility agreements for coterminous boards. Ontarians already reap considerable benefits from these arrangements. For example, in Brantford, St. Basil Catholic Elementary School and Walter Gretzky Elementary School each have a wing in a 90,000-square-foot shared facility. The arrangement has already produced significant cost savings.", "This approach is further supported by a feasibility analysis of 11 school boards carried out by Deloitte in 2012, which found that shared services in areas such as energy and transportation could produce ongoing annual savings of $3 million to $8 million per year, representing anywhere from 13% to 28% savings on these boards’ annual total expenditures. All this is to say that, ultimately, there are ways to find cost efficiencies within our current system.", "Education is a public good. Efficiencies should not come at the expense of quality, but we must also remember that teachers and students in the classroom must always be the focal point of provincial education funding. For example, money for professional development should be allocated for teacher-directed and teacher-led initiatives. Training programs must reflect the experiences of teachers on the ground rather than being dictated from central administration, and funding should be directed as such.", "One of the many benefits of specialized teacher-led professional development is that it allows teachers to better understand and engage with particular student populations. Perhaps nowhere is that more evident than with First Nations, Métis and indigenous populations. Although there is much-deserved attention paid to on-reserve schools, it is important to remember that 82% of indigenous students attend a provincially funded school.", "To redress the current education and resource gaps that many students face, the government must ensure that schools have additional resources so that students have access to the proper supports required to meet their needs. But the critical component in this is to ensure sustainable, multi-year funding of public education and facilitate effective long-term planning with the earlier release of grants for student needs and flexibility to allow boards to meet local needs. We believe in long-term planning, but it is very difficult for boards to engage in long-term planning in a system where funding allocations are made only months before the start of the new fiscal year and are only for one year.", "Multi-year planning requires stable multi-year funding and flexibility in order to meet local needs, in addition to providing school boards with a long-term projection of what they can expect with regard to funding allocations well before the start of the new fiscal year. This would allow school boards to plan ahead much more effectively and would reduce the potential of boom-bust funding cycles that can happen in the current short-term model.", "Speaker, I feel that in debating Bill 92 in the House today it is necessary to discuss the great work that the Auditor General of Ontario has done on this file in conjunction with a historical look at collective bargaining relations under this government, as it gives an important historical context as to why this bill was drafted in the first place.", "In 2004, the Ministry of Education began informal talks with local bargaining units, with the aim that they incorporate provincially based funding and staffing policies into their specific local agreements. At the time, local collective bargaining was the primary process through which collective agreements were reached. However, the province then introduced a voluntary second tier of central bargaining which would serve to focus on issues that would naturally be suited to a centralized bargaining process; for example, Speaker, salaries and other financial matters, considering that the province controls the funding for education.", "While the process was voluntary, the ministry encouraged participation in the central process by offering in advance to cover the participants’ costs. By 2008-09, despite a continued lack of legislation on this matter, the Ministry of Education required that the terms of the central bargaining agreements be incorporated into all local collective agreements.", "During the 2012 round of negotiations, all the trustees’ associations and some teachers’ unions withdrew from the central bargaining process. In response, this government enacted the Putting Students First Act, 2012—which could also have been called the “putting teachers last act”—in order to force local school boards and union districts to incorporate into their local agreements the settlements that had been reached centrally.", "In short, this did not go well for the government. They were taken to court by the teachers’ unions, and the Ontario Superior Court of Justice found that the Putting Students First Act, 2012, was deemed unconstitutional. Two years later, when the government introduced the School Boards Collective Bargaining Act, 2014, the ministry had by that time spent a total of $14.2 million on its own central bargaining activities.", "I would add that it was shortly after this period, on November 4, 2015, that the Standing Committee on Public Accounts passed a motion to have the Auditor General’s office review the bargaining costs paid to the education sector unions since 2008. Had the standing committee not passed that motion, it’s unlikely that the Ministry of Education would have released all the information we now have access to today.", "Ultimately, the results of the committee’s motion were included in the May 2016 Auditor General’s report, where it was found that since the year 2000 the ministry had made payments amounting to $80.5 million. Speaker, this number is staggering, but not surprising considering this government’s history of waste and mismanagement.", "Furthermore, it was found that while some portions of the payments to the unions were allocated to provide teachers with some professional development, a full $22 million was provided with no strings attached, and that the ministry has little information as to what these funds were actually used for.", "The Auditor General asked if this was “an appropriate use of taxpayer funds, given that union members’ dues typically are used to cover bargaining costs.” In addition, the Auditor General stated, “We found very little evidence of governments paying education-sector unions for significant bargaining costs elsewhere in Canada.”", "But, Speaker, the lack of financial accountability is not the only critical issue here. When you look at the history of collective bargaining in this province under this government, you can see how long they have left the engine idling on this file. They began talks in 2004 to try to centralize the collective bargaining process. It took them 10 years to successfully introduce the School Boards Collective Bargaining Act, 2014, and a further three years to fix it by introducing the bill we’re debating today, Bill 92.", "This raises some questions, the first of which is, “Why now?” Why didn’t this government bring forward the School Boards Collective Bargaining Act, 2014, a decade ago, when they began talks with the unions to centralize the process? Furthermore, why weren’t the amendments contained in Bill 92 in the original act three years ago?", "There can only be two reasonable answers to this question. The first is that the Ministry of Education did not adequately complete the School Boards Collective Bargaining Act, 2014, when the minister tabled it in the House. The alternative is that the amendments in this bill are exceptionally time-sensitive.", "If it’s the latter, then we would ask what the considerations are on why this bill is being brought forward at this time. Is the urgency and importance being driven by the upcoming provincial election? I feel it is important that the minister’s answers to these questions are on the record so that we know where this government stands on the bill and whether there are potential ulterior motives at work here.", "Speaker, earlier I quoted words from the late American President John F. Kennedy. He once said, “Leadership and learning are indispensable to each other.” While it’s clear that this government lacks the former, we must therefore assume that they are incapable of the latter. Nevertheless, we give this bill the same degree of scrutiny as we give to all bills that pass through this House.", "What exactly does Bill 92, an act to amend the School Boards Collective Bargaining Act, seek to change? Bill 92 proposes several amendments that would change how the collective bargaining process is handled in the province. Some of the changes that the bill makes are good ones, but there are others that we have concerns about.", "Perhaps the largest change that Bill 92 would make is that it would force unions to a centralized bargaining table for collective agreements. Currently, the 2014 School Boards Collective Bargaining Act provides that the collective bargaining for collective agreements under the act may include centralized bargaining, but there is no requirement to include a centralized process. Bill 92 changes the collective bargaining process by requiring that centralized bargaining must always occur first, and that every employee in a union and every school board must be represented by a collective bargaining union.", "Bill 92 also amends the act by mandating that unions must have over 60 employees to be at the bargaining table, and if there are less than 15 employees, then they must join a union that has a collective bargaining agency to be present at the negotiating table.", "We are concerned that this shift will ignore many of the local issues that are specific to the needs of particular regions or teachers. In my view, forcing every employee into a union and collective bargaining into a centralized bargaining process carries the risk of all negotiations being focused on high-level items such as salaries, and likely won’t consider issues such as working environments in unique areas.", "However, this bill is not without some merit. For example, it allows the Minister of Education to extend the duration of current agreements by a period of two, four or five years. I have spoken with some teachers in my riding, and several feel that the time between negotiations is too short and that negotiations happen too frequently. Many of these teachers want to focus on teaching their students rather than worrying about what is being discussed at the negotiation table.", "Giving the Ministry of Education more flexibility in what the structure of collective agreements can look like is something that has value if it is to the benefit of both teachers and the taxpayer.", "There is also an amendment in this bill to add an additional five days’ notice of any change of a strike or lockout that would result in complete withdrawal of instruction, services or total closure of one or more schools of a board. When a strike or lockout occurs, it often results in a great amount of stress for both parents and children as they try to figure out how to accommodate the children being unable to go to school. While preventing a strike from occurring is obviously the most optimal option, providing parents with additional notice of a strike is something that we welcome.", "The bill also requires school boards to provide updates of the progress of local bargaining, which could result in more accountable and transparent negotiation.", "The last amendment I would like to mention is the bill requires that trustee associations be added to the sunshine list and that trustees would also be required to report their use of public funds received from the Ministry of Education.", "Naturally, we agree with the amendments that increase the level of accountability in government, as the public has the right to know how their tax dollars are being spent.", "As I said earlier, we will give this bill the same level of scrutiny as we would any bill and look forward to a continued debate. However, we’re not the only ones who have given this bill a great deal of thought and scrutiny. My office recently received a letter signed by the presidents of the Ontario Public School Boards’ Association, the Ontario Catholic School Trustees Association, the Association des conseils scolaires des écoles publiques de l’Ontario and the Association franco-ontarienne des conseils scolaires catholiques. They had been offered an opportunity to provide input into Bill 92 and raised significant concerns regarding a number of issues that would not be addressed by this bill.", "First, each of these associations had noted their commitment to a sequenced bargaining process, which they believe provides greater stability in the sector.", "Second, they have become concerned that the amendments in Bill 92 contained no ability to decrease the number of central bargaining tables and in fact could actually increase the number of central tables.", "Last, these associations noted that because this government has decided that Bill 92 will not address the issue of sanctions that can occur at both the central and the local level, there is the possibility that the education sector could find itself in a state of perpetual sanction.", "Speaker, these associations are well positioned to understand the needs of our education system. I would think that this government would listen carefully to their recommendations and consider each as we debate this bill here.", "As one would expect with any bill that has an impact on collective bargaining, there have been several stories in the media recently addressing the issue of collective bargaining. I believe that it’s important to have some of what has been said on the record here.", "For example, a Globe and Mail piece took a look at recently ratified contracts with the Canadian Union of Public Employees and how that agreement included a 4% wage increase over two years. The article states that this is reflective of the agreements that the government has reached with other education unions, including those with the Catholic and the elementary school teachers.", "Another recent article, in the Toronto Star, claimed that a recently reached collective agreement with the Ontario Secondary School Teachers’ Federation is the last negotiation process in this round.", "The total amounts of this round of bargaining with all education sector unions is expected to cost the province hundreds of millions of dollars over the next two years in additional salaries. The article later states that an increase of 1% to the wages of the province’s teachers can generally be expected to cost $170 million. When coupled with the results of other collective agreements, this means that this round of collective bargaining represents a cost of roughly $680 million over two years.", "Speaker, you may be wondering why I raise these articles and the figures they use in the Legislature. That’s because we have a concern about these costs when we consider that the minister has gone on the record saying that any cost associated with collective bargaining would be “net zero.” This begs the question: How will the minister be ensuring that collective agreements are net zero? The only question is, where will the cuts come from? They cannot come from the collective bargaining increases to our educators, so this government has to cut elsewhere, and this is what concerns my colleagues.", "Today, I’ve spoken about several ways in which our education system needs improvement and how the system cannot take more of this government’s neglect, but I cannot imagine the damage that would be done to our children’s education if cuts were made to anti-bullying measures, the school repair funding program or our special-needs students. Any cuts made to anti-bullying measures would remove what tools exist that allow our educators to prevent and address bullying before it becomes serious and help children who have been bullied if they’re unable to prevent it.", "Any cuts made to our school repair system would deepen the infrastructure deficit that already exists, resulting in some students not having access to adequate facilities and others being forced to move into other schools because it would be a danger to the students to remain in their original building. We’ve seen that this government does not understand how to address the problem, and any aid they’ve offered has been window dressing, at best. I’d also been concerned about the ongoing status of our education infrastructure if the cuts came from here.", "However, one area where cuts of any kind would do great damage is in the area of special-needs students. I’ve already discussed how we need to be able to recognize the needs of special education students in our schools. The resources that special-needs administrators currently receive are not enough to be able to accommodate the needs of these students.", "Speaker, what happens to special-needs programs if they’re faced with cuts? What happens to these students? How will this government ensure that special-needs students will always have the same opportunity—the same opportunity to receive an education as every other student in this province? These are the most vulnerable individuals in our society. They absolutely should not have their services cut, but cuts in other areas would also be unacceptable. If there was a reduction in support staff and a downloading of work directly to teachers, this would negatively impact the amount of time that teachers are able to spend in the classroom and, by extension, how much time they would spend with each student. This is not conducive to having an environment that promotes learning. Teachers require certain support structures that allow them to focus on their jobs—educating students—thus these support systems are critical for our children’s education.", "In a similar vein, we’ve already seen large cuts to resources in classrooms. Many teachers often have to pay for the items themselves that they use in the classroom. What else will teachers be forced to pay for if further cuts are made in this area? Ultimately, we would like to see this government not adopt a slash-and-burn approach just to maintain the idea that the result of collective bargaining will be net zero from a funding perspective.", "Any cuts made to the areas I discuss would have unfortunate ramifications for not just the affected students but the teachers and the parents of students as well. This is why I believe it’s important that any particular questions that I raise are answered. Students, teachers and parents have a right to know how this government is going to change the education system, particularly if it affects them directly.", "In closing, I’d like to reiterate what I’ve said here today about our concerns with Bill 92, an act to amend the School Boards Collective Bargaining Act. Again, there are some provisions in this bill that we welcome and think would have a positive impact on the lives of those that it would most affect, students and their parents; in particular, that it requires an additional five days’ notice if a strike or lockout is going to occur, giving parents more time to plan for their children. The bill also gives the Ministry of Education some flexibility in the length of collective agreements, giving teachers more time to focus on students and less upon what is happening at the negotiation table.", "Of course, we welcome the amendment that increases accountability, such as requiring school boards to provide updates on the progress of local bargaining and including trustee associations on the Ontario sunshine list. Both of these amendments will provide a more open environment for the public to see how their taxpayer dollars are spent.", "But, as I said, there are some challenges with the legislation. On the accountability front, we don’t believe that this bill goes far enough. It requires that trustee associations be more open and accountable, while at the same time forcing collective bargaining to occur through a centralized process. We’re also concerned that the accountability measures contained in the amendments within Bill 92 are just a sideshow to the minister’s true objective: forcing collective bargaining into the shadows so that the public cannot see how this government is handling the negotiations. There’s simply no way that we can trust that this is actually a priority for this government; otherwise it would have taken a much more concrete stance in 2004 and passed legislation much more quickly.", "We were also concerned about the minister’s statements concerning the net-zero approach to collective bargaining agreements. Our concern is that this almost certainly means cuts to education. Whether the cuts be from classroom resources, administrative resources, specifically from special needs students or elsewhere, parents and teachers both have a right to know how this government is going to impact the education system to compensate for their generous strategy at the bargaining table.", "I’ve mentioned in this House before that my daughter is an early childhood educator. I know that she and many others in the education sector go to work every day to do what small part they can in shaping the minds of their students and preparing them for the world that awaits them. That’s why we will continue to study this bill to determine if it’s in the best interests of our students, our teachers and the education future." ],

Why is it that the Liberals can’t seem to get it right? Why is it that we had, in 2012, the Putting Students First Act, then, in 2014, we changed the bargaining and then, in 2017, we will change the bargaining again? Maybe we could take our time, listen to everybody on both sides of the House that has good ideas and get it right this time, because at the end of the day, when the bargaining rules are not clear, nothing good comes of this, certainly, for the people affected, but mainly for our children in the schools in and around.", "I was also interested when he was talking about the school reviews taking place. I have been an MPP for close to 10 years, Speaker. Every single year, I have at least one of the four school boards that cover my area do a school review. I can tell you exactly how it’s going to end: All of the little schools in Nickel Belt close, and we put those kids—three and a half and four years old—on buses for hours at a time to bus them into big, urban schools. This is wrong.", "The last one to go through this was the rainbow school board. The last time they went at it, they shut down the school in my riding in Long Lake. Now this area has no school; everybody gets bused. Now they are looking at a primary school in Levack and Dowling as well as secondary schools in Lively and Chelmsford. We have to do better than this. I agree with what the member has said." ],

I remember back in the early 2000s—2002, prior to 2003—the state of our school system. I remember Mike Harris saying he was going to create a crisis in our school system, and create a crisis they did. It was such a crisis for our young students, our young people, that I had young students coming to me and saying to me that the strike had really jeopardized their chances of getting scholarships because there were no extracurricular activities in the schools. The schools were in total chaos.", "So it’s surprising to me that I’m hearing a lecture from that side of the House. I didn’t really mean to be partisan about this, because I really believe, and my thought was, that what’s being said here today would be: What would be in the best interests of our kids? We want to make sure that they get the education they need. We want to make sure that the tools are there. That’s the same party that said they would scrap full-day kindergarten. That’s also a useful tool for our kids. I travel this province and I hear from parents and I hear from teachers the value of full-day kindergarten.", "So this is the last party that anybody should take lectures from in this province when it comes to education. In their platform, education wasn’t even a factor. And as the member said, there must be an election coming—why they have such concern about education at this point." ],

Many people can’t get the surgeries they need.", "But now we’re seeing a rationing in our school system, where many rural schools—up to 600—will be closed in order to placate this government’s wasteful spending. In my riding, we’ve seen the schools of Springfield, Sparta and New Sarum—the hearts of their communities throughout rural Ontario—shut down due to this government’s mismanagement and faulty funding model. If only they could take a minute and put a pause on this review ongoing throughout the province, and maybe working with parents and listening to the community as a whole on how the boundaries are adjusted, we might be able to save some of these communities’ schools, which keep the lifeblood in rural Ontario.", "I know this government is anti-rural Ontario. They’d like to see as many people as possible move out of rural Ontario, because they can control the population much better with that.", "Maybe they could follow through on their actions and put a hold on closing the 600 rural schools in this province and give our kids in rural Ontario a fair chance to do the best they can in their lives." ],

  "speaker" : "Ms. Peggy Sattler",
  "text" : [ "I’m honoured today to rise in this House as the new education critic for the Ontario NDP caucus to participate in the debate on Bill 92, the School Boards Collective Bargaining Amendment Act, 2017.", "This bill furthers the evolution of centralized bargaining in Ontario’s education sector that began under the Liberal government in 2004 and culminated in the School Boards Collective Bargaining Act, 2014, which this legislation proposes to amend.", "In my remarks this afternoon, I’m going to spend some time tracing that evolution, describing the various iterations of collective bargaining that took place in 2004, 2008, 2012 and 2014. A clear understanding of how we have arrived at Bill 92 is necessary to reliably assess the impact of the changes that are proposed on the next round of collective bargaining in 2017 and how likely, or not, the proposed amendments will be in bringing labour peace and stability.", "Certainly there is no disagreement on this side of the House about the importance of labour peace in fostering positive teaching and learning environments, in enabling students to thrive, and in making families feel confident that their children will receive the resources and supports they need at school to get the best possible start in life.", "The School Boards Collective Bargaining Act, then known as Bill 122, was introduced on October 22, 2013. I was proud, as a newly-elected MPP, to make my inaugural speech during the second reading debate on that bill. My connection to this issue was deeply personal. I had served for 13 years as a school board trustee, from 2000 to 2013. I was elected to the board in the midst of the deeply divisive and rancorous approach to education labour relations that marked the Progressive Conservative government of then-Premier Mike Harris, and resulted, over the period from 1997 to 2003, in 279.5 instructional days lost to teacher strikes and board lockouts.", "This is important history. Ontarians should never forget that period of education turmoil and crisis that was deliberately and famously created by the Progressive Conservatives. A number of sweeping changes were introduced by the Conservatives, among them the introduction of a new funding model in 1997 that gave the government complete control of financing education and eliminated the ability of local school boards to raise revenues through municipal property taxes. Instead of local boards negotiating with their local bargaining units and able to fund local education initiatives through property tax levies, the provincial government now controlled both the amount of provincial funding allocated to school boards and also the level of education property taxes. As many of us will recall, this major restructuring of education financing, coupled with the forced amalgamation of school boards, prompted all five teacher unions—representing 126,000 teachers—to walk out for two weeks in November 1997, affecting 2.1 million students and politicizing—even radicalizing—a whole generation of parent and community activists, myself among them.", "I remember vividly the job actions, since my first child had just started JK that year. I remember walking the picket line in solidarity with teachers, my younger child in a stroller, to protest this shocking and unprecedented attack on public education.", "Despite his initial denials, Mike Harris later admitted that the express purpose of Bill 160 was to reduce costs by cutting $600 million out of education expenditures, a trend that continues under the Liberals, as I will discuss later.", "Other changes introduced by Bill 160 included placing teacher labour relations under the Labour Relations Act and naming provincial teacher federations as the bargaining agents for teachers while having local school boards remain the employer bargaining agents.", "Although the purse strings were now held entirely by the provincial government, the collective bargaining process did not give the province any formal role in collective bargaining. At the same time, local school boards continued to negotiate with their local bargaining units but did not have any ability to fund the agreements beyond what was provided by the province.", "In the first round of collective bargaining that followed the election of the Liberal government in 2003, the idea of framework agreements was introduced as a means of addressing the challenges associated with this misalignment. That meant negotiating a master collective agreement provincially which would address key funding issues. Individual school boards and teacher bargaining units were then responsible for negotiating local issues and for ratifying the framework agreements. This initial experiment with centralized bargaining began partway through the collective bargaining process and only applied to collective agreements negotiated with OSSTF and with ETFO. It was informal and voluntary, with a focus that was largely on central problem solving but did lead to signed agreements in 2005.", "In the 2008 round, the process became more formalized: Deadlines were set for agreement on key issues and financial incentives were offered to help reach provincial framework agreements. The process was expanded to include all four teacher unions: OSSTF, ETFO, OECTA and AEFO, as well as education worker unions who participated with school trustee associations at provincial discussion tables, or PDTs, with the government acting as facilitators. There were three discussion tables for education support workers: one for CUPE locals, one for OSSTF support worker locals and another that was comprised of locals from a number of other unions, known at the time as the ”pizza” table.", "While generally considered a success, the government’s stakeholder consultation summary that they have posted with relation to Bill 92 states that, “These voluntary and informal processes were not without their challenges though, including one teachers’ federation not meeting a deadline and receiving a different wage scale than other federations. As well, given that the process was voluntary and informal, there was a growing sense of frustration from the union and employer side with respect to the local implementation of centrally reached agreements.”", "Similarly, Queen’s University Professor Brendan Sweeney noted, in an article called Education Labour Relations in Ontario: “Although the provincial discussion tables negotiations were subject to some criticism, most education sector stakeholders perceived them to be valuable. The negotiation processes and the ultimate terms and conditions of the framework agreements have a number of noticeable impacts on the working relationships between school boards, school administrators, teachers, and support workers.”", "In particular, Sweeney says that the PDT process prioritized provincial actors and reduced the autonomy of school boards and other local stakeholders, affecting the day-to-day relationship between teachers and educational support workers, their unions and school boards. This can be problematic when local actors—those who actually administer the agreements—misinterpret the intent or language in agreements negotiated provincially.", "Sweeney also highlights the challenges administering a one-size-fits-all agreement across very different contexts with boards of different sizes and numbers of students and across regions that vary in population density and socioeconomic profiles. He states that, “Ensuring adequate room to manoeuver within those contexts, while maintaining accordance with collective agreements, remains a priority for school boards and unions throughout the province.”", "Sweeney also pointed out that the three- and four-year terms of the 2005 and 2008 provincial framework agreements, combined with centralized funding and control over financial aspects of education, led to noticeable changes in the interaction of the union representatives and the school board human resources personnel. In some boards, relationships improved. The length of the contract allowed the parties to engage in dialogue and develop trust in order to address matters in a mutually satisfactory manner. In other boards, especially those with a poor history of labour relations, the longer length increased the number of disputes between the boards and the union representatives about the interpretation of terms and conditions.", "Sweeney concludes that longer-term agreements make it more important than ever to develop and foster trust in systems, processes and relationships in the education sector, a point I will come back to later.", "The next round of bargaining, in 2012, saw yet another central process, this time with a critical difference. The process was conducted in the context of fiscal restraint, and the end goal of the process was to freeze wages for teachers and education workers.", "Bargaining was launched in late February 2012, when the first provincial discussion table meeting was convened by the government with the education sector unions. Not only were the trustee associations sidelined from the process, but a series of proposals was tabled by the government that led almost immediately to ETFO’s refusal to continue to participate. Other unions followed suit, withdrawing from central negotiations. The process itself was then challenged by the unions before the Ontario Labour Relations Board. The unions based their OLRB complaint on the actions of the Liberal government, which had gone far beyond the role of facilitator. The Premier, the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Education, they said, had stepped “into the shoes of the school boards as employers and [were] attempting to dictate the process and contents of school board collective bargaining.”", "Although the complaint was dismissed, the OLRB chair commented that since the PDT process was voluntary, it was entirely appropriate for the unions to abandon the process if they did not like the government’s position. This bolstered the rationale later for a legislated, rather than voluntary, two-tier bargaining process that was introduced with Bill 122.", "That summer in 2012, the government entered into a memorandum of understanding with OECTA. Unable to reach agreements with the other unions, the Liberal minority secured the support of the Progressive Conservatives in order to pass Bill 115, known by its Orwellian title as the Putting Students First Act. This legislation allowed the provincial government to set rules that local school boards must adhere to when negotiating with local unions, and also limited the legality of the teachers’ unions and support staff going on strike. It required that any collective agreements in the school board sector entered into after August 31, 2012, had to be substantively identical to the OECTA MOU. If school boards and affected unions were unable to reach collective agreements by December 31, 2012, agreements would be imposed upon the parties.", "During the debate on the School Boards Collective Bargaining Act, my colleague the member for Toronto–Danforth had this to say about Bill 115: “The bill goes well beyond any prior attempt by the provincial government to constrain collective bargaining. The authority given to the minister and cabinet effectively enables them to control both the process of bargaining and the results of bargaining, including the right to strike or lock out, and imposing collective agreements or their forms without any accountability to the Legislature.”", "The member for Toronto–Danforth went on: “The act interferes with the collective bargaining process set out under the Labour Relations Act on significant matters, such as wages and sick leave. It violates rights to freedom of association under section 3 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, as recognized by the Supreme Court of Canada.", "“The act seeks to shield the actions of cabinet from any review by the courts, the labour board or boards of arbitration, in contravention of a legal concept as basic as the rule of law.”", "I want to commend my colleague here for his prescience. He’s not a lawyer; however, he predicted what would happen more than three years later, when Bill 115 was indeed found to have contravened the Charter of Rights, despite the efforts made by the Liberals to insulate themselves from this outcome.", "In an article entitled “Collective Bargaining between Teachers and the Province of Ontario, 2012-2013: A Study in Charter Politics,” Carleton University Professor Michael Mac Neil writes:", "“Bill 115 was very carefully crafted to minimize the likelihood of its being found unconstitutional. The preamble to the act noted that the measures therein are meant to be exceptional and temporary and to seek and encourage ‘responsible’ collective bargaining. Most importantly, the legislation allowed bargaining to continue for almost four more months before the government could exercise the power to impose the wage freeze. Moreover, it did not remove the right to strike during that period. This, combined with the extensive centralized bargaining that had already occurred and the decision in Fraser and subsequent lower court cases, gave the government confidence that the bill could withstand a constitutional challenge.”", "However, in the fall of 2012, five unions—ETFO, OPSEU, OSSTF, Unifor and CUPE—took the government to court on behalf of the teachers, other professionals and support staff they represented. They argued before the Superior Court of Justice that the Putting Students First Act, as well as the processes and the procedures that the province had implemented leading up to the enactment of the legislation, had resulted in a breach of their right to freedom of association, as guaranteed by the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.", "On April 20, 2016, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice agreed, ruling that the Putting Students First Act was unconstitutional. The court held that the Ontario government had infringed on the applicant unions’ right to freedom of association by substantially interfering with the collective bargaining process throughout the fall of 2012 and with the passage of the bill.", "The ruling stated that between the fall of 2011 and the passage of the Putting Students First Act, Ontario infringed on the applicants’ rights under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms to meaningful collective bargaining. The justice further declared, “When reviewed in the context of the charter and the rights it provides, it becomes apparent that the process engaged in was fundamentally flawed. It could not, by its design, provide meaningful collective bargaining. Ontario, on its own, devised a process. It set the parameters which would allow it to meet fiscal restraints that it determined and then set up a program which limited the ability of the other parties to take part in a meaningful way.", "“In its desire to reach an end it had defined, Ontario ran over the rights of the employees. The end sought by Ontario could have been achieved through a more targeted legislative or administrative action and fairer, meaningful collective bargaining. The impact was not just on the economic circumstances of education workers, but on their associational rights and the dignity, autonomy and equality that comes with the exercise of that fundamental freedom.”", "Speaker, just as I remember my experiences with Bill 160, just as I remember how the anger that I felt at that time prompted my decision to run for the school board, I remember even more clearly how I felt after Bill 115. As a trustee, I remember the chaos it created in our schools: the loss of extracurriculars for our students, which is sometimes the only thing that keeps some young people going to class every day; the demoralization—the demonization of teachers and education workers; the feeling that things were out of control and that the Liberal government had chosen to engage in a high-stakes showdown without any regard at all for Ontario families and students.", "The Liberals’ mismanagement of the education system, their complete lack of concern about the impact on students and families, contributed directly to my decision to run for the provincial Legislature. I know that my colleague the member for Kitchener–Waterloo also remembers Bill 115. Professor Mac Neil from Carleton University writes, “At the same time that bargaining was continuing at the local level during the fall of 2012, unions were not confining their actions to the bargaining table. In September 2012, in a by-election in Kitchener–Waterloo, the New Democratic Party won in a riding for which the Liberals had high aspirations, denying the minority Liberal government the opportunity to form a majority government. The teacher unions appeared to have become actively involved in supporting the NDP candidate and were quickly credited with or blamed for, depending on one’s point of view, the outcome.”", "Of course, from our perspective, we would only offer credit, never blame, and I hope all MPPs would agree.", "The article goes on to say that after McGuinty’s resignation and the election of Kathleen Wynne, “In what may be a somewhat ironic development, the Liberal Party, after having mended fences to some extent with the teacher unions ... recruited the outgoing president of the OSSTF as their (ultimately unsuccessful) candidate in another by-election that took place on August 1, 2013.”", "This is a by-election with which I am intimately familiar, since it brought me here as MPP for London West with strong support from OSSTF members.", "Although Bill 115 was repealed on January 23, 2013, the toothpaste was out of the tube. The government’s consultation summary on the School Boards Collective Bargaining Act observes that, “The unintended result of the different central process in 2012 was confusion, animosity and damaged relationships between and amongst the parties.”", "While I agree that the result was confusion, animosity and damaged relationships, the instigating factor was not that the process was different. From the perspective of the students whose school year was turned upside down, from the perspective of the families who had to deal with the upheaval and uncertainty of labour unrest, from the perspective of teachers and education workers whose constitutional rights were trampled in the most cavalier way, the problem was not the process. The problem was the total disrespect for democracy displayed by the Liberals, the total disrespect for the school boards and education sector unions who were the parties legally responsible for negotiating collective agreements.", "Following the debacle of the 2012 round, the government went on a major offensive to try to rebuild relationships with education sector partners. To avoid a similar debacle in the future, they also proposed to formalize education sector collective bargaining. Trustee associations, teacher unions and education worker unions were all invited to participate in a consultation process throughout 2013 and 2014 to develop new legislation to guide education sector collective bargaining in the future.", "This new legislation, the School Boards Collective Bargaining Act—or Bill 122, as I mentioned earlier—created a legislative framework for the collective bargaining practices that had been in place informally between 2004 and 2012.", "The act changed the collective bargaining process in two key ways. First, it formalized a proactive two-tier process of central and local collective bargaining. Second, it provided for central grievance arbitration. The act mandated a system of central bargaining on fiscal issues and key matters of provincial education policy.", "For support staff, access to central bargaining was not mandatory but was subject to the approval of the minister. Before collective bargaining was able to begin at either level, the central parties were required to negotiate the items that would be bargained centrally. At the central table, the crown was identified as a formal participant but not a party in the sense of being subject to the bargaining and good-faith rules under the OLRA.", "While the central table was a tripartite structure, the status of the crown was somewhat different than the status of the other two parties. Local tables maintained the traditional bipartite structure, with bargaining conducted by school boards and local bargaining units. The crown was given the authority to designate additional matters to the central table, and the OLRB was designated as the arbiter of whether those additional items were central or local in cases where the parties did not agree.", "The legislation also allowed a two-track arbitration process in which the crown could participate in the arbitration hearing. In addition, although recognized as the employer, local school boards were not permitted to settle a local case without the consent of the crown.", "The legislation also created independent strike and lockout windows at both the central and local levels. All parties at both levels were required to follow the conditions laid out in the Labour Relations Act. Additionally, the School Boards Collective Bargaining Act required five calendar days’ written notice for parties to be in a legal position to take strike or lockout action.", "The act also clarified that a central award decision on language for parties with the same central collective agreement prevailed over any local settlements and/or local arbitration decisions.", "The School Boards Collective Bargaining Act received royal assent in April 2014 and was put to the test later that same year. The 2014 round of bargaining involved nine central tables. There were four teacher tables and five education worker tables.", "The new requirement that all three parties at each table—the government, the trustee associations and the unions—had to agree on which issues would be centrally bargained immediately created challenges. In the 2008 and 2012 bargaining rounds—the rounds preceding Bill 122—the ministry consulted more or less with unions and trustee associations but made the final decision on which matters would be dealt with centrally.", "Under the new legislation, when there was disagreement among the three parties as to what the central issues should be, they had to go to the OLRB for a decision to resolve the disputes. It therefore took from September 2014 to January 2015 just to determine the issues to be centrally bargained with teacher unions, and until June 2015 to determine the issues to be bargained with CUPE.", "By April 2015, negotiations had hit an impasse, partly because of a government proposal to eliminate caps on class sizes and to give teachers more non-classroom duties. Strikes in April and May closed high schools in Peel, Durham and Sudbury, with elementary teachers following suit with work-to-rule action. Notices were served of possible teachers’ strikes in Halton, Peel, Waterloo, Ottawa-Carleton and Thunder Bay. Following a ruling from the OLRB that the Peel, Durham and Sudbury strikes were illegal, the government introduced back-to-work legislation, which passed on May 28, 2015.", "Desperate to ensure labour peace for the start of the 2015 school year, the Premier met with union leaders in July and secured a commitment to get back to the bargaining table. By mid-August, most of the teacher unions were back at the bargaining table, and OSSTF was the first to announce a tentative provincial deal on August 20. Talks later collapsed, however, with CUPE and ETFO, who launched work-to-rule campaigns in September.", "What can we learn from this history lesson on collective bargaining in Ontario’s education sector? First, the process matters. But what matters much more is whether the parties are treated with respect and whether there are meaningful opportunities to negotiate.", "The 2012 round was conducted using the voluntary, informal PDT process. The 2014 round was conducted within a formal legal framework, but both rounds were almost equally disastrous for students and families, for teachers and education workers and for school boards.", "The 2012 round went off the rails from the beginning, when the government announced its take-it-or-leave-it ultimatum and chose to ignore the role of school boards as the legal employers of teachers and education workers. It completely imploded when the government decided to impose collective agreements, a decision that was later found to violate the charter rights of unions to free association.", "Despite the cautious optimism that was expressed by stakeholders for the formalized process set out in Bill 122, the 2014 round was only slightly less disastrous than the one before. As the only participant with the authority to develop and implement a legislative framework, the government had an obligation to show the leadership necessary to make the framework work. The Liberals chose not to do so, allowing the escalation of job action during both central and local bargaining.", "In the spring of 2016, having made a commitment during the initial consultation to conduct a review of the act once bargaining was complete, the government invited stakeholders to participate in a study to assess if further improvements or tweaking were needed to the act.", "In July 2016, a summary of the consultations that were undertaken was publicly posted on the Ministry of Education website. The author of the consultation summary states—no doubt tongue in cheek—that the government wanted to “build on the success of this first round of bargaining” under the School Boards Collective Bargaining Act.", "So here we are debating the legislation that resulted from that review: Bill 92, the government’s proposed amendments to the School Boards Collective Bargaining Act.", "Comparing the consultation summary that’s posted on the website to the legislation that is before us today reveals that Bill 92 does include some of the recommendations made by some of the stakeholders who participated in the consultation process. Unfortunately, however, several of these recommendations were highly divisive throughout the consultations on the bill, raising concerns about the effectiveness of these amendments in improving the collective bargaining process for the next round.", "I’m now going to turn to what is in Bill 92 and share some stakeholder perspectives on the provisions that are included in the bill.", "Currently, the School Boards Collective Bargaining Act provides that bargaining for collective agreements under the act may include central bargaining but is not required to include it. Bill 92 changes this rule to mandate that central bargaining must always occur.", "Further, it states that for the purposes of central bargaining, every school board must be represented by an employer bargaining agency, and every employee in a bargaining unit must be represented by an employee bargaining agency. This amendment is to take effect during the round of bargaining following the 2017 round.", "The bill adds new rules to the School Boards Collective Bargaining Act to ensure that all trade unions representing employees other than teachers must either be designated as an employee bargaining agency or be a member of a council of unions designated as an employee bargaining agency for the purposes of central bargaining.", "The OLRB’s role in the process is set out, and related regulation powers are described. The OLRB would act as a neutral third party to assist education worker groups to find a central employee bargaining agency. It would initially act in an advisory capacity, but it has the power to make a binding decision if necessary.", "A new requirement included in the bill is for five days’ notice of any change to the nature or scope of a strike or lockout that would result in the complete withdrawal of instruction or services in one or more schools of a board or the closure of one or more schools of a board.", "In addition, the current act prohibits parties from entering into agreements to continue the terms of operation of a collective agreement. Bill 92 adds provisions to permit such agreements in specified circumstances and sets out the process by which an agreement may be entered into and the rules that apply to an extension. A transitional provision addresses the validity of continuation agreements that were entered into when the prohibitions applied.", "Other new provisions include when the crown or an employer bargaining agency may provide assistance with local bargaining or require information regarding local bargaining; how conflicts or inconsistencies within a collective agreement between central and local terms may be resolved; agreements or undertakings entered into by the crown for certain purposes under the act; the delegation of powers from the Lieutenant Governor in Council to the minister or from the minister to a ministry employee; and the continuation of the education relations commission and related governance matters.", "Speaker, New Democrats absolutely agree that the provision to allow extensions to exist in collective agreements when both parties support an extension is important to ensure labour stability. In light of the tentative agreements that have been negotiated to extend the term of operations of the collective agreements that were ratified during the last round, this amendment is necessary to allow the extensions to be implemented should these agreements be ratified and approved by the crown.", "One wonders, however, about the rationale for many of the other changes, especially since the consultation summary repeatedly highlights the lack of consensus on potential changes to the acts. For example, these are various statements taken from the summary:", "“In general, there was no clear consensus about changes that are needed.”", "“The crown will need to consider the feedback received, and continue to engage in a now open dialogue with its central partners, as the lack of consensus does not indicate a completely clear path for improvements to the act.”", "“The parties were in consensus that the length of time taken to reach an agreement on the central/local split of issues was too long. Many of the parties also expressed that as this was the first round of negotiations under the new framework, more experience would likely help address this in subsequent rounds. Some of the parties also felt that the number of issues discussed at the central table was too broad.", "“There was no consensus,” however, “across the parties on any amendments to the act to address the issues mentioned, which does not provide a clear path forward.”", "And finally: “While this consultation process has concluded, policymakers should carefully consider all the feedback provided; however, the lack of consensus does not indicate a completely clear path forward.”", "The only issue about which there was consensus across stakeholders was with regard to improved French-language capacity. All the French-language parties agreed that there is a French-language capacity issue that needs to be addressed to ensure that they are able to fully participate in all aspects of the bargaining process in the language of their choice.", "The report offered several suggestions to facilitate the conduct of future central negotiations entirely in French and to ensure that the specific language of labour relations is understood in both languages. These suggestions included increasing the fluent French-language labour relations capacity of the Minister of Education at the staff and senior management level, ensuring that quick, accurate and knowledgeable translation services are available and providing a knowledgeable interpreter.", "Yet despite this consensus around the unique needs of French-language central parties, none of these recommendations are reflected in Bill 92. Instead, the bill includes several issues that were highlighted as being particularly polarizing: for example, the five days’ notice provision. The report states that the School Boards Collective Bargaining Act “requires that federations, unions, and trustees’ associations/school boards provide at least five calendar days’ written notice in advance of any labour disruption at the central or local level. There is no provision in the act for providing specific details and/or providing additional notices should the party make any changes to the nature of the labour disruption.", "“The parties’ discussions focussed on whether this provision was appropriate for the sector, if it functioned as intended in the first round of bargaining, and whether or not any amendments could infringe on the right to engage in a labour disruption.", "“The parties were split fairly evenly along the following lines:", "“—affirming that the status quo is appropriate; or", "“—suggesting that amendments need to be made to require the notice to specify the action that will be taken in detail and that a new notice must be provided for every and any change to labour disruption activity.", "“A few parties suggested that, if the act is to be amended, it should be to remove the five days’ notice requirement and make the parties only subject to the requirements set out in the Labour Relations Act.”", "The issue of education worker union participation in central bargaining was also flagged as contentious:", "“Education workers’ unions must request that the minister establish a central table for their trade union or council. Some unions and local bargaining units chose not to participate in central bargaining.", "“Concerns were raised about the possible inconsistency in bargaining outcomes that could result from some parties not participating in central bargaining. In addition, concerns were raised about limiting the ability of trade unions and local bargaining units to freely choose to participate in central bargaining. There was no consensus among the parties about whether central bargaining should be mandatory for all education worker unions and mandatory for all bargaining units in a union.”", "So it is somewhat surprising that Bill 92, a bill that is intended to smooth the collective bargaining process and prevent the kind of labour disruptions that occurred during the 2014 round, includes so many issues on which there was no consensus.", "I listened carefully last week during the minister’s speech leading off debate on this bill. She stated, “In addition to supporting the tentative extension agreements that have been reached, the proposed amendments will result in an improved process for the next round of formal bargaining.” She went on to say, “We have consulted extensively with our partners and incorporated their perspectives into these proposed amendments. Of course, we must acknowledge and respect the fact that some of the proposed amendments will require continued engagement with our partners, but there is no question that each of these amendments, which collectively serve to refine the legislation, are needed to ensure a flexible, transparent and consistent process going forward.”", "Actually, I think there is a question. From the initial responses of the parties who participated in the consultation process, it appears that there are quite a few questions about whether the amendments will improve and strengthen the process going forward.", "CUPE, in particular, is concerned about the provisions to make central bargaining mandatory for all education worker unions. They issued a media release on February 22 that stated:", "“CUPE Ontario strongly opposes an amendment to the School Boards Collective Bargaining Act ... tabled yesterday by the Minister of Education ... that will make central bargaining with the provincial government mandatory for all education workers.", "“If passed, the new legislation would take away the rights of school board support workers to democratically determine their participation in central bargaining with the provincial government. Currently, education workers represented by CUPE and other support staff unions may request to participate in central bargaining but are not mandated into the process.", "“‘We have repeatedly shared with the government that, in our view, this is not the part of the act that needs an overhaul. Legislating all education workers into a central bargaining process with the provincial government is wrong. And, as previous successful rounds of bargaining have proved, completely unnecessary. In our view, if it ain’t broke, why fix it?’ said Terri Preston, chair of CUPE’s Ontario School Board Coordinating Committee....", "“Respect for workers’ rights to determine their participation in the process, as currently provided by the act, has been fundamental to CUPE’s support for and participation in central bargaining with the provincial government.", "“‘Mandatory central bargaining is anti-democratic,’ said Fred Hahn, President of CUPE Ontario. ‘We’re not going to sit idly by while this government attempts to undermine our democratic right to free collective bargaining. We’ve fought this before, and we’ll fight this again.’", "“CUPE has continuously made its concerns with this change known to the ministry, through consultations and correspondence, and calls on the minister to delete this change from the draft legislation before it proceeds any further through the legislative process.”", "OSSTF is also concerned about the impact of the legislation on the collective bargaining process. Their press release, also issued on February 22, states:", "“The new amendments to the School Boards Collective Bargaining Act announced Tuesday by Mitzie Hunter, the education minister, have not addressed how to streamline the process or improve labour relations at the bargaining table.", "“Although the Ontario Secondary School Teachers’ Federation ... participated in the consultations regarding the proposed amendments, it is obvious that the consultations were not taken seriously by the government. ‘There are a number of significant structural flaws in the current legislation and OSSTF/FEESO made 11 recommendations to streamline and strengthen the bargaining process. All were ignored, resulting in none of our issues being addressed and the process continuing to be lengthy and unwieldy,’ said OSSTF/FEESO President Paul Elliott.", "“‘These changes announced by the minister do not improve the legislation and do nothing to make the bargaining process more efficient,’ concluded Elliott.”", "AEFO’s release, also dated February 22, states:", "“The Association des enseignantes et des enseignants franco-ontariens (AEFO) has been made aware of the government’s proposed amendments to the School Boards Collective Bargaining Act.... A quick read-through indicates that some of these amendments fall short of AEFO’s expectations.", "“For example, the government intends to force unions representing support staff (secretaries, teachers’ aides, computer technicians, etc.) to become members of provincial negotiating organizations. However, as its members’ bargaining agent, AEFO already represents them in an official and exclusive capacity.", "“‘Any amendment to the act should lead to a more efficient process,’ indicated AEFO President Rémi Sabourin. ‘There is no need to make it more cumbersome,’ he added.”", "ETFO’s response to the proposed amendments states, “The government is again, reminded that ETFO provided its own suggestions for amendment to Bill 122 in May 2016. Regrettably and significantly, very few of these have been included in the government document. ETFO continues to believe that its proposals would provide for significant improvements in the manner in which Bill 122 operates and urges the government to reconsider its proposals before finalizing any package to be presented to the Legislature. Particularly we are disappointed that no provision has been made, as suggested in our prior brief, to extend the period in which the parties can agree on central items or have such issues determined so that bargaining is not delayed.”", "The ETFO brief goes on to say, “ETFO has no issue with continuing central bargaining for all education worker bargaining units, but such central bargaining should not be mandatory but require the agreement of the employee representatives.... ETFO does not oppose procedures to permit stranded units to join other EBAs; however, in our view this should only be permitted with the consent of the EBA.”", "The ETFO brief urges that “the length of regular collective agreements should not be prescribed but should be left to the bargaining parties to determine,” and that “any process which would enable one party to trigger extension negotiations should provide for a full range of bargaining and dispute resolution options.”", "ETFO does not support the proposal requiring mutual agreement between the crown and employer bargaining agency on a lockout, and strongly opposes “the suggestion that there should be a new five days’ notice for any identified escalation of strike/lockout activity.”", "School boards are also questioning whether the amendments in Bill 92 will ensure what the minister calls a “flexible, transparent and consistent process going forward.” On February 10, before the legislation had been tabled, the presidents of the four trustee associations—OPSBA, OCSTA, ACEPO and AFOCSC—co-signed a letter to the minister expressing their significant disappointment and deep concern about a number of issues that were not addressed in the bill.", "The final point I would like to make before I wrap up my speech is about the other factors that contribute to labour peace and stability, aside from the collective bargaining framework. Earlier I talked about the importance of the parties treating each other with respect, whatever framework they are operating within. The other essential precondition is ensuring that students have the resources and supports they need to reach their learning potential, especially students with identified special needs, students who are English-language learners, and students who are marginalized by poverty and lack of opportunity.", "Ontario teachers and education workers are passionate about student learning. They are passionate about public education as a means to promote equity and inclusion. But too many teachers struggle to meet the diverse needs of students, with declining resources.", "In his remarks opening the debate on this bill, the parliamentary assistant to the minister said that “underlying the success of Ontario’s publicly funded education system are two key elements, both of which are intrinsically tied to respectful bargaining that prioritizes mutually beneficial agreements. Those two elements are: partnership in reaching common goals, and sustainable funding that provides the resources and support necessary to make those goals attainable.”", "New Democrats couldn’t agree more about the importance of sustainable funding that ensures resources and support. However, what we’ve seen from this Liberal government is a lot of talk and not much action. Over and over, we hear the Liberals claim that education funding is going up, but they don’t mention that the rate of increase is actually lower than the rate of inflation. That means revenues are not even keeping pace with costs.", "Over the past three years, Liberal budget documents have revealed that the government has not spent more than $1 billion in dedicated education funding: $400 million was left unspent in 2014, $248 million in 2015, and $430 million in 2016. At the same time, there is a $15-billion maintenance backlog that has accumulated in deferred repairs across the province.", "The budget showed that the Liberals made a $250-million in-year cut to education in 2014-15, and internal budget documents reveal plans to cut another $500 million out of education over the next three years.", "Parents of students with special needs are disproportionately affected by this government’s misplaced priorities. GSN allocations for this school year resulted in 25 school boards receiving $8 million less funding under the Special Education Grant. Last year saw the lowest annual increase of GSN funding for schools since the Liberals came into office.", "In Toronto alone, boards will be dealing with a shortfall of more than $2 million. The Geographic Circumstances Grant, which helps to keep small and rural schools open, will again be cut this year. Over the last two years, this grant has been cut by almost $10 million and is now facing another $7 million in cuts.", "Speaker, families understand that Liberal cuts to education will mean fewer supports for students, more layoffs and even more school closures across the province. About 100 good neighbourhood schools have closed across the province since 2011, and 600 Ontario schools are currently part of accommodation review processes.", "Instead of facilitating shared use of schools as community hubs, the Declining Enrolment Adjustment, which provides a three-year transition period for lower-enrolment schools, is being cut by half—$33 million—and it’s being shortened to a two-year period. When these cuts are coupled with GSN, underfunding and the pupil accommodation review guidelines, the inevitable outcome is more school closures.", "Kathleen Wynne and the Liberals have let Ontario families down—my apology, Speaker. The Premier and the Liberals have let Ontario families down. She has broken her government’s promise that she would invest in public education, and the budget shows that education is likely to face further cuts.", "The high-needs allocations will be frozen for the next four years, at $1 billion overall. The Pupil Foundation Grant faces a $36-million cut. The base top-up funding is being cut by $38 million and is slated to be completely eliminated over the next three years.", "In the past two years, we have seen hundreds of teachers lose their jobs due to underfunding, as well as ESL educators and early childhood educators. At a time when we should be investing in students’ futures, the Liberals are cutting critical programs instead and forcing students to pay the price. This is not the way to ensure the success of Ontario’s publicly funded education system. It is not the way to ensure respectful collective bargaining that prioritizes mutually beneficial agreements.", "I want to thank you, Speaker, for this opportunity to participate in this important debate. I have raised a number of issues in my historical overview of the collective bargaining process in Ontario, issues that I think are highly relevant as we look at this bill and reflect on the provisions that it proposes and we use the experience of the past to assess whether the provisions that are set out in this bill will actually do what the bill is supposed to do, which is to streamline the collective bargaining process, to strengthen the collective bargaining process, and to improve the collective bargaining process.", "Based on the historical overview I have provided, I think some serious questions have been raised about the efficacy of this bill in actually achieving that labour peace and stability that we want to see following future rounds of collective bargaining.", "I look forward to listening to further debate on this legislation, to hearing the questions and comments from my colleagues, and to watching as this bill moves forward in this province and we work to ensure that all students have opportunities to have the supports and resources they need to thrive." ],

Suddenly, now education is front and centre.", "I listened to her, and she spoke about chaos and mismanagement. However, all this mismanagement has taken place over the last 12 or so years, according to the NDP, and they never saw fit to mention this or to even put it in their platform. So that’s total negligence on their part, then. They are to blame for any erosion in the system, which is not the case. Ontario has one of the best education systems anywhere in the world. This is not partisan spin; this is factual. We have people from all over the world, from other jurisdictions, coming to Ontario to see what’s right with our education system.", "Mind you, Mr. Speaker, there’s always room for improvement, and that’s why we’re trying to do that through the collective bargaining act.

It’s interesting that the two by-elections, Kitchener–Waterloo and London West, really drew from the strength of the community and their sense of fairness when it came to Bill 115 and the attack on teachers. I’m going to throw myself in the mix there. I had been a teacher at the time who had been kicked in the teeth by Bill 115 and this Liberal government. That fired me up, that fired a number of my colleagues up to take it to the streets and take it to the government, and now I’m standing here as a result of that. I cut my teeth on Bill 115 because it was, as we know, unconstitutional.", "But here we are again with this government stirring it up and mixing things up with collective bargaining. I hope that in the province of Ontario, we will continue to see any kind of meaningful negotiation when it comes to collective bargaining. We’re seeing less and less autonomy when it comes to local bargaining, and Speaker, I’ll remind you and everyone in this House that each of our boards, each of our local communities, has unique needs.

The law must be the same for all, both protection and punishment. I will not expand on that any further, but on the fraternity, this is an important element that I think we need to recognize.

  "text" : [ "First off, I appreciate the opportunity to address Bill 92. Of course, I also wish to commend the newly elected member from Ottawa–Vanier on her maiden speech and, as has been commented, laying out so many of the principles that we hold dear, not only in the province of Ontario but in Canada and around the world: justice and freedom for all, and the rule of law. We could go on and on. I think that’s very important in a maiden speech, to establish and to set that bar.", "We all remember our maiden speeches. Mine was a couple of decades ago. I had a chance to talk about the riding and I also recall reading my grandfather’s maiden speech, which would have been in probably 1945. Again, military and coming right out of the Second World War and the principles that you’ve articulated—obviously we fought for that. Our parents, our grandparents fought for that in that war and in many wars before that.", "I will mention that I also thank the member for Ottawa–Vanier for giving us a little bit of a pause, a break from Bill 92, but I will wade back into a piece of proposed legislation that’s the titled School Boards Collective Bargaining Amendment Act, 2017. We’re told that the bill, the proposed legislation, will better enable us to strike a balance between provincial and local collective bargaining. It makes centralized bargaining mandatory. There are some objections to that that I hope, in my 20 minutes, I’ll have time to address.", "Of course, Bill 92 is not to be confused with a previous Bill 92, the public sector pay freeze legislation, 2012. Bill 92 in many ways has been spawned from the previously debated and passed Bill 115.", "We have a new bill before us, Speaker. It’s an enhancement or a proposed model for collective bargaining, the two-tier system of collective bargaining that we now have in the province of Ontario, with respect to those who work in the education field, and a model that—this is related—just brought us to a two-year contract extension for OSSTF. I am a former member of OSSTF; that stands for Ontario Secondary School Teachers’ Federation.", "You can see the intention behind this two-year contract, given that we will have an election in a little over a year from now. That may be a good thing, to get over that hump rather than the government negotiators—and I never know who they are; we always know the names of the union negotiators. But it will, perhaps, better enable the government negotiators at the table with the teachers to get over that hump rather than, in a sense, being under the gun of offering money to unions just before an election. In that sense, maybe that’s a good thing. OSSTF is going along with that. I understand that some of the other teacher unions will be following and so we’ll probably, I assume—you can’t speculate in this business—see them ratify that approach.", "With this legislation, it’s not the kind of legislation that really amazes anybody, but it does kind of amaze me that the government is so eager to introduce this kind of housecleaning approach. They’re obviously still trying to fix a problem that was created by this government, again, going back to the aforementioned Bill 115.", "But there are so many other issues in the area of education that are plaguing our system, plaguing our schools. Things are out of balance. There’s an argument, through this legislation, that the two-tier collective bargaining system is out of balance, but there are other things that are out of balance in our education system as a whole and the negative effects on the number one stakeholder in our education system, and that is the students who attend. This legislation goes on and on about the approach that they’re taking. I’ve scanned the legislation. I don’t think it mentions the word “student.” I don’t think it mentions the word “pupil.” “Pupil” is perhaps the bureaucratic word, or the older word, for a student. I’m sure it mentions teachers; I don’t think it mentions parents. So this is not necessarily a piece of legislation—it is education legislation but it’s really not about students; or parents, for that matter, or communities.", "What I see with respect to the operation, the governance of our education system, in my mind, is a misallocation of scarce resources. So many of the debates are around money. Of course, collective bargaining is primarily about money. Whether it’s wages or salaries, hours of work or amounts of sick time, amounts of holiday time or pensions, invariably it’s about money.", "It’s about, of course, working conditions. As a former high school teacher, I never really found the job necessarily dangerous, although I did get my job at Christmas because one of the students beat up the former teacher. But other than that, most of these issues are around money.", "We’ve just heard the one-hour lead. There was actually 10 minutes of that one-hour lead presented last week from our education critic, Lorne Coe, who is the member for Whitby–Oshawa. He described aspects of the misallocation of resources—or “scarce resources,” to use the economic term. I note his argument for better usage of our schools as community hubs.", "One example I hope to intertwine with my discussion—and I know that a number of the teacher unions addressed this during pre-budget hearings. We’re all aware of the race of this government to shutter the doors of so many of our small rural, small-town schools. In my view, it regrettably sentences more young people—very young people—to yet even longer school bus rides to school in the morning and back again at night.", "Scanning the legislation, there’s no mention of school buses there or transportation; again, no mention of students, no mention of pupils, no mention of parents in this legislation, even though it is education legislation.", "As a former teacher, I know a little bit about the high school environment. I never did go to teachers’ college. Like I say, I was hired at Christmas. There was a need for somebody in the shop wing. I taught agriculture and environmental science. I have the utmost respect for Ontario’s teachers. I keep in touch with so many of my colleagues, but I really keep in touch with so many of my former students. I have that respect for teachers, for educators, for the support workers—those janitors who know everything that goes on in the school, especially the big high schools like the one I taught at, with well over 1,000 students. You can’t be out in the hall all the time and you can’t be behind the school all the time and in the parking lot, during breaks and during noon hours, breaking up the fights, which actually was part of my job as a teacher. I’m not sure whether teachers today break up fights or ride herd at noon hour—maybe other people are brought in to do that—because I’ve been away from the system for a number of years.", "It can be a tough job, but, quite sincerely, it is a very rewarding job. I loved the job. You work from 9 to 5 in the school. Sometimes, people do leave before 5 o’clock. My job required coming in Sunday afternoon because I was managing a 50-foot greenhouse as part of the agriculture program.", "I come from a family of farmers and teachers. My father was a teacher at a number of levels, and my grandmother was a teacher. I know my father did negotiate on behalf of high school teachers with the Haldimand Board of Education, as I recall. During my tenure as a member of OSSTF, I certainly did not consider myself a union man. We did not go out on strike. We would never think of going out on strike.", "My grandmother was a teacher in the one-room school system—of which I’m a proud graduate, at SS number 12, Shands public school, a one-room school. That’s the kind of school where the teachers do run the school. When you have one teacher and eight grades, the students, especially in the senior grades, understand that it’s their responsibility to make sure that things run adequately and in a good way.", "When you craft legislation like Bill 92, it is important to speak to people on the front lines. I know there was a consultation—well, I know now there was a consultation process for this legislation. I just found out. Our critic may have known about it. I don’t know whether he attended any of the consultations. But with all the presentations that we heard on the finance committee from many of the teacher unions, from the school boards, nobody mentioned this legislation. I thought that maybe the unions got blindsided by this. CUPE is not happy, but I don’t think they got blindsided. They knew this was coming, I’m sure.", "I just think it’s unfortunate. I don’t recall reading anything in the papers about this legislation or in social media. I think it’s unfortunate that when something like this lands on our plate—-I suppose it was last Thursday. I will say, on behalf of the official opposition, that we have not had a chance to discuss this legislation. We will do that tomorrow during our caucus meeting.", "But it’s so important to talk to people on the front lines. Nobody in my constituency has sent me an email about it because they don’t know about it, really. I’m not sure whether many of the people in the profession know about this—whether janitors in the schools, people doing maintenance, education assistants or teachers even know about this legislation. Maybe that’s the way things run. I know that when I was teaching, I really had no idea what the deliberations were at the board level or what the deliberations were at the union level—not that OSSTF was a union back in the 1970s, in my view. We considered it a professional organization because we considered ourselves professional, not union people.", "I think it’s very important that whoever is behind this legislation has a feel for what’s going on inside the classroom. As I’ve said, it doesn’t talk about students, but I hope we had an adequate consultation. You have to talk to teachers, talk to the principals—we heard a bit through some of the organizations—talk to the trustees, talk to the parents. I don’t know whether anybody talked to the students about this. Why do we have these schools? Why do we have teachers? It’s for the students. Why do we have hospitals? It’s for patients. I don’t know whether the people who we built this system for were consulted on this; probably not.", "Again, that’s why we spend billions and billions of dollars on our education system. It’s the number two draw as a ministry on the provincial treasury, and that’s not counting university budgets and community college budgets.", "We did hear from the Ontario English Catholic Teachers’ Association, OECTA. Ann Hawkins came before finance committee during our fairly recent pre-budget consultations. She’s the president of the Catholic teachers’ association. She didn’t talk about collective bargaining. She didn’t talk about this legislation that we started debating the first week back. She pointed out yet another promise of this government that has not been lived up to:", "“During the 2014 election, the Liberal Party campaigned on a platform to invest in social programs and social infrastructure. Premier Kathleen Wynne put the matter bluntly”—and again, here’s a quote from Kathleen Wynne—“‘That’s what governments exist to do,’ she said. However, in many ways, this pledge has not matched reality.” According to Ann Hawkins, Ontario, as she pointed out, “still has the lowest spending on public programs per capita of any province in Canada.” She identified this as “not a proud achievement.” It always raises the question: Well, just what is this government spending the billions of dollars on?", "One thing that Ann Hawkins did address on behalf of the Catholic teachers’ union—she spoke of school closures, the impact on rural Ontario. The government is doing this “as a way to improve cost efficiency and deal with enrolment issues. However,” Hawkins suggested, there are more fruitful alternatives available, alternatives “that would not disrupt the lives and livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of students, families and education workers.”", "One of the alternatives she spoke about was shared services. She talked about “a feasibility analysis of 11 school boards carried out by Deloitte in 2012, which found that shared services in areas such as energy and transportation”—obviously, let’s put everybody together on the same school bus—“could produce ... annual savings of $3 million to $8 million.” There’s a 13% to 28% savings on school boards’ annual total expenditures.", "OECTA is well aware of the pain in closing schools, and she impressed on the committee that there are other ways to utilize space in schools rather than closing them. This was actually articulated by our education critic as well.", "Indirectly—talking about money and saving money—that leaves more money to be spent on other areas, and that could probably serve the teacher unions well during collective bargaining and again even under the enhanced system described in this proposed legislation, Bill 92.", "We wrapped up the finance hearings. There were 157 deputants and we received something like 90 submissions. I do commend the researchers who put together the report and the recommendations.", "I want to mention Susan Viets and Carrie Hull, who are employed by the Legislative Assembly. They did a truly Herculean—I don’t know if I pronounced that correctly or not—successful effort to compile all the advice and the recommendations that we heard, including advice we heard from the teacher unions and the school boards.", "But collective bargaining really didn’t come up. It’s a budget issue; it’s an issue for finance committee hearings. So I’m just not sure where this one came from.", "We’ve been hearing from CUPE. I haven’t heard too much opposition about this legislation. I haven’t heard too much at all about it, although on social media, CUPE—there’s a union that represents 260,000 members—has a petition up on Facebook challenging Bill 92 as taking away workers’ democratic rights. I understand that OSSTF, my former association, has some concerns. I think they have some concerns about certain things that have not been included in this legislation.", "I’ll wrap up there, Speaker. It’s surprising, when I look at this bill—I thought this was a bit of a sleeper. Once you start talking about it, you realize there probably is a fair bit we could discuss, to try and get this two-tiered system to run a little better." ],

Their priorities will not be properly represented because the government will be focused on satisfying other entities. That makes sense. Obviously, they’re going to be dealing with the teachers, who are the main bargaining unit. A lot of the support workers and very different communities—their priorities are different. In different areas of the province, there are different issues, and they feel they’ll get lost in the shuffle. That’s understandable, because if the government can simplify it and just deal with one body who governs all the other bodies, or they’re attached to those bodies, it certainly makes the considerations of the other bodies inadequate because the government’s not focusing on it.", "One of the biggest groups is against it. OSSTF is against the new legislation because it has not addressed how to streamline the process or improve labour relations at the bargaining table, which is probably 90% of the game. You’ve got to have good relations at the bargaining table, and you can’t have one side or one cabinet or one government-sponsored group dictating to the particular group without all the other groups that are involved in education represented properly.", "The government keeps touting that they want everybody involved.

Moreover, as proposed, the amendments could, at some point, result in greater, not fewer central bargaining tables.”", "Lastly, in a letter that I received, they expressed their “deep concern with respect to the crown’s unwillingness to address the possibility of continuous sanctions within the sector simultaneously at both the central and the local level.” The concern they feel is “further exacerbated given the proposed amendments to the structure of the act which would allow for the possibility of collective agreements expiring at different times.” They feel “the education sector could find itself in a state of perpetual sanction.” As they indicate, that “is not in the best interest of students” and would erode “public confidence in the publicly funded education system.”", "So they’re hoping that we, in this Legislature, will rectify some of those problems. Speaker, that’s from the Ontario Catholic School Trustees’ Association, the public school boards, AFOCSC and ACEPO." ],

  "text" : [ "It’s my pleasure to rise today on behalf of my constituents of Windsor West and speak to Bill 92, the School Boards Collective Bargaining Amendment Act, 2017. This legislation amends former Bill 122 after the initial round of negotiations with education workers for a new collectively bargained contract, which began in 2015.", "Speaker, as a New Democrat, collective bargaining is near and dear to my heart. It’s no secret that when employees work collectively to better the interest of their co-workers and colleagues, all are better off. To do this, workers become members of a labour union, and on behalf of its members, the union advocates for better working conditions, fair wages and so much more.", "New Democrats are committed to making it easier for workers to build solidarity and work together. We want to make it easier to join a union. To this end, we are calling for card-check certification and first-contract arbitration. These measures will reduce the possibility of intimidating workers and ensure access to binding arbitration so that if the parties come to an impasse, a first contract can be achieved.", "Of course, we are also calling for a $15-an-hour minimum wage to improve the quality of life for all Ontarians.", "The legislation before us today deals with the education sector, which already has robust employee and professional representation. As a province, we must provide these professionals with the tools they need to do their job effectively, in part through collective bargaining.", "The legislation that the bill before us seeks to amend outlines the process for collective bargaining in the education sector. The legislation establishes a framework for two-tiered collective agreements between school boards and their employees. For bargaining at a central table, the parties are an employer bargaining agency and an employee bargaining agency. For local bargaining, the parties are a school board and a bargaining agent.", "The government is required to participate in central bargaining but is not entitled to participate in local bargaining.", "Bargaining in 2015 brought to light several issues with the collective bargaining framework in its current form. There were initial lengthy discussions about what items were to be discussed at the central table and what items were to be included at the local table. Some local tables just reached an agreement, over a year and a half since the negotiations began.", "Of course, the government did not hesitate to impose back-to-work legislation and strip the democratic right of employees to go on strike, a move that was supported by the Conservative caucus.", "I’d like to remind all members of this chamber that New Democrats were the only party that voted against the undemocratic back-to-work legislation.", "Just to be clear—because the Conservatives now stand up and pretend to be the champions for labour—they supported the Liberal government in stripping teachers of their right to strike. It wasn’t the first time.", "It’s important to point this out, because he’ll say, “I didn’t actually vote on Bill 103,” but that’s because he didn’t technically have a seat in the Legislature yet: It’s not surprising that the PCs, under the leadership of Patrick Brown, supported anti-union legislation.", "Not too long before Bill 103, it was Premier McGuinty who forced the terms of a contract on education workers, through Bill 115. Many of the current members of the Liberal government were also members of the McGuinty government at that time and voted in favour of the legislation—including Premier Wynne. This legislation disrespected the collective bargaining process and stifled the voices of professional workers in our school classrooms.", "Speaker, it’s interesting. Before I came up here, I had an opportunity to watch the member from Whitby–Oshawa do his lead on this legislation, and there are some things that I would like to touch on that he said. I wrote some notes down here. They’re scribbles. It’s almost like doctor writing, so I’m going to have to try and figure out what I wrote down here.", "It’s interesting, though, because he talked about one of the government members and how that particular member’s words are on record, so we will be able to know if there are ulterior motives.", "Maybe what the member from Whitby–Oshawa doesn’t realize is, it’s not just the Liberal members—their comments and their ideas—that are kept on record. It’s also the Conservatives. Anything they say is also put on record. And you can’t really outrun your own record.", "So I’d like to point out that it was under Bill 115, and then subsequently Bill 103, two bills that stripped teachers of their right to strike—Bill 115 actually imposed contracts on education workers—that the Conservative caucus all supported the Liberals when it came to Bill 115 and Bill 103.", "So while the Conservatives are sitting there, talking about how egregious it was that the Liberals brought in such legislation—and I’m not arguing that. I certainly never supported Bills 103 or 115. Bill 115 is one of the reasons I decided to run for provincial office. I think it’s interesting that the member from Whitby–Oshawa wants to throw the Liberal record at them but totally discredit the fact that they supported the Liberals when it came to 115 and 103.", "Then it’s interesting, because the member from Whitby–Oshawa then went on to say that the government has failed to review and change the funding formula. I find it interesting, as I’m sure my colleague from Hamilton will—" ],

  "text" : [ "—from Hamilton East–Stoney Creek will agree with me. It’s interesting that he would be attacking a funding formula that was brought in under a Conservative government. It was brought in, in 1998, under Mike Harris. So I don’t think that they’re on very solid footing to attack a funding formula that they designed.", "He then went on to talk about how, over 20 years—and this is important; this number is important—the system has been underfunded to the point that there’s been such a decline in the school buildings that school boards simply can’t keep up with school repairs. Think about that. He said “20 years”; he actually said “20 years.” Now, I know I’m still fairly new here, but I don’t think the Liberals have been government for 20 years. They’ve been in government for the majority of that time, for the largest portion of that time, but I’m pretty sure—and I might be wrong. My colleague has been here longer than I am, but if you do the math, that means that the problem with the funding and the problem we’re seeing in the downward decline of, as we used to call it in the education system, the physical plant, so the buildings, the decline that we’re seeing because of the lack of funding started under the Conservatives and has only continued and escalated under the Liberals.", "So again, I don’t think they’re on very solid footing in the PC caucus to be complaining about the funding formula or the conditions of the buildings when it was their policies that started it, and the Liberals have just continued it. It’s becoming harder and harder these days to tell the difference between the Liberals and the Conservatives, frankly.", "He also made the comment about Bill 115, the Putting Students First Act. He made the comment that it should have been called the “putting teachers last act.” Again, I will remind the member from Whitby–Oshawa, the other members of the PC caucus and their new leader, Patrick Brown, that the Conservatives supported Bill 115. They supported, as the member from Whitby–Oshawa would like to call it, the “putting teachers last act.” I would actually like to amend that and call it the “putting education workers last act.” They just continued this under Bill 103; they just did the same thing under Bill 103. They stripped teachers of the right to strike.", "While they would like to stand up and go on about how the Liberals don’t respect education workers and how the Liberals don’t respect the bargaining process, again, I would draw a parallel between the Conservatives and the Liberals. When you’re supporting back-to-work legislation, anti-union legislation, you really don’t have a leg to stand on and criticize somebody else. Again, New Democrats were the only ones who have consistently voted against and not supported anti-union legislation, such as Bill 115 and Bill 103.", "I’d also like to point out that the majority of the comments I was hearing while watching debate were specifically around teachers, not highlighting the work that other education workers do, like ECEs, EAs, custodians, secretaries, IT technicians and so many others who work in the school system, day in and day out, to try to provide students with the safest and best education experience that they can.", "I personally, on behalf of the New Democrat caucus and my leader, Andrea Horwath, would like to extend our appreciation to all education workers for everything that they do to make sure that our students are safe and our students receive the best education they can. I can tell you from what I’ve heard that the current government and the Conservative government prior to it didn’t make the work of education workers any easier.", "I’d like to review some of the provisions of Bill 115. We’re going to dial it back a few years, since we are talking about collective bargaining. I want to talk about some of the provisions of Bill 115 so we can get a better sense of the government’s record on negotiating with the education sector.", "Bill 115 sought to limit fair, free contract negotiations and impose contracts on education workers. That’s not really called “collective bargaining,” when one side comes in heavy-handed and says, “You’re going to do it our way and you’re going to like it.” That’s not really fair bargaining.", "At the time, the government even knew that what they were doing was wrong and tried to limit scrutiny of the bill by the courts or by the labour relations board. Bill 115 stated, “14(1) The Ontario Labour Relations Board shall not inquire into or make a decision on whether a provision of this act, a regulation or an order made under subsection 9(2) is constitutionally valid or is in conflict with the Human Rights Code.”", "So what the government said, and again the Conservatives supported it, was, “We understand that it’s against the Human Rights Code, but we’re not going to allow the Ontario Labour Relations Board to look into it and actually deem it—put it on paper, let the public know that it’s against the Human Rights Code.” The government actually stripped the OLRB of the opportunity to do that, to stand up for workers and their human rights.", "“14(2) An arbitrator or arbitration board shall not inquire into or make a decision on whether a provision of this act, a regulation or an order made under subsection 9(2) is constitutionally valid or is in conflict with the Human Rights Code.”", "So we’ve taken away their right to having an arbitrator or arbitration.", "It did not allow a review by a court: “15(1) No term or condition included in an employment contract or collective agreement under or by virtue of this act, process for consultation prescribed under this act, or decision, approval, act, advice, direction, regulation or order made by the minister or Lieutenant Governor in Council under this act shall be questioned or reviewed in any court.”", "The Liberal government put themselves above our judicial system, and they did that with the support of the Conservatives.", "“15(2) No steps shall be taken to have a court question, review, prohibit or restrain any consultation, review or approval process prescribed or initiated under this act at the minister’s or Lieutenant Governor in Council’s discretion.”", "Again, you can’t take it to a court and have a court decide on whether or not this is infringing on your human rights." ],

They stripped them of their right to ask for an independent officer to review what was being put before them and to be able to say that they were not comfortable with what was put before them. The government, with help from the Conservatives, put themselves before the judicial system, the OLRB and any arbitrator or arbitration in order to decide that they were actually infringing on someone’s human rights.", "As we can see, the government included provisions in this bill to limit the ability of courts to scrutinize provisions that infringe on collective bargaining rights. I think education workers, parents and students are right to be skeptical whenever this government talks about changes to collective bargaining. Don’t take my word for it, Speaker. The Ontario Superior Court ruled on this matter.", "Of course, we know the level of respect that the PCs have for education workers. In 2015, the member from Kitchener–Conestoga—and again this goes back to the member from Whitby–Oshawa talking about how one of the government members’ comments were on the record and how those things can come back to get you at some point. I’d like to point out, in 2015, the member from Kitchener–Conestoga, a member of the Conservative caucus, actually compared our hard-working education workers to monkeys, stating—and this is a direct quote right out of Hansard:", "“The reciprocal principle behind the catchphrase ‘you scratch my back and I’ll scratch yours’ is as old as the hills. Somebody does something to benefit someone else with the expectation that the benefit will be paid back, either immediately or down the road.", "“Think of the line of monkeys scratching each other’s backs or in a business where perhaps a service provider engages in work for a broadcaster who, in turn, provides them ad space. But while this is an age-old practice in, say, the animal kingdom or in the business world, when this practice enters the world of politics and behind-closed-door deals with taxpayer dollars, the scratching begins to cross lines of propriety.”", "At the time when that comment was made, I stood in the House and suggested that that member actually apologize to education workers for comparing them to a line of monkeys picking lice off of each other. I have yet to hear an apology from that member.", "A member from the opposite side didn’t hear who that member was. She asked for clarification. It was the member from Kitchener–Conestoga who made those remarks.", "Speaker, those comments go directly to the respect that we see coming from the Conservative caucus when it comes to collective bargaining and, more specifically, union members. I certainly don’t feel that anybody in the education sector deserves to be compared to monkeys, and it troubles me that anybody in this room would compare them to monkeys.", "But to add to that, when you look at the services that they provide and the fact that we entrust our children, our grandchildren, our nieces and nephews to them every day, with the hope that they will keep them safe, that they will be a shoulder to cry on when our kids need it, to instill values and to provide an education with the limited resources that we are given, that comment, although it bugs me on many levels, bothers me even more, that somebody would compare them to monkeys.", "The legislation before us today is an attempt to remedy some of the difficulties both parties faced in the last round of negotiations so that the process can be more efficient in the future. I know one of the other members of the Conservative caucus called it a mess, said that they should have gotten it right the first time, so maybe he doesn’t understand the process.", "The School Boards Collective Bargaining Act originally was a collaboration, knowing that there would have to be changes made. This process that is currently in place, prior to this legislation, has a lot of problems—a lot of problems. My hope is that the government side has actually really engaged the unions that represent workers, really and in earnest engaged in conversation to get their voice into this legislation.", "I do know that there are two unions that represent education workers, CUPE and AEFO, who have concerns about this legislation, valid concerns about being forced into central bargaining, because that has not happened before. They have been able to choose whether or not they wanted to engage. I hope that those concerns are going be taken into consideration and that particular piece amended to reflect their concerns.", "However, Speaker, when we look at history, when we look at Bill 103 and, prior to that, Bill 115, we see a history of both the Liberal members and the Conservative members not really respecting the voice of the education workers, not really respecting the concerns that they bring to the table.", "These are the front-line workers who are in our schools every day. Their voices and their concerns should be taken into consideration and heavily weighed when we’re talking about legislation like this.", "I’m hoping, again, that the government side will amend the one particular area that CUPE and AEFO are expressing concerns about." ],

When the Conservatives said that this bill was a mess, that the original bill was a mess and they should have been able to get it right in the first place, I actually stuck up for the government side—the minister must not have been listening at the time—when I said that actually, the idea of the bill in the first place was a collaboration among the education workers and the government, and that the idea was that as they came across issues, they would come back to the table and work to fix them. I don’t think the education workers expected it to be the mess it was, but it was the understanding that the original form of the bill was something to start with and to build on as they went through the process and figured out the issues.", "I find it interesting that the member from Carleton–Mississippi Mills and then the member from Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound both said that they think it’s a waste of time to even talk about collective bargaining, that we should be talking about the education system—which I agree with; I talk about the education system all the time. I talk about what needs to be fixed in the education system and how it’s underfunded. However, although they don’t think it’s important enough to talk about collective bargaining and it’s a waste of time, it’s a pivotal piece of the education system. We need to make sure that the education workers are in classrooms where there are class caps, where the students are getting all the supports they need, that there’s enough staff in the schools. So I disagree with the Conservative members that it’s a waste of time to be talking about collective bargaining." ],

I want to just clarify, Mr. Speaker, a little bit with you.

We also consulted with the Ontario Catholic School Trustees’ Association, Ontario Public School Boards’ Association, the Council of Ontario Directors of Education and our supervisory officers. We also did some outreach to the teachers’ federation and education workers’ union representatives, the Association des enseignantes et des enseignants franco-ontariens, the Elementary Teachers’ Federation of Ontario, Ontario English Catholic Teachers’ Association, the Ontario Secondary School Teachers’ Federation, the Canadian Union of Public Employees—CUPE—and 14 unions representing education workers, including CAW, OPSEU and others.", "What I’m trying to say is that we started this process in 2014.

We really want to make the made-in-Ontario process more flexible, transparent and consisten.

These are families that rely on a strong, stable and sustainable publicly funded education system each and every day. That is the main intent of this technical bill, if you will, that we’re discussing this afternoon.", "The proposed legislation, I know, would amend the Ontario College of Teachers Act and improve flexibility in the system by allowing collective agreements to be extended, to support improved flexibility and stability for all parties, including students and parents.", "Currently, the act sets a default term length of three years. During the extensive consultations with the sector, support has been expressed to give the minister the authority to extend agreements and also to alter the length of term of new agreements to two, four or five years. This amendment would give parties the flexibility to pursue longer agreements or extensions of agreements, which can help provide consistency and stability for all parties, as well as the families, as I mentioned. The potential for longer terms is also consistent with other jurisdictions, such as Quebec or British Columbia.", "It would also add transparency. I think we all agree that Ontarians deserve a clear picture when it comes to the costs of bargaining. The proposed legislation would, if passed, make annual salary disclosure mandatory for the trustees’ associations. Salary disclosure would establish clear accountability between the ministry and the trustees’ association on matters related to funding, and would strengthen the public confidence in our education system.", "To address the AG’s recommendations to improve transparency, the legislation is also proposing to require mandatory comprehensive reporting on the total funding received from the Ministry of Education, including bargaining costs.", "These amendments were also developed in response to issues that were raised by the Auditor General in her special report on government payments to education-sector unions. These proposed amendments would provide for full transparency and accountability by the trustees’ associations and by the crown.", "Some of the amendments, if passed, would improve consistency and efficiency in the bargaining process, including ensuring that parents and students are well informed in advance of labour disruptions by requiring an additional five days’ notice for strikes, lockouts and certain circumstances. This is in addition to the five days of notice already included in the act.", "Mr. Speaker, I just want to elaborate for a second on that. Labour dispute action can be very disruptive for parents and for students. Under the current legislation, the parties are required to provide at least five days’ written notice in advance of any labour disruption action at either level. For example, if teachers are going to initiate work to rule, they must first provide five days of notice. However, there is no provision for providing notice upon escalation of labour disruptions; for example, when you’re going from work to rule to a full strike. This proposed amendment would require five days’ notice from unions before they escalate their strike action to the full withdrawal of services at a school. The same would apply to school boards that are considering a lockout. Requiring notice from federations and school boards before a full strike and/or lockout is key to ensuring that parents and students are well-informed in advance of serious labour disruption.", "I would like to add that this is very important, in my opinion, from a personal point of view. I don’t have kids currently in the school system. I’m already a grandmother, and I’m actually looking forward to the time when my two grandchildren will be in school. But I can recall when my kids were going to school during the Harris years. My son didn’t have any after-school activities for the whole length of high school. That was difficult. That was one of the reasons that, in the end, also determined my interest in provincial politics, because the education system at the time was really in a shambles. There was strike after strike, and the children were the ones that were suffering the most. I still remember that.", "At this point in time, when time has gone by and I now have two grandchildren, a boy and a girl, too young yet to join in the system, I hope that we continue to strengthen it. This is a step to do that, toward that direction. Nothing is perfect, but we have to continue to strive to improve our system in the best way possible so that our future generations, our young generations, are the ones that can benefit from a system that works, that is safe and that is sustainable." ],

I was reminiscing with her later on. During my inaugural speech, I talked at length about how I found it a little weird that we call them maiden speeches. I want to note that the member never used that expression all the way through. I was very proud of her for that, not going back to that old, archaic, traditional term and, instead, stating, in French, that it was her inaugural speech. In my case, with the sports references, I like to call it the rookie speech, which is what I used in my remarks.", "If I go back to my speech, you will remember, Speaker—and I know you were listening attentively at the time when I did my inaugural speech—that I actually have a master’s degree in labour relations from Queen’s University, a great institution. So collective bargaining is something I know a little bit about. I had the opportunity to consult in the field for numerous years with the Central Ontario Industrial Relations Institute and assist the parties in collective bargaining. And I taught labour relations up at Seneca for a number of terms. These are things I covered in my inaugural speech. I don’t want to go into them in great detail, but just to set the framework that I actually know a little bit about this stuff. I’m absolutely delighted to be able to bring some of that experience to the House today.", "Particularly, I find it very interesting that this is a bill that emanates from the Ministry of Education, because what we’re in fact talking about here is labour relations. Labour relations is typically governed by another ministry entirely, the Ministry of Labour, which sets the framework, typically, for collective bargaining in Ontario. Under the provincial scheme, particularly in industrial collective bargaining, where you end up—before you go on strike, you have conciliation, you have mediation and such.", "In the old days of education bargaining, we had a thing called the Education Relations Commission, which provided much the same function as the conciliation offices of the Ministry of Labour but it situated underneath the Ministry of Education. We still have that body, the Education Relations Commission, but its role now is to assess undue harm for students when the parties are in a lockout or a strike situation. The Education Relations Commission will say, “Is a student’s year in jeopardy?” before making a call back to whether or not the parties should continue in that work stoppage situation.", "This was an important issue for me when I was running in 2014, because we had just came out of that very tumultuous bargaining based on Bill 115. I went door to door and met with so many teachers who were upset with our government for having disrupted the collective bargaining system.", "Once again, I want to state very categorically in this House that I am a great fan of the collective bargaining process.

That was the old strategy. What we used to see at the collective bargaining, board by board by board across the province, were all these dysfunctional aspects of employees whipsawing or boards hanging out, waiting for some other settlement. It was so dysfunctional. It took so long to get bargaining going in a consistent way.", "At the time, it made more sense to do board-by-board bargaining because the education rate was on the mill rate at the municipal level. So you’re raising money locally; the idea is that you should be spending it locally. But the reality is, we decided that now we are not putting the education rate on the mill rate. It is a government of Ontario function to provide the per-student funding. Now it makes sense that we have province-wide bargaining, because in essence we’re the ones holding the purse strings. That’s why we do have that central bargaining.", "As we moved out of the old system and we went into the new system of collective bargaining, we knew—and I want to point out how it was our Premier, our Minister of Education at the time, who fixed the problems associated with the dysfunctionality that came out of Bill 115, which was a dysfunction that had risen over the years from the previous system. We brought a new framework in for local and general bargaining, which looks like it actually kind of worked. We had some disruptions. It was the first time out of the gate with it. Both the Premier and the ministry committed that they would review the provisions of the School Boards Collective Bargaining Act to see if there are other ways we can improve it, because there were dysfunctions in how people were getting used to what areas are local or what is general. So it was very important that we take a look at it, and that’s what we’ve done.", "No one in the House should be at all surprised that we are going to improve the School Boards Collective Bargaining Act as a result of that initiative. We’ve had the experience of the last round of collective agreements. I’m delighted that we have agreements with pretty much every partner. I’m not sure if there are one or two still that we’re working on, but we’re in very good shape. We’re waiting for some ratifications. So we’ve had some success under the old system. What we’re seeing here, as the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration outlined, is that ultimately we’re going to make improvements, because it’s for the kids.", "I remember in grade 13—when there was a grade 13; that tells you how old I am—we had a four-month strike in our school board. The disruption of almost a half of my year and not getting that grade 13 education—look what it has left me qualified for.", "Anyway, Speaker, thank you very much.

The bill adds provisions to permit such agreements in the specified circumstances.” Really, I think, the bill seems mainly about extending contracts beyond the next election as has been negotiated by the government. We’ll get a chance to talk about it in caucus tomorrow.", "What is missing from the bill, certainly, and I’m sure the member from Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound will bring it up in his upcoming speech, is talk about all of the school closures that are going on around the province, particularly in rural Ontario. I know he has talked about some 600 closures. The government has changed the ARC process to speed up the closures.", "Certainly, in my riding of Parry Sound–Muskoka, one that is really concerning is in the village of Honey Harbour, in the southwest corner of my riding, which really isn’t close to anywhere. There’s an ARC review going on for both the public school and the Catholic school, so the danger is that the community will lose both schools. It’s not close to anywhere. It’s a minimum one-hour bus ride for these primary-age students, and that would be devastating for the village of Honey Harbour. If you lose both schools, what young family is going to move there? What businesses would be able to operate there? It would be absolutely devastating.", "The solution that the community is pushing for is co-location of both schools in one building. I hope that the government will support that, and that they keep a school in Honey Harbour, as it absolutely vital for the community." ],

Bill 92, the School Boards Collective Bargaining Act, changes that so that the first tier of collective bargaining must participate in central bargaining, strike or lockout notice, including education workers in collective agreements; and bridges conflicts or inconsistencies between central and local terms of collective agreements. Also, centralized bargaining must always occur first, and every employee in the union and every school board must be represented by a collective bargaining union.", "The union must have over 60 employees to be at the bargaining table. If there are under 15 employees, then they must join a union that has a collective bargaining agency to be at the negotiating table.", "The bill also allows the minister to extend the duration of current agreements by a period of two, four or five years. An additional five days’ notice of any change of a strike or lockout that would result in complete withdrawal of instruction, services or total closures of one or more schools of a board—I’m talking about school closures, Mr. Speaker. It’s right there in their words. I think I’m on target. I think I’m on topic.", "The bill requires school boards to provide updates on the progress of local bargaining. I’m also going to talk, in a little bit, about the local bargaining that could be happening with communities to keep those schools open.", "Trustee associations will be added to the sunshine list. Trustees are also required to report the use of public funds received.", "There is no question that the Liberal government’s two-tier bargaining system has been a failure, creating chaos for children and parents. Everything this government has done in education, they’ve bungled. In reviewing the education minister’s lead-off speech, I was interested to read how she would spin the years of bungling. As expected, the speech included a lot of spin about the state of the education system under this Liberal government. In her speech, the minister promised this would “strengthen our made-in-Ontario approach to bargaining in the education sector ... flexibility, transparency and ... consistency.” She also stated that the new School Boards Collective Bargaining Act benefits “Ontario’s two million students and their families, all of whom rely on a strong, stable and sustainable publicly funded education system each and every day.” And she promised “a flexible, transparent and consistent process going forward” and to work with “our partner trustee associations.”", "Funny thing: I have yet to speak to a parent who would actually agree with the accolades this minister gave her Liberal Party in her lead-off speech. At a time when they’re shuttering schools, cutting special-education funding and relying on parent fundraising and private donations to schools more than ever before, who are you going to believe about what’s going on in our current education system? Let’s debunk some of the myths from this minister’s lead-off speech.", "The minister said that Ontarians should be proud of the state of their education system. She called it “one of the most revered ... education systems in the world.” A lot of students and families, especially north of Toronto, would like to remind the minister that there are two tales to this system. For most students outside of Toronto, it’s a different story, one that this minister is either unfamiliar with or is refusing to tell.", "This is where I am going to talk about school closures, because it does have a significant part in regard to this legislation. The ministry’s accommodation review process, used by boards to accommodate students, is flawed and lacks transparency and accountability. It also fast-tracks closures. They actually took out the community impact portion from the last ARC review process to this review process. That tells me that they really didn’t really want to listen. They didn’t want to give communities a chance to collaborate and find solutions to keep these schools open. They wanted to expedite it so that they could actually get their budget savings in the bank for them for the next budget.", "As a result, as many as 600 schools across Ontario are under threat of closure—600, Mr. Speaker. They bill themselves as the education party, and yet there are 600 schools under threat of closure. There is nothing “revered” about shutting down hundreds of community schools across Ontario. Does the minister agree with that?", "I don’t know about members opposite, but I find the 600 school closures to be a statistic that’s very troubling. I find it extremely disappointing that this minister and this Liberal government would slam the door on all of these children and communities, people who were promised a better education system and who have every reason to expect it from the Liberals.", "When I look at a piece of legislation like this, my first priority is actually the kids, the students, the future—those pages in front of you, if they lost their school. We need to ensure that we have the schools open, which allows us to actually have collective bargaining opportunities and to be able to make sure that there’s fair and equitable remuneration for those people in those schools and in those facilities. I won’t apologize for making that my absolute clear priority, because this is about the lifeblood of our community. This is about the next generation. This is about ensuring that our communities can thrive and survive in the future, and I’ll always put the children first and those needs first.", "Yes, maybe, in some of my remarks earlier, I got fairly excited about this, but this is critical. If those schools close, that decimates our communities. We will never, ever recover from these. They can spout all the things they want about programming, but at the end of the day, education is not just a school. It’s not just the four walls of a facility. It’s the whole educational component and the whole educational process.", "In my case, the Bluewater District School Board has 53 schools: 42 elementary and 11 secondary. As many as 18 of those may be closed in the next 15 years. That’s a third of our school space. In 2016-17, the closures included Owen Sound Collegiate and Vocational Institute, Bayview Public School, Sydenham Community School, Dufferin Elementary School and Derby Public School. Currently under review and pending are Beavercrest Community School, Chesley District Community School and Paisley Central School.", "Mr. Speaker, I said earlier in my remarks that the mayor of Grey Highlands, Paul McQueen, is here in Toronto today. He issued at ROMA a couple of weeks ago an invitation to both the Premier and the minister to visit. So let’s have some collective bargaining. Let’s have some discussions with the people who actually are going to be impacted the most by these school closures.", "I’m issuing that invitation to them again, to take him up on his invitation to come and visit, to truly see what these closures are going to do, to see that they actually can—there is no time ever running out to make the right decision, to reverse their decision, to put a moratorium on school closures until we can do that. That will have a ripple effect to collective bargaining, because those people will actually still have jobs if we have the schools still open. I can’t fathom that a piece of legislation, when you’re talking about closing 600 schools, is not going to have some impact on collective bargaining.", "If anything, Ontarians want and need better accountability from the education minister over her rampant school closures and more transparency to deal with funding, closures and declining enrolment.", "There has been labour unrest. In 2015, over 70,000 students underwent the longest teacher strike in 25 years, after more than 70,000 high school students were kept from class for weeks. What is so “revered” about being locked out of class for a month, I ask the education minister?", "Special education cuts: Just in the last few years, 38 school boards had to cut their student special education funding to the tune of—guess what?—$22 million, with 50 in my riding of Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound alone.", "Parents are being forced to fundraise for basic needs, including school repairs. More schools are relying on parent-led fundraising money and developer payoffs to finance needs than ever before, creating a gap between the have and have-not neighbourhoods, towns and cities.", "In Toronto alone, fundraising brings in $20 million a year, most of it coming from parents in wealthier areas. This is a funding gap that this government has allowed to be created and one that puts students in wealthier areas at an advantage for extracurricular programs, such as lunch-time yoga, magic classes and professional vocal coaches, as well as for building sports fields and playgrounds, while students in poorer areas struggle to pay for basic nutrition programs. What is so revered about this funding gap for students whose parents are not able to pitch in thousands of dollars for school fundraising?", "Access to full-day kindergarten: This government is wasting money when we need to fund full-day kindergarten. We need to fund class sizes. This is what this government promised. Instead, they’re putting students at risk. Does the minister know that the lack of space has forced schools to warehouse four- and five-year-old children? My office has heard from parents across Ontario whose children were in a kindergarten class of 50 kids and where everyone wore earmuffs to block out the noise. I wonder what exactly the minister would deem “revered” about that learning environment, Mr. Speaker.", "Higher test scores and standardized testing: We hear it all over the place. The minister and Liberal government have been spinning their message of higher test scores in reading, writing and math. But we’re hearing from actual teachers, saying that they don’t agree with it and they don’t support it. They want to ensure that each student is individual and gets the best program that they can, not standardized scores. The money that they spend on that that could be going to the front line for those kids is absolutely astronomical—not the investment that most people are talking to me about it actually want.", "When was the last time this minister sat down with a math teacher and looked at the math proficiency of our grade 3 and grade 6 students? The fact is, math scores have been declining for years, and most schools haven’t improved. Ontario desperately needs a strong focus on basic math skills and financial literacy in the classroom. Sadly, with the deficits that this government is running and the debt that they’re carrying and continue to, our students are going to need even more math literacy to be able to understand how they’re going to survive in our world going forward. The truth is, the Wynne Liberals have watched enrolment decline for years and they have failed to adequately prepare for this change. Instead of having a credible plan to turn local schools into community hubs, this government has 600 schools potentially on the chopping block.", "In the two elections that I’ve fought, they committed to looking at and reviewing and fixing the funding formula so that it would actually ensure that our communities could move forward, that we actually would continue to have schools in our communities so that the kids are getting the education they deserve. Yet they’ve done nothing with that funding formula. They’re talking about things like collective bargaining so that we’re not talking about the bigger issues, so we’re not talking about school closures and so we’re not actually holding them to account for the damage they’re doing to our children, to our education and, frankly, to our province and our country.", "We will continue to reach out to families, students and teachers, and we’ll listen carefully to their feedback on any proposed legislation that comes through here in regard to education.", "I have a couple of letters here, Mr. Speaker. One was penned collectively between myself and my colleague Lisa Thompson in October 2016. It was addressed to Minister Hunter, talking today about those closures of schools and concerned about what that impact is going to be—and there is going to be a ripple effect to that collective bargaining piece of legislation here because there are going to be a lot less people that we’re talking to and there are going to be a lot less people sitting there asking to have collective bargaining, because that’s where we’re going. We talk about collaboration. We talk about collective discussion and collaborating and making sure that we’re listening to the people we’ve been elected to serve.", "In my case, with the Markdale school in particular, Chapman’s Ice Cream has stepped up and said, “We’ll collaborate. We’ll partner with you. We’ll figure out a way with you to keep this school,” because they expect to expand. They want those students of today to have jobs tomorrow in their home community, if that’s what they so choose. They’ll come to the table and they’ll bargain. Whether it’s collectively or collaboratively—whatever word you want to use—Chapman’s is prepared to do that.", "Bruce Power—thinking about the Paisley school. There’s already a Four County Labour Market Planning Board for Bruce, Grey, Huron and Perth that suggests that access to a good school helps with finding and retaining good workers in the community. This government has actually—and I give them credit: They’ve actually committed to rebuilding, re-tubing and refurbishing Bruce nuclear—six units of the nuclear plant. That’s going to be great for our hydro. Obviously, we need some relief from hydro prices with the way that they currently are. Nuclear is going to continue to play a key role in that. We’re going to need those workers. We’re going to need to have schools in those communities that are actually going to be growing because of the workforce that’s going to move in to do those. There, again, we’ve said, “Come to the table. Come in and actually do some bargaining. Come in and consult and work with our communities.”", "Since being appointed the education minister, the minister has tried to shift the blame for decisions about which schools to close onto local trustees, but everyone knows that it’s this government. It is their agreement that they’re actually enforcing. They’ve shortened accommodation reviews. Their 13-year-long—14 years almost, now—mismanagement and high debt are the real reasons behind these mass closures. It’s definitely something that needs to be addressed. We went back again, in November 2016, to the Minister of Education and asked, “Please put a moratorium on this.”", "Minister, it’s never too late to do the right thing. Take a step backwards. Ensure that you’re not decimating communities. It’s the educational impact, absolutely; but it’s the whole ripple effect to a community, particularly a single-school community, where you actually are taking a facility, a community centre, a community hub—and they’ve actually used language themselves to be able to want to do that, but yet the action doesn’t follow.", "The minister’s response in question period one day said, “Solutions will not be found at Queen’s Park.” This only perpetuates these broad challenges. Ontarians feel that you do not wish to be engaged in a broader dialogue about the negative impact of shuttering schools across hundreds of communities in rural and northern Ontario.", "Moreover, your response is also in direct opposition to the Premier’s stated promise “to apply open government principles to problem solving.” So I ask: How is it that you want the government to hide from the opportunity to work on solutions when this goes directly against the principles of supporting civic participation and greater collaboration between government and citizens of Ontario?", "When the minister was originally elected, she championed civic engagement. She promised to be the one who would listen to the concerns of communities. However, the minister, I do believe, sincerely wants to still do the right thing. And so, in that spirit, my letter was asking her to step out, to actually step back from the discussion and the decision that’s already been made, and actually open the discussion back up with those communities to ensure that we can actually do that.", "In the words of the Premier: “to remove barriers, and provide the tools and information they need to innovate and meet evolving community needs.” That may not be collective bargaining in the sense of some of the legislation that we’re talking about today, but it’s open bargaining, it’s transparent bargaining that is engaging all the people that are going to have an impact in our communities.", "We have, in regard to this very specific piece of legislation, a letter that is co-authored by ACÉPO, the Ontario Catholic School Trustees’ Association, the Ontario Public School Boards’ Association and the Association franco-ontarienne des conseils scolaires catholiques. They are saying in here:", "“Notably, during each of the subsequent consultations all four trustee/school board associations articulated their firm commitment to sequenced bargaining. It was our shared understanding that the crown also saw value in such an amendment, as a manner by which to provide greater stability within the sector. It is regrettable that such an amendment, which we firmly believe to be in the best interests of students, is no longer being considered by the crown.", "“Secondly, we are concerned that the proposed amendments do not reflect the ability to decrease the number of central bargaining tables. Moreover, as proposed, the amendment could, at some point, result in greater, not fewer, central bargaining tables.", "“Finally, we continue to express our deep concern with respect to the crown’s unwillingness to address the possibility of continuous sanctions within the sector simultaneously at both the central and local level. This concern is now further exacerbated given the proposed amendment to the structure of the act which would allow for the possibility of collective agreements expiring at different times. Accordingly, the education sector could find itself in a state of perpetual sanction. We firmly believe that this is not in the best interest of students and has the real possibility of eroding public confidence in the publicly funded education system.", "“We appreciate the opportunity to provide input on this....”", "So they have, again, reached out and said, “Government, step back. Even with this piece of legislation, there are concerns that we have here. There are concerns that you’re not taking into account.”", "I think it behooves the government, on anything that’s dealing with education, to do the right thing, to make sure that they’re actually doing that. In this case, some amendments to the School Boards Collective Bargaining Act—the School Boards Collective Bargaining Act, 2014, provides that collective bargaining for collective agreements under the act may include central bargaining but is not required to include it. It changes the collective bargaining by requiring that centralized bargaining must always occur first, and that every employee in a union and every school board must be represented by a collective bargaining unit. The union must have over 60 employees to be at the bargaining table. If there are under 15 employees, then they must join a union that has a collective bargaining agency to be at the negotiating table.", "We’re pleased that the government actually is finally acting on the AG’s recommendations after years of inaction. It’s crucial, though, that any changes made to the collective bargaining process be fair and reasonable to all employees and taxpayers.", "I’m going to close where I started: All of this is about people. In this case, education should always start and stop with the children. It’s a fundamental premise that you need places of education, particularly in small, rural, single-school communities—how imperative it is that those schools remain, that they actually have the ability to have an education in their home community, not putting three-, four- or five-year-old kids on buses for an hour and a half one way, Mr. Speaker. We need to do that as part of any bargaining. That has to be central to any bargaining and any discussion we’re going to have.", "Six hundred schools is a threat to our kids, to our future and to our province. We’ve asked the government many, many times over the last two years to step back. Just stop today and put in a moratorium. Don’t close any. Let’s have further consultation. Let’s bring people to the table and actually find a bargaining system that is going to work to allow those schools to remain in those communities, to thrive, survive and be sustainable in the future.", "It is my hope that they will look at bargaining in a different light. It won’t just be about money and it won’t be about rights. It will be about kids and the benefits that the kids should get from a truly exceptional education system here in the province of Ontario." ],

  "text" : [ "I’d like to thank the member from Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound for his comments on Bill 92, the School Boards Collective Bargaining Amendment Act. Again, it’s important to recognize that the original bill that came forward, the School Boards Collective Bargaining Act, was a collaboration. It was always meant as a starting point to figure out what works and what doesn’t work, and to be amended. That was always the intention of it. I don’t think that education workers, when they came to the table and helped draft that, expected to have the number of problems that they face.", "One of the biggest problems they faced was not having a government partner at the bargaining table. I don’t think they thought that was going to be an issue. I don’t think they expected that some of the lowest earners in the education sector would be threatened with having their pay docked if they did their job exactly as was described. All they were saying is, “We’re not going to go above and beyond like we normally do. We’re going to do the work we’ve always done, the work that’s expected of us, but we’re not going to go above and beyond.” They were actually threatened to have their pay docked for that. Certainly, that wasn’t part of what they had agreed to in the beginning.", "I just want to be clear, though, because the Conservative members seem to be confused about what the bill initially was about. It was always about a starting point and learning from it, and adjusting it so that it works for all parties.", "Unfortunately, under the legislation that is before us, to amend that act, it doesn’t work for CUPE or AEFO. They have expressed concerns, so I implore the government to come back to them and find out how amendments can be made to make it more palatable.", "That being said, I agree with the member from Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound. There is not enough funding in the system; there is not. It’s grossly underfunded. Schools are being closed at an alarming rate thanks to the government shortening the process for that, but it was a PC government that started this funding formula to begin with." ],

  "text" : [ "I am very pleased to comment on Bill 92, which is an act to amend the School Boards Collective Bargaining Act. I thought I would actually speak a little bit about what’s in the act because, of course, the member from Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound didn’t really do that, so I thought I would.", "The original act set out a default length for the length of the collective agreement of three years. It did allow for people to have some flexibility by mutual consent, but I think you can understand that in a bargaining framework where the bargaining mandate was a net-zero collective agreement, the unions didn’t have much of an appetite to go beyond three-year collective agreements. In fact, all of the agreements from the first round of bargaining are third-year collective agreements.", "What the amendments do is, certainly, allow for initial collective agreements to be two, three, four or five years, but they also allow for the extension of collective agreements. I’d like to congratulate the Minister of Education, who has, in fact, negotiated two-year extensions to all of the collective agreements.", "While it’s true that in the first round of bargaining, generally speaking, the teacher collective agreements were achieved first, in this round of bargaining, it’s notable that the CUPE extension representing education workers was actually the first agreement to be negotiated. So in this round, the education workers were actually first to the table. I think that’s a credit to the education workers, and also the Minister of Education, that everybody is important in the system. It doesn’t matter whether you’re a teacher or an education worker; everybody is important." ],

  "text" : [ "First of all, I’d like to congratulate the member from Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound on his advocacy for rural Ontario. Certainly, we do not have that across the floor on the government side. There are many examples of how they’re ignoring rural Ontario on some of the issues going on out there.", "I would also like to congratulate him for his record in his community. Most members know, I believe, that he may be considered Mr. Groundhog during the Wiarton Willie Festival that’s held in Wiarton. I’ve been there a number of times myself. It shows what a community can do when they get together to make an event successful. Unfortunately, closing rural schools doesn’t help that. Communities disappear and people move away, and the member has been a great advocate of having a really close look at what this government is doing concerning rural Ontario.", "It would also be helpful if this government would try to fashion legislation that has a beneficial plan not only to the populated areas of Ontario but all of Ontario, which includes rural Ontario. They try to keep changing labour bills such as this without really looking at the full picture. So here we are again, discussing a bill to do with labour and negotiations with labour. This is certainly not the first time. I’ve only been here just over five years, and it’s not the first time this has happened. It’s too bad that the government couldn’t fashion some of these bills.", "Another thing I was wondering about, Speaker—it’s kind of a question. I don’t know how much pizza was eaten at the last negotiations; I wonder how much is going to be eaten at the next negotiations. It’s just incredible how that works." ],

It comes from his heart and there’s some factual information there. But I must remind him—and I have the greatest respect for him––that it was his illustrious leader, Mr. Harris, that was called the “Education Premier”—which was a bit of a fiasco, a bit of a sarcastic comment he was accused of. He actually decimated the education system in this province, as well as brought in the funding formula, which, I might add, has been a complete disaster. But in all fairness to him, the present government has had many years to change the funding formula, and they haven’t.", "The biggest complaint I get from school boards, the biggest complaint I get from trustees, from teachers—everybody—is the funding formula. Until you change the funding formula, you’re not going to correct the problems in this province when it comes to education. You can bargain all you like. You can have central bargaining, which I don’t agree with. There are some points where local bargaining is effective, especially the support workers in education. They need some avenues to be able to bring forward their criteria, and you can’t do that in central bargaining because central bargaining will be focused on the larger unions and, most likely, the teachers they have to deal with. So the caretakers, the secretaries and the support people in schools won’t have a voice, centrally, to speak of. I think the government will be distracted with their concerns and will be focusing on the bigger concerns of the big unions. So I think that when they say they like to involve everyone, that’s not quite true. They’re not involving everyone." ],

There was no $2 million that came to the two schools that are closing in my riding, to say, “How can we help you out? How can we ensure community impact”—which my colleague from Perth–Wellington was talking about, what can happen when a community bands together.", "He talked about advocacy for rural Ontario, Mr. Speaker, and I’m proud to do that, but I want to emphasize that advocating for rural Ontario means a stronger Ontario, period. Agriculture is in rural Ontario. One of the schools that’s going to close, perhaps, or a change is going to be the high-skills major for a specialty in agriculture. Where does our food come from, Mr. Speaker? It’s fundamental back to that and our education is fundamental back to our communities.", "In 2016, Minister Sandals insisted that any wage increases were offset by cuts made elsewhere in the education system. We raised that flag. We hoped at that time that changes such as that did not result from classroom cuts and resources for teachers. We actually said that we welcomed measures that give parents additional notice of school closures due to labour disputes and those types of things. Sadly, because of mismanagement and bungling over the last number of years, we’re at a point where we’re closing schools.", "The members from Perth–Wellington, Hamilton East–Stoney Creek and Windsor West talked about the funding formula. The Liberals committed in two elections to review the funding formula for schools, particularly rural and northern schools. Mr. Speaker, they broke a promise. How can we trust them with anything when something as fundamental as education—when they pride themselves on supposedly being the education party but will not even address something that now is decimating communities across this province? It will come at some point. There is definitely growth in the city, so they’re not as much challenged now, but they will get that.", "At the end of the day, what we really want is to ask for a moratorium on school closures." ],

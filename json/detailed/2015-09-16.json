Just before I begin though, Speaker, I want to take a moment to say that it’s great to see all my colleagues here in the Legislature and, once again, welcome to the member for Simcoe North.", "Over the summer, MPPs are able to return home to meet with their constituents and to hear their concerns on a wide variety of provincial issues. One of the many things that many members heard at home that was echoed at the recent Association of Municipalities of Ontario, AMO, conference was the need for provincial government to listen to stakeholders and municipalities. More than just listening, they need a government that is willing to be a real partner. Far too many groups have offered the government input only to see them change course with a snap decision unilaterally.", "I hope the government is willing to listen when it comes to Bill 73. While I cannot speak for the government or third party, I can say that the PC caucus is here and ready to listen. We’re ready to work for you, and we want to work alongside municipalities to ensure that they are set on the right track.", "Last week I had the pleasure of addressing the Chatham-Kent Home Builders Association. More importantly, I was able to hear their concerns regarding a number of issues, one of which was Bill 73. Their chief concern was red tape, which is hurting their industry and making it harder for them to expand operations and create more jobs, but they did have concerns with this bill. Their main concern with the bill was the potential for development costs to be raised with negative effects for Ontarians seeking housing.", "In a press release, the Ontario Home Builders’ Association made their concerns very clear. I’m going to quote from a portion of that press release: “The Ontario Home Builders’ Association (OHBA) is concerned that new transit taxes on development will disproportionately increase housing costs for residents and the cost of setting up new businesses.”", "Our critic the member for Oxford has been carefully considering the benefits and unintended consequences of this bill and has been actively engaging with municipalities and stakeholders. We, alongside the Association of Municipalities of Ontario, AMO, were surprised that the government moved ahead with this bill before conducting any consultations on some of the key areas that the bill deals with.", "We understand why municipalities are looking to develop development charges to pay for additional infrastructure. They’re looking for any additional funding they can get after years of cuts and a downloading of services by the Liberal government.", "I would like to take a moment to highlight one key planning issue that is of massive concern in my riding." ],

You know, the government is like a toothache: When you hit a nerve, they go, “Ouch.”", "The municipality of Chatham-Kent alone, in my riding, has over 4,000 municipal drains with a total length of 4,800 kilometres. The municipality performs approximately 550 drainage projects annually. Most of these projects are related to ongoing maintenance, and the rest are capital projects.", "Chatham-Kent is incredibly concerned over new changes brought in by this government that will see further demands placed on municipalities across the province. In the words of the municipalities, with Chatham-Kent already completing in excess of 550 drainage projects each year, it will be impossible for them to comply with the new self-monitoring and reporting process.", "They estimate they would need to hire two full-time experts at a cost of roughly $250,000 just to manage the new reporting and application requirements that were previously handled by the province. One of the things I don’t want to see is members of the administration of the municipality of Chatham-Kent go to jail, and that’s what is being implied through some of this legislation. Given that Chatham-Kent is trying to rein in its own deficit, it’s unrealistic to expect the department to be able to afford to hire these experts while also keeping up with the sheer volume of annual drainage projects required to keep them operational.", "Local officials were able to meet in my office here at Queen’s Park with policy advisers from the government, who, to their credit, were receptive to the municipality’s concerns with the unintended consequences of the upcoming changes. If this issue is not addressed, it will seriously jeopardize the future growth of Chatham-Kent.", "Mr. Speaker, one of the things I don’t want to see as an unintended consequence of this legislation is an increase in the cost of housing in the province. There are currently 168,000 families on the wait-list for affordable housing. We must do all we can, as legislators, to ensure that this number falls. If balance in this bill is not achieved, then, unfortunately, the opposite just may happen. Increased development costs are inevitably passed along to homeowners, condo buyers and renters alike.", "A couple of years ago, Ipsos Reid conducted a survey on behalf of the Ontario Real Estate Association. In that study, 94% of Ontarians said that owning a home provides a healthy and stable environment for raising a family. It’s clear that many Ontarians dream of one day purchasing a home. In fact, nine out of 10 Ontarians say that owning a home is part of the Canadian dream. We don’t want to see them have that dream crushed by rising costs extended to Ontarians.", "As I conclude my remarks, I just want to stress the importance of balance when it comes to the Smart Growth for Our Communities Act. It’s about ensuring that individual communities and businesses have input into the future of their communities. It’s about addressing concerns while ensuring that good projects can move forward. Currently, we’re seeing the exact opposite under this Liberal government.", "Ontario has just under 2,550 acres of vegetable greenhouses, with more than 2,000 of those in the Leamington and Kingsville area. My riding of Chatham–Kent–Essex, and the region as a whole, depends on the greenhouse industry and the good-paying jobs that it provides, with spill-over benefits to the entire community.", "The industry is ready to grow, but the government is not ready to let it grow. They simply cannot expand without access to more electricity. They also need new transmission lines so that they can sell the power they generate to the grid, and additionally, better hydro service would allow greenhouses to add light for the winter months so that they can grow a year-round crop.", "Based on a 5% growth estimate, which is very conservative, the industry could expect another 660 acres of new greenhouses in the next five years, boosting greenhouse vegetable sales by $205 million.", "The government’s delays on a crucial hydro transmission project are costing Leamington jobs and investment. Leamington mayor John Paterson was very clear when asked about the potential for growth and the danger of inaction by the provincial government. I’m going to state him verbatim: “We’ve said to the Minister of Energy, we’ve said to the Ontario Power Authority, we’ve said to everyone who will listen to us, if you don’t do this, Leamington and Kingsville are stymied. We can’t grow. We don’t have the hydro capabilities here.”", "Our community has already paid heavily for this government’s failure. The community and businesses are screaming for help from the government, but their pleas have gone unnoticed. Don’t ask the government; ask them. Nature Fresh Farms announced earlier in the year that it would be bringing a $200-million expansion and 300 jobs to Ohio instead of Ontario. The company cited massive hydro prices and the transmission project’s delays as the reason Leamington did not receive those needed investments.", "Mr. Speaker, I am certain that there are other MPPs in the Legislature that would agree with me when I say that Leamington and the Essex county area desperately need jobs. We cannot afford to let good-paying jobs and expansion in Leamington slip away because of dithering by the government. This government is preaching smart growth, but when a golden opportunity to grow hits them square in the face, they don’t know what to do. That’s not smart at all.", "Mr. Speaker, thank you very much for the opportunity to address you this morning in this hallowed place, the Legislature." ],

Speaker, as you’re well aware, there are many things that are missing in this piece of legislation that the NDP has noted as we’ve gone through it. We see that the government has been consulting on this for about a year and a half, but really, do we have a bill that addresses the questions of sprawl? Does it address the questions of the OMB essentially negating democratic decisions at the city council level? No, in fact, Speaker, we don’t have that.", "The OMB is something that this government has promised to reform for over 12 years. In fact, this bill doesn’t provide the reform that people across Ontario have been expecting and people across Ontario need. It doesn’t sufficiently protect municipalities from needless appeals to the OMB. In my own riding, Speaker, there are projects that have come forward where the developers have effectively ignored the city of Toronto, ignored the planners, ignored the local politicians and the local community, and gone straight to the OMB.", "Speaker, that undermining of the ability of cities to plan rationally and have everything set up at the OMB is a huge failing of this government’s approach to cities and city planning. We need to encourage sustainable, transit-friendly land use planning. The province needs to support regions like Waterloo that plan for smart growth. Instead, the province has allowed developers to use the OMB to overrule municipalities and the province’s own Places to Grow Act in order to pave over farmland and build more sprawl. If the government is serious about cities that work and taking on climate change, this bill is inadequate." ],

They said, “We have a deficit problem, and we have a solution for it: We will simply download on the municipalities the costs that the provincial government used to have, and then we will say we have solved the problem.” I can well recall those days when municipalities had a legitimate beef with the provincial government. The Progressive Conservative, as it’s called here—even though it’s Conservative—government in Ontario downloaded. Even Conservative politicians at the local level were astounded by this.", "This government, the Liberal government, did exactly the opposite. It has been uploading financial responsibility, taking that onerous responsibility from the municipalities and placing it where it belongs, at the provincial level, at the cost of some $2 billion. Even when the provincial government was facing major economic challenges, we did not make a decision to say, “Well, we have a solution for that. We’ll discontinue the uploading process.” No. Even through the most difficult times, we have continued to upload those responsibilities.", "I know that the member didn’t have an opportunity to clarify that the downloading took place under the Conservative government and the uploading of responsibilities has happened under a Liberal government." ],

Speaker, we really do have distinct problems, challenges and opportunities in Ontario, and I would only hope that some accommodation is made. When you look at southern Ontario, the GTA and southwestern Ontario, there was the Golden Horseshoe plan. Really, that plan is all about containing growth. But when you cross north of Vaughan, as many people in this Legislature haven’t done yet, you’re in a whole different world, especially as you come to northern Ontario, where our northern growth plan is all about igniting growth.", "There really are two diametrically different plans that should be in place.

What it doesn’t do is provide housing and development growth. Ontario should be moving forward and removing needless barriers so that municipalities and others can move with their projects.", "I was here earlier during a previous debate where a colleague of mine brought up a very interesting point: If you don’t have the proper power supply—and my previous colleague, my friend who talked about the barriers to northern Ontario—you will not have growth. That’s one of the biggest challenges that we have in northern Ontario, having that proper power supply, proper hydro supply, in order to attract investment.

Many people think we are not working, but this is not the reality for all of us. The work we do when we are back in our ridings is very important. When we are not here at Queen’s Park—being back in the riding allows us to engage with our constituents, attend community meetings and events, and, through discussions, we have the opportunity to develop legislation and ideas, and understand what people have to say about issues and about this government. Then, our responsibility is to bring back their voices to the Legislature and voice our constituents’ concerns here with this government.", "The first reading of Bill 73 was in March 2015, second reading started in April 2015, and then the House rose in June 2015. Now we’re here, the first week back—this is the actual first week back in the Legislature—and as the MPP for London–Fanshawe, I look forward to participating in the debate on Bill 73, An Act to amend the Development Charges Act, 1997 and the Planning Act, also known as the Smart Growth for Our Communities Act.", "What this bill does is it includes some long-overdue improvements to the Development Charges Act and the Planning Act, but in our humble opinion, here on this side of the House, there’s still much missing from this bill.", "I understand the government has conducted public consultations on land use and planning development charges for a year and a half. That’s quite a long time to go out throughout Ontario and consult with people to hear what they have to say. And though the act is rather thick on paper, it’s thin on OMB reform that the government has been repeatedly promising for over 12 years.", "For the short time that I’ve been here—and I think 2011 and 2014, that’s still a short time—I’m not surprised by the lacklustre legislation this government brings forward. You have to ask yourself, “Can’t this government make a commitment to legislation that will really make a difference, and then actually follow through on what they say?”", "The consultations probably gave people a lot of hope. They probably thought, “Finally we’ll have a chance to be heard and there will be legislation and reform at the OMB.” Alas, Bill 73 does not sufficiently address municipalities and the needless appeals to the OMB. What does it say to municipalities that invest in planning reviews and developing new land use policies when a developer can turn around and immediately ask for the OMB to alter the new rules? So we ask: What reasons do municipalities have to invest in such initiatives? We need to give them incentive and we need to give them legislation that will work for them.", "As many other MPPs before me in this House have pointed out, this bill ignores solutions to affordable housing, and one of the solutions we think will help affordable housing in many communities throughout Ontario is inclusionary zoning. That’s an NDP proposal that this government claims to support, but it’s not in the bill, which is very disappointing.", "My fellow MPP from Windsor–Tecumseh gave statistics about the need to fix—which is very important, because a lot of affordable housing right now in all cities throughout Ontario needs to have maintenance—and the need to build more affordable housing that will also help people who have been on waiting lists for far too long.", "I don’t think this is anything new, so I really want to make sure that I articulate it. People have basic needs and one of the basic needs is a house, a place to live. Right now, what we’re facing is there are many people who are struggling day to day, trying to make ends meet. They’re actually struggling to get by. Their rent is expensive, tuition’s expensive; they don’t have retirement benefits. People’s hydro rates are up. Some people call my office, and their hydro rates are half the cost of the rent they’re paying. So affordable housing is essential. It’s essential to survival and to a healthy community. Having affordable housing is basically having a stable place to live.", "In my riding, like many other ridings, I’m sure, through the Legislature, MPPs have co-op housing and geared-to-income housing. Those are wonderful builds in our community. They need to be incorporated throughout cities, and inclusionary zoning is a great way to accomplish that.", "A couple of days ago, the member from Eglinton–Lawrence was ranting and raving about, “You’ve got to give us some ideas. What are your suggestions to make these bills better? You need to help us out and make government work.” That’s a perfect suggestion: inclusionary zoning. Put it in the bill. It’s going to make a huge difference to people, to communities and to thriving cities. We know in Toronto there’s a real gap in affordable housing, so I hope the member from Eglinton–Lawrence is listening. Take it to the minister; act on that suggestion. There’s one suggestion.", "London, I have to say, is a wonderful place to live in. The city has been promoting growth in London in many ways, and this bill allows me the opportunity to talk about what London’s been doing. In 2012, city of London staff began a public consultation called ReThink London, which sought to gather as much public input as possible regarding how residents would like to see the city develop. It was the most extensive public consultation process for an official plan in Canadian municipal history. Consultation topics included: culture, prosperity, regional connection, green thinking, transit and neighbourhoods. It was a groundbreaking initiative to pre-emptively and actively engage the residents of London in owning the future of our city.", "The results of ReThink London were incorporated into the London plan and our city’s 20-year official plan that contains significant progress and changes into infrastructure, including improved standard transit as well as new rapid transit, development of the Thames River shoreline, and infill in the core and suburbs to prevent further sprawl. The plan focuses on transit overhauling and infill, two initiatives that are directly impacted by land use planning and development charges, which this act doesn’t address. So there are some issues with the Development Charges Act amendments that directly affect our city’s official plan and development progress.", "Area rating policies currently allow municipal councils to determine if and where specific areas of the city should be subject to different development charges. We have some concerns that the rigid language in the revised act might inhibit councils from exercising discretion over area ratings.", "One of the reasons the city of London waived development charges for the downtown core and Old East Village areas was to promote growth and development, a decision that has produced demonstrably positive results, attracting companies and small businesses to the city’s rapidly reviving core. An example of revitalization that was recently in the paper was the old Mark’s Work Wearhouse building located on Dundas Street in Old East Village, which is now going to be transformed into a grocery store with a training component.", "Speaker, there are also concerns about appeals of the development charge bylaws to the OMB only resulting in maintenance of, or decreases to, the council approval rate. A suggestion London city staff has expressed is that the board members should also be able to increase the development charges rate if it is deemed appropriate. That’s another suggestion the government can take into account.", "As it stands, the development charges do not allow for municipalities to recover growth-related capital costs from the building of certain municipal services. These costs instead are absorbed by the taxpayers. If these ineligible services are removed from the Development Charges Act, it would provide municipal councils with the authority to determine what municipal services should be subject to cost recovery. There are similar concerns about city taxpayers bearing the load for development of soft services that are currently subject to a mandatory 10% deduction for capital needs recovery.", "Homebuyers pay a lot of money in development charges and parkland dedication fees when they buy a home. They deserve to know how and where their money is collected and spent. We hope the promised transparency in the act will truly deliver.", "While this bill is a step in the right direction, my party is certainly eager to see improvements. The legislation is not what the government promised Ontarians. These kinds of half measures only pay lip service to the real issues, or the affordable housing crisis the New Democrats will call to the government’s attention. Our communities need assistance and we must do more. We have an obligation to help them." ],

They were desperate to move, to get into something that would provide them with housing that gave everyone the room they needed to live.", "Ignoring, setting aside the opportunity that presentation of this bill presents to address inclusionary zoning and provide more affordable housing is a huge failing on the part of this government.

There are 440, as a matter of fact. I think sometimes this government is only interested in listening to about eight. The large urban municipalities: They’re the only ones that they’re interested in hearing from because, let’s be honest, that’s where most of the votes are when it comes to trying to win a provincial election. That’s who they’re catering to, and a lot of rural Ontario has been left behind as a result of the actions of this government.", "Bill 73 is another cute-named bill. It’s the Smart Growth for Our Communities Act. It makes it sound like there’s actually something smart in this bill that’s going to impress people in ridings right across Ontario and in communities across Ontario. I can tell you that, once again, this bill is about as flimsy as that piece of paper right there. There’s not a whole lot of meat on this bone when it comes to this bill. This is something that this government does time and time again, though. They’ll bring in legislation that doesn’t have anything in it but it has a real snazzy-sounding title that everybody can get behind. Well, how can you vote against smart growth for our communities? You can’t, really. But there’s nothing in the bill, when you get to it. My wife is a high school teacher, and if she saw this bill, she would grade it as incomplete. It wouldn’t even be worthy of a letter; it would be incomplete. I think that’s the case, but I digress.", "As we move on here, the Association of Municipalities of Ontario represents the municipalities in Ontario, and their reception, or their reaction or response to Bill 73 is lukewarm at best, I would say. Let me quote here: “Elements of the bill which are problematic: AMO objects to the requirement for an upper-tier planning advisory committee”—or a PAC—“with at least one member of the public. The mandatory PAC will create more issues than it resolves.” We know that it wouldn’t be the first time that this bill has actually brought forward legislation that’s created more problems than it solved. They have a pretty good track record of bringing in legislation that makes it more difficult for smart growth and smart development in the province than it fixes.", "The Ontario Home Builders’ Association—let’s hear what they have to say. They have a mixed reaction to this as well. They’re saying: “The Ontario Home Builders’ Association (OHBA) is concerned that new transit taxes on development will disproportionately increase housing costs for residents and the cost of setting up new businesses.” This highlights another remarkable trait of bills that this government introduces: Somehow, somewhere, they’re going to find a way to make it more expensive to do business in Ontario, and that’s what this legislation is poised to do.", "Municipalities are constantly running into planning challenges, but this government has chosen only to address a few that seem to fit the narrow list of things that they want to talk about in some of their large urban municipalities. For at least the last two years, I’ve had meetings in my office in Belleville and up in North Hastings, and even here at Queen’s Park during the ROMA conference that happens every February, regarding the use of private roads in small, rural municipalities. They call them condo roads in a lot of the small, rural municipalities. The government has done nothing to address this issue and the concerns of municipal councils in these small municipalities in regard to Bill 73. That’s something that they could have tackled in Bill 73.", "In fact, the government policy seems to be to disregard the concerns of a lot of small municipalities. I can even cite the example this past week of the mayor of Prince Edward county. Prince Edward county is a pretty significant municipality in the grand scheme of things in Ontario. It seems to be the number one most promoted tourism area in any of the Ontario advertising that you were seeing on TV during the Pan Am Games or during the Olympics when they were in Sochi, Russia. The Ontario ads, “Yours to Discover,” promoted Prince Edward county in five different snapshots of the sandbanks or wineries in Prince Edward county or downtown Bloomfield or wherever it might be.", "There are specific concerns that are being expressed by the mayor and council in Prince Edward county that aren’t being dealt with by this government. As a matter of fact, when they go to AMO and the mayor of Prince Edward county meets with the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change and a number of other ministers—the Minister of Natural Resources, the Minister of Tourism—he is promised that things are going to progress down the road. But when he follows up with the office after having the meeting at AMO or whatever the conference might be—“Well, we can’t meet with you.” That’s the response that he’s getting: “We can’t meet with you,” for this reason or that reason or another reason, or, “We can’t address your specific situation.”", "They’re saying one thing when they’re face to face, but when it comes time to actually put the rubber to the road and do something about it, they find an excuse not to. It’s shameful what’s happening. Relationships are deteriorating between municipalities and the provincial government because of the actions of this very arrogant Liberal government here at Queen’s Park." ],

In his address to this year’s AMO conference, the president of the association said that the association wants policy that reflects a desire to have growth pay for growth. Not a bad motivation behind planning policy, but it has to acknowledge certain truths, one of which is that we have a housing affordability problem in this province. We have 168,000 people, Mr. Speaker, who are on a wait-list for affordable housing with thousands of them in my riding of Prince Edward–Hastings. We have people who are downsizing in our communities because they can’t afford their property taxes. They can’t afford their hydro bills. They can’t afford their mortgage on the house that they currently live in, so they’re having to downsize. In the case of many seniors, just the property tax and the hydro bill are enough to make it tough to make ends meet month after month.", "I’m not sold on the idea that increasing the cost of doing business in order to build homes in the first place is the best way to solve an affordability problem. Municipalities are facing ever-increasing financial strains. Oftentimes, the property tax base is an insufficient source of revenue. Belleville council has regularly spoken about the tens of millions of dollars of infrastructure in the city that either needs to be replaced or will soon need to be replaced. It’s not just Belleville that is saying these things; it’s municipalities right across the province.", "The provincial government has continually pushed problems to the municipal level. This has taken many forms, whether it was ending the OMPF funding, which is a huge problem for small municipalities in my riding, cuts to the special dam funding, or a lack of seriousness when dealing with the arbitration process in the province or arbitration reform. Municipalities are continuously being asked to do more with less.", "How we ultimately help municipalities best meet the needs that come with growth and planning is going to be a matter that generates considerable debate. Once again, I’m brought back to the fact that this government has put forward a bill that has little meat on the bone. There are not a whole lot of issues that are being dealt with in this bill. They could have been dealt with.", "In Prince Edward county, this very concern is raised as the government pushes to erect 400-foot-tall turbines that are being hauled down roads that can barely withstand regular traffic from a Mazda, let alone the giant vehicles that are being brought in to haul these industrial wind turbines down those roads to build these monstrosities in the community. All this, by the way, would be going through an incredibly sensitive wildlife habitat. One can only imagine what any other developer would have to pay to bring those trucks and have that kind of development occur there.", "Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I look forward to wrapping this up." ],

I think anybody who’s been involved with municipalities and with development in this province will understand and know intuitively that we have a very complicated, onerous and costly planning regime in this province. What is smart about making it more costly, more complicated and more onerous, which is what Bill 73 does? There’s nothing smart about this bill.", "I also want to bring attention to the members in the House today that the member from the Scarborough–Guildwood, in her earlier comments, mentioned—and used it as a pretext to end debate on this bill. She said that all members are in agreement with this bill and that we should send it to committee; there’s no need to hear from anybody else.", "She may want to correct the record. I’ve listened to debate this morning. There is not full support for this bill. I think you’d have to be in some other pixie-dust land to think that there was support in this House for this bill. So the member from Scarborough–Guildwood may want to use both ears while listening to debate and not come to these false conclusions.", "Once again, I represent rural municipalities—a number of them. There are significant troubles. Most of the troubles that they experience with the Planning Act are not by other developers challenging but from the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing. The member mentioned in his comments about private roads—that’s a big deal. We’ve had many, many objections to the OMB by the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing with regard to development and official plans. That is what needs to be addressed and what is failing in this bill." ],

But I’d like to one-up him. Out of the 444 municipalities that are in Ontario, 37 municipalities are in Algoma–Manitoulin: 21 First Nations and 15 local service boards. I love each and every one of those communities, and I try to get to them each and every time.", "One thing I do want to comment on: He made a comment in regard to the PACs, and he’s right. The single- and upper-tier municipalities are required to create planning advisory committees which “shall include at least one resident of the municipality who is neither a member of a municipal council nor an employee of the municipality.” Municipalities may join with others to create a single PAC; however, the PACs are not specified or given any information within the context of this.", "Also, earlier the Minister of Tourism, Culture and Sport made a comment in regard to shutting down debate. It’s funny how quickly you want to shut down debate on this, but when we have one of the biggest policy debates in regard to the sell-off of Hydro One, we’re not having that opportunity to have a chat.", "The member also talked about the OMPF funding that has been reduced, which the government now has claimed they have reintroduced, but at a lower amount. The dam funding: You’re absolutely right. The special dam funding has been under threat of being eliminated, which affects 111 municipalities—which a community out of Algoma–Manitoulin has taken the lead on in the fight in order to maintain that.", "I do want to correct the record. My two colleagues the member from Essex and the member from Prince Edward–Hastings talked about walleye fishing. There is good walleye fishing in Prince Edward–Hastings, but everybody knows that the best fishing for walleye and pickerel is in Algoma–Manitoulin." ],

Right? I think that that’s a problem in rural Ontario. I know that it’s a problem in my riding. In some communities, we’re experiencing negative growth, and this bill does nothing to address the situation in small rural municipalities. It’s all about big development.", "As the member from Lanark–Frontenac–Lennox and Addington, Mr. Hillier, said, this bill is actually making it more costly, complicated and onerous for planners, for developers, for growth in our province.

  "text" : [ "I agree with my friend from Prince Edward–Hastings that the various municipalities that are represented by rural members are not experiencing growth and have not experienced growth for quite some time. Yet they still have to plan for it, and they still have to build in those costs for projected growth, as an optimistic region would do: always looking forward, always projecting forward and always trying to incentivize and entice that growth.", "I know that’s what is happening in my area, in Windsor and Essex county, in Chatham–Kent–Essex. Those guys are always looking forward, trying to be innovative in their approach to development, working with developers, working with industries and trying to facilitate it. They just simply wish they had a partner at the provincial level that acknowledged that that is what they’re doing, and moulded and tailored policy in that regard.", "Somebody made mention that we shouldn’t be debating this—I forget who it was; I think it was somebody on that other side—but it is quite interesting. It seems as though the government has touted that they have consulted widely on this bill. They’ve had some round tables, some discussions with municipalities. However, the largest policy initiative ever put forward by a government in the history of this province, the sell-off of Ontario Hydro, has yet to have one iota of discussion with the public at all. They are keeping that in the dark. It is unbelievable, it’s unfortunate, and it really is telling in terms of what they prioritize and what they don’t—what gets to be debated and what doesn’t get debated. So when it is our time and it is our right to debate a bill in this House, rest assured that we will take it as duly elected members of the House, because that’s what our job is.", "This bill, as has been mentioned, doesn’t really go as far as municipalities and those who are integral players within growth and development in municipalities would like. The bill includes some welcome improvements to the Development Charges Act and the Planning Act, but it is still missing many initiatives and much real, tangible policy, and it really behooves this government to put into place those types of initiatives that they know exist. They know they exist because there was a previous bill, Bill 39, which was put forward by a member of the Liberal Party, not a newly elected member—I think it was one of his first bills, and we supported that bill. It went a lot further in terms of addressing the challenges for municipalities, specifically dealing with the OMB.", "We know that homebuyers pay a lot of money in development charges and parkland dedication fees when they buy a new home. They deserve to know where the money is collected and spent. That’s what Bill 39 did: It dealt with the OMB. It dealt with some provisions of accountability and transparency for ratepayers, to know that their development charges are actually going to enhance the communities in which they live.", "In my area of Windsor and Essex county, we really have some incredible dynamics between municipalities, one of which, LaSalle, is where my wife is from. It’s really a wonderful community. It’s on the banks of the Detroit River, a historic community that has experienced growth over the years. That’s one of the areas that we could point to that has experienced some growth, due in large part to the prudent planning of the municipality, but also the prudent financial discipline and the fiscal discipline that that community has had. You feel it. The roads are nicely paved. They’ve got good planning. They’ve got a good amount of natural space that’s built in. It really is a wonderful community that people are flocking to.", "However, they are now on the boundary of the Herb Gray Parkway, a provincial roadway that is, again, one of the largest expenditures of this government, one of the largest they’ve ever endeavoured in terms of the cost. They spent a lot of money on that thing." ],

However, the four years of construction that that community has endured, and the arterial roads that the construction companies have had to use, have caused a lot of damage to the municipality and to the municipal services. In fact, some residents who are on the boundaries of the parkway are now experiencing massive flooding due to the water that’s being accumulated because you’ve covered so much of that area with cement and asphalt.", "The municipality is saying, “Wait a second here. We certainly would like some help. This is your project. You’ve created some chaos in terms of road usage, damage to roads and the need to repair them. Can we have some help? Can we have a partner in this, seeing as though it was a component of the project?” There’s no partner to be found. The answer was, “No. Sorry. Live with it. Get on with it.” So there’s another example of where the government has—not officially downloaded costs on them, but by their actions have caused more strife and grief for a community. A community that has, again, if you look at their books, been fiscally prudent and really, really well regarded in our community.", "However, they still need support. If you look at the applications for support through various methods and various programs, the province is reticent to support them because their books look good. They’re doing so well that the province can’t support them in terms of grant money for infrastructure. Therefore, they have to look at other methods to supplement that cost, the cost for their infrastructure and the cost for their growth. That’s just one example of the challenges that exist.", "Speaker, a glaring omission in Bill 73, the Smart Growth for Our Communities Act, is any attempt from the government to address the serious issue of affordable housing. It is at crisis level, definitely in the GTA. Interestingly, if you come down to my riding, we still have a definite need for affordable housing but, in general, the housing is some of the most affordable in the world—well, in the province. That’s why I encourage anyone to come and look at some real estate prices in Windsor and Essex county. It certainly makes more sense than it does in the GTA. A similar-sized house in Essex would be a third of the cost, which for some people just doesn’t make sense.", "Speaker, the government could and should enact some provisions to include inclusionary zoning, which would give the municipality the tools to demand that developers build those types of projects into their development, therefore creating communities that are affordable and accessible for all residents. It’s certainly something they could do that would go a very long way.", "My colleague from Chatham–Kent–Essex again referenced the fact that growth isn’t happening because of other metrics, mainly the high cost of energy, but also access to energy. In the area of Chatham–Kent–Essex and my riding of Kingsville, Essex, they have a lot of greenhouses that need access to power. Interestingly enough, we are surrounded by, I would say, hundreds of windmills, large industrial wind turbines that are generating power, no doubt, yet we can’t feed them into our municipalities to incentivize and add to the growth and the capacity.", "For years and years we’ve heard this government say that they were going to do something. When I was first elected, the Minister of Finance was Dwight Duncan from Windsor–Tecumseh. He stated at that time that he had this issue resolved: It was going to be changed; it was going to be fixed. Here we are four years later and still no inkling of resolution for the community of Leamington.", "Certainly, this bill is something that gives a little bit of hope that the government is paying attention. However, we know that, through amendments that we will propose to the bill, we can certainly make it stronger, and we’ll hope that the government listens to those amendments. Many of them will be amendments that exist verbatim in Bill 39 that a member of your caucus put forward and that we believe actually could make this bill stronger. So we’ll see how you vote at committee on those amendments, those very amendments that are derived from a member of the Liberal Party, because we actually think that a good idea in this place doesn’t need too much—" ],

Neal, along with volunteers from the Childhood Cancer International and Big Book of Care campaigns, are reminding us to do more so we can build a future free from cancer; that is, to build on the progress achieved at all levels of society and to make new drug research possible so we can ensure a brighter and healthier future for all of our children. That means government, industry, hospitals, research institutes and individual and corporate donors.", "As such, I respectfully ask all of us to commit to working tirelessly to ensure we give our children and youth every opportunity to grow and thrive and live in a world that is free from cancer in all its forms. It is my hope that we will soon, for the dream of my hero, Terry Fox, find a cure for all cancers. “Somewhere the hurting must stop.”" ],

Her name is Adrienne Newport.", "As a child, Adrienne had to wear a bright blue helmet to go to school because she would bash her head on walls and doors, a way of dealing with her frustrations that was misunderstood by many. At a young age, she barricaded herself in her home and attempted to burn it down. Consequently, she was arrested and charged for her actions. She spent time in a psychiatric ward and other institutions where she was restrained and sedated on numerous occasions.", "Adrienne wrote a book, co-authored by John A. McCurdy: The Light That Guides My Way. She outlines her challenges and sheds light on what it’s like to live with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder—FASD for short. Adrienne was born with FASD along with cerebral palsy. Despite her unfair circumstances at birth, improper care for her needs and mistreatment since a young age, Adrienne has accepted her challenges. She has persevered and she is succeeding.", "Adrienne has been working part-time in the administration office at Rygiel Supports for Community Living. She is grateful for the staff and the support of people like Donna Marcaccio, the executive director. She has also earned a community integration certificate from Mohawk College. Her dream is to have a full-time job as a counsellor, a social worker or even a politician, so that she can continue to raise awareness about FASD.", "I am grateful that I’ve had the opportunity to meet Adrienne. I enjoyed reading her book detailing her life journey, and I strongly suggest this read." ],

Our mayor, Berry Vrbanovic, spoke at the gathering, announcing that our council has committed $10,000 to the Mennonite Central Committee as it responds to this unprecedented humanitarian crisis. I’m proud to add that our government recently committed $10.5 million in aid to the resettlement of 10,000 refugees by the end of 2016.", "Despite the impulse to see immigrants as a burden to society—this is a notion that is profoundly mistaken. As the daughter of immigrants, I can say with confidence that immigrants built this country. They contribute to the economic prosperity of Ontario and they make our communities more vibrant. We are taking action in Ontario to help Syrian refugees, but we need a federal partner to address our current refugee resettlement policy. We hope that they heed Ontario’s call to bring more refugees to Canada by the end of the year. Ontarians care, and I’m heartened to know that the people of my community, Kitchener Centre, do too." ],

This is not only devastating to the front-line health care workers but more so for their patients, who are now rightfully concerned about access to the quality health care they need and deserve. Just this week we heard that hospital cuts in Ottawa have led to rising readmission rates, negating any supposed savings and negatively impacting access to quality care.", "The Liberal government has clearly put self-interest ahead of the health care of northerners.

Let me tell [you] that it’s a big joke, and that program should be scrapped and save the taxpayers a ton of money. I live at 72 First Street, Englehart, so there are a few reasons why it cannot be shot; one, because I live in town.

Are we not supposed to grow our own food anymore?”", "That’s the issue that this government is missing.

  "text" : [ "Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I appreciate the opportunity to continue my remarks.", "Where we left off: We were talking about some of the beneficial steps, some of the improvements that Bill 106 will provide. It addresses a number of concerns, particularly where it comes to some of the major issues that arise for condominium owners. One of the issues that I talked about that I think is very important is that there is a tribunal mechanism. If there are disputes, if there are concerns between the condominium owner and the board, there is a remedy, which is a positive sign.", "But I want to reiterate one of my concerns. Although there are disputes between the condominium owner and the board, and it is important to provide a tribunal that allows for those issues to be remedied, one of the major sources of complaints is between the condominium owner and the developer, and the condominium owner and the condominium manager. However, those two categories were left out of this tribunal process. That’s very concerning.", "It seems to me that if you have already struck the tribunal, it would only make sense to make sure that all the players involved are incorporated into the tribunal mechanism. It only makes sense that if a condominium owner wants to raise a complaint, they should be able to raise all of their complaints in that tribunal. Now, the way the system works is that you can raise some complaints to this tribunal when it comes to your condominium board, but if it’s a developer issue or if it’s a condominium manager issue, you have to go to court.", "We all know how difficult it is to go to court, to navigate the court system, how costly it could be and how difficult it could be for someone who doesn’t understand the court system or is not familiar with it. Often it’s so cost-prohibitive that people are loath to go to the courts, and they are left without any remedy or any solution to their problem. So that’s a big concern.", "The other area I touched on—and I want to go into more detail on this area; I have some other sources and other folks, and I would like to add their voices to this issue. With condominiums being newly built homes, one of the major concerns that has arisen when it comes to condominiums in general is that we all know that a home, whether it’s a condo, a townhouse or a freehold house—these are some of the most valuable assets in a person’s life. In a consumer’s life, this is probably the most expensive single purchase they will make, and it is very important that they have peace of mind when they make this purchase.", "The government has created a home warranty system, and this home warranty system, although it’s private and not-for-profit and although it’s not owned by the government, essentially the government mandated that Tarion is the only source of a warranty. It’s the only place you can go to for a warranty, and in fact you have to have a warranty if you purchase a new home. It seems to make sense for such a valuable asset to have a warranty, but when you require that there’s only one place to go—you have to go to it—and that entity is not providing good service, the government has a responsibility to have oversight over this entity.", "Though it may be private, essentially it is operating solely because of the mandate the government provided. If the government hadn’t said that, by law, you must purchase your home warranty through Tarion—if they didn’t mandate that by law—then Tarion would essentially have no source of revenue or very little source of revenue or a questionable source of revenue. It’s solely operating based on that mandate and, in effect, it is being operated on public dollars. Because it is operating on public dollars, it should be open to the same scrutiny we apply to other arm’s-length agencies that work because of the taxpayer dollar. However, in this case, Tarion is not under any scrutiny. It’s not under Ombudsman oversight, nor is it something that is accessible by the Auditor General.", "Alan Shanoff, who was previously counsel to Sun Media Corp., a freelance writer who also teaches media law at Humber College, wrote for the Law Times and got into this issue regarding Tarion. I’d like to quote Mr. Shanoff’s article. He very clearly summarizes the situation: “The government doesn’t fund Tarion, which instead relies on mandatory fees passed on to and paid by new home purchasers as well as builder registration and renewal fees and investment income. In other words, it’s really the public that funds Tarion’s operations. Although it receives no government funding, all of Tarion’s revenue comes from its legislated mandate.”", "In that type of circumstance, when its entire source of revenue essentially comes from the public and it has no scrutiny, no oversight, that is a recipe for serious problems.", "Condominium owners, like all homeowners, purchase this very valuable asset and want to ensure that the asset they’ve purchased has some protection. They’re given this supposed peace of mind that there’s a warranty, that if there’s any issue with building code compliance, if there’s any issue with the unit’s manufacturer or the manufacture of the various components of it—if there’s an issue with the way the kitchen is set up, the kitchen cabinets, the flooring—if there are issues with this unit, there is a remedy. You can go to the home warranty and make a claim.", "But the problem—back to Mr. Shanoff’s article—the concern is that when we look at Tarion’s operations, in 2013 it collected $33.9 million in new home enrolment fees. It also earned $3.2 million in builders’ registration and renewal fees. In addition, when you include investment income, “its total revenue for the year was $71 million.” However, Tarion, in light of earning or bringing in $71 million, only paid out $7.3 million to homeowners for warrantable claims made where the builders were unable to resolve the issue. As it stands, the total equity at December 31, 2013, was $216 million. The community has essentially paid 216 million taxpayer dollars into this—consumers have paid into this—yet there’s absolutely no scrutiny. There’s no Ombudsman oversight, and there’s no access to the Auditor General.", "Now, this is an issue that has been raised a number of times. The previous Ombudsman raised this issue, received almost 300 complaints about Tarion, ranging from 2007 to 2013, and stated that he “long believed that Tarion lacks proper oversight.” In addition to the previous Ombudsman, former Ombudsman Daniel Hill also recommended that Tarion fall under the Ombudsman office’s oversight. This was in 1986. MPP Rosario Marchese specifically tabled bills on this issue to reform Tarion in 2010, in 2011 and most recently in 2012.", "There have been a number of people who have raised concerns around this issue, from ombudsmen to sitting members of provincial Parliament, and there has been nothing done to reform Tarion. At a minimum, Tarion needs to receive some serious oversight. All of these concerns were raised from the ombudsmen, were raised by the MPPs. All of these concerns for reform were around oversight and accountability, but the fact is that there is no oversight with respect to the Auditor General and there is no oversight with respect to the Ombudsman’s office. These are two specific requests that have been made time and time again, and there has been nothing to reform these two requests. It’s a fact. At this point in time, there is nothing that has been done with respect to those issues.", "I would implore the government to take a step. This is a serious issue, this is an important issue, and the government is very well within its mandate to be able to address this issue, to look at the books. We’ve asked time and time again to look at where our dollars are going. Is there appropriate value for money; are consumers receiving the best protection possible; are there inappropriate activities going on or not; and, given the evidence in terms of the revenues coming in and the claims going out, is this fair, is it appropriate and are consumers getting the best service? These are questions that people are asking and there are no answers provided, and there hasn’t been sufficient oversight.", "The Canadians for Properly Built Homes also raised this concern, and they’ve raised concerns with respect to Tarion a number of times. Most recently, they raised an issue—they had a news release on June 1, 2015. They’re urging the government to pass Bill 60. Bill 60, again, builds on the great work of MPP Rosario Marchese but looks toward improving Tarion oversight and accountability. The Canadians for Properly Built Homes specifically indicate that, using Tarion’s own client survey data, approximately 60,000 Ontario families are dissatisfied with the service they received from Tarion. That’s a significant number." ],

There are more and more people who are upset about what is going on.", "The Canadians for Properly Built Homes also raised concerns around the accumulated wealth that Tarion has, where the oversight is, the accountability of where that wealth is going and where it’s being used. Essentially, there is no consumer protection with respect to this issue. People are upset, and they’re not seeing any real action.", "So it’s one thing to raise the concern; now I’m going to provide some clear suggestions. I proposed a bill—and again I built on the great work of other members. One of the first steps we need to do is look at the overall framework of Tarion. One of the first steps is that if we know that essentially all of the revenue that comes into Tarion comes from the public, then one of the requirements, that I’ve asked for in Bill 60, is that Tarion be included on the sunshine list—there would be public salary disclosure and that it would apply to Tarion. It would be the start of uncovering whether or not things are going on in an appropriate manner or not.", "I’ll just remind the government that in one of the most recent scandals, the Ornge scandal, the key to unlocking this scandal—and this question was posed a number of times and specifically answered by the Minister of Health at the time. One of the keys to unlocking the scandal in Ornge was the salary of Dr. Mazza. Once that salary got disclosed, that it had risen to over $1 million, there were some serious red flags. That question about salary was posed by the NDP numerous times in committee, years before the scandal broke. This question about salary continued on to requests through the disclosure-of-information requests that were made, freedom-of-information applications that were made to obtain the salary.", "These requests, again, landed on deaf ears. No one responded and we did not have that answer. It was only after the great investigative work from various media agencies that we were able to uncover this salary, and then we realize that there were some serious problems with Ornge and the way it was conducting its business: that it was mixing for-profit and not-for-profit agencies in a way that was inappropriate, and that the service quality was seriously at risk.", "We have another potential Ornge on our hands. We have an agency that provides an important service but has no accountability, in effect, and has no real oversight. The government is not taking any actions to provide that oversight and that accountability. Without that, perhaps this will turn into another Ornge. Instead of it being an issue that lands on the front page of a newspaper, perhaps the government can take this opportunity, now that this issue has been raised again and again, and perhaps they can take the step now to proactively address the situation and find out if there is a serious concern; address it now, instead of waiting years from now when someone else will come back and quote the member from Bramalea–Gore–Malton for having raised this issue in Parliament.", "In addition to the issues around accountability, the other concern about Tarion is that its purpose is to provide protection for homeowners. If that’s its purpose, then it should be clearly listed in terms of its mandate; it should be clearly listed in terms of its mission. Most importantly, its membership, the board of Tarion, should be made up of people who actually will advance that initiative.", "Tarion doesn’t only act as a home warranty; in effect, it acts as a form of regulator over the builders. However, the membership of the board is comprised of primarily the very same industry which it seeks to regulate. That, inherently, is a problem. If Tarion is supposed to regulate an industry and if it’s supposed to provide protection to the consumer, to the homeowner, then its board should reflect that membership. The membership of the board should reflect that. The membership of the board should reflect people who are homeowners, who are members of homeowner associations, people who are affiliated with protecting consumer rights.", "As it stands, Mr. Speaker, the membership of the board is actually comprised of agencies and individuals that are related to the construction industry. While we respect the construction industry as an important, vital sector in our economy, and it provides a vital service towards building homes, it doesn’t make sense that the regulator of this industry be comprised of people from that industry itself. It just doesn’t make sense. That’s something that we also question. We want the government to address that as well, and Bill 60 looks to address that issue.", "We have an opportunity now; the government has taken an appropriate step and a good step to addressing the issues around condominium owners. We’ve seen a serious lack of oversight in terms of the condominium industry, resulting in some serious issues. Many of the members are familiar with the glass-falling circumstances that occurred with condominiums, which resulted in a lot of the pressure placed on this government now to take the steps that we see with Bill 106. But we’ve only just scratched the surface with this bill, and there’s a lot more that can be done.", "With respect to the condominium authority, though the condominium authority is a good idea—and I applaud the government for ensuring, right off the bat, that the condominium authority is something that is open to Auditor General scrutiny; that is an appropriate decision that makes sense. But if you can do it with the condominium authority that the government is creating through this bill, why can’t you then also have that same accountability and oversight with Tarion?", "I just cited some of the dollars and figures. If you look at Tarion in terms of its resources, how much money is involved in Tarion, and you compare that with the potential condominium authority, it’s light-years apart. You have one agency, which is just going to start—which will not have nearly the same revenue, won’t have nearly the same amount in terms of asset—receiving the highest level, the gold standard, of oversight and accountability, and you have another agency, which has 100 times more assets in terms of revenue, and it’s receiving essentially zero oversight from this government.", "In fact, when it comes to the oversight and the relationship between the government and Tarion, though the previous Ombudsman did not have the mandate to actually investigate Tarion directly, the Ombudsman did have the authority to investigate the relationship between the government of Ontario and Tarion, and did so, did evaluate this relationship. In 2008, the then Ombudsman released a report which criticized the ministry for its failures concerning Tarion. So it’s important that that be noted as well. It has not only been raised by members of provincial Parliament, but the Ombudsman also raised this issue, issued a report on this issue and, in fact, criticized the government’s handling of this file. It’s important that this issue be highlighted again.", "So while the tribunal is a good step and while it is an important measure, in terms of a remedy for those condominium owners who are concerned, it shows us that the government is capable of providing oversight in that area. It should be able to provide the same accountability with respect to Tarion.", "Now, I raise this issue, and I want to go into some more depth on this, with respect to the way that the tribunal will be set up. This is a question about the manner in which the government is bringing bills forward. Much of the details around the tribunal—the way the tribunal is going to work in terms of its mechanism, the way it is going to unfold—are left to regulation. Any time you leave details, and a great deal of details, to regulation, it limits the ability of the opposition to be able to provide insight into this bill. If everything is going to be left to the minister to provide in regulation, then the bill becomes less wholesome in terms of what we can say and provide input to. So while the tribunal looks good, I don’t have any of the real details around the mechanism, the way it’s going to operate and the way it’s going to unfold. Those details are only going to be—" ],

  "text" : [ "Thank you.", "With respect to the other areas of this bill—where this bill provides some strong protection and where we need to strengthen some further protection—one of the areas that I touched on earlier in the speech, and I think it is something we really need to highlight, is that there is a great need for consumer protection, in terms of what the buyer is provided with at the time of sale and what they receive once the sale is completed. That’s something that this act looks to address, but we need to address it in more detail.", "For example—and I touched on this and I think it’s something we need to touch on a bit more. When you purchase a condominium, the way the current legislation protection works is that the unit itself—if you’re promised a certain type of flooring and pay for that flooring, you’re promised a certain type of wall, a certain type of amenities and a certain upgrade in the kitchen or the appliances, those items in your actual unit are very specifically protected in the agreement. So if there is a significant variation, if you purchase something and the square footage is 700 or 800 square feet and you receive something that’s 500 square feet, you will be protected. That’s something that’s very closely scrutinized, and that’s important.", "But the areas that don’t receive the same level of protection are the common elements, and I think that’s important to note. In a condominium, often the selling point or the point that really pulls someone in is the fact that when you’re purchasing a condominium, you’re receiving a whole host of other amenities, and that’s something that condominium homeowners look towards. They look at and they assess, “Okay, maybe I’m getting a smaller room, maybe the square footage of my actual unit will be smaller, but this condominium will have a large party room the residents will have access to. If I know that I have access to this party room, a common area, a common room where I can come to, then I can make do with a smaller condominium. I can make do with that because I know I’ll have a larger space to entertain my guests.”", "Now, that’s something important to somebody and if the developers say up front that you’re going to get a 10,000-square-foot common area, recreation space, as well as a patio where you can be outdoors and barbecue, and that’s something important to you, and then when you purchase the unit, you get the unit you were looking for, the unit that you were told, but the party room, which was supposed to be 10,000 square feet, turns out to be a closet and has maybe room for 10 people, that’s no longer what you were promised. That has a serious impact. These are things that have happened to people.", "People often look at condominiums and they look at some of the resources that are available and they say, “Perhaps I don’t need a gym membership because the condominium will have a gym in it.” That’s something that the developer will sell: “Listen. We’ll have a state-of-the-art gym. We’ll have all the weights you need, we’ll have all the equipment you need. You don’t even need a gym membership; you’ll save on that.” So perhaps you look at your condominium fees, which seem a bit high, and say, “Well, I can knock off the cost of a gym membership and I can incorporate that into my costs and say that it makes some sense. I’ll purchase this unit.” Then when you go and get the unit, instead of this world-class gym facility, you see a treadmill and an exercise ball and you’re thinking, “I could have put that in my own unit,” that’s a problem. So it’s important that those common elements that you may not, at the top of mind, think are as relevant, in a condominium purchase they are absolutely relevant and they need to be protected.", "If a consumer is provided with a certain detail around what the common element will be, then that should actually be what they get. That’s an important area of protection that is lacking in this bill at this point in time, but it’s something I’m sure we can include and I implore the government to address that concern.", "Just with my time remaining I want to look at, again, the manner in which the government approached this situation or this reform. Two issues: One is the lack of speed with addressing this concern. Condominiums experienced a great boom. A lot of condominiums were built and during that time when many condominiums were built, many condominium owners didn’t receive adequate protection. Issues were raised by the government very slowly to provide adequate protection. That’s an issue or area of concern.", "The government has a responsibility to address and be flexible to the changing demographics and the changing realities, and when condominiums started increasing in terms of an option for people—right now, there are 1.3 million people living in condominiums. That’s the same size as an entire province; Saskatchewan and Manitoba are about the same size in population. So this is a serious demographic and it needs to receive some serious protection.", "The other last area I want to touch, just in closing, is that when the government consulted on this, the government failed to consult with actual condominium owners and instead consulted with a host of other experts in the field. But if you’re seeking to create a bill that protects the condominium owner and there’s only one member of that panel—and this is the fact—that could be considered to be associated with any condominium-owning association and the rest of the board was comprised of construction-side and developer side individuals, that doesn’t seem to me the appropriate way to set up a bill which is seeking to reform condominiums and protect condominium owners. It’s not the way to do it.", "So I ask the government that—you have a great opportunity now to provide real protection to condominium owners, to consumers. And it doesn’t have to be just condominium owners. If you reform Tarion, you could provide real protection to all homeowners." ],

It’s a very important bill, because we know that about one in 10 Ontarians lives in a condominium, and we know that over half of new builds in Ontario are condominiums. This legislation is in need of an overhaul, for sure.", "Let’s talk about what this bill will do. What will this bill actually do? It will increase protections for condo owners who are purchasing a condo. It will require condo managers to be licensed. It will create new governance requirements for condo boards. It will strengthen the financial stability of condo buildings. It will establish a modern, cost-effective dispute resolution system.", "I really want to emphasize in this debate that this legislation is based on over 2,200 recommendations made by, yes, condo owners, condo managers, developers and experts. Yes, the ministry does receive a number of complaints and inquiries a year about condo issues, and that’s why we’re bringing this forward again.", "Some of the concerns from consumers relate to an increase in condo fees, major financial decisions being made without an owner’s consent and courts being required to appoint an administrator to look after buildings in financial crisis. These are real, big issues that will be and can be addressed by this legislation. Some of these things, quite frankly, lead to declines in property values, and that’s not good. If we pass this legislation, we’ll have stronger consumer protection, a condo authority that would have oversight of the sector with quicker, lower-cost dispute resolutions than are currently available today, and instead of spending a lot of time in legal battles, there will be earlier opportunities for resolution.", "This is strong legislation that will protect consumers in Ontario." ],

He also mentioned, very importantly, that many of the operations that will result from this bill will be done through regulations, which, again, nobody in this House will have any scrutiny over.", "Where I take a bit of an exception here is this: This bill will create a new delegated administrative authority. This delegated authority will also have tribunal functions, which not all of them have, so this will be a licensing body as well as an adjudicative body. To have those functions wrapped up in a subordinate body of the Legislature that has no scrutiny over it, no oversight of it—I think we’re living in a bit of a dream world if we believe that we are going to achieve the results that we want to achieve of having expeditious, efficient, low-cost remedies to disputes. We won’t be able to actually look into what they’re doing. We won’t be able to see what the due process, what the rules of that tribunal will be.

I think the theme of where he was going with the criticism of this piece of legislation is that yes, there was consultation and that is good. Condo owners have wanted for a long time to be listened to by this government. You must remember that former member Rosario Marchese first made the introduction of these changes back in March 2007. This is a long-standing issue.", "It would appear that, as with a lot of pieces of legislation that come before this House, there’s a missed opportunity to make this legislation even stronger. It’s almost as if the legislation was crafted, and then they let the developers have a little go at it and cut out some of the more important pieces that would actually protect consumers who are condo owners.", "I think the other point that the member from Bramalea–Gore–Malton made which actually resonates with us on this side of the House, because we’ve seen this time and time again, is that too much of this legislation is left to regulation. You can’t blame us for having some trust issues with this government when legislation passes through this House and then the minister has carte blanche to change it. It actually negates this kind of debate. This should be an exercise in strengthening a piece of legislation. That has been the tradition of this Parliament. That has been a long-standing tradition of a democracy. When you leave too much to a minister just to take a red pen and cut out major components of a piece of legislation, then it is our responsibility, as representatives of our communities, to bring that to the floor of this Legislature. I think the member, being a lawyer, fully understands what that means." ],

About one in 10 Ontarians now live in condominiums. That’s 1.3 million people across the province of Ontario living in condos, and more than 50% of new homes that are being built in Ontario are condos. Currently, there are 700,000 condo units in Ontario, and 51,000 more are under construction, with many of these condos being built in my own riding of Davenport.", "Condos also represent about half of the new homes being built in this province, in a housing sector worth almost $45 billion and employing more than 300,000 Ontarians. The government received about 2,200 submissions through its consultation on the Condominium Act, so it was an extensively consulted piece of legislation. The existing Condominium Act was passed more than 16 years ago. Since then, we can agree that the condominium landscape in Ontario has changed drastically.", "That’s why it is important that we, as a government, are putting this act forward to protect the owners of condominiums; and it will improve and provide protection for Ontario’s 1.3 million condo owners. If passed, this legislation would increase protection for the condo owners and Ontarians purchasing a condo. It would require condominium managers to be licensed; create new governance requirements for condo boards, strengthening the financial sustainability of condo buildings; and establish a modern, cost-effective dispute resolution system.", "Mr. Speaker, I totally agree with the passage of this act.

I echo those same concerns, because many of the actual details around the mechanism of the tribunal are left to regulation. That’s concerning.", "I am encouraged, though, by the fact that the tribunal will have, in law, Auditor General oversight. But I’m also cognizant of the concern that was raised by my honourable colleague that perhaps we should also include—maybe I’ll take out the “perhaps”; we should also include oversight by the Ombudsman to provide real accountable and transparency. That’s one additional oversight piece that I think is important.", "I think in general, though, it is a step forward. It’s a great opportunity to provide real reform and real protections to consumers. Like we’ve said—and many people have all echoed this—condominiums are moving, more and more, to be a primary choice for many homeowners. If not the ultimate choice, it’s still the first choice, because it’s more affordable. Many people decide to move into a condominium first.", "Whether it’s a condominium or a townhouse or a home, one of the areas of reform that’s badly needed and this bill does not touch on is the reform of Tarion. We need stronger oversight and accountability into Tarion. It provides a warranty, but at this point in time people are questioning whether it’s really putting the consumers’ needs and their concerns as a priority, and that’s something we need to address." ],

When you were buying a condominium in the mid-1970s, you were taking a little bit of a risk back then. It was a little bit like the Wild West out there. I was fortunate; I got into a very good deal and everything worked out really well for me. But at the time, in the media—this would be the mid-1970s—the idea of a condominium was a fairly new concept and there were some horror stories out there. There were units that weren’t finished; there were builders that just took money and took off—all sorts of stories that we didn’t want to hear. But it was one of the best investments we ever made.", "It’s interesting to see now that even though it was a new way of living back then and one that a lot of people didn’t understand, over half of the homes that are built now in the province of Ontario are indeed condominiums. It’s interesting to also note that one in 10 people in Ontario lives in a condominium.", "I’m sharing my time today with a few people: the member from Northumberland–Quinte West, the member from Etobicoke–Lakeshore and the Associate Minister of Finance. Speaker, I thought I should mention that to you.", "The point I’m trying to make is that the Protecting Condominium Owners Act continues on in the way that this government and, I think, all three parties have determined over the years: We need to provide better protections. As we find out different things about how condominiums work and we know a lot more about them, we’re introducing more and more protection measures. This falls, I think, right in line with that, because if you look at some of the major points that are covered in here, it allows for improved and better dispute resolution. That’s something that I think we’d all like to see. Obviously, there are disputes that arise from time to time, and the establishment of a condominium authority in this regard is going to help an awful lot.", "It also provides increased customer protection for owners and for buyers of condominiums. Over the years, we found out that certain increased protections are needed, and sometimes you only find those things out as a result of experience, of going through them. When you introduce improvements like this, it’s a sign that this government and this House are indeed listening to the people who are coming forward with some of the problems that they’re facing.", "We’ve decided, also, as a part of this act, should it pass, that it would strengthen financial management rules for condominium corporations. That would help them prevent fraud within their own organizations. It would also help prevent mismanagement by the management companies themselves or by the boards themselves. The example that is used here is that it would prevent the condo corporation from finalizing major contracts unless they fulfilled certain procurement process requirements that are probably the sort of thing we’d all like to see. It’s a good example of good management, and it simply applies those concepts to the financial rules that condominium corporations must operate under.", "It’s going to make it easier for condo owners and boards to participate in and to vote at the meetings that are held from time to time. It’s going to make it much more user-friendly. I believe that if you’re just an individual owner who owns one unit in a building, it allows you to have your share of the power, your share of the influence, and make sure that your opinions are heard when decisions are made at the condominium.", "The thing I really like about this, too, is that we’re going to license condominium managers. This is something that I think has been lacking in the past. The proposed act would establish a separate piece of legislation that would allow us to put some discipline in the form of a delegated administrative authority to regulate condominium management and those firms that they work for. We would have a compulsory licensing system.", "If you’re a citizen member or you’re a volunteer member of a board, when you go out and hire somebody that is going to run probably one of the biggest investments in your life, you know that you can go to a licensing system and you know that that person has the credentials, has the authority, has the background, that they are going to do a very, very good job in protecting your investment and making sure that the place where you live is well run.", "Overall what this is going to do is improve protections for almost 1.5 million condo owners in the province of Ontario. It is a huge investment for a lot of people. Often it is the first investment they make, or sometimes it is the last investment they make. People buy condominiums when they’re young, and when they downsize they often go back to condominiums.", "It is the sort of thing that I think is going to protect a wide range of people in Ontario. I’d urge all members of the House to support it." ],

We’ve heard that over and over again. Our friend Rosario from the NDP had been preaching this for the eight years I was here prior. I think they recognize that with change and regulations there’s got to be some rules in place.", "Madame Speaker, I would say in general that we are moving in the right direction. This is something that, frankly, condo owners and condo tenants have been waiting for. I know we heard from the opposition that this government has been here 12 years, so let’s get it done. I’m hopeful that at the end of the day we will have that support from the opposition to make sure that we get this done.", "I just want to highlight a couple of the things during the process that got us here today and what the intent of the bill can be. There was some extensive—and I think we have heard this before but it is worth repeating—consultation and review for the Condominium Act; some 2,200 submissions, and it was varied, from owners to developers, managers and some industry experts. The review concluded that some things needed to be addressed: new laws and tools to increase consumer protection for condo owners and buyers, to improve on how condominiums are run and managed, because we heard over and over again, through that particular piece, that not all condominiums were managed in a standard way.", "It also means strengthening the financial sustainability of condominium buildings, because we want to make sure that when somebody buys a condominium, from a consumer protection piece, that roof that they buy to have over their head has some substantial credibility so that the roof will not leak, or when the roof needs to be replaced, there is enough money put aside to make sure that the roof gets replaced or the sidewalk gets paved so that we don’t slip and fall, and the grass gets cut.", "So Mr. Speaker—this has been difficult because I was saying “Madam Speaker” because there was a Madam Speaker, and now I’m saying “Mr. Speaker.” I think you’re trying to confuse us. But anyways, we’re here. So I just urge the opposition to support this. Let’s protect condominium owners, but also managers and corporations." ],

That percentage will continue to rise.", "In my community of Etobicoke–Lakeshore, as we speak, there are some 3,000 condominiums under construction or about to start construction, and many thousands more that will be built in the decade ahead. So in my community, this piece of legislation is something that has been awaited and is very important to many people. I, myself, am a condominium owner and resident, so I’m very grateful about the additional protections that this act will provide.", "There is nothing more important than the government being able to put in place protections that give people reassurance that their home, their enjoyment of their home, their way of life will be secure. This legislation goes a very long way to providing more protections for condominium residents. It was the result of very extensive consultation over 18 months, and I believe we’ve gotten it right.", "The ability to put in place a good dispute resolution mechanism for people is extraordinarily important. During my time as a city councillor, I was often brought into the fray when there were disputes between individuals and a condominium board. I, of course, wasn’t really in a position to assist them, but I was very sympathetic to what sometimes were lengthy, multi-year battles in court. That was not fair to individuals with legitimate concerns.", "This dispute resolution system will give quick, easy and affordable access to individuals to challenge a condominium board when they feel something is not being done properly or their rights aren’t being protected.", "There is also going to be important additional consumer protection for owners and buyers of a condominium, ensuring that there must be better disclosure by developers to condominium buyers when they purchase their unit as to what it is that they’re buying; better protections about hidden costs that might arise between the process of when you sign an agreement to buy a condo and when you actually take possession and close on it. Those are important provisions. The ability to ensure that there will be better fiscal management by a condominium board, better governance for condominium boards and better education for those volunteers who are elected to serve on condominium boards are all very important provisions of this act and the regulations that will flow from it.", "The ability to ensure that condo managers are licensed and that they’re held to some kind of standard—there are many great professional condominium management companies and individual property managers, but in the past, there have often been cases where there was quick turnover of condominium managers because it wasn’t really that professional of an organization or viewed as that professional of a profession. This will give it greater status and, I think, will attract people who are very committed to doing this job well. They will have the tools in place to do it well, but condominium residents and owners will also have a better ability to hold them to account when something isn’t done properly.", "This piece of legislation will provide significant help to condominium owners and residents that they did not have before. It will give you much greater peace of mind, if you’re a condominium owner or resident, that if there is a problem, there will be an easier mechanism to try to resolve it: more professional governance, more professional management and better fiscal management. It means that one in 10 Ontarians will be able to sleep more soundly in their homes every night, knowing this legislation is in place, if it is passed." ],

  "text" : [ "Thank you, Speaker. I’m pleased to join my colleagues to speak today about Bill 106, the Protecting Condominium Owners Act. As our cities continue to grow, we know that more and more people are choosing to live in condos. Over half of new homes being built in this province are condos. In fact, one in 10 Ontarians live in condos, and that number is surely to continue to rise in coming years.", "The existing Condominium Act was passed more than 16 years ago. Since then, the condominium landscape in Ontario has changed dramatically. Our government is committed to modernizing the existing rules to ensure that they are reflective of the realities that we see in the marketplace today. This act is an important step that our government is taking to ensure that Ontario’s 1.3 million condo dwellers have the protection they need.", "We know that buying a condo is a major milestone in many Ontarians’ lives and a major financial investment, and we know it’s important that the government take steps to protect condo owners’ investments. This is something we have heard from our consultations that we’ve done with many Ontarians. This legislation is based on over 2,200 submissions to the condo act consultation process. We developed this legislation in consultation with condo owners, condo managers, developers and experts.", "Our government knows there are a number of concerns and issues that condo owners face. Currently, the ministry averages over 1,000 complaints and inquiries a year on condo issues, ranging from owners surprised by increases in condo fees, major financial decisions being made without owners’ consent, and courts being required to appoint an administrator to look after buildings in financial crisis. All of these issues lead to a decline in property value.", "If passed, as my colleagues have said, the proposed legislation would increase protection for condo owners and Ontarians purchasing a condo; require condo managers to be licensed; create new governance requirements for condo boards; and strengthen the financial sustainability of condo buildings, as well as establish a modern, cost-effective dispute resolution system.", "The act would also create a new organization, a condominium authority that would have oversight of the sector. This new organization would provide quicker, lower-cost dispute resolution than what is available today.", "We want people to feel comfortable and protected in their homes. We don’t want them to have to worry about spending tens of thousands of dollars to resolve disputes. If this legislation is passed, all condo owners would have access to a dispute resolution process which will solve disputes in a fraction of the time and cost that currently exists.", "We also know that Ontarians have concerns about surprise costs in the buying process. The proposed legislation contains strong provisions to protect Ontarians at all stages of condominium ownership.", "The act has measures to prevent developers from charging surprise cost increases for condo owners. It also improves disclosure during the purchase of a condo.", "We are empowering condo owners, who can now feel confident their condo board will have clear governance guidelines and the proper training to deal with residents’ concerns in an open and accountable way.", "Mr. Speaker, reforming Ontario’s condominium laws was a key commitment in our 2015 budget. The 18-month consultation process and review of the Condominium Act is an excellent example of open government in action, a key platform of the Wynne government. I know this is a priority for Ontarians and I would definitely be encouraged if all members of this House, the opposition in particular, would support this very important bill, this very important piece of legislation and move this forward." ],

I think the Liberals have really outdone themselves; it’s 10 years too late, but we’re glad to finally see some changes. The last time there were amendments, there was a fraction of the condos that we have today. So it’s a chance to make some much-needed changes.", "Through my term here, I’ve been approached by many different groups looking for changes, asking for changes from this government—people who were tired of waiting. So right now, we certainly are supporting. We’re looking for a few amendments to the bill, but we would like to see it go through as well.", "The last time, in 2002 or 2003, there were 270,000 condos; there’s almost 10 times that today. For people purchasing a first home or condo unit, it’s probably their largest investment, so we want to make sure it’s protected. We want to make sure that costs are kept as low as possible so people can enjoy their home, but also be able to enjoy some of the other features that are in this great province.", "Right now, there are some issues. The condos are getting a little older now. They’re finding the funds aren’t there for the repairs because maybe not enough money was put aside or it wasn’t treated properly. This legislation is looking after some of those things. We look forward to moving on to committee." ],

Our member talked about that a number of times. Since then, there has been more falling glass. You can imagine that, walking down one of the streets here where all the condos are, and the glass is falling down because of shoddy construction. It’s incredible.", "It led to class-action lawsuits. Since then, again: more falling glass. It’s really amazing. Even though the falling-glass crisis was arguably what finally pressured this government into taking action on condo act reform, Bill 106—I want to be clear on this—will do nothing about falling glass. So don’t look up.", "There are currently very few limits on what developers can bury in a purchase agreement or in a condo declaration; for example, statements outlining what an individual owner is responsible for within their condo and what common elements the condo corporation is responsible for. This is something that I think should disturb all of us. The hidden costs, the weasel clauses can expose buyers to serious risks. Developers often promise one thing in a condo showroom and deliver something completely different. While developers are limited about what major changes they can make to individual units after purchase, they can grant themselves shocking freedom in what they can do." ],

It was a condominium. There were some issues. This goes back to the 1980s. We had some issues with some failing concrete, and we were levied with a fee. We were young, we didn’t have a lot of money back then, and we were levied with a fee of astronomical proportions, which it was very challenging to pay.", "This is why this piece of legislation is so incredibly important.

Over 50 members of this House have spoken to this bill.” Yet the members of the opposition will have been denied the opportunity to speak to the bill, because the Liberals are doing it in just little fits and starts. They barely clear their throat, and they move on to another speaker.", "This is a comprehensive piece of legislation. I applaud the minister for finally doing something about it. It’s 36 pages; some of the bills the Liberals bring out are three or four pages. We need to make sure we have adequate time to debate this bill, and then get it to committee so that we can amend it and make it the best possible piece of legislation that we can out of this House." ],

After initial start-up funding from the government, it would be financed solely by a fee charged to condo corporations. We understand that the estimated fee passed down to the owners is about $1 a month—this is what we’re led to believe. Now, when I hear that $1-a-month estimate, Speaker, it brings to mind past government estimates. I recall in 2009, when I was in the mayor’s chair in the city of North Bay, that the Green Energy Act was introduced and we were told it would only increase hydro fees 1% a year. We now know, of course, that they have turned into 10% a year. So when we hear that this is only going to raise your fee $1 a month, we’re a bit concerned. Of course, we also recall the government’s insistence that the gas plant cancellation would cost $40 million when it actually cost $1.1 billion. So we’re a little leery of estimates.", "Nonetheless, the condo authority will have the responsibility to administer the condominium authority tribunal, which would resolve disputes through case management, mediation and adjudication.", "The bill will create a separate licensing authority to administer licensing of condo managers. This will be done through a proposed new Condominium Management Services Act, which will create a compulsory licensing system for managers and management firms, creating a training and education program for managers, and establish a code of ethics for condo managers. The act would also set qualifications to be a licensed manager.", "The bill would amend the Ontario New Home Warranties Plan Act, so that most of the warranty protections available to buyers of new condos would also apply to certain condo conversion projects.", "This bill, in its aim, is to strengthen financial management by providing condo owners with more information about financial matters affecting their investment and more control over the changes.

Now, this bill also intends to improve how condos are run by requiring boards to provide regular information, updates to owners, and updating requirements for board meetings.", "The most recent condo legislation is, as you’ve heard several times today, from 1998.

My hometown is North Bay. As I said, the minister talked about one in 10 Ontarians living in a condo. Primarily we’re talking about the GTA, perhaps Ottawa, London and some other communities, but I will say that we have condos in North Bay. So my point here, the very point that I make, is that there is a vast difference. When you’ve got such an intense concentration of condos in the GTA or in some of the other large urban centres, this need for these managers with accreditations and training is extremely important and valuable, but the point I want to make is that we have issues in northern and rural Ontario, where there are some condos, that are very unique to owners outside of the GTA.", "I’m going to just give an example of some previous legislation that I think brings home this very point. Again, back in the day, when I was mayor of the city of North Bay, the strong communities act came across our desk. By the very title, you would think that this was going to be good for all communities, but again, it was a Toronto-centric problem that the government created a large solution for that ended up hurting others. This is what I want to bring to this condo change here: that we need to make certain that the rules that are put in place don’t adversely affect the small communities that have one or two condo buildings in their entire community.", "That strong communities act, for instance, acknowledged a very important issue about wetlands in Toronto. There really aren’t a lot of wetlands down around Bay Street and University Avenue. We understand that; we get that. So the solution was that any wetlands that are found in Ontario must not be sold and used for development, and we get that. That’s so important. That’s how we filter our water, through the wetlands, and we understand that it’s important. Except in the old days, in northern Ontario, you were allowed to build on a wetland if you created an equal-sized wetland elsewhere—very practical. It was a common practice and, in fact, it was our law. But this Toronto-centric solution that came across wiped out all that.", "As you’ve heard me say in this Legislature before, we now have a 112-acre, $40-million industrial park in North Bay that can no longer be built on. Sewer, water, roads, fire hydrants, high-speed Internet: It’s all there, but we can’t build on it, because a law was changed to solve an important problem in Toronto, but it was pan-Ontario, so the north got sucked into that vortex and it was one set of cookie cutter rules. My point is, let’s make sure that the legislation reflects the unique issues that affect condo owners in northern and rural Ontario. That’s the point I make with that.", "In 2012, the government began its Condominium Act review, which was a three-stage public engagement process aimed at modernizing the legislation. This was in response to growing concerns from condo owners and managers, again, primarily in the urban centres. The key issues identified in this review include governance, dispute resolution, financial management, consumer protection and condominium manager qualifications.", "A little bit of other background worth noting: The bill has the support of the Canadian Condominium Institute. Here’s an excerpt from their release—I like to look at a balanced approach to the discussion. The CCI is speaking about Bill 106, the Protecting Condominium Owners Act. They look at the changes in Bill 106, including “establishing mandatory licensing of condo managers and strengthening financial management rules for condo corporations to help prevent fraud and mismanagement.", "“The Ontario caucus of CCI, a national, independent, non-profit body dealing exclusively with condominium issues, has been among those pushing for legislative reform in Ontario for more than a decade. CCI members played an active role in the” consultations and the working panels over the last two and a half years.", "So, it truly was a red-letter day, especially for those in the urban centres, when the Minister of Government and Consumer Services did introduce the bill and it was given first reading and passed. The proposed legislation includes mandatory education for condominium directors.", "The current chair of the CCI stated, “The Canadian Condominium Institute has been front and centre in providing director education since 1982 and we anticipate that despite mandatory education being offered through a newly formed condo authority, CCI will continue to be a long-term source of ongoing training for directors.\"", "“The CCI ... caucus appreciates” the fact that “the government did not introduce a new Condominium Act” but amended the present one. These are comments I’m sharing from them. They look forward to the changes, among them, “off-budget spending whereby a condominium board would have to notify owners if it had proposed an expense exceeding the budgeted amount by more than a set margin.” Interesting.", "They believe that “transparent financial management is the foundation of a successful condominium corporation and community.” Of course, I would agree with a statement like that, thinking, of course, that that is also what you would look for from a government.", "Their legal firm, Gowlings, provided the analysis regarding the planned establishment of a new condominium authority and a new tribunal. They noted that the new condominium authority and tribunal “are required to be self-financed. Some of the financing is expected to be generated by the users who would be required to pay certain fees. The details of how these new entities would be financed have yet to be hashed out through” this legislation.", "I think that’s kind of one of the important aspects of being able to have a discussion in this Legislature and not truncate any discussion. It’s also important to be able to have these in committee to be able to discuss that at that point as well. We’re looking forward to a thoughtful and fulsome debate in the Legislature about the various aspects.", "“The condominium authority is also expected to be able to levy fees from all condominium owners. A number that seems to be floating around is the suggestion that condominium owners would pay $1 per unit, per month to finance this authority. Assuming ... there are 700,000 condominium units in Ontario,” we’re talking about “$8.4 million dollars” a year. “Just as a point of comparison, the budget for the Landlord and Tenant Board exceeds $30 million.... We may have a far way to go.”", "This is why I questioned earlier that estimate of a dollar. It’s fine to have a starting point, but I wouldn’t want anybody to take that figure literally to the bank.", "“It appears that the proposed Condominium Authority Tribunal has not been granted jurisdiction to rule over dispute between corporations and property managers. If the province is planning on creating such a specialized tribunal, it may have made sense to also grant it authority to rule over these kinds of disputes.”", "That’s why we have these debates. That’s why we don’t want to see these debates truncated. These are ideas that I’m truly hoping the government is noting and can comment on.", "Gowlings also had this to say regarding new requirements for condo directors: “Bill 106 proposes to impose mandatory training on all directors. It is not clear at this stage what training would be required, who would provide such training and how frequently such training would have to take place. It is not clear either whether individuals who have already attended” CCI’s director’s courses “would be exempt from this ... requirement.”", "“Directors would” also “be required to proceed with a certain level of disclosure. We will have to wait for the adoption of regulations to know exactly what directors will be required to disclose.”", "Now, Gowlings also speaks about changes to repair and maintenance obligations: “One of the most important proposed changes to the legislation, in my view, is that the responsibility to repair a unit after damage will no longer fall to the corporation (unless the declaration provides otherwise). The responsibility and the cost of repairing units after damage would be shifted back on to each owner.", "“In my view, this is a welcomed change, which will simplify greatly many matters including issues surrounding insurance.”", "Others may not see it that way.", "This is why we need these 20-minute opportunities to bring this out, so we can have an intelligent discourse back and forth to talk about these various points. I’m hoping in the two- minute hits that we’ll hear some thoughts about these.", "The proposed act does not appear to make this change retroactive—another point that needs to be debated. It may be a problem as many corporations have had their declaration drafted under the current or prior legislation. So for this reason, many of the existing declarations imposed on corporations the obligation to repair a unit after damage. At the time of incorporation, this language was simply reflecting the legislation in place. By not making the proposed change retroactive, many existing corporations may still be responsible to repair old units after the damage simply because their old declaration says so.", "I’ve also seen concerns expressed by some about whether all of this legislation will ever be proclaimed into force or whether some of the regulations necessary to give teeth will ever be enacted. It’s always a concern. We’ve seen other bills come, get debated, get through and get passed but never be enacted. There are still many on the books, and that’s a concern. As I said, there’s precedent for that. It’s worth noting that it’s a concern that has been expressed amongst stakeholders, and the government should be aware of it.", "In conclusion, it has taken a long time to introduce this legislation, but I’m hoping the government has indeed used their time effectively, put forward legislation that will fix the problems and, hopefully, they’ll listen to all of us as we take our time to bring new ideas, question some of it and use that effectively, Speaker. I thank you very much for the opportunity to rise." ],

His voice would have added so much context and history to this debate.", "Speaker, I want to talk a little bit about condos in general, because they are an up-and-coming way of optional real estate. The member from Timiskaming–Cochrane talked about his daughter and that her first purchase was a condo. A lot of the younger generation are opting to purchase condos, and the reasons include that they probably don’t have to do maintenance outside, landscaping and snow shovelling, because they probably have a busy career, a busy life, and doing those things takes time out of a lifestyle. So it’s a lifestyle choice, perhaps, as well as an affordability option. A condo apartment or a condo townhome may not be as expensive as a single-family dwelling, especially in certain communities and cities in Ontario where it can certainly add up for a single-family dwelling. We know Toronto is one of those communities.", "The other sector of society that purchases condos, I find, that is up and coming is seniors. Being the seniors critic, that’s one thing that they’re in the market for, for different reasons perhaps. They want to downsize from a larger home. They’re empty-nesters now; the kids have left home, thank goodness, if you’re lucky enough for that to happen. So you’re looking at downsizing, and as a senior, you may not be physically able to maintain the snow shovelling. As a mature person, it’s hard enough to be shovelling that heavy snow off your driveway. So they could be doing it for that reason. They also maybe want to have one-level condos so that they don’t have to climb up and down stairs.", "I’m always in the market for real estate; we’re always looking, seeing what options are out there. This summer we actually looked at a couple of condominium units, and I have to say, it’s certainly a difference from being a homeowner, where you have that freedom of a yard and you’re not side by side with someone or in an apartment building.", "A little background on condos that we’ve done some work on—and the member from Bramalea–Gore–Malton mentioned it earlier: About 1.3 million Ontarians live in condos, and half of all new homes being built are condos. That’s huge, Speaker. Half of all new developments are condominiums, so that is saying something in the real estate market.", "I will give the government some credit for finally bringing this bill forward, because we have to recognize that there needs to be some regulation around this property purchase. We can’t just let that have free rein when people end up being the victims of bad developments, of bad board management and condo managers. So good for the government to do that.", "Similar to a municipal government, condo residents pay taxes—they translate them into condo fees—and they abide by condo bylaws. Condo governance is basically a fourth level of government for these people, and the condo act is like a constitution and a charter of rights for that level of a quasi-government. So really, they’re already governing themselves, and I think this bill gives those parameters and a recourse for condo owners to go to tribunals and the condo authority in order to hear their concerns.", "A little bit of history that happened as to why we’re here today: The NDP pushed for condo act reform against the government’s reluctance, and this government was reluctant. They were very reluctant and resistant to put this in; yes, they were. I know some may shake their heads, and that’s okay. Everybody has a difference of opinion. But really, there was reluctance. Rosario Marchese was an advocate for this bill and reform for a long time. It would have been better if the government had acted quicker, but here we are today, so we’ll give them credit for doing that today.", "As the condo boom exploded in Rosario’s Trinity–Spadina riding, he noticed that despite the condo act, many condo owners basically lived in the Wild West. We had the condo act but it wasn’t up to date. It wasn’t meeting the current needs of the market. Basically, this was a world of corrupt condo managers, rigged repair contracts, unexplained maintenance fee increases, abusive and unresponsive boards that refused to be open and accountable to the owners whose money they spent, unmaintained common areas that were falling apart, shoddy condo construction and unethical developers who ripped off consumers by burying nasty surprises in contracts’ fine print. This is not an over-exaggeration. This was actually happening, so truly, the description of this being the Wild West is accurate. It’s absolutely accurate, and I think people would agree.", "For condo owners, the condo act wasn’t helping them. It wasn’t anything that could assist them in what they were going through in today’s reality. Their only remedy was the courts, for which people, of course—not everybody can afford that. It is very expensive. First of all, you should actually talk to the person who you may want to take to court and try to resolve it within the condo corporation. But if that’s not to your satisfaction and you still feel that you’re not getting justice, you’re not getting that remedy, you have to seriously think about whether, financially, you can afford to take the condo board or the condo corporation to court. Probably a lot of condo owners opted out of that because they couldn’t afford that expense. We know the condo act today will at least help those two areas. They can take the condo board to a tribunal and at least try to resolve, hopefully, smaller issues that they would have normally had to go to court about and take that money out of their own pocket.", "This kind of whole mantra of what was happening around the condo scene led Rosario to table four bills. He started doing this back in March 2007 to try to reform the condo act. His fourth bill was Bill 72. It was tabled in 2012, and each time—again, a difference of opinion. We believe the government kind of stalled the progress on reform, saying that the existing system was adequate, that it was working ok.", "Sometimes things kind of evolve in a bad way, and this is an example. In 2012, as the member from Niagara and the member from Kitchener–Waterloo talked about earlier, there was glass falling from high-rise buildings without any kind of warning, just out of the blue. You could be walking to work, or at 3 o’clock in the morning, or rush-hour traffic—rush-hour traffic in Toronto can be sidewalk rush-hour traffic; it doesn’t have to be roadside. There were injuries. Thank goodness there were no serious, major injuries, but my goodness, imagine the outcome if there were more escalation of injuries happening. Headlines were being made, and then I think the government finally woke up and decided that, “You know what? This is a breaking point for us, and we’re going to have to look at condo reform.”", "So what they did was they started out by starting a three-stage process. The government did an independent review, a public policy forum, and the review was divided into three stages. In the first stage, they collected and summarized stakeholder input into findings—a report outlining the issues and problems facing condo stakeholders. That’s fair enough—a good first step. The second stage was by far probably one of the most important stages. In this stage, the stakeholders’ input was filtered through a hand-picked expert panel which made recommendations to the government. The recommendations are, of course, the basis for Bill 106. Finally, the third stage of the review—the barely noticed third stage—summarized reactions to the stage 2 report from various stakeholders who were lucky enough to receive an invitation to comment or who managed to spot the meeting and announcements that were quietly posted in late 2013 and early 2014. The reports offered no additional recommendations to the government as a result of these reactions.", "So that’s a little bit of the history of how we got here today. It’s really important to know that because it kind of gives us the context of the importance and the validity of why we need this act.", "The other thing I wanted to talk about was some of the messages that we believe should be given out to the public. I hope there are condo owners watching today. It would have been exciting, too, to let condo owners know that this act was coming to fruition in the House for debate, because I know that if I were a condo owner and had heard all these awful reports about condo fees rising, shabby workmanship, mismanagement of condo boards, mismanaged condo managers, as a condo owner, I would be in tune to listening to what’s going to be in this bill, and most importantly, sometimes, what’s not going to be in this bill.", "We’ve been pushing hard for needed reforms, obviously, with regard to this. It’s been about eight years. Eight years, eight consumer ministers and two Premiers later, we finally have the bill.", "The bill includes important and much-needed reforms to condo board governance and finance. Condo owners will benefit from greater training and assistance for condo board directors. Owners will have more power to see important corporation documents, to requisition meetings and to ensure that large expenditures do not go without consultation and notification of owners. That’s really important.", "Maybe this is part of the government’s plan with regard to the condo authority: educating real estate agents and educating condo owners and purchasers. As the member from Timiskaming–Cochrane said, his daughter bought her first condo, and reading that real estate contract and understanding what they’re getting into is very complicated.", "We need to inform real estate agents and condo owners and educate them, because this appears to be an up-and-coming market, and it’s going to be alive and well for many, many years. If we’re going to do it, we might as well start with this at ground level. We’re talking about regulating and changing this bill and reforming the Condominium Act. Let’s talk about education and get it right. Start the education with the new reform act. This is a great opportunity to do that.", "The NDP has long supported reforms, and it is good that the government is finally acknowledging that we need them. What is in this bill is reasonably good, but there are some things in this bill—and two particular areas that we’re concerned about that are not in the bill. The bill excludes disputes involving condo managers and developers, and that leaves many condo owners and buyers without adequate protections. There is a gap in this condo reform bill. It’s a good first start. There are going to be some protections that condo owners have never had before, so again, we give credit to the government for that.", "The other piece of this is the condo authority. Their effectiveness in this body of—not regulation, but being in charge of condo owners—the condo authority: We don’t really know what their powers will be, what their mandate is or what their duties entail, because it’s all going to be up to regulatory procedures and it won’t come back to this House. We won’t have any say in what’s going on.", "Sometimes I think modelling the condo authority with boards that were already in existence for many, many years—my background is in insurance, so I think about RIBO, the Registered Insurance Brokers of Ontario. Previously I was a broker; I no longer am. You can’t hold a licence in the Legislature, by the way, and be an MPP. It’s kind of a conflict, apparently.", "Anyway, that’s a great organization. When I was a broker, we were supposed to have testing once a year. We had courses so that we were up to date when things changed. If we’re going to do that condo authority and have a system or some kind of protocol, let’s look at some organizations that actually have huge memberships and have those rules already in place, so that members continue to be educated as to how they report things.", "Before I forget, I do want to give kudos to the government for setting this up right from the get-go. It says here that what happens is that the Lieutenant Governor in Council is to “designate a not-for-profit corporation as the condominium authority,” and the condo authority will be delegated administrative authority bound by the governance and accountability provisions in an administrative agreement with the crown and subject to oversight of the Auditor General. That is great. Right from the beginning we’re involving the Auditor General because we don’t want to get into financial issues and arguments about the condo authority, condo owners and the board. I was really impressed to see that.", "Some of the stakeholders’ responses—I just want to mention one. Condo owners’ advocate Anne-Marie Ambert manages the Condo Information Centre, so there are resources that the condo authority can obviously draw upon in order to get some expertise. People have been doing this for a while.", "What this Condo Information Centre does is, it collects reports of condo mismanagement and other owner complaints. That’s an important resource, because you can actually learn a lot from the reports that have been kept with regard to mismanagement and owner complaints in order to formulate the condo authority and what kind of education they should dispense to the board and condo owners.", "She also served on the review’s expert panel. She is largely very supportive of the changes to Bill 106, but says many protections are still missing from the bill, and includes a few of them. Again, this is a stakeholder that was involved in the process, so I hope the government will take her suggestions under consideration.", "Inadequate checks on unexplained large surpluses and inadequate owner control over large expenditures: When we talk about any kind of real estate, everyone has a financial interest in that. When you are a condo owner, the condo board is in charge of that money. They need to be held accountable, and condo owners need to know that there’s adequate checks and balances of how they’re going to be trusted with their money. Because, in the end, the negative result comes back on them with condo fees skyrocketing if they have to actually have repairs done.", "More transparency needed for contract procurement, including knowing the names of bidders in order to discourage bid-rigging: That’s common sense. We want to make sure that anybody who puts in their bid is the most competitive bid, is the best-qualified for the work, so that you as a condo owner know there’s not going to be any kind of hanky-panky going on.", "Poor protections against shoddy construction: We already mentioned that.", "There’s no framework outlining the proper role of condo lawyers paid by condo owners but hired by condo boards often to fight against condo owners. That’s a little bit of a conflict.", "Those are some of her suggestions. I think, in general, though, there was good work done on this bill. We’ve talked about some of the gaps that are in there that we are concerned about—not having developers and condo managers in that tribunal dispute process. Maybe we’ll get there one day as this evolves into another phase of condo ownership.", "Thank you for allowing me to have the time to debate. I know many members in our caucus here are very excited to debate this bill, because it is a big bill. I hope this government will see fit not to have comments about “We’ve debated this eight hours.” That’s not the point. We should be able to debate this bill as long as people have a voice in this House and want to contribute to that debate. Everyone’s opinion is valid. Everyone’s opinion is important. When you start shutting down voices—maybe you’ve heard the message over and over again, but guess what? Mr. Marchese gave that message over and over and over again and now we’re finally listening to it. That’s really what I want to also put out there, Speaker.", "I encourage every member to debate this bill. Get your voice out there. It doesn’t matter if the member before spoke on the same thing. We need to make sure we effect change, and that’s with our voices and bringing them from our ridings through this House." ],

These condominiums are popping up everywhere, and it’s amazing to me—considering how many members that the government has in the GTA and specifically here in downtown Toronto, where all of these condo buildings are popping up—that it has taken this long to get to this point, where we actually have a condo act, or perhaps the Rosario Marchese act.", "You know what? We need this legislation in the GTA in particular because all of the other different acts that are in place—and I think a previous speaker mentioned five different acts in place—don’t really touch on condo owners. This is an important segment of the population here in the GTA that now lives in condominiums. They need to have some protection when it comes to their new living arrangement in a condo.

Ontario homebuyers are supposedly protected against shoddy construction by Tarion Warranty Corp., a private corporation established under the Ontario New Homes Warranty Plan Act. The act requires Tarion to maintain a builders’ registration, enforce building warranties, and make sure new homes are built to building code and to a decent standard of workmanship. If the builder doesn’t honour that warranty, then Tarion is required to pay for those repairs.", "Here’s some of the stuff that’s not happening. Tarion is controlled by the same development industry it is supposed to regulate. So when things go wrong and Tarion receives complaints about shoddy construction from homebuyers, Tarion has a powerful interest in taking the side of the developer over the consumer. It seems that Tarion is far more interested in collecting money from the homebuyers than in honouring their claims.", "Accordingly, in a report in 2014, Tarion has built up a huge surplus that is now—listen to this, because I know that you Liberals are interested in this—nearly half a billion dollars. That is more than twice its anticipated claimed liabilities and nearly 100 times greater than the amount in claims it actually paid out last year.", "While Tarion does not like spending money paying out consumers’ claims, it does spend a lot of money hiring lawyers to fight the consumers when they have appeals or denials of those claims to the Licence Appeal Tribunal. According to Canadians for Properly Built Homes, consumers are outgunned by Tarion, the builders and the lawyers." ],

I think we here around the House this afternoon all agree that home owning is a very big investment for many, and those that are getting into the market really need to do their homework before they buy a home. Condos are just, I think, a little bit more tricky when it comes to looking at the legislation.", "I’m glad that our government is taking firm action to protect the home and condo owners’ investments. The proposed act would set extra safeguards to protect condo owners and buyers and help them to make those informed decisions. It will require developers to give condo buyers a copy of an easy-to-read guide to condominium living at the time of the sale: very, very important for first-time buyers.

We receive somewhere around 100,000 newcomers from around the world. Recently I attended a citizenship ceremony at the CNE, where we welcomed 56 newcomers, new citizens, from 18 different countries. They happen to choose Ontario because it’s a good place to live. Many of them will need a place to live and many of them are making that contribution, buying up a property here in Ontario, and a condominium is definitely a good option for their investment.

If you remember, years back, when we introduced the greenbelt plan, the reason for it was that we’ve got to stop urban sprawl.

It’s an action that continues to dominate farm discussions and barbecues over the summer.", "Briefly, my two questions were: Firstly, to the Minister of Agriculture, your regs question the integrity of consulting agronomists, disqualifying those who work with the seed trade. Where are you going to find sufficient crop advisers who are not associated with Ontario’s seed trade sector?", "Secondly, Minister, why would you, as Ontario’s Minister of Agriculture, regulate a seed itself as a pesticide?", "The reason for my dissatisfaction is that, in my view, this wasn’t enough time for a fulsome answer to what I consider a detailed technical issue.", "Question number one derives from published criteria for professional advisers under the auspices of both the Ministry of the Environment and the Ministry of Agriculture. So, beginning on August 31, 2017, the regs require what’s called a professional pest adviser to be independent. To qualify at that time, they cannot derive a financial benefit from a person, including a business corporation, manufacturing or selling a class 12 pesticide. As well, to be contracted as an adviser, one must be recognized as a certified crop adviser certified by the American Society of Agronomy and be a member in good standing of the Ontario Certified Crop Advisor Association, and must be registered as a member—for example, a professional agrologist—under the Ontario Institute of Professional Agrologists Act, 2013, with a field of practice relating to pest control and the production, processing and protection of agricultural, horticultural and related products and supplies.", "I mentioned, in my question, a statement from Peggy Brekveld, a Thunder Bay farmer and vice-president of the OFA, who charged that the regulations are unworkable, saying, “We will be required to have a certified crop adviser inspect our field ... there’s only about 100 CCAs that are qualified to do these inspections.” She indicated that farmers in northwestern Ontario might have trouble finding an inspector.", "The 28,000-member Grain Farmers of Ontario have been forced by this government to go to court to seek an immediate stay on the implementation of these regulations.", "In its May 2015 posted amendments to this regulation, 63/09, the Ontario Federation of Agriculture stated that with regard to subsection 8.2(4), they questioned the basis on which the Ministry of the Environment questions the integrity of consulting agronomists. Many engineers, accountants, dentists, lawyers and other certified professionals provide advice to clients despite being employed by or affiliated with a larger firm. Again, they indicated that the numbers would be severely limited, certainly not sufficient to conduct pest assessments required by these regulations.", "Now, my second question, Speaker: Just to reiterate, the term “seed” is defined within the amendments as “a seed that, as a result of being treated, is coated with or contains one or more pesticides.” However, subsection 8.1 of the regulation indicates that all treated corn and soybean seeds are a class 12 pesticide.", "Again, Canada’s Seeds Act defines a seed as “any plant part of any species belonging to the plant kingdom, represented, sold or used to grow a plant.” Neonic pesticides are not species belonging to the plant kingdom. So there is some confusion here and it’s puzzling.", "I ask the question again: Why do these regulations take a seed and characterize a seed and define it as a pesticide? It’s not a pesticide. It’s a seed." ],

Without pollinators, much of the food we eat and the natural habitats we enjoy would not exist. So to that end and with the support of Premier Kathleen Wynne, as outlined in her mandate letter to the Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, the Honourable Jeff Leal, we are working with our partners in the agricultural sector to reduce the use of neonicotinoid-treated seeds.", "Our government released the regulatory amendments to the use of neonic-treated seeds based on a precautionary approach. It has been over a year since we announced our intention to move to regulate neonics, and many months of consultations that began in December 2014. Throughout the process, the minister made it very clear that any changes would be based on four key principles and with input from the agricultural community. Now, these principles are that all producers be allowed to access treated seeds where there is a demonstrated need, that the draft regulation will be implemented over time, that testing for pests will be workable for producers, and that stakeholders in the agricultural community will be engaged in helping develop the appropriate audit procedures.", "Starting on July 1, 2015, Ontario did move to restrict the sale and use of neonic-treated corn and soybean seed to improve the health of bees, other pollinators and the environment in general. The new requirements support the government of Ontario’s target to reduce the number of acres that are planted with neonic-treated corn and soybean seeds by 80% by the year 2017. Throughout the implementation process, OMAFRA and MOECC staff have been travelling across the province to deliver information and seek input on the regulation. OMAFRA has hosted a number of information sessions, including events for the agricultural industry and farm leaders. The ministries are committed to continuing this outreach and working with the farming community to address any challenges or questions they may have during this implementation period.", "The regulation is but one piece in our very broad Pollinator Health Strategy. We all have a responsibility to move forward with an approach that protects pollinators but supports the continued growth of Ontario’s agricultural sector. We’ve taken an important first step toward that goal by developing a regulation to reduce the number of acres that are planted with neonic-treated corn and soybean seed.", "As we all know, the declining health and population of bees and wild pollinators is very concerning not only in our province, but globally. Many other provinces, states and countries are also concerned about the decreasing health in population of bees and pollinators and are seeking appropriate strategies to address that. While Ontario has been a world leader, this concern has resulted in many other jurisdictions taking action to protect pollinators." ],

There’s never a single quick and easy fix to a complex problem such as this, and that’s why it is so important that we approach this strategy holistically, to understand all of the contributing factors and develop a plan which addresses them.", "Our broader pollinator health action plan will identify steps to address other key stressors: climate change and weather, diseases, pests, pathogens, habitat care and nutrition. It will take collaboration and innovative thought from all Ontarians to help us reach this goal, a goal that benefits everyone across the province. We will continue to work on the comprehensive pollinator health strategy to strengthen pollinator health and to ensure healthy ecosystems, a productive agricultural sector and a very strong economy.", "In closing, Speaker, I’d like to say that the agricultural community in Ontario has a history of modernizing and adapting to changes, and we will continue to do so together. In short, we will understand that all ag producers will have access to treated corn, treated seeds, where they’re needed, and that these regulations will be phased in in a responsible manner." ],

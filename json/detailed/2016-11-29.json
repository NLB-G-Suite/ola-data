  "text" : [ "I’m very excited, in my capacity as the Attorney General for the province, to speak today on third reading on the proposed All Families Are Equal Act, 2016.", "Speaker, this bill would have not been possible without the support and inspiration of many people who have been actively working on this issue. I do want to acknowledge a few people, such as Jennifer, Kirsti, Ruby and Cy Mathers McHenry; Sheila and Justin McHenry; Rachel Epstein, Andy Inkster and Joanna Radbord; Donna McDonagh, Julia Gruson-Wood; Emery Potter and Goldie Gruson-Potter.", "Speaker, people in Ontario value diversity and equality. In Ontario, we believe that everyone should be treated equally no matter their race, creed, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression. That’s why all parents and their kids need to be treated equally under the law.", "Whatever shape a family takes, the most important thing is that children grow up knowing that they have the love and guidance of their parents, a strong and stable place to call home, and certainty about whom their parents are.", "I wanted to take a moment to go over why our government introduced this bill and why it is so important that this bill passes as soon as possible. Members of the LGBTQ2+ community must have the same rights as their heterosexual peers: the right to love and marry the person of their choosing, and the right to start and raise a family.", "As you may recall from my previous statements in the House, Speaker, the law governing the legal status of a child’s parents at birth has not been substantially changed in Ontario in nearly 40 years. A lot has changed since then. In the year 2016, there’s no one way to start and raise a family. Family structures are more diverse.", "Right now, under the law, there are extra burdens placed on certain parents who use assistance to have children. LGBTQ2+ parents often have to spend time and money to be legally recognized as their children’s parents. I’ve heard that this experience can be painful and humiliating for families. That’s not fair and it’s not right. Having a child should be a wonderful time, not a time filled with uncertainty and anxiety.", "Speaker, it is not fair to these families that they have to spend their time and their hard-earned money to be legally recognized as their child’s parents. The reality is that our province’s parentage laws are behind the times and do not reflect the diverse, open and LGBTQ2+-proud province that we are.", "Let me recap what we are proposing in this legislation if it passes the House. Passing the All Families Are Equal Act would update our laws so that all kids are treated equally, by recognizing the legal status of their parents no matter if their parents are LGBTQ2+ or straight, and no matter if they were conceived with or without assistance. It would not require them to go to court and spend money on lawyers.", "If passed, the bill would also allow parents who use a surrogate to have a child to be legally recognized as parents without having to go to court, as long as they have written agreement with the surrogate and have all received legal advice. To help protect the rights of surrogates, this bill, if passed, would also require the surrogate to confirm that she is still okay with giving up the child after it is born.", "To support families where a parent chooses to freeze their eggs or sperm when facing a terminal illness, we are also proposing that a court be able to recognize a deceased person as a parent if the surviving parent decides to conceive a child after the death of their spouse or partner.", "In recognition of co-parents and multi-parent families, we are proposing to simplify the process of birth registration so that up to four people could be recognized as parents of a child—regardless of how they were conceived—without having to spend time and money going to the courts.", "In order to accomplish all of these things, this bill would amend 41 separate acts.", "I believe this bill responds to key priorities of our government: to make everyday life easier for Ontarians, to remove unnecessary burdens and costs, and to create a fair society for all.", "Speaker, the All Families Are Equal Act, if passed, would amend Ontario’s parentage laws to have gender-neutral language, wherever possible, as well. We’re doing this to make the law as inclusive as possible while recognizing that some families don’t use “mom” and “dad.” I want to be clear, however, that people can still choose to use the terms “mother” or “father” on their child’s birth certificate; to suggest otherwise is false. If this bill passes, people would also have the option of choosing the term “parent” on their child’s birth certificate.", "I would also like to take a few moments to thank the many people who have worked very hard to make the All Families Are Equal Act possible. I know there has been a lot of emotion that has been involved. We are talking about families and we are talking about children, which is something that I know we all recognize in this Legislature and across the province.", "This bill has been about inclusion. This bill has been about equality. It is about ensuring that all parents, regardless of their background, reflecting the diversity of our province, are able to care and provide love for their children the way we always, always have done. I think that is exciting. It is highly emotional to know that we are taking this very important step to ensure that we’re recognizing and bringing within the legal framework all families in our province with this beautiful diversity, and that we’re not requiring parents to take any additional extra steps to be recognized as parents; they will be parents by way of right, as a result of these changes, if this legislation passes.", "I would first like to recognize Jennifer and Kirsti Mathers McHenry and their children, Cy and Ruby. I believe Cy and Ruby finally made it into the House for the first time. They’re waving at us right now. We want to welcome them both. Give them a big round of applause.", "It’s always good to see little children in the House, Speaker. I think we should have kids in the House more often.", "We worked very closely with Jennifer and Kirsti as we developed the bill, and I want to personally thank them. I would say that I think, during the course of the work we were doing, we became friends. We had some very, at times, tough conversations, at times emotional conversations, but—at least I can speak for myself, Speaker—I’m a better person for it, because I did learn a lot from both of them. I want to thank them for their attention, their love and their care that they gave to this bill.", "Both of these women shared their very intense and deep personal stories with Ontarians in this Legislature, the legislative committee and with the media. It’s not easy to share your own personal story in such detail, and they both did that, and they did that for the sole purpose of moving public policy forward in our province, and to make sure that other moms and other dads and other families don’t have to go through the hurdles that they had to go through as they were having and raising these two beautiful children of theirs, Cy and Ruby.", "I also would be remiss if I did not recognize the member from Parkdale–High Park for her advocacy and leadership on this very important issue. I want to thank her personally for the passion she brings. The member and I have now had the opportunity to work on many bills together, and it has always been a great delight. The last time, with one of the bills we worked on, I said great things about the member, which I stand by. I found myself mentioned in her re-election campaign material, which is totally fine. I hope she will say some nice things so I can quote her in my materials too.", "It just goes to show, Speaker, that despite what people see on camera during question period, actually members across the aisle do work together, with each other, because we’re all driven by the same purpose every single day, which is to make our province a better place to live. So we probably agree more than disagree, and this bill is a great example of that kind of agreement, that kind of unison in voices in making sure that we move forward with a very fundamental human rights issue. I thank the member for all her work, as well as many other individuals and organizations who participated in the formation of this bill over the past few months. And of course I want to thank the members of the Standing Committee on Social Policy for their hard work on this bill as well.", "Speaker, I don’t plan to talk too long, so I want to make some concluding remarks, and that is to say that this piece of legislation, the All Families Are Equal Act, would help ensure that all children are treated equally by recognizing the legal status of their parents, no matter if their parents are LGBTQ2+ or straight or if they are conceived with or without assistance. Our government is calling on every single member of provincial Parliament to vote in support of this bill. It is important for all members of this Legislature, new and old, to show their support for the LGBTQ2+ community and the values of diversity and equality that are so important to Ontario by voting for this bill. We want this important piece of legislation to pass as quickly as possible, which is why the government will not be putting up any more speakers.", "Thank you, Speaker, for the time, and I look forward to hearing the comments of other members." ],

  "text" : [ "It’s important that we are engaged in this discussion, in this debate on Bill 28, for I feel that it has not been adequately examined in the full details. So I do want to offer some comments during this morning’s debate.", "I’ll start by saying that Bill 28 does play an important role in updating Ontario’s laws pertaining to parentage so that they better reflect society’s views on same-sex marriages and the use of new reproductive technologies. It is important that our legislation and our justice system are updated to accommodate these changes in the evolution of societal views and in improvements in technology which enable new circumstances to come into play. Ensuring that same-sex couples and parents who use reproductive technologies are able to be legally recognized as parents without additional hurdles and bureaucracy is an important step in ensuring that all people are treated equally under the law.", "I believe that these changes within Bill 28 are wholly justifiable updates to our existing legislation. I find no reason to oppose their approval and am supportive of them. If these changes made up the bill in its entirety, I believe that the Liberal government would have had full support, not only from this Legislature but also from the vast majority of people in Ontario.", "However, Bill 28 does more than simply update our laws. It also extends our laws into some unknown and uncharted areas, with consequences unseen. It permits four—or in some cases more than four—people to become parents of a child. It does this while providing no explanation as to the problem this aspect of the legislation is meant to solve. We have not seen or had the opportunity to examine any studies, any empirical evidence of just what consequences may result from that recognition. Due to the fact that no real objective problem had been identified and that no objective explanation has been put forward, this aspect of Bill 28 has been opposed by many members of the public, from very diverse political and cultural backgrounds. This public confusion is a symptom of the Liberal government’s haste to push Bill 28 through the Legislature and the refusal to spend any time evaluating the effects and consequences such legislation may have.", "Because of the emotional nature of Bill 28, it would seem imperative that the government ensure that it be properly communicated and justified, not only to the Legislature, who is tasked with approving it, but to the people of Ontario, whom such legislation will ultimately affect.", "What is also worrisome, Speaker, is that this obvious expedience has caused the government to be negligent, I would say, in their task to ensure that the bill is complete and that safeguards exist to ensure its functionality. By putting so much stock into our judicial system to protect the best interests of children, the government has ignored our own responsibility as legislators to craft effective legislation and uphold our responsibilities to protect the children. It seems that rather than allowing the Legislature to ensure that the proper safeguards and functionality are in place, and that unknown consequences are evaluated, the government would rather quickly throw the burden onto the court system rather than examine these issues ourselves.", "Reasonable amendments were proposed at committee to place safeguards into the bill that would close up areas of uncertainty and ensure effective functionality. These amendments included an addition which would ensure that children born through reproductive technologies would be able to access the relevant medical histories of their biological parents in order to ensure they could take part in effective health planning for their future. This health care information is crucial for any person who wishes to understand potential health issues passed down to them by their parents and is a reasonable method to address a potential issue caused by modern assisted reproductive technologies. This amendment was ruled out of order, and it highlights a perfect example of how the government has not taken the appropriate time to deliberate and review Bill 28 and come to a full understanding of the unanswered questions and potential issues this legislation may pose.", "An amendment was also introduced to put a reasonable safeguard on the words “mother” and “father” by ensuring that they would remain as options on government forms such as birth certificates, alongside the option of “parent,” as it is changed in Bill 28. That amendment was voted down by the government and the third party. That amendment was offered up in a response to the government claims that this terminology of “parent” and the terminology of “mother” and “father” would not be removed. We put that amendment in to safeguard its continued use, and it was voted down. It has caused some public opposition to this bill, that the threat of these identities, “mother” and “father,” may be deconstructed and eliminated in subsequent regulations.", "However, rather than ensuring all parents were accommodated in this legislation, it seems the priority was yet again to rush the bill through the Legislature without fully evaluating the consequences. The arguments that were made against this reasonable amendment, as well as the treatment of some of the deputants who were supportive of the amendment, was shameful, to say the least. The people of Ontario who come to this Legislature and to our committees ought never to be subjected to ridicule and malice from those who are elected and charged to listen to their concerns.", "It is true that there are aspects of Bill 28 that are fully appropriate and changes that need to take place to bring our parentage laws up to speed with new technology options and social views. For those changes alone, the bill, in many ways, is supportable. However, we did fight for reasonable amendments and safeguards to ensure that unforeseen consequences of Bill 28 could be minimized or mitigated, because it was obvious that questions and risks were not being fully investigated or examined.", "The NDP and the government showed no intention to ensure that all views, questions and people were accommodated, and they are responsible for voting down those reasonable amendments. I trust that the government in future will take the time to review the effects this legislation may have on all our families, and in our family courts, and that should negative consequences arise, they find the same expediency and the same courage in correcting any of the consequences that may arise.", "When I was putting together thoughts for this morning’s debate, I recalled the comments of our recently departed Clerk, Deb Deller. When she left this Legislature, in her comments that final day, she implored the government to look up to the owl that is engraved in this Legislature, that it represents wisdom, guidance, thoughtfulness. I think the government has lost sight of the owl. Hopefully, as this bill makes its way through society, if there are negative consequences, that wisdom will prevail and courage will prevail to correct any of those failings." ],

Before I get into what I was going to say before I listened to his words here, first of all, I’d like to say that I’m very proud to be part of a Legislature where all views are not accommodated. I’m very proud to be part of a Legislature where racism is not accommodated, where misogyny is not accommodated, and where homophobia and transphobia are not accommodated. I think, in this post-Trump world, it’s incumbent upon all of us to have the courage, and sometimes the ability, to resist those very forces.", "We keep in mind that we are debating this bill against a world backdrop where some 80 countries have laws against homosexuality, where many of those countries have the death penalty for those who are LGBTQ2S, where massacres like the one in Orlando still occur in North America, and where the very tenuous rights of LGBTQ2S folk are always and ever under attack. That is the backdrop here.", "The very same arguments—that we haven’t thought through all of the ramifications—were made around the fight for equal marriage. Well, guess what? We’ve had equal marriage for a long time now, certainly in this country, and the sky has not fallen. In fact, even at the time that we were hearing testimony around Bill 28, the parent equality act, I saw some of my old adversaries come: the same people with whom I used to debate equal marriage; the same people and their followers who are out at the front protesting advances around sex education in our schools; the same people who actually proffered death threats around equal marriage—" ],

I think it’s really important for those of us who sometimes feel like we live in a bubble of equal rights—rights that we feel really are equal—that those folk are still out there. Mind you, the good news is, they are not the majority. The majority of Ontarians and the majority of Canadians do support equal rights for LGBTQ2S folk. That means a great deal in the range of policy, and that’s what brings us here today.", "A few other things he talked about: the haste with which this bill is going through. No, no: 10 years later. It’s taken 10 years to get here, and I’m going to talk about that. Ten years isn’t fast; it’s a decade. It hasn’t happened quickly.", "That we’ve thrown the burden back on the courts: absolutely not. In fact, it’s the reverse: The courts have thrown the burden on us. The courts demanded of this Legislature that we act because the law was so clearly discriminatory.", "That “parents” is actually the appropriate legal term: There’s nothing revolutionary about that. Guess what? Even after the parent equality bill passes, there will still be mothers and fathers. Who knew? It’s amazing. There will still be mothers and fathers even after parent equality is passed, and they will be acknowledged as such.", "His question—we’ve heard about this: four-parent families and how this is a completely revolutionary idea. Well, I can tell you that every divorced heterosexual couple who then remarries is a four-parent family. And heterosexual couples who have divorced and remarried, where children spend some time at one household and some time in another—they already have four parents. This is not a social experiment. This has been going on for as long as marriage has been going on. Mr. Speaker, this is just equality we’re talking about, so that LGBTQ2S communities can also experience, legally, four parents.", "But that’s not the issue, really. That’s not what he’s really speaking about, and not who he’s speaking for and to. Who he’s really speaking for and to is that drum beat of a voice coming out of the fundamentalist religious right. I can say that I’ve been fighting that voice for decades. In fact, I’ve been fighting that voice for 45 years.", "I’m a United Church minister by trade, and 45 years ago, in 1971, I was proud to be the only woman who signed on to We Demand, which was the first gay rights demonstration in Canadian history on Parliament Hill, when homosexuality was still illegal. In 1971 we also had the first gay pride. Contrary to some opinions, it was a big picnic over at Hanlan’s Point. I have the pictures to prove it. It was a celebration of all things LGBTQ2S—well, just “gay” back then.", "In the 2000s we saw, of course, the struggle for legalized same-sex marriage. I was proud to marry two wonderful women in my church using the systems of banns that Brent had started. I submitted it to Thunder Bay, and it became the first legalized same-sex marriage because one of the clerks in Thunder Bay thought that Paula was a male name. A little bit of gender confusion there; it was great. So we got that, and that was the first legalized same-sex marriage in North America, actually.", "Then I got elected. One of the first bills that I proposed was Toby’s Act, to add gender identity and gender expression to the Ontario Human Rights Code, and I found support all around the House. In fact, Christine Elliott from the Progressive Conservatives and Yasir Naqvi from the government side, the Liberals, supported that bill. After five tablings and much struggle, many years later we got it passed. So now we have gender identity and gender expression in the Ontario Human Rights Code.", "By the way—and this is important—Bill 16: Yes, we need it federally, but if you are a trans person in Ontario, unless you work for a federal employer or in a federal institution, you’re already covered. Your health is covered, your employment is covered and your housing is covered. We have that basis. Know that, and act accordingly. That’s in Ontario.", "Then we banned conversion therapy. That bill we got done in two months. It was a record. We banned the attempt to make LGBTQ2S children straight. We banned that in Ontario. Who knew it was still going on? But it was. So that was banned. That just happened in 2015.", "Now we’re fighting for parent equality, a struggle that has taken some 10 years.", "I hope that in that little preamble to what I have to say I’ve countered some of the myths about how fast this has happened. It has taken 45 years to get to this point; it has taken 10 years for this bill alone.", "The Ontario Court of Appeal recognized equal marriage, as I said, back in 2003, but it has taken 10 years since the courts told this government to fix their legislation. In 2006, the Rutherford case: Justice Rivard found the Ontario birth registration scheme to be discriminatory because it excluded non-biological lesbian co-mothers.", "Additionally, a 2007 ruling by the Ontario Court of Appeal declared that there is a legislative gap in the scheme for parental recognition. They said that it’s in the child’s best interest to recognize more than two parents.", "On April 8, 2016, 21 LGBTQ families issued a charter challenge against the Ontario government to fight the discriminatory laws. The court ruled in favour of the families and ordered the government to bring in legislation by September 30, 2016, which they did.", "Folks will know that in 2015 we brought before the House Cy and Ruby’s Act (Parental Recognition), named after the children who are here, Cy and Ruby, which did pass second reading; however, it sadly died with prorogation. Bill 137 is an update of that. Again, there’s nothing fast about this.", "What will the All Families Are Equal Act do, if passed?

Here’s all it will do:", "—It will ensure that all couples who use assisted reproduction to conceive are recognized as their children’s parents.", "—It will allow parents who use a surrogate to be legally recognized as their child’s parents without a court process, as long as the surrogate agrees before conception and after birth.", "—It will more clearly recognize the legal status of all parents, regardless of how their child was conceived.", "—It will bring our laws up-to-date with British Columbia and Alberta, who have already got laws around this.", "Again, this is just about equality with heteronormative families. That’s really all it is.", "I want to acknowledge those who are here, and some who are not here, who really are the stalwarts and who have really been fighting for this for the last decade. First of all, Joanna Radbord—I don’t see her here, but she was very instrumental; Maretta Miranda, Joanna’s spouse; Cameron Miranda-Radbord, Joanna’s son; and of course, as already acknowledged, Kirsti Mathers McHenry; Jennifer Mathers McHenry; Cy, Kirsti and Jennifer’s son; and Ruby, Kirsti and Jennifer’s daughter. Also, their parents are here: Sheila McHenry and Justin McHenry.", "Robyn Dutt; Andy Inkster from the Sherbourne Health Centre, a very important institution in our community that’s been fighting along these lines, again, for at least 10 years; Kathleen Murphy; Poppy Murphy; Sarah Toper; Simon Toper; Dr. Donna McDonagh—I’m going to talk a little about her charter challenge, but she was one of the applicants there; Caroline McGrath; Rachel Epstein from the LGBTQ Parenting Network, again, who have worked so hard for so long for this moment; Ido Katri; Juana Berinstein, Sarah Blackstock, Nica Blackstock-Berenstein and Isa Blackstock-Berenstein; Elizabeth Ruth; Marcidita Duclayna; Carolina Bernstein; and a student from our office, Bri Gardner from Ursula Franklin, who really is the future and whose future we are working to protect this morning.", "So all of these folk and many, many more have been working for a long, long time, Mr. Speaker, to make this day a reality. And why have they been doing it? There’s a simple answer, and that’s love. It’s the love of their own children and the desire to protect their own children, the same way every family in Ontario’s first rule of action, if they’re loving parents, is to love and protect their children. That’s why we’re here. And when we talk about children, we’re saying not just some children, not just the children of heterosexual families, but all children. That’s why we’re here. Children do not ask which family to be born into. All they ask of us is that we love them and care for them, and they ask of legislators that we make that possible and that we protect those who love them and care for them. That’s why we’re here: to protect those children.", "Again, part of the backdrop to this, when we talk about protecting our children, is the very glaring fact that if you are a trans child or if you’re an LGBTQ2S child, your risk of suicide is far greater than a heterosexual child, so it’s to protect those children too. It’s to protect our children. So I would say to anyone who professes faith of any kind, certainly all of our scripture professes love and calls upon us, no matter what our faith, to love our neighbour as ourselves. And guess what? Some of our neighbours are LGBTQ2S. We are called upon—in fact, it is our duty—to love them, and love means accepting them and treating them as you would someone in your family, someone like you. That’s what it calls us to do. Anything short of that is not faithful. It’s not faithful. Can I repeat that again? It’s not faithful, and particularly where children are concerned, it’s not faithful. When we think of what all of the world’s holy books have to say about children, we get that message loudly and clearly: It is our duty as adults to protect all of our children, whatever family they are born into, whatever they look like, whatever their families look like. That is a call to us from God. There you go.", "Now, to get back to Bill 28 and parental equality, let me talk about Kirsti Mathers McHenry and Jennifer—and this story has been told many times, so I have the permission, of course, to use it. When Kirsti was in labour, she ran into difficulties. She ran into the kind of difficulties that made those who loved her, those who were around and the medical staff fear for her life. In the end, all are well and they’re all here, which we celebrate. But Kirsti realized in this process that if something happened to Jennifer, she would not have any legal right to walk out of that hospital with their child. Think about that: that in fact, the sperm donor, who did not want to be a parent, would have more rights than she would.", "This is the kind of situation we are trying to protect against in Bill 28. That is the child we are going to protect by passing Bill 28. That could happen. That has happened. So when we think about the call to love and we think about the call to love our children, the current status quo does not do that. That’s why we need this bill.", "Donna McDonagh’s story is more complicated, a little bit more complicated, but it shows again the failings of the status quo. Her daughter was born in the autumn of 2006. A law was about to change allowing two moms to put their names directly onto a child’s birth certificate. Their baby was the first in Ottawa to have a birth certificate listing two women as parents. Many women thought this was the answer; they thought this was all they needed.", "She had every reason to be confident that she was a full parent before the law. Her name was on the birth certificate. Their child’s last name was a hyphenated hybrid of the two moms’ surnames. The two women had signed an order of joint custody. She was granted paid and topped-up parental leave. She had successfully applied for the baby’s health card and social insurance number, and was named as parent on the application for a passport.", "Wills, powers of attorney, codicils—everything signalled the same intent, that they were equal parents, until the relationship ended in 2009. At the time of the breakup, there was an agreement there would be joint custody, but there was a loophole in one of the laws governing parentage, which could be used to cut McDonagh out. Needless to say, long story short, hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees later, the situation was rectified.", "But when we talk about crowding the courts, clogging the courts, that’s exactly what this bill, Bill 28, will help to remedy. It’s exactly the opposite of what you heard the member from Lanark–Frontenac–Lennox and Addington say, exactly the opposite. In fact, the courts will be less crowded because of the passage of Bill 28.", "Let us remind also, people who are watching this, that a child who has a medical emergency, who was with, say, Kirsti before this law is brought in, and she needed to sign off on some medical procedure at the hospital if Jennifer were not available— she would not be able to do so. It puts the child’s very health and very life at risk. Again, Bill 28, the equal parent bill, will actually remedy that, will keep our children safer.", "I could go on and on, but suffice to say, for those who are watching and for those who are here, this is a historic moment. It’s a historic moment that has taken 45 years and a lot of work on behalf of a lot of people to get to this moment where we can actually have parent equality in the province of Ontario. It’s taken 10 years just for this bill. It’s taken a court order for this government to act. It’s taken all of the above and putting at risk many families and children in that course of time to get to this point.", "In a sense, when the member got up and spoke—and I know where he’s getting his talking notes—it was, in point, a question of faith. It is a question of faith in equal rights. It’s a question of faith in protecting our children. It’s a question of faith that families come in all shapes and forms and always have. This is nothing new—always have. It’s a question of faith that if we allow parents who love their children to love their children, those children will be okay insofar as we can protect them. It is a question of faith in that we’re acting on children’s behalf and not out of prejudice, and not only when those babies are born, but throughout their lives, so that they know, as teenagers, as young people, that they’re going to grow up into a world where they can marry who they love and who they choose, and they can have children and those children will be equal. It’s a matter of faith in that.", "It’s a matter of faith in a world that believes in those bedrock principles of equality, of family, of all types of family and of our children’s right to exist safely and with love. It’s faith in that. And, yes, it’s faith in the people who sent us here, that they do support all of that, despite the voices of a few. The vast majority of Canadians and the vast majority of Ontarians want this to pass and faithfully sent us here to make it so. That’s the faith we’re speaking about here, and it’s a faith that every other religious faith takes part in.", "So to all of those who would send me angry emails after this and to all of those who will send us angry notes on social media—which they do—know this: The God you worship and the God we worship is the same God, and this is what God wants.", "So here’s to parent equality, here’s to our children, here’s to a truly faithful future, a truly equal future for everyone." ],

This was not something that I expected, and I have to be honest with you, I haven’t even had a chance to do a thorough review of the bill.", "This is a consumer protection bill brought forward by the Minister of Government and Consumer Services, with respect to home inspections and to amend various acts with respect to financial services and consumer protection. It’s a very significant bill in its content, so there’s going to be an opportunity to look at all of the details here through the second reading debate and have that opportunity to bring this to committee for further dissecttion, and also the opportunity for people on both sides of the argument to bring their concerns and/or support for the bill to the committee.", "One of the things this is about is door-to-door sales. This will ban certain types of door-to-door sales. I must say that over the years, door-to-door sales have become less and less of an issue as the marketplace has changed. Quite frankly, many people do most of their business today online—not myself; I’m a little bit more traditional. But our daughter Emily, who lives in the Northwest Territories, is continuously doing business online, making purchases online. First of all, they don’t have access to all of the stuff within their community of Fort Smith in the Northwest Territories, whereas online you have access to any product that any of those companies that are offering that line of product—you have access to that.", "The issue of door-to-door sales, quite frankly, has changed over the years. But there has always been that challenge attached to it and that concern attached—we’ve always had that picture of the door-to-door salesman that people have some concern about, because the person who meets them at the door has not by choice decided they want to go out shopping for that product. The product is coming to them and, in many ways, they haven’t had a chance—I’ll say one thing about Emily: Before she makes a purchase, she has gone through every possible avenue of that product. Every possible characteristic and attribute of that product she has dissected and studied. Emily doesn’t make impulsive purchases.", "One of the challenges with door-to-door sales has always been that you’re met with someone at the door who says, “I’ve got the greatest thing here since they invented the wheel or since sliced bread”—maybe it is sliced bread; I don’t know—“I’ve really got a great product for you. Let me come in and show you this product and I guarantee you’re going to buy it.” Then there’s the concern about some of the techniques that have been used by people who come door to door to sell products.", "Our job here as legislators has been and is to protect consumers. It’s vital for us to ensure that we don’t condone practices that would be considered nefarious or misleading. That’s one of the reasons that I think we always need to have good protection for the consumer at their own door. As I said, the person whose door the salesman may come to was not prepared to view that product today, was not prepared to look at that issue, so they haven’t necessarily done their homework. They’re going to be told all about what is great about this product but not necessarily have the time to find out how maybe that product isn’t best for them.", "One of the door-to-door sales that we don’t allow anymore is contracts for electricity. We give people a lot of room and a lot of latitude to get out of those contracts. You’ll remember that years ago the show Marketplace did an exposé on door-to-door electricity contracts and found multiple examples of how consumers were almost coerced and forced into signing a contract, and didn’t even know necessarily that they were entering into a contract. That resulted in some legislation being brought in here years ago which made the practice more regulated and more highly scrutinized. We did that last year again with Bill 122, I think it was, or Bill 132, in the previous Parliament before the prorogation. So there’s more protection for those consumers. They still have the right and the option to enter into a contract for electricity; it just has to be done in a different way and there are more clarifications necessary. Anything that has been done has to be reconfirmed a second time to ensure that the consumer has entered into that contract willfully and of their own accord.", "I remember my mother-in-law, who is an 83-year-old senior born in Germany, came here in 1954, never worked outside of the home, lives only on the Canada pension and the old age pension that is provided to her, as anyone at that age has access to or is given those. She would have the supplement as well, because she doesn’t have any other income of any kind. She’s widowed and has been for years. She got into one of those electricity contracts at the door, and she had that contract for about seven or eight months, was paying way too much, but she never talked to me or my wife about it, because she felt embarrassed that she got into that. Then she started to show us her hydro bills, her electricity bills, and we were able to have her taken off that, have that contract nullified.", "I must say the energy retailer was quite co-operative; there was no issue in getting it nullified. But my mother-in-law who, when she came here—she doesn’t speak the best English even today, but there was no question in our minds that the person who she signed that contract with was less than fully forthcoming and fully transparent in how they marketed that service to her.", "She was, to me, a classic case of where the practice was wrong: living alone, not highly articulate in the English language, and certainly everybody—you’ve got to remember, everybody in this province, if someone comes into their home and says, “I can save you money on your electricity bill,” is interested, because electricity bills in this province, under this government, have gone through the roof. In fact, they actually recognized it themselves today, that the electricity bill is one of the biggest challenges that people are facing in this province. The Premier even said—not because she was sincere about it, but because she wants to change the channel and change the message—that she apologizes for what has happened to the electricity bills in this province.", "I would like to ask the Premier, where have you been? It didn’t become a problem on November 18, 19 and 20 in Ottawa at the Liberal convention, when she made her marvelous speech to the converted. It’s been a problem for years—a minimum of seven or eight years that the problem has been ridiculously challenging for people in this province. And all of a sudden, she is going to fix it? We do need protection for consumers, but I’ll tell you that what consumers need protection from most in this province is that government on that side of the House." ],

As he talked about the challenges of door-to-door sales or the nature of door-to-door sales, it’s interesting. We think of door-to-door sales being almost—well, like out of a movie, where a door-to-door salesperson comes in to sell you a vacuum and show you a product in the safety and comfort of your own home. We think about how it used to be and we look now to what we recognize at our doors.", "When I first bought my house, there was a learning curve about all the things that I needed, trying to think proactively and best care for my new home, and juggle and pay for all of these new bills. I remember someone coming to my door with a computer tablet and showing me all of the reasons that, if I didn’t sign this, I was going to have bills that were astronomical and I wouldn’t be able to manage, and, yes, I worried: “Oh, look at all this that I don’t know.” I read things and got a little bit tangled in the marketing and signed up for a contract. Then I realized that—I think over the long term, I ended up paying more than I would have if I’d just left well enough alone. But I did not renew, and I called them and said, “Get me off of this.” I was able to do that for myself and advocate for myself and learn something through that process.", "My grandmother, though, at 95 years old—I was glad she did consult with me about some of these contracts and that she said to people, “I won’t sign it today. You can leave me something to read.” I’m glad that she did that, because hearing about the member’s mother-in-law and her journey—we do need to do what’s best for consumers, and that is, indeed, to act on their behalf and protect them." ],

A good idea is a good idea, and I’m glad that, as a government, we’re bringing that forward.", "I think the member from Renfrew–Nipissing–Pembroke made the case for why we need this bill very eloquently by illustrating the example of his own mother-in-law.

But those who do stay at home for long periods of time are particularly vulnerable just because of the opportunity to, I guess, interact in this kind of a sales environment, and also because, as the member from Renfrew–Nipissing–Pembroke said, often these end up being impulse sales because the deal seems so good and you have to sign now for the deal to be good, and all of those pressure tactics make it very hard to resist.", "I have to say that, as a government, we’ve come to this measure.

Basically, this act is dealing with three areas where I think MPPs’ offices get a lot of e-mails and phone calls. One is door-to-door sales. The second is payday loans, which are very common in many of the ridings outside of the GTA and Ottawa. And three is home inspections.", "The member who just debated was focused more on the door-to-door sales aspect and the fact that seniors—and, I would add to that, vulnerable people—who are in our communities are at risk of signing and agreeing to things that really are not in their best interests. We all know that in the past, there were many door-to-door sales for energy and electricity contracts which people got trapped in. We’ve dealt with that in a piece of legislation already, but door-to-door sales still continue and the high-pressure tactics go on, not necessarily to deal with electricity, but I would say that payday loans—it’s very possible that many of the people who are going and getting payday loans at extremely high interest rates—as high as 400% a year, we’re hearing—could be getting those payday loans to pay their hydro bills. Isn’t that unfortunate, Mr. Speaker, to hear that in Ontario, in 2016, people are deciding to borrow money to pay their hydro bills at such high interest?", "Home inspectors: Well, we all know that we need better protection of consumers in terms of ensuring that home inspections are done properly.

I think about how did we get here, where we’re protecting consumers from door-to-door sales or protecting consumers from payday loans, exorbitant interest rates, and we’re protecting consumers from home inspections? Those are the three areas that are being highlighted in this bill.", "It’s the right thing to do; we need to protect consumers, Speaker. But how did we get there in the first place, allowing these payday loans to charge extraordinary amounts of interest to the most vulnerable people? Many people now are in that broad title of vulnerable people even if they have a job, because we’re not creating good-paying, sustainable jobs. We’re creating precarious work, jobs that don’t have benefits, and people can’t make ends meet.", "When you have hydro rates that are so high, people have to decide between putting food on the table and paying their hydro rates. That is the reality that people are facing today. And what do they do? Sometimes they have to go out to these payday loans and get a loan, just to make ends meet. What’s happening to them is that they’re getting interest rates basically like 490%, I think it was, when you look at how it accumulates. It’s revolving over and over again, and no one catches up.", "So having this bill to protect consumers and putting them first is a good thing, Speaker, but honestly, I think about how we got here.

People can do their own home inspection; they can have their friend do a home inspection. But we do have many, many home inspectors in the area that do this as a living. So any way that we can further professionalize that service I think is something that is positive for the buyer and the seller, because the reality is that it’s not the seller trying to win or the buyer trying to win. It’s about making sure that everybody, when they put their signature on that line at the end, when they finalize the deal, when it is a done deal, as they say, is satisfied that they’ve gone into that with the full information, their eyes fully open, and they’re satisfied that with all the knowledge that is available to them, they’ve made a decision to make a purchase and finalize a sale.

However, for those suffering in Leeds–Grenville and across Ontario, his words ring cruelly empty.", "If I sound urgent, Speaker, it’s with good reason. In 2014, the Leeds, Grenville and Lanark health unit reported the highest rate of Lyme disease cases per 100,000 in Ontario—nearly 17% of the total cases. Yes, there have been positive steps regarding awareness and prevention, but increasing populations of ticks and longer seasons of exposure mean all the awareness and the prevention won’t keep people from being bitten and getting sick. It’s these people that our health care system is failing.", "Two years on we’re no closer to the testing and treatment available in the United States or in Europe. With all of its resources, Ontario should be a destination for those seeking cutting-edge treatment.

They’re good jobs that provide so many of the services we rely on. Now the Liberals have decided to undermine their work. They want unskilled workers with no certification to do the same work as our tradespeople. They want fewer inspectors for health and safety in the workplace. They are fine with making this province less safe just so corporations and developers can save a few bucks. This is serious. People could die. Workers shouldn’t have to worry about whether their workplace is safe or not.", "Mr. Speaker, it seems to me that what the Liberals want is to make our workplaces less safe and our workers less sure about their jobs. What kind of message is this sending to our young people who want to pursue the skilled trades, as well as to our young women and men? I can tell you what the message is. It’s simple: All the hard work you put into mastering your trade and becoming certified doesn’t matter. What does matter is ensuring businesses can use non-certified workers just to save a quick buck.", "Instead of attacking skilled trades workers, instead of stripping away the value of their certificates, instead of making the workplace more dangerous for workers, instead of that, let’s support our workers in the province of Ontario.", "Let me get straight to the point: Schedules 16 and 17 of Bill 70 are wrong.

As a new member, you soon learned that fundraising for the community was as important as curling, and both allowed you to meet new friends from across our region. All of our members spent untold hours volunteering for various events—always with a smile.”", "There is no doubt that their generous donation will have a lasting impact on local patients and their families for many years to come.

This unique project, designed to initiate discussion on critical human rights issues, is now in its second year of operation. As a proud Portuguese Canadian, I am pleased that for this particular Davenport tour, the organizers included in their curriculum a story about the Portuguese hero Aristides de Sousa Mendes.", "Aristides de Sousa Mendes was one of the great heroes of the Second World War. As the Portuguese consul stationed in Bordeaux, France, he found himself confronted in June 1940 with the reality of thousands of refugees outside the Portuguese consulate attempting to escape the horrors of the Nazi war machine. In all, de Sousa Mendes saved 30,000 people, including about 10,000 Jews, by issuing visas to Portugal. It has been characterized as the largest rescue action by a single individual during the Holocaust. He has also been recognized by the Yad Vashem in Israel as “the righteous one.”", "I am thrilled that students, teachers, families and friends in Davenport will learn from this Tour for Humanity and get an opportunity to learn about this wonderful Portuguese hero who saved the lives of so many, and that this tour will empower students to raise their voices and take action against hate, to make the province and the world a better place." ],

It’s about making sure that we move Bill 70 along as quickly and as expeditiously as is possible, to make sure that the good, positive measures that are in this bill for the people of Ontario take effect as soon as possible. A lot of the measures in this bill are really about just making everyday life better for the people of Ontario. There are a number of areas where this bill does really important things, and I would like to mention a few of those.", "This bill will take action in terms of helping people purchase their first home. One of the things that I hear about a lot in my community—I think we hear it across the province, but certainly in Etobicoke Centre, I hear about young people struggling to afford to buy a home and enter the housing market for the first time. We’ve taken a step in the right direction to address that by doubling the maximum land transfer tax refund to $4,000 for eligible first-time home homebuyers. It’s a small step, but I think it’s an important step.", "We’re establishing the initial parameters for the Financial Services and Regulatory Authority, which will be a new, flexible regulator of financial services and pensions that will be more consumer-focused and improve protections for consumers, investors and pension plan beneficiaries. Again, we want to make sure that we’re protecting consumers, that we’re protecting investors. This is really, really important because people, at the end of the day, need to be able to save and invest to secure their financial futures. But we want to make sure that the regulators that are in place are nimble, effective and adaptable to the times and to the investment vehicles that are out there.", "Extending the Ontario Securities Commission whistle-blower protections to employees who provide information about possible contraventions of Ontario commodity futures law: This is again about protecting investors, and when I say “protecting investors,” I’m not talking about large institutional investors. I’m talking about the people who live in my community, who rely on the returns from these investments every single day to secure their retirement, for example.", "Requiring the heads of regional municipal councils to be directly elected by voters, which will strengthen democratic representation—my former seatmate, now minister, Chris Ballard introduced a private member’s bill in the previous sitting on this issue. I’m really proud of his leadership. I know a number of members of our caucus have introduced legislation in that vein. I’m really pleased to see this measure in here. I think that’s a validation of his good work and the other members’ good work. Really, the alternative to moving this forward is to really slow the process down. We’re not going to allow that to happen. We recognize the challenges that Ontarians are facing. I’ve mentioned some of the fixes that are in this bill that will help Ontarians, and we want to move this in place.", "What I wanted to do, too, is talk a little bit about the broader picture of what we’re doing here and how this bill fits into that. Going back to the last election campaign, we committed to balancing the budget by 2017-18, and we continue to be on track to do that. I have to say that I’m proud to be one of the members of Treasury Board. I’m proud to have had the opportunity to be parliamentary assistant to Minister Matthews at Treasury Board and now to Minister Sousa in finance. I’ve had the opportunity to provide input, to advise and to use some of my business and finance background to help the government achieve that very goal—not to achieve it with a slash-and-burn approach, as has been done in the past, but to really do it in a thoughtful way, looking line by line through the government budget, getting better value for money, making sure that we’re continuing to deliver improved results, but also finding the resources to invest in those programs that people care about. That’s going to allow us to balance the budget in 2017-18.", "We’re not doing it, as I said, with a slash-and-burn approach, as has been done in the past. But we’re also doing it in a way, keeping our eye on the economy, making sure that we’re making the investments that don’t necessarily—not just the short-term investments in programs, but also the longer-term investments that are going to spur our economy, create jobs and really create the foundation for a more prosperous future for years to come. One of the best examples of that is the investments that we’re making in transit and infrastructure and transportation infrastructure, in hospitals and schools. These are investments that take time to realize and to build, but once they’re built, they create a foundation for economic success, and they create a foundation for greater quality of life and greater health care, education, and all those things that the people of Ontario need, care about and deserve.", "So we’re balancing the budget in 2017-18. We’re doing it in a smart and prudent way. But we’re also making sure that we’re putting in place the foundations to grow our economy and create jobs for people of all backgrounds and from all parts of the province.", "One of the things that I’m really proud to see is Ontario’s economic performance over the past number of years. Business investment in Ontario increased by 0.6% in the second quarter of 2016 and 0.9% in the first quarter. We’ve recovered all of the jobs that were lost during the recession. I think that’s a very positive sign. That doesn’t mean that we don’t have more work to do. We have a lot more work to do; there’s no question. There are a lot of people out there who are still struggling, and we need to make sure we continue to work to spur our economy and provide the foundation for their success. I’m as big an advocate for that as anyone, and the rest of our caucus are big advocates for that. But these are positive signs, and we’ll continue to do the work we need to do to achieve the goal of making sure everyone shares in that success.", "Our unemployment rate, for example, has been lower than the national average for 18 months in a row now. It’s the lowest unemployment rate in eight years.", "So these are positive signs, but there’s much more work to do.", "There are a few things in this bill that I want to mention, in my remaining time, that I’m particularly proud of, that support those objectives that I talked about: balancing the budget, growing our economy, facilitating a better quality of life and protecting consumers. One of the things that we’ve done is we’ve made amendments to implement certain recommendations of the November 2015 report submitted by my colleague Laura Albanese, the Minister of Finance’s former parliamentary assistant. She did incredible work. In her report, she recommended that we allow Ontario credit unions to participate in syndicated loans outside Ontario remove differential rules for small credit unions, and authorize regulations setting out different deposit insurance limits for different insurable deposits. She completed her review in November 2015. The recommendations were based on extensive consultations. I spoke with the member for York South–Weston many times when she was doing this work, during that consultation process. I know how hard she worked. I know how thoroughly she listened to people across Ontario.", "She created a report that found an excellent balance: to ensure that the people who are served by credit unions are supported, and that credit unions can continue to prosper and deliver not only the kinds of services that Ontarians need but also give back to communities. Many of the credit unions really reinvest in their communities. I think of ones that serve my community in Etobicoke. Ukrainian Credit Union is an organization that I know well. Buduchnist Credit Union is another one. They don’t just provide excellent service to their members; they also take the profits and reinvest them in communities in Etobicoke Centre and across Ontario.", "Another important element that I want to talk about, Speaker, is the establishment of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority, which is a new, independent and flexible regulator of financial services.", "Consumer protection is essential to maintaining our position as a leader in the financial services sector. I used to work in the financial services sector, and I know that Toronto—Ontario—has one of the largest financial services sectors in North America. We are actually global leaders in a number of niche areas within the sector in making sure that we have appropriate, flexible regulatory authorities that are flexible to the needs of business, but also protecting consumers is key.", "In 2015, we had an advisory panel to review the mandates of FSCO, DICO and FST. In response to the recommendations that were made by the panel, we’re introducing legislation that, if passed, would establish the FSRA. This is an important step in modernizing the regulation of our financial services sector and pensions in Ontario.", "In summary, Speaker, we have a bill here that’s really designed to protect consumers. It’s designed to strengthen the economy. It’s designed in such a way to make sure that we’re fiscally responsible and that we’re managing towards a balanced budget in 2017-18 while investing in the services that are most important to the people of Ontario, whether that be health care or education or transit or roads or other kinds of infrastructure.", "I’m really proud of this bill. I’m proud of the work that the Minister of Finance and his team have done in pulling this together. I hope that we can get this motion passed so we can move the bill through as quickly as possible and get it passed, because at the end of the day I was elected—we were all elected—to deliver results for the people of Ontario, but also to deliver them quickly and expeditiously. That’s why I hope we have support from all sides to move this time allocation forward." ],

Businesses like King’s Lock Craft Distillery in Johnstown in my riding were hopeful about what those talks would produce. Instead, they were shocked to learn that Bill 70 unilaterally imposes a 61.5% single-tier sales tax. All of that work to develop a graduated tax plan like other jurisdictions in Canada and the United States have used to grow this craft industry was poured down the drain.", "It’s been incredible to hear the finance minister and the member for Beaches–East York argue that it’s actually good news for craft distillers. Frankly, I’ll take the word of the industry over the government spin.", "The member for Beaches–East York even brought up NAFTA, speculating a graduated tax would “put the whole craft beer industry in the province at risk.” What a bunch of fearmongering nonsense, Speaker. The member knows, or he should know, that a graduated tax isn’t the issue. We have plenty of graduated taxes. A problem only exists if you tie those taxes to local input. It’s just another red herring to justify the indefensible actions of this government.", "The finance minister needs to recognize the damage this dispiriting tax is going to cause. I hope he’ll agree to take it out of Bill 70 and get back to the table with the craft distillers to work on a real solution." ],

But the real reason, or one of the real reasons, is when the government prorogued the House and when they wanted to change it from—remember the tag line was “Building Ontario Up”? Then they realized that a lot of people weren’t being built up, so they decided to change the tagline to “Building Ontario Up for Everyone.” As a result, a lot of things had to start over, and now they’re being rushed to manage their schedule.", "Obviously, they want to build Ontario up for everyone—except Ontarians who actually want to take the time to speak to this bill, because they’re being rushed, now, as well. Our time to debate is being cut. But that’s really not the most egregious part. It’s the people who actually have issues with this bill: Their time is being cut as well.", "If you will recall, when this bill was first introduced in the House, the NDP introduced a reasoned amendment, for two reasons. The first was to try to slow the bill down a bit, because it wasn’t even off the presses and they wanted to start debating it. The second reason was that there are many schedules in this bill. It’s an economic bill, it’s been talked about as a mini-budget, but there are schedules in this bill that don’t belong in an economic bill, specifically schedules 16 and 17.", "In our amendment, we suggested or demanded or expected that these schedules be removed and that they be reintroduced as independent legislation, because they are both—16 is perhaps not as contentious as 17, and I’m not going to get into all the details, but one has to do with occupational safety, and schedule 17 has to do with the College of Trades. They’re both important issues, contentious issues that shouldn’t be hidden in the middle of what everyone perceives to be a budget bill. That’s what’s happening here.", "We gave the government notice that we believe, the NDP caucus believes, that those two schedules should be pulled out of the bill and that the bill should be considered without them. I would like to repeat that, because it’s not that we don’t believe that they should be discussed; we fully believe that we should have an open, public discourse on those two schedules. But they should be separate legislation. They shouldn’t just be hidden in this bill.", "It is for that reason that we do not support this bill. There are good things in this bill, but they are used more as window dressing to actually hide the egregious parts.", "In my five years here in the House, I could never understand why this government continues to do that. The member from Etobicoke Centre, I believe, who I do a lot of work with, said he was proud of this bill. I can’t understand that. Why aren’t bills more straightforward? It’s supposed to be a budget bill. If that’s the way it’s being sold—the selling point with this bill was the extra $2,000 rebate to allow young homeowners, first-time homeowners, to buy homes. That’s the tagline, but there’s all kinds of stuff in this bill that has nothing to do with the economy per se—and the government continues to do that.", "If it’s a budget bill, let’s talk about budget matters so people can understand what’s being spoken about and we can actually have a fruitful discussion or a fruitful debate. But it’s never quite as cut and dried as that. I’m sure that when we vote against this bill—“Oh, you know what? They’re against first-time homebuyers,” which is not the case—absolutely not, Mr. Speaker. What we are against is taking what could be straightforward legislation and continually inserting poison pills or contentious sections that should be discussed on their own. They should be openly discussed, and people should have the time, when the hearings are scheduled, to actually be able to plan how to attend these hearings.", "If you look at this schedule, there are very few people who are experts in any field who can drop everything on a day’s notice to talk at Queen’s Park for a few minutes. Then, you question whether these few minutes have any validity, because the decision has likely already been made on this bill, whether they come or not. That destroys the whole faith in the democratic process.", "But again, the main point for us that I would like, as a representative of the House leaders team here, is that we put forward a reasoned amendment to take schedules out of this legislation so the legislation could be considered on the merits without those amendments. Those amendments, specifically 16 and 17, should be considered as independent legislation so they can have a fulsome debate. We maintain that position.", "Some of my colleagues would like to have some time to speak as well." ],

I’ll talk more about that in a moment.", "The ministry also stated that the economy is only on pace to grow by an annual rate of 0.7%.

They have a one-time sale of assets and then, because that still wasn’t enough, they have to go and dig into the reserves. That’s one-time again—one-time reserves, the contingency fund—gut that so that they can artificially present some kind of artificial balance.", "Ontario’s economic accounts, when they came out recently for the second quarter of 2016, noted that the province’s exports actually declined by 3.3%.

So, again, on page 1, he opens with: The cap-and-trade will “reduce the deficit” now and “increase the deficit ... in future years.”", "Let’s go on a couple more pages. He talks about the fact that the “information currently available suggests some cash raised through cap-and-trade” will result “in the cap-and-trade ... reducing” the deficit. That’s another one that he tells us.", "On page 16, he tells us the same thing. Cap-and-trade: “The result would be a reduction in the deficit....” Speaker, they’re in denial.

How can that be in this Legislature? How can that be allowed to be said in this Legislature, when this government does nothing but present numbers that are absolutely opposite to the numbers presented by an officer of the Legislature?

I don’t know how you’re ambushing somebody when you come out in December 2015 with a warning that you’re going to be doing this, and in the fall of 2016 you now call it an “ambush.” Again, they like to point fingers at people to take the blame off of the work that they have not completed and have not done.", "It’s interesting to note in this fall economic statement that what they also don’t want to talk about is the fact that Ontario has a massive deficit—a deficit of more than $300 billion. I’ve only been here five years, but I think back, as many of us followed politics for a while, to 1990. Ontario’s debt in 1990, before the NDP took office, was not even $40 billion.

It’s not going to fix itself. So what this government has done is that they have gone out and sold Hydro One; they bring in some one-time revenue. They’ve got cap-and-trade; the Financial Accountability Officer told us that they’re bringing in revenue. They sold the LCBO building—they’re bringing in revenue. They’re about to sell the OPG. So all of the sudden, what they’re saying is, “Look, our revenue is the same as our expenses. We’ve balanced. Isn’t that wonderful?” Next year, once they sell the next building, “Oh, look at us. Our revenue is now higher than our expenses. We have a surplus.”", "But what they’re not telling you and what you need to see is that top-up of revenue from the sale of assets is only one time. Hydro One: You can’t keep selling it every day; it’s going to be all sold. You no longer have that revenue. So after the election, after 2017-18, after you have artificially balanced, you’re back down to your old revenue again. You have no more furniture to sell, no more buildings to sell, no more assets to sell. You’re back down to the fact that your expenses are higher than your revenue. That’s what we call a structural deficit. That’s what the Financial Accountability Officer explained; he explained that.", "Now, I realize that the government members did not show up at the briefing from the Financial Accountability Officer and they did not show up at the briefing of the cap-and-trade presentation.

I’ve asked the minister many times since the fall economic statement came out. The Financial Accountability Officer says it in here: They’re either going to have to raise new taxes or find new assets to sell or try to control their expenses. But we’ve seen that they can’t control their expenses. They said there would be no taxes, but they raised taxes on spirits and they raised land transfer taxes as well.

Speaker, you may recall, I’m sure, the many hours we’ve spent in this House talking about payday loans. So, to unlock the time allocation on a payday loan, the president of the Windsor Family Credit Union announced at the AMO conference three months ago that the WFCU would be taking on the payday loans industry. Instead of having to pay $63 to borrow $300 from a payday lender, you could get that $300 loan from the WFCU for $4.25. That’s right: On one hand, a payday loan at an interest rate of 555%, and on the other, an annual rate of 37%. These loans from the credit union, by the way, you can get for as much as $2,500.", "Speaker, if this bill wasn’t time-allocated, I would have a lot more to say about what other good things the WFCU is doing in our part of the province.", "Let me turn to the time-allocated schedule 9, which allows for an arbitration officer to be appointed more quickly in the case of a dispute between a municipality and a firefighters’ union. Some municipal leaders will tell you the arbitration system is broken. But let’s look at Windsor for a moment. It took an arbitrator—are you ready for this? It took an arbitrator eight and a half years to settle a contract dispute between the firefighters and the city of Windsor. Nobody wins in a situation like that—eight and a half years. So anything that we can do to expedite the arbitration system is a good thing for everyone.", "Obviously, some people in this province still feel the Wynne Liberals are pulling us down, not building us up, despite the title they slap on this bill.

They charged us more to encourage us to conserve, and then, because we did such a good job at not using as much electricity, they upped the rates to make up for the money they lost. Talk about incompetence.", "But I guess I have been doing nothing but talking about the incompetence of this Wynne Liberal government for the past seven or eight minutes. I know that’s what people in my part of the province think of this Wynne Liberal government: They are uncaring, incompetent. They are not doing the job they were elected to do. They are not standing up for the disadvantaged. They are not protecting our most vulnerable citizens. They are not the progressive bunch we thought they were.", "They certainly had no right to start selling off our shares in Hydro One. Liberal math is failed math. The Wynne Liberal government is a failed government. They failed us again by time-allocating this bill, shutting off debate and refusing to answer questions posed by the people of Ontario. Shame on them, Speaker. Shame on them all." ],

What we have seen today, through the government’s imposition of time allocation on this bill, is that our ability, our democratic right and privilege which we have been sent here with has been stymied, so to speak.", "The member from Nipissing gave quite a lengthy synopsis of what his party’s position is on the bill, and it became a little bit heated. If anyone has been tuning in and watching, it became heated early on.", "I gave thought to the simple role of our system here. I was going through some articles on my feed, and I came across an article that named the Royal Canadian Air Force captain who just passed away yesterday due to a crash at Cold Lake, Alberta. He was a Hamilton native. His name was Thomas McQueen. He was 29 years old. He was a 10-year RCAF veteran, and he was passionate about flying. He was to be married very soon. I don’t know if we’ve given a moment to pause, thank him for his service and extend our condolences to his family, but I want to do that during this debate because it puts into context the incredible responsibility and privilege that we have here, and also for us to be mindful of those people who are outside of these buildings that we call our democratic institutions and who protect our right to do this. We should be mindful of this privilege and the need to use it completely.", "It’s not because we hate each other. It’s not because we want to attack each other. It is because it is the foundation which our democracy is built upon, so we should use it, we should protect it and we should defend it every day that we can, at every opportunity that we can in this House, and we should honour those who do that outside of the House. I certainly do that in recognizing Captain Thomas McQueen from Hamilton and his colleagues. Maybe we’ll do that more formally at a later date in this House. I think we should.", "Speaker, the bill that we have before us has been referenced as a mini-budget bill because it does contain provisions that ultimately will affect the finances and the function of the entire government over a large scope. It has many schedules. It’s an omnibus-type bill.", "Many schedules that are within the bill are contentious for certain segments of the group; many are not—all the more reason to have a complete debate and allow stakeholders to tell us exactly what their contention is with the bill, how we can make it better and how we might be able to alleviate some of those key points.", "In the brief time that I’ve had the bill in front of my eyes and others have had the ability to review it, one that I see is schedule 1, the amendment of the Alcohol and Gaming Regulations and Public Protections Act, 1996, which essentially imposes an increase on spirits in the small craft spirit industry—and when I say “spirits,” Speaker, I mean alcohol—one of which resides right in my riding, in Amherstburg. It’s called Wolfhead Distillery. They’re brand new. They’re a start-up distillery. If you’ve ever gone down Howard Avenue on your way to Amherstburg, you’ll see them; they’re right across the street from the quarry. They’ve got thousands of oak barrels on the premises there that they make. They previously dealt with wood pallets for the manufacturing sector, so they’ve got different segments. It’s a really interesting building and business, but they’ve branched out to create this beautiful micro-distillery on that site. It was an industrial site that dealt with oak pallets. They’re now making some of the best whisky and vodka that you could ever taste, right there in Amherstburg, Ontario.", "Now, out of nowhere, after two years of consultation with this government—let’s get this straight: This industry, a burgeoning industry in the province, has consulted with the province and has asked for some measure of parity similar to what craft brewers have experienced in terms of the taxation that is levied on the industry. After two years of consultation with this government and explaining the position that would position them for growth, this government has done an about-face and levied an enormous increase on their product, essentially spirits purchased from a distillery retail store. So if you walk into Wolfhead, into this beautiful restaurant/boutique distillery, those products that you will buy off the shelf will be taxed at 61.5% of the retail price, plus a 28-cent-to-38-cent-per-litre volume tax and an 8.93-cent environment tax for each non-refillable container. Tell me you’re going to want to stay in business after being beat up like that." ],

Or you close up shop. That isn’t building Ontario up for everybody. That is breaking down small enterprising businesses that are playing an integral role in our local regional economies.", "It’s another indication of a government that has not been willing—maybe has given all the right signals and played all the right tunes and made all the right gestures over at least the last two years with the craft distillery industry, but yet when it comes time to actually put something on paper to give them some certainty, this massive tax increase comes out of nowhere.", "There are certainly more schedules in here that are contentious. I have some serious reservations about schedule 16. My colleague the member from Windsor–Tecumseh hit the nail on the head when it comes to the Occupational Health and Safety Act and ultimately allowing companies to escape mandatory inspections because of a new recognition through an accredited health and safety system. I get the system; I understand it. I’m aware of systems that exist. They are currently voluntary systems. They exist in other jurisdictions. But to use the carrot in that approach—said another way: To eliminate health and safety inspections as the incentive to implement a rigorous health and safety program in your place of work is well beyond what any reasonable person would think. I would suggest we could do it a whole host of other ways, but that’s it.", "Speaker, I thank you very much for the time, and I thank my colleagues for their mindful eyes on the clock." ],

Stripping the skilled trades of the ability to govern ourselves and to allow an entity, the Ontario Labour Relations Board, that does not place public safety above all else, unlike the Ontario College of Trades, when deciding which scope of practice in a trade, or trades, can be done by unskilled and untrained workers, harming not only trade workers’ livelihoods but also members of the public’s safety.

To those out there at home or those who might read the Hansard later, time allocation means the government doesn’t want to talk about something anymore, and they’re restricting the voices of not only the duly elected members in the House but the voices of the people of Ontario.", "I think it’s interesting. The member from Etobicoke Centre spoke before me and he said that we are all elected to provide results quickly and expeditiously. Yet we had the Deputy Premier stand up yesterday in answer to a question and she said, “We do not make up legislation on the fly without analysis or to score cheap political points.” So I’m wondering which it is: Do we move things through here quickly and expeditiously or do we not make things up on the fly? Because that’s what the government has done. They’ve made things up on the fly and now they’re jamming through legislation that is going to very seriously affect the workers in this province.", "I want to point out that there are two schedules in this bill that are incredibly problematic—and saying “problematic” is understating it. Schedule 16 directly relates to the health and safety of the people of this province when they are at work. Schedule 17 talks about the College of Trades, but when you boil it down, it’s also about health and safety. We, the NDP, have tabled a reasoned amendment asking that schedules 16 and 17 be removed from this bill because they have no place in a finance bill, a budget bill. They are very serious issues that should have the proper amount of time to be discussed and debated, and for people to come forward—not just those in the Legislature, but others—to share their concerns. Unfortunately, the government side does not think it’s important to hear from the people who are affected by schedules 16 and 17.", "Specifically to 17, we need to make sure that when people are in the workplace, the people who are trained to do the work are doing the work, not just for their own safety but for the safety of those who are going to benefit from their work.", "I’m going to talk about schedule 16—I only have four minutes left. Schedule 16 is incredibly scary—I’m going to say “scary”—not just to me but to people across the province. The OFL, OPSEU and now CUPE has joined—those are unions that have joined the chorus to say, “We need to slow down on this and look at what this is going to do to the workers of this province.”", "What we’re doing is taking away oversight around health and safety. The government wants to remove oversight. They want to remove the ability for there to be health and safety inspections in the workplace. In fact, an email from somebody in the ministry actually said they want to “reduce the burden of unnecessary processes such as routine inspections.” Can you imagine that? To think that routine inspections, which are meant to keep the people of this province safe and alive while at work, are considered a burden by this Liberal government.", "I’d also like to read something from a Ministry of Labour inspector. He says, “Ministry of Labour inspectors have written thousands of orders to contraventions. Thousands of health and safety contraventions to which orders are written by health and safety inspectors on proactive field visits. Thousands of violations. Thousands of contraventions. Thousands of orders.” Yet this government wants to take away the oversight of the Ministry of Labour inspectors who go in and find these issues and bring them up and have them corrected before somebody is hurt or before somebody dies.", "As the member from Windsor–Tecumseh pointed out, in Windsor alone since April, since the Day of Mourning, there have been four deaths. We have a government that stood here and supported—and I applaud him for his private member’s bill stating that the flags at all government buildings, whether municipal or provincial, should be lowered for the Day of Mourning to recognize those hurt or killed on the job.", "But it’s not enough for the government side to support lowering a flag. They actually have to support the workers and make sure that there’s legislation in place that protects them. What they’re doing is taking away that protection, and by doing time allocation, they’re taking away the voice of the people in this province.", "They’ve now put in place that you have to table amendments by Friday. For anybody who is watching this or is going to read it in the Hansard later: It’s now Tuesday. It’s Tuesday, and we’re giving until Friday to table amendments. By next week, they’ll have pushed it through committee and already made it law, “they” being the government—certainly not this side of the House.", "In the two minutes I have left, I just wanted to point out that this year, 2016—September 2016—the Minister of Labour marched in a parade with labour leaders and workers, here in Toronto, for the Labour Day parade—a day that honours the workers of Ontario. Little more than two months later, the same minister—and it was unprecedented to have the Minister of Labour march in a Labour Day parade. That tells you a lot—that they’ve never had a Minister of Labour march before with them.", "Two months later, that same minister is helping his government, the Wynne Liberal government, shut down debate, shut out the voices of labour leaders and workers, and push through legislation that removes independent oversight of health and safety in the workplace, putting thousands of people at risk. Workers across this province are now at more risk of being seriously injured on the job or dying.", "To the Minister of Labour, who had the honour—and it is an honour when you have labour leaders and workers ask you to join them in a Labour Day parade honouring the work that they do on behalf of all of us and that benefits all of us. It’s an honour when they ask you to march in their parade. It’s not enough to show up and march in the parade and pose for pictures; you actually have to protect the people who had asked you to march with them. You have to protect the workers from all across this province.", "Schedule 16 and schedule 17 of this omnibus bill, Bill 70, should not even be in Bill 70, but what that does is basically say that it’s more important for the Minister of Labour to have his photo ops than actually support the people that he marched with on Labour Day." ],

Our proposed package of reforms would, if passed, amend the Municipal Act, the City of Toronto Act, the Municipal Conflict of Interest Act, as well as certain other acts to reflect the current needs of our municipalities and the people that they serve.", "As many in this House may know, my ministry is mandated to review two of these pieces of legislation, the Municipal Act and the City of Toronto Act, within five years of the previous review. Additionally, we also included the Municipal Conflict of Interest Act in our review, which has not been updated substantially since 1983. From this review, we have introduced a robust package of reforms to ensure that these three pieces of legislation work well together.", "These reforms are the result of extensive consultation with both our municipal partners as well as the public. I’d like to thank everyone who offered recommendations on how to modernize the suite of municipal legislation covered by the bill. I’d particularly like to thank the Association of Municipalities of Ontario and partner municipal associations across the province for their input. I’m confident this legislation is a reflection of that advice, as we all strive together to make local government more transparent, accountable and effective for communities in all parts of our great province.", "As you know, Speaker, the Municipal Act sets out many of the roles, responsibilities and powers of Ontario’s municipalities. The City of Toronto Act sets out a similar framework specifically for the city of Toronto, while also reflecting its status as Ontario’s largest municipality. The Municipal Conflict of Interest Act sets out financial conflict-of-interest rules for municipal council members and for members of local boards.", "Municipalities really are the level of government closest to the people. They provide essential front-line services like public transit and recreation facilities, and deal with local issues like fixing roads and collecting property taxes. Our communities need to be strong and vibrant places where people can live, work and raise their families. That means Ontario’s municipalities need to be open, accountable and financially sustainable, and they need to use and have in place the powers to make that happen in a way that respects local responsibilities and circumstances and meets local needs.", "Over the past year and a half, we asked Ontarians for their input on how to achieve this goal. I want to acknowledge the work of the previous minister, the member from Ancaster–Dundas–Flamborough–Westdale, and I want to thank him for his leadership and carriage of this file during his very successful tenure in this position.", "Under his leadership, my ministry conducted consultations across the province for the municipal legislation review between June and October of last year, with municipalities, stakeholders and the public at large. The review focused on three main themes: accountability and transparency, municipal financial sustainability, and responsive and flexible local government.", "During the review, we asked how these important pieces of legislation could be improved, and Ontarians responded. We received more than 350 submissions that identified areas where we could improve and suggested solutions. Almost half of these were from members of the public.", "From all accounts, we heard the legislative framework for municipal governance is working well, but that there was room for improvement. We considered this input carefully, and the reforms we are proposing take into account what we heard.", "Speaker, let me highlight some of the key proposed changes that we are considering.", "One of the key priorities outlined in my mandate letter from the Premier includes working with our municipal partners to support accountability and transparency, and ensuring that they have the powers they need to be flexible and responsive to the needs of their residents.", "This was a main priority for our review as well. We asked the public what we could be doing better to improve accountability and openness in local government. We asked local governments how to improve the current accountability framework, while ensuring that these improvements take local circumstances into account. Our review asked for input on codes of conduct, on accountability officers, on open meetings and on conflicts of interest.", "Municipalities are responsible for determining the process for complaints about codes of conduct, and many of the rules for enforcing them. The Municipal Act currently gives municipalities the option to adopt a code of conduct for members of council and local boards.", "In our review, we asked Ontarians whether their municipality had a code of conduct and if it was working effectively. We learned that while many large municipalities have a code of conduct, many medium-sized or small municipalities do not.", "In order to provide greater consistency in the level of accountability and integrity across Ontario’s governments, we are proposing to require codes of conduct in all municipalities. I’m confident that our proposed approach strikes a strong balance between municipal autonomy and the need to have some consistent guiding principles across the province.", "To ensure that codes of conduct are enforced more effectively, we are also proposing to make changes related to local integrity commissioners. Municipal representatives are expected to perform their roles with integrity and meet the highest standards of conduct. When citizens, members of council and local boards feel that these standards have not been met, it is important that they have the opportunity to voice their concerns. Our proposed changes focus on improving access to integrity commissioners, to ensure that these concerns are addressed. Municipalities would be required to provide access to an integrity commissioner to investigate complaints and provide advice to municipal councillors and information to the public.", "At the same time, we don’t want to create an undue burden on municipalities and elected officials, as there are many small municipalities out there. Municipalities will have the option of pooling resources with another municipality, to share an integrity commissioner if needed, or arranging for an integrity commissioner on a fee-for-service basis.", "We’re also proposing to give integrity commissioners broader powers to give them more flexibility. These changes would, if passed, give them an expanded role, including to investigate complaints; provide advice to members of council and educational information to the public, municipality and members of council; and to initiate investigations related to municipal conflicts of interest and the municipality’s code of conduct.", "Another change that we are proposing would provide better clarity for members of council, local boards and the public on the definition of “meeting.” Right now, I’m not sure what the best way to describe it is. It’s pretty much impossible to describe, and it has left municipal officials, I would say, in a very tenuous and uncomfortable position on many occasions.", "If passed, the term “meeting” would be amended so open meeting rules would apply when a quorum of members is present and they discuss or otherwise deal with a matter in a way that materially advances the business or decision-making of the relevant municipal body. This would provide greater clarity and help ensure that a simple coffee chat between two councillors is not considered a meeting requiring public scrutiny.", "Speaker, this part was important to me. Many of us in the chamber today have a municipal background, and I think it’s important that we, as best we are able, provide some clarity on this issue so as not to put municipally elected people in these very difficult circumstances from time to time.", "Municipalities and certain local boards would also be able to allow for more ways for members to participate in meetings. We’re proposing to provide municipalities and certain local boards with authority to allow members to participate electronically in meetings that are open to the public, for example, via teleconferencing and videoconferencing, rather than requiring them to attend in person. However, in order to help ensure transparency, electronic participants could not be included in the number of members required for a quorum.", "If passed, this change would allow municipalities and local boards to provide for more inclusive participation in council, local board and committee meetings. It would also help make meetings more accessible for members. I’m sure there are a number of people who are elected municipally in Ontario who, from time to time, find they have to travel great distances to attend meetings, and I believe this would be helpful for them as well.", "Speaker, I think everyone in this House would agree that we need to find ways to encourage more women to participate in local government. Currently, women comprise 26% of councillors across Canada and 16% of all mayors. As you know, the member from Kitchener Centre—and she just walked into the chamber, our good friend Daiene Vernile—recently received unanimous second reading support for her private member’s bill, Bill 46, Municipal Statute Law Amendment Act (Councillor Pregnancy and Parental Leave), an act which aims to ensure that women and parents are entitled to take time off for pregnancy or parental leave without fear of being removed from elected office. I think it’s a great opportunity for us to highlight this work by this member.", "I’m pleased to incorporate the member from Kitchener Centre’s bill into Bill 68. I had a good conversation with the member. I asked her how she intended to proceed with her private member’s bill, if she would like to see it considered for incorporation into this municipal package of amendments, and she was more than happy to see that occur. She sees this as the quickest way to expedite her private member’s bill. I thank her for her foresight in bringing that private member’s bill forward to begin with, and I thank her for her foresight in allowing us to incorporate it in this municipal package. Hopefully, upon passage, we will have in place one less, I would say, structural impediment, should this pass, for women making a decision on whether or not they want to put their names forward for elected office at a local level.", "If passed, the bill we are proposing today would ensure offices of members of council would not become vacant because of an absence related to pregnancy or parental leave for 20 consecutive weeks or less. Accommodating parents at the local level sends a strong message that municipal politics can be family-friendly.", "Another review theme focused on supporting strong and financially sustainable local governments. I believe our government has worked very hard to ensure municipalities have access to the resources they need to build the strong, vibrant communities that people deserve, no matter where you call home, because whether you live in the north, like me in my riding of Thunder Bay–Atikokan, or in the GTHA, no matter where you call home, your community is, quite frankly, the centre of your universe. It’s where you raise your family. It’s where you have backyard barbecues with neighbours in the summer. It’s where the local hockey rink or community centre is the hub of activity. It’s where you rely on safe roads or modern transit systems to get to and from work.", "Since 2003, this government has worked hard to reverse the downloading costs of services that drain vital resources from municipal budgets. That led to worsening infrastructure deficits across the province. I remember very clearly being elected in 2003 for my first term. When we were first elected to government in 2003, we identified three deficits that we had assumed, in our opinion. One was obvious, a financial deficit; another was a services deficit; third was an infrastructure deficit. We’ve been working very hard to address that since being elected in 2003 to government.", "It was not a good partnership between the province and municipalities at that time. I had served six years on municipal council in Thunder Bay and have first-hand knowledge of that relationship. It was not good. I say again in here, as I’ve said many times, I think it is the reason that many people made a decision to leave their home communities, run provincially and try to find a better way to represent their municipalities at the provincial level. Instead of a partnership, the previous government fostered an adversarial relationship with local governments. We’ve done much to undo the damage.", "We’ve uploaded many services and costs back to the province. We want to continue building Ontario’s municipalities up, so during our review, we invited input on topics including how existing municipal financial powers can be used more effectively; whether municipalities have the powers they need to plan for, prioritize and fund infrastructure and public services; and what barriers municipalities face in achieving long-term financial sustainability.", "Municipal financial sustainability is important for the health of the province and it’s important for this government. Municipalities provide a range of vital services to Ontarians, including maintaining and expanding public infrastructure such as roads, bridges, water systems and local public transit systems. To deliver on these services, municipalities need to manage their finances effectively.", "We consulted on this at length with our municipal partners. While local governments have a number of options when deciding how to pay for services and projects, we heard that they would like additional powers and resources to pay for these services and strengthen their communities.", "I want to be clear: Our government respects our partnership with Ontario’s municipalities and respects the elected officials who work hard each and every day to build better communities for the people they serve. We worked hard to rebuild trust after the previous government pushed its problems onto local governments.", "As a former municipal politician, I remember those days. That is why, when we work on legislation that affects municipal governments, we do it in partnership, as equals, in order to achieve a common goal that is good governance and strong, fiscally sustainable communities across Ontario.", "I’m now going to turn the floor over to my hard-working PA, the member for Northumberland–Quinte West, who played a valued role in this legislation, including attending and leading many of the consultations across the province. But before I do that, I’m going to highlight just a little bit the municipal sustainability piece. If I could leave those following this debate on television back in their ridings—there are several numbers that I could leave with them, but one would be simply this: When we came to government, the sum total of financial assistance that was flowing to the municipal sector in the province of Ontario was about $1.1 billion. Today, that number has increased to $3.8 billion, a combination of the OMPF, the Ontario Municipal Partnership Fund, the uploads—and when I say “uploads,” and I’m speaking to people in all the municipalities across Ontario, I’m talking about taking back costs out of your municipal property tax base that were downloaded into the municipal property tax base by the previous government. We were left with that legacy when we came here in 2003.", "That downloaded cost—I don’t think we can overstate the importance of the work that we’ve done. In individual municipalities across this province, the total cost of what we have uploaded to them might represent anywhere from between 5% or 8% to maybe as much as 13% of their total tax base, especially in the smaller municipalities that had bridges and roads, those costs, downloaded into their municipal property tax base.", "Can you imagine being a city the size of Timmins? I remember, not that long ago, driving in from the airport into the municipality of Timmins, and the fellow telling me on the ride in—and it’s a long ride from the airport—that most of that road, which was in very rough shape—it was 10 or 20 kilometres long or longer—had been downloaded to a town the size of 50,000 people or so, into the municipal property tax base, by the previous government.", "That speaks to some of the work that we’re trying to do. I know that my parliamentary assistant is going to speak to more of that in his speech.", "I thank you for your time, and I look forward to the debate on second reading." ],

It has been a bit of a long haul, but at the end of the day, we’re here and I’m hopeful that we’ll give this really serious consideration as we move forward. And I thank him for trusting me to work with our municipal partners across the province, as well as members of the public, as we conduct the reviews of the municipal legislation framework. It was fun, in a way, for me because I was able to reconnect with a lot of colleagues in the municipal sector, but also with different other groups right across the province.", "The minister was highlighting a number of issues that this piece of legislation tries to address to make the life of municipalities a little bit easier. I’m going to carry on with that thought in mind.", "One of those areas is the prudent investor standard, that we try to make it easier for municipalities to invest. Currently, a municipality can only invest their funds in a list of eligible investments. We kind of put them in a straitjacket. The proposed changes, if passed, will provide eligible municipalities the option of investing according to prudent investor standards, just like any other investors. Having this broader investment power will allow eligible municipalities to invest in any security in a way that a prudent investor would do, like you and—well, not necessarily you and I, Speaker, as I’m not sure I’m an investor. I depend on somebody to do some investing for me.", "They will have the flexibility to build a diversified portfolio of investments and better adapt to their investments to meet their local risk and return objectives. This is something that municipalities had asked us to consider. As a responsible level of government, we agreed that municipalities should have these added powers. As a former mayor, I know that the best path to building better communities by all of these levels of government is by working together. We can get so much accomplished.", "Another example of how this government is listening to and working with municipalities is around tax sale timing. I know, as a reeve and then mayor of the municipality of Brighton, that we sometimes had difficulty collecting property taxes, and foreclosure was always an issue. In our review, we also took a closer look at the length of time it took before a municipality can start a tax sale, and are proposing changes that would allow municipalities to use a tax sale more effectively.", "The changes we are proposing would provide municipalities with the option to expedite a tax sale of a corporate property that has forfeited to the province to help return these properties back into productive use more quickly. One of the proposed changes would also reduce the time that property taxes have to be owing before a municipality can start a tax sale from three years to two years. I know the minister has heard from communities in the north that three years is too long and that often properties become derelict and lose value, lowering the amount that municipalities stand to recoup. I know that municipalities are very appreciative of this proposed change.", "Based on our conversations with municipalities over the past year, we are proposing a number of changes to generally improve property tax collection and administration. For example, the proposed changes will broaden the range of fees and charges that could be added to the tax roll, to help municipalities with the collection.", "Considering these financial proposals as a package, this legislation, if passed, would provide eligible local governments with the ability to broaden their investment powers and give them the potential for better returns to help finance local infrastructure and front-line services to the public. These measures could have a direct impact on the quality of life in communities right across the province.", "We also heard during our review that some municipalities would like additional authority to raise revenues beyond the property tax base. Our government has a strong record of working with municipalities to ensure that they’re able to provide the services their communities need. As the minister mentioned earlier, as a result of provincial uploads and historic infrastructure investments by this government, support to municipalities has increased considerably over the past decade.", "In 2017 alone, municipalities are benefiting from over $4 billion in ongoing support through the Ontario Municipal Partnership Fund or, as we call it, OMPF; provincial uploads and other provincial initiatives—an increase of $2.9 billion from the level provided in 2003. This represents 13% of all municipal tax revenues in the province. In some communities, particularly small, rural and remote areas, like the areas I represent, provincial support is equal to almost 50% of the municipal budget.", "We also appreciate that many municipalities are facing challenges in dealing with infrastructure needs and accommodating growth, and we have recently responded by increasing the Ontario Community Infrastructure Fund to $300 million per year by 2018-19 to support needed projects in small, rural and northern communities. I would want to add that when the fund was first initiated, it was $100 million, so it’s now going to be increased threefold. I would add that once that fund comes to full fruition in 2018-19, $200 million will be formula-based, so municipalities will be guaranteed a transfer of funds, regardless of their circumstances. That’s something, frankly, that municipalities were asking for. They wanted a predictable level of funding that they can count on from year to year.", "We are encouraging our municipality partners to have local public discussions about what they need to be fiscally sustainable moving forward. We will continue this conversation and hope to hear, broadly speaking, some agreements from municipalities on these issues. At this time, the government is not considering expanding municipal taxation authority in the legislation, but rather will continue to work more broadly to improve municipal fiscal sustainability.", "The final theme of our review focused on ensuring local governments have the power and the flexibility they need to be creative and responsive in providing services to their communities. In our review, we considered municipal service improvements and the challenges or barriers to achieve them. That takes us to the role of community councils, how municipalities are responding to climate change and representation at the regional government level.", "We are proposing an amendment that would, if passed, affirm a municipality’s power to establish and determine the composition of a community council. As you know, the former government, through legislation and with no local consultation, forcibly amalgamated many communities across Ontario. I was a member of that particular class when that happened. We had to rush home and try to form alliances with our neighbours.", "With the stroke of a pen, many autonomous historic communities across the province were eliminated and forced to merge into larger entities. Brighton township, the municipality where I was proud to serve on council—as councillor, deputy reeve and reeve—is off the map today.", "By affirming municipalities’ ability to establish and support the mandate of community councils, this legislation, if passed, will promote restoring power over local decision-making back to the local communities that may have been amalgamated. The proposed amendment in this legislation affirms that municipalities may establish community councils and determine their composition. The amendment states explicitly that a municipality may create community councils, determine the composition of community councils and assign community councils the function of providing advice and recommendations to council, including on budget matters.", "Community councils will be used as a tool to increase local input in the municipal decision-making process. Jurisdictions in Ontario that adopted community councils, like the city of Toronto, the city of Sudbury and others, appear to have increased local input into the municipal decision-making process.", "Speaker, as you know, climate change is one of the most significant changes of our time. Its impacts are already being felt in communities across the province. We’ve seen an increase in the number of extreme weather events, like flooding and tornadoes, more frequent heat waves and more severe episodes of freezing rain. And I think, Speaker, you would agree that just this past summer we had one of the warmest summers in southern Ontario—" ],

I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, that as I talk to my local municipalities—I have eight and one county—that they’re all already quite engaged on dealing with climate change, doing their part.", "We know that local governments need to have the power and flexibility to respond to these challenges that their communities are facing. The changes we are proposing focus on better positioning municipalities to do this effectively. We are proposing to give municipalities the clarity they need to pass bylaws related to climate change.", "Local governments will be clear in their ability to provide for or participate in long-term planning for local energy use, and they would have the option to require green standards in the construction of new buildings in certain circumstances. If passed, municipalities would also be required to adopt a policy detailing how they would protect and enhance their local tree canopy and natural vegetation cover.", "I would just add to that that the Highway of Heroes, and the planting of some 117,000 trees between Trenton and the city of Toronto to recognize every fallen soldier going back through all the wars in Canada, is a huge step that will help climate change, as well." ],

We asked Ontarians if their current regional council compositions were responsive to their communities’ needs, including changes in population growth. As a result of the review—and we did have a lot of input—we are proposing that regional municipalities be required to review the number of council members representing their lower-tier municipalities at least once following every second municipal election. This measure would ensure that regional councils are required to periodically turn their minds to the composition of their own council. They will be able to keep the existing composition or change it, but they will be required to consider the issues and vote on them at the regional and lower-tier levels. This will start after the 2018 municipal election. As someone who comes from an area that has an upper-tier level of government, I know that our municipalities appreciate this change to strengthen democratic representation at the local level.", "We have already taken steps, through the vehicle of the Building Ontario Up for Everyone Act, to move forward on a related change coming out of our review. In that bill, we are proposing a requirement that all heads of regional council, except for Oxford county, be directly elected starting in the 2018 municipal election.", "While the principle of democratic representation is important to us, at the same time, we appreciate the unique needs of municipalities, including counties, across this province. Counties are required to have the flexibility to determine how the heads of council are selected. In cases where it is appropriate, the province encourages counties to consider directly electing heads of council and whether a review of their composition is appropriate.", "In order to facilitate municipal participation in community hubs, we’re also proposing changes to help municipalities use small business incubator powers.

I think that it’s important that we all acknowledge the importance that women play in our local governments. If someone sits on city council, they shouldn’t have to worry about losing their seat during their pregnancy or if they want to take parental leave. It’s an issue that not only affects the councillors, but their families as well. My colleague the MPP from Kitchener Centre, my seatmate who looks after me every day, brought this issue to light in her recent private member’s bill, and we have incorporated it in the proposed changes that we are speaking about here today.", "I want to congratulate Councillor Kelly Galloway-Sealock, a city councillor in Kitchener.

The offices of members of council will not become vacant due to an absence related to pregnancy or parental leave for 20 consecutive weeks or less. I believe that this is a step in the right direction for not only giving our municipal officials the time they need to raise their new families, but allowing them to do so without losing their seat.", "Speaker, I’m going to call it there.

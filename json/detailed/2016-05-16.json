  "text" : [ "Thank you, Speaker. You’ll have to forgive me if I do a little bit of a recap, because it could be that over this busy weekend we just had, a few people forgot where I was at. So I will recap and then continue.", "Basically, the goal of the Climate Change Mitigation and Low-carbon Economy Act, Bill 172, is to create a cap-and-trade system to reduce greenhouse gases and to protect the environment, to help Ontarians transition to a low-carbon economy, and to coordinate such actions with other jurisdictions.", "Let’s be clear: New Democrats support cap-and-trade, but we also support a system that is fair, that is effective and that is transparent.", "Some of the ideas that I will put forward are really to put forward some constructive ideas as to how we can make this bill better than what it is now.", "You all know that I represent a jurisdiction in northern Ontario. Every day or so, I stand in the House, like I did a few minutes ago, and read into the record petitions sent to me by hundreds and sometimes thousands of names. Every week, when I go back to my constituency, I go to the office and there will be another pile of petitions that all say the same thing: “We are being gouged at the pumps in northern Ontario.” We are paying a price discrepancy between other areas of the north, in Sudbury and Nickel Belt, which I represent, and it boggles the mind. It is impossible to justify that bringing gas to Sturgeon Falls is 20 cents a litre cheaper than bringing gas to Sudbury. It makes no sense.", "When we see things that say we will add over four cents in tax on to the price of gas, this has severe repercussions for the people I represent. In most of my riding, there is no public transit. If there was public transit—and in some parts of riding, there is. In Val Caron and Hanmer, there is a little bit of public transit. People use the public transit. There are such great distances that if you can get from Hanmer to downtown for $3, the price of a bus ticket rather than the price of gas, it is worth it and people use it. But in most of my riding, this is not an option that is available. The only option available is to drive your car.", "So, when we see a tax on gas in areas of the province where you have no other option, it is hitting people in the pocketbook. It is hitting people who already have a hard time making ends meet. This is not fair, and this is something that people are really opposed to. I can show you stacks of petitions. Although I’m not allowed to use props, I can show you stacks of petitions. Every week, I get the same thing. They come from all over my riding, and they are angry about the price of gas.", "Now we have a program of the government that will further increase the price of gas in areas of the province that have no choice. Don’t get me wrong; people in the north support a green economy. People in the north want to make sure that we have a healthy environment and that we protect our environment, just like every other place in Ontario, but they don’t want to be the ones who pay for somebody else to enjoy, and this is the path we seem to be going down.", "The other complaint I receive the most often is about the price of electricity. My riding was one of the lucky ones where the smart meter—I have a hard time calling them “smart,” Speaker, and you’ll understand why. They did not work. For months that turned into years, a lot of people—hundreds of people—in my riding got hydro bills that made no sense. A hydro bill for a camp that has burned down—it does not exist anymore—and you get a $300-a-month hydro bill. How can that be? The camp is gone, yet the meter still reads and still sends reports.", "We had this couple from Hanmer in my riding—a $2,000 hydro bill for a camp where the breaker has been turned off for the winter. How could that be? Well, I’ll thank the previous Ombudsman for the great work he did. He did receive over 100 complaints from my riding as to how poorly those smart meters were performing in Nickel Belt. Now they have been taken down. We still have smart meters attached to our houses, but they’re not being used; they’re not being read. They can send the information they want. This is not how we get billed anymore. But a lot of people went through a lot of hardship before we got there.", "I’m putting that forward because you have to take into account the ever-increasing cost of electricity. When you’re talking about a low-carbon economy and you say “no more fossil fuels,” we all get this. At the same time, you have to realize that when hydro doesn’t work, then we back up.", "The last thing I want to put on the record—because I see my time is almost gone—is Mattagami. Mattagami First Nation has put forward a request for a small generating project. The request for proposal came out that they wanted 200 megawatts of renewable energy, and 75 would be into hydro, run-of-the-river. They put forward a request, a good proposal, in collaboration with OPG, and it got turned down. It got turned down because they say there was no room on the grid to carry their little project of 7.5 megawatts, I think it was. How could that be?", "Mattagami is at the end of the line. They have power failures all the time. I’ve read into the record before weeks after weeks of power failures. Yet, when they put forward a solid project that would bring them run-of-the-river so that there would be increased power on the grid, they are told that there’s no room on the grid. Why? Because some portion of the grid has been promised to a developer down south, when nobody knows who that is and we know full well they will never come to Mattagami.", "There is something wrong. Let the people of the north have their fair share. Treat us like you would like to be treated. Then there would be a whole lot more support for Bill 172.", "I thank you, Speaker, and I appreciate your patience with me." ],

And this government has a very large bureaucracy. The last thing it needs is to add hundreds of people to the offices around Queen’s Park to deal with cap-and-trade.”", "Another point that’s been made in the debate is that there is a lot of cap-and-trade fraud in many of the countries where this has been introduced. It makes me very nervous that that could happen. Again, at the end of the day, we all need to focus on programs and services that are truly going to move the needle: things that are going make a difference to climate change, to our environment and to the health of the Ontarians who are going to be paying these bills.", "Mr. Speaker, as I said earlier, I’m going to talk for 20 minutes later this afternoon.

The simple fact of raising the cost of things to force people to stop using them is a fine idea if you have alternatives.

She had a nice quote: that it was “reasonably likely” going to result in something. Well, this is called questions and comments, and I have a question for the government: How are people in northern Ontario reasonably likely going to pay the bills caused by this when there is no alternative? There is no public transit. We had daily bus service; that was cut. We had daily train service in northeastern Ontario, and guess what? That was cut. We have people now who can’t afford the hydro to heat their homes, and this government comes out, “Well, we’re going to have to heat everything with hydro.” We are looking desperately to find other means to get out of using hydro to heat our homes, because we can’t afford it, and yet this government says, “Use more hydro.”", "Again, that doesn’t reflect what people in our part of the world are actually feeling.

There will be a dedicated fund, estimated to be $1.9 billion, which we can invest in your local homes, we can invest in infrastructure in your communities, we can invest in transmission lines, so that the First Nations in Mattagami will actually have an opportunity to get off diesel. Because one of the greatest climate change initiatives we will get out of the north is that if we take community after community from diesel—which is a fossil fuel. I would like to remind the members that diesel fuel is a fossil fuel, and the objective here is to get out of the fossil fuel business and get into the electricity business.", "I know that First Nations across Ontario in remote communities want us to have a dedicated fund which will allow us to get transmission into their community and get them off very, very expensive hydro. That’s what this bill will do.", "If you took the members from the opposition’s point of view, where you had a tax-and-dividend scheme, the member from Nickel Belt’s constituents would be spending more for gasoline and we’d just give them a cheque back. If I use their argument, they would do nothing with that cheque because there are no options. What we’re saying is, there will be a dedicated fund, we will give them options and maybe an option will be that we could get all the guides and your remote fishing communities on four-stroke engines because the climate change benefit of being on a four-stroke outboard as opposed to a two-stroke is an incredibly important direction, or maybe some of those 4 by 4 F-150s—let’s start developing pickup trucks that are hybrids so that we can use gas more efficiently." ],

  "text" : [ "Thank you for the opportunity to speak on this bill. I will be sharing my time with the member for Ottawa–Orléans and the member for Sudbury.", "I just want to offer some comments about the targets of the bill. What is the fundamental premise of the bill? The fundamental premise is that reducing greenhouse gas emissions is vital to fighting climate change. That’s the bottom line.", "Ontario has set targets for reductions to greenhouse gas emissions relative to our 1990 levels. We have committed to a 15% reduction by the year 2020, a 37% reduction by 2030 and an 80% reduction by 2050. What this act is going to do is it’s going to enshrine those targets in legislation so that they’re just not things that we’re talking about or speculating about; it’s things that we’re going to do by virtue of legislative authority.", "Another key element of the bill is the development of a climate change action plan. The bill requires the government to prepare a plan detailing the actions that it’s going to take that will enable Ontario to meet our emission reduction targets—the ones that I’ve just set out.", "We have worked with our New Democrat colleagues to strengthen the government’s accountability in reporting our progress under that action plan. My thanks to the third party for that.", "Amendments were made in committee, after hearing from the third party, to require that the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change publish a progress report every year rather than at least every five years. That’s very, very important because we want to stay on top of this file, we want to stay on top of those targets, to manage the targets.", "A third element of Bill 172 is the cap-and-trade provisions. The bill now before the Legislature provides a strong foundation for Ontario’s cap-and-trade program and establishes the framework for its implementation.", "I want to say a few words about transparency and accountability because that is very important in the massive piece of legislative change that is contemplated in this bill. The government has included a number of other elements in the proposed legislation to ensure transparency and accountability. The bill would require an annual report on the funds credited and charged to the greenhouse gas reduction account as well as a description of initiatives for which the funds were used. It would require government to publish reports on the use of cap-and-trade proceeds, which will be invested in the various initiatives that reduce or support the reduction of greenhouse gases.", "Under the proposed legislation, before any amounts are paid in respect of any initiative, the minister is required—required—to review the initiative and provide an evaluation of that initiative to Treasury Board. As you all know, appearing before Treasury Board is a very vigorous exercise. In his or her review, the minister must consider a number of things: the potential emissions reduction of the initiative; how the initiative relates to achieving the province’s greenhouse gas reduction targets; how the initiative relates to other potential planned or funded initiatives; and how the initiative relates to the climate change action plan.", "The bill, as amended in committee, also now includes a requirement for the minister’s review to consider whether the initiative is also likely to assist low-income households and vulnerable communities with their transition to a low-carbon economy. In summary, this government recognizes the disproportionate impact that carbon pricing can have on low-income households and supports the steps that we are going to take to transition them to a low-carbon economy.", "Mr. Speaker, I’m going to let my colleagues now pick up the debate from here, but just let me conclude. This is a transformative piece of legislation, and that’s why my comments about transparency and accountability are so important, and why those elements of the bill are so important to the successful implementation of this act." ],

  "text" : [ "I would say that it’s always a pleasure to rise and speak in this House, and particularly on Bill 172, the Climate Change Mitigation and Low-carbon Economy Act, 2016. I know my colleagues will be sharing a little bit their thoughts on how good this bill is, but I just want to bring maybe a different perspective today. Most of us in this House—and I say “most of us”—understand that the climate is changing and that the actions we take today will impact our children and certainly our grandchildren. The actions we are taking and putting forward in this House are to address the changing climate. We see greater variation in what were normal weather patterns. We’ve seen an increase in tornadoes, in the destruction they can bring, such as the tornado that brought destruction to Goderich in 2011.", "All of us in this House should know by now that it is well established that climate change is happening and it is man-made. I hope that all of us can agree on this fact. In particular, I hope that the PCs have truly come around to the fact that climate change is a reality and we must start to mitigate its harmful effects now.", "I was present at their convention a few months ago in Ottawa, when their leader curiously stated that he believes in a carbon tax. That was quite interesting, that he decided the environment was something that indeed needs protection. It’s interesting, given his presence in a federal government that cut back on protecting our environment; that rolled back protection for our lakes and our rivers; a government that turned off the federal funding for the Experimental Lakes Area.", "Where was their leader then? He was complicit in part of the reduction of environmental protection and the muzzling of scientists. And where has his caucus been on this issue? Many of them had petitions on their websites that sought to block Bill 172 even after their leader announced the party would support a carbon tax. They even updated their logo, which has questionable aesthetics, but to highlight that they are committed to the environment, they included a leaf of some sort in their logo.", "All this smoke and mirrors on their part is to hide the fact that their newfound change of heart is to hide their leader’s previous record on the environment as a Harper backbencher. While the environment should be a non-partisan issue, their conversion on the way to Damascus seems to be more painted in politics than principles.", "So, while I do hope some of my colleagues on the other side of the House truly have embraced a new attitude on protecting the environment and supporting this bill, I remain skeptical about their newfound ideals past the next election.", "Interjections." ],

If we were all running towards a wall that was dead ahead of us, and you were running at it full speed, when do you slow down and change directions? Is it at one metre before? Is it 10 metres before; 100 metres before? Is it when you were a few kilometres back and you had people telling you, “Don’t worry, the wall is just a mirage. Keep running; it’s okay. Everything stays the same. Just keep running”? When do you actually veer off?", "There’s a phrase in the English language, and I think it’s the most dangerous phrase in the English language: “We’ve always done it this way.” Well, if we’ve always done it this way and we keep running towards that wall without veering off, what’s going to happen? Keep our fingers crossed and hope that it’s a mirage?", "At some point, we have to recognize that we have to veer off. We have to change what we’re doing. We have to realize that our current path towards the wall is going to end up with one thing, and that’s not what we want.", "Bill 172 is allowing us to veer off from running towards that wall because none of us want to hit that wall. I don’t think anyone in this Legislature wants to hit that wall.", "But it was interesting, Mr. Speaker, to hear from the opposition earlier talking about higher costs. I recognize that everyone is concerned about higher costs. We have plans in place to mitigate those costs: a $325-million Green Investment Fund just to start. But those higher costs were all they could talk about. They didn’t talk about higher temperatures and how that will have an effect. We see those effects happening right now in my own riding of Sudbury: floods in Sudbury. We could go to Toronto. Right across our great country, climate change is having an effect now.", "Are we still running towards that wall, knowing? Are we not veering? Do we not want to make that change?", "That’s what this bill is doing. It is allowing us to start with the veering away so we can ensure that our children and our children’s children, and I think if we look—we’ve been talking a lot about First Nations: seven generations. They can look back and say, “This is when we made the change. This is when we veered.” And that is so important. It is so important for us to be able to do that, because what we’re doing with this bill—I think there are two pieces that are key to recognize. We want to have reduction targets and action plans, and the cap-and-trade program will be using the proceeds to help both one and two.", "So if we’re looking at our emission reduction targets and action plans, this bill—establish in a statute the government’s existing greenhouse gas emission reduction targets: 15% below 1990 levels by 2020, 37% below 1990 levels by 2030 and 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. We want to establish a framework for reviewing and increasing targets, as well as for the establishment of additional interim targets.", "So yes, those are some lofty goals that we need to accomplish, but they are important goals. If we don’t start trying to achieve some type of reduction and some type of target, what’s to say, then, that we just go and pick a number out of the air? Fortunately, we can actually see in the air now because we don’t have smog days anymore in Ontario. What was it? In 2014 was the last time we had smog days in Ontario. As a former asthmatic, I think that’s something that we should all be proud of, and for all people who want to be able to breathe our air and drink our water, what we’re doing as a government I think is important.", "It’s also important to recognize that this government is preparing this climate change action plan to enable the people of Ontario to achieve our targets and announce progress reports annually—sorry, not annually, but every five years. I think that’s important too, to recognize that while we’re reducing, we’re also going to be monitoring to make sure that every five years—that if this is what our goal is supposed to be; as I said before, 15% below 1990 levels by 2020, 37% by 2030—we need to have targets, and that’s what we’re talking about.", "If we’re looking at some of the provisions when it comes to cap-and-trade and the use of those proceeds, this bill addresses, as I said, the emissions calculations; the reporting and verification; the requirements to submit allowances and credits to match the GHG emissions; registration of mandatory, voluntary and market participants; the creation and distribution of allowances and credits; the establishment of an offset program—and that’s important for those of us in the north—trading; fees; and market operations and oversight, including provisions for a strong compliance and enforcement regime. Those are key.", "But when you’re looking at the initiatives that are set out in this bill that may be funded from the greenhouse gas reduction account that’s going to be established from cap-and-trade proceeds, Mr. Speaker—please indulge me as I talk about this list—eligible initiatives, including those relating to energy use—again, if we go back to my initial analogy, if we’re still running towards that wall, ways that we can help veer off is looking at using the proceeds from this fund, from the cap-and-trade fund, from the Green Investment Fund and from the $1.9 billion that’s going to be there for energy use.", "Land use and buildings: I think that’s something those of us in the north really need to talk about. We have many buildings where their windows need to be replaced, you’re still on electric heat, and now we’re going to have incentives to go geothermal and many other programs. Those are the types of things that we’ll be able to invest in—", "Interjections." ],

This Green Investment Fund is $325 million. It is huge for us in the north, because we know that we’re going to have avenues that we can actually start renovating our homes and those types of things. Land use and buildings is one of those things that we can actually use these dollars for.", "Infrastructure: We often hear the words “resilient infrastructure.” As I talked in the opening of my speech, I said we had flooding in Sudbury. Part of that relates to not having the necessary infrastructure in place to deal with these 100-year storms that are not just happening every 100 years; they’re now happening every few years, unfortunately. So what we need to do is start investing in our infrastructure, helping our municipalities deal with these frequent storms. That’s something I know that we, as a government, have recognized and have made sure that we will allow our municipalities to invest in.", "Transportation is another key one; transportation and public transit, especially in the north. I know we’ve heard from opposition members that the public transit system isn’t always as readily available, but that’s something that we can start looking at and working with municipalities and making it available. Rather than always saying, “No, no, no” and keep running towards that wall, Mr. Speaker, you start having the conversations. That’s what we’re doing with this.", "Industry: I’ve spoken with mining. I’ve spoken with the forestry sector. I’ve spoken with the steel sector. All of them understand that we need to do something and all of them recognize that we need to have a dialogue. They’re all doing what they can, Mr. Speaker. I’m very pleased and proud to be able to come from a mining community that just this past week had a session on what they called the Sudbury Protocol. The Sudbury Protocol is looking at the regreening efforts that Sudbury has made since the 1970s: over 12 million trees have been planted. Hopefully I got that number correct; otherwise, my constituents will be calling me and letting me know. But 12 million trees have been.", "We can now drink from 330 lakes. Back in my day and back in the 1970s, we had 90 of those 330 lakes within our city boundaries that were dead lakes. We’ve regreened. We’re growing. We’re making sure that we’re investing. I’m very proud to come from a mining community that actually recognizes the importance of being green, Mr. Speaker.", "Agriculture and forestry is something that we’ve also been working diligently with. I know the Minister of Agriculture has been working with farmers. The forestry sector: I’m meeting with them a little later today. They’re actually very interested in the offset piece—again, inside Bill 172—and I know many of these amendments were also brought forward by the opposition and were taken and put into this.", "Waste management: Education and training is another piece that I think is important, Mr. Speaker. I know my time is getting close to running out, but education and training is so key to make sure that—as I said in my analogy, we’re all running towards this wall. I said “you” initially, Mr. Speaker. Not you running, but in terms of the analogy. But we’re all running. Every single person in this province is running towards that wall. How we decide as a society and as a government to veer off and change, to make those necessary changes, to ensure that we actually mitigate the current climate change that we’re seeing and do our best to adapt—I think education and training are key.", "emissions even more.", "I’m very, very pleased to be able to stand here today to talk about an amended bill that is doing the right thing to really stop us running towards that wall, veering off when we’re supposed to, to make sure that our province is doing what we can to ensure that we’re living in a better, cleaner, safer world." ],

Obviously, they’re running. I think the real problem we have is that every time they get closer to being able to make ends meet, the government sticks their foot out and trips them again. This bill is one of those trips again that, in fact, is going to make it more and more difficult for them to live and to make ends meet.", "The first speaker was speaking about an action plan. As I listened to the member from Beaches–East York, he was talking about that action plan and how we’re going to get out of fossil fuel use in this province and we’re all going to go all to electricity. Most of my people can’t afford the electricity they have to buy now. I think them all going to electricity just isn’t feasible, and, again, another foot is coming out. As people are trying to make ends meet, another government foot is tripping them up.", "Then we hear another one that says, the member for Beaches–East York—oh, no, that’s the one that was out of fossil fuel.", "We heard speaking about the buildings in Sudbury need new windows, and they’re still on electricity. Now, how does that fit with this plan that the government is doing? We’re going to put them all on electricity, but in Sudbury they want to close down the electric-heated homes and go—I would presume—to a fossil fuel to heat them up so we can be able to pay the bills to heat our homes, because presently, going with hydro, as the member suggested—it’s far too expensive to heat those homes with hydro." ],

Frankly, I would call it social engineering when you read articles which I will get to that were in the Globe and Mail today with some of the proposed changes the government wants to bring about.", "In my recent trips around the north and as northern critic, I’ve got to tell you that there’s a lot of uncertainty when you talk to businesses about what’s going on with the cap-and-trade plan. In December, I, along with our leader, Patrick Brown, did a week-long road trip starting in North Bay and heading all the way up to Dryden and back. We made many stops along the way and had lots of discussion about various issues. It’s interesting how often concern with the uncertainty with regard to cap-and-trade came up.", "For example, we toured Hemlo gold mine and had a good look at that large open-pit mine at Hemlo. Their big concern was the uncertainty of what it was going to cost them for cap-and-trade. They can’t change the price of gold. All they can do is manage their costs. They were guessing that it might cost, for that one mine, about $3 million a year. That extra cost shortens the life of the mine. It can even lead to the shutting down of the mine.", "We drove up, as I mentioned, to Dryden, stopped and toured Domtar there, which is a big pulp and paper plant. They were very concerned, stating that they have already done a lot of work to reduce their greenhouse gases. They were concerned about whether that would be recognized and uncertain about what it would cost them, again. They were guessing millions of dollars. Of course, the forest sector is one that’s very much in sync with the environment. I’ll get to that in a few minutes. A pulp mill is very important for all the various forestry operations in a given general area, because it relies on lumber mills; it relies on chips. It’s important to have a pulp and paper mill to have a successful forestry sector in a given geographic area, so a lot of concern there.", "Just last week, I was up north in Timmins. I happened to run into some people from Goldcorp checking into the hotel, and the number one thing that came up was, they were actually looking at their energy costs and concerned with the uncertainty with regard to cap-and-trade and just what it was going to cost. They mentioned that they had been talking to deputy ministers, and assistant deputy ministers and even they don’t have answers for them, which makes you really concerned, especially given the track record of this government when it comes to trying to plan things out and engineer things. You just need to look at other great schemes they’ve come up with. Whether you believe in what the goal is or not, you look at the Green Energy Act: Sure, it’s a good idea to switch to more green energy, but look at the way this government did it.", "We need to look at the Auditor General’s report of 2015 where it points out that “electricity consumers have had to pay $9.2 billion more ... for power from renewable electricity projects over the 20-year contract terms under the ministry’s current guaranteed-price renewable program than they would have paid under the previous procurement program.” To make that clear, that means you could have achieved the same result but saved $9.2 billion. That money has all gone on to hydro bills around the province. They didn’t accomplish anything more. They just spent an extra $9.2 billion.", "When it comes to this cap-and-trade program, it’s about the way they are going about it, and do you trust this government with their various schemes they are coming up with?", "We’ve heard from the environment minister in a report in the newspaper that he thinks we should not be using natural gas, that that’s a bad thing. I tell you, if you visit the folks in Parry Sound–Muskoka—personally, I’d love to be able to heat my home with natural gas, because it’s by far the most efficient way to heat your home. They want to switch everyone to pure electric. Well, in my riding, if you do that, people can’t afford to heat their homes, especially with the huge increases, the 80% increases, we’ve seen in electricity bills. People won’t be able to heat their homes.", "My next question for the government would be: Are you going to outlaw wood heating as well? Because a lot of people in my riding of Parry Sound–Muskoka heat with wood, partly because they can’t afford the electricity costs. You want to social-engineer them all on to only electricity. There are a lot of people in my riding that simply will not be able to afford to pay their bills with that plan of yours. The idea of doing away with natural gas, something that lots of people would love to be on, just seems a little bit out there, shall I say.", "We heard the Minister of the Environment say last week that he wants to shut down nuclear in 10 years. Well, nuclear power, just in case he wasn’t aware, is 60% of the electricity of the province of Ontario, and I would argue it’s a clean energy that is not emitting greenhouse gases except in the construction phase of a nuclear plant. And yet, the Minister of the Environment wants to shut down 60% of the electricity generating, the baseload in this province. So he’s switching everybody to pure electric, doing away with natural gas, but doing away with 60% of the generation that is clean, green generation.", "You wonder why we’re a little skeptical about this social engineering scheme you’ve come up with. Especially based on your past track record, I think it’s fairly obvious. Again, with your other scheme, your Green Energy Act, the Auditor General’s report was talking about how much extra consumers are paying:", "“Given the current comparatively high prices that consumers pay for electricity in Ontario, it is especially critical that Ontario determine how it will meet its future electricity demand in the most cost-effective manner. Ontario’s residential and small business electricity consumers have already had an 80% increase in the electricity portion of their bills, including global adjustment fees, between 2004 and 2014. In particular, global adjustment fees, which are the excess payments to generators over the market price, amounted to $37 billion”—that’s a B; it’s hard to get your head around—“from 2006 to 2014, and these payments are projected to cost electricity consumers another $133 billion from 2015 to 2032.”", "The numbers are so big, it’s hard to get your head around them. That’s the Auditor General of Ontario, not me, that’s coming up with these figures.", "Last week up in Timmins, another gold mine that we toured wasn’t big enough to qualify for the Northern Industrial Electricity Rate Program, so they are faced with paying the global adjustment. They pointed out that the global adjustment was 50% of their electricity bill—50% of it—and that they were paying—", "Interjections." ],

  "text" : [ "I guess this government just doesn’t care about whether they create any jobs in this province or whether people can afford to pay their electricity bills, based on the crazy schemes they’re coming up with.", "The Minister of the Environment and Climate Change, in his speech—I believe it was at the Economic Club last week—stated that you shouldn’t buy a car with an internal combustion engine; that you should only buy electric vehicles. That’s so out of touch with the reality of rural and northern Ontario, where at least 50% of the people are driving pickup trucks, and that’s the reality of what they need: You don’t have public transit, so you have to rely on an automobile. And yet, in this fantasy world of the Minister of the Environment, he’s going to miraculously switch everyone to pure electric vehicles.", "I would ask the Minister of the Environment or the government members what that means for the auto sector in Ontario, which is billions and billions of dollars, and thousands of jobs in Ontario. Have they thought that out? How many Teslas are made in Ontario? How many pure electric vehicles are made in Ontario? How many hybrids are made in Ontario?", "I was thinking—I mean, I drive a hybrid. I drive a Ford Escape hybrid, which is a very good vehicle. I do it mainly to try to save some money on gas. I had a Ford Fusion hybrid prior to this vehicle, which I put a few hundred thousand kilometres on around Parry Sound–Muskoka.", "I did ask the library, because I wasn’t familiar with any electric or hybrid vehicles, which ones might be made in Ontario, seeing as we have a really important auto sector, in case the government members aren’t aware of that. There’s a few thousand jobs. Which ones are made in Ontario?", "Well, I did find one. I’m sure it’s a beautiful vehicle. I’m not slamming the vehicle at all; I bet it’s a beautiful vehicle. The Lexus RX450h is made in Ontario, I think near Cambridge, starting at $68,950, probably about $80,000 when you get it nicely equipped. I’m sure it’s an absolutely beautiful vehicle. I just don’t know how many of my constituents in Parry Sound–Muskoka are going to be able to afford that, even with the $15,000 subsidy that you want to hand out.", "The approach the government is taking—it’s so complicated. I had a citizens’ group come to me in the last year—I think it was called the Citizens’ Climate Lobby—and I sat down with them. I was trying to understand the cap-and-trade system a bit. So I’m asking them questions about cap-and-trade. In the end, they said that what they would like to see is carbon pricing, an amount per tonne that could go up over time, and carbon pricing that is completely revenue-neutral so it doesn’t hurt the economy.", "That is an approach that has been taken by BC since 2009, I believe, and it hasn’t hurt the economy. The economy has still grown. It has worked, and it’s simple and it’s transparent. This approach the government has come up with is so complicated, it’s so open to manipulation and it’s so open to fraud. And in other jurisdictions where we’ve had it, it hasn’t worked. So that is the approach this government has come up with. It’s just not a great approach.", "So this citizens’ lobby group wanted to have revenue-neutral carbon pricing, and what they were asking for was an actual cheque to go back to every citizen, so that a citizen would realize, “Okay, we’re having to pay a bit more for whatever—for gas for my car—but I see I got this cheque back at the end of the year that is the refund.” So whatever the government collects gets fully refunded to the citizens of the province. That achieves two things: The people recognize that it’s not just a tax, and it doesn’t hurt the economy. Very importantly, it doesn’t hurt the economy. I think BC has shown that.", "That’s the approach the PC Party wants to bring in, slightly different—not necessarily a cheque coming back—and details still to come. But revenue-neutral is absolutely critical so that—in BC I know that for rural areas that absolutely depend on automobiles and where there’s no other choice, they do have some sort of rebate for people in rural areas. They have corporate and personal income tax reductions so that every dime collected in the new tax is refunded to people and doesn’t hurt the economy.", "In this government’s case, it’s a brand new tax—billions and billions of dollars—and then they’re going to come up with all these crazy schemes of how they’re going to spend your money. I mean, they’re talking about getting into retrofitting buildings. That’s really, really expensive, to retrofit buildings. I happened to replace the windows in my home last year. I guess I was a year too early to do it because maybe, if you do it next year, you’re going to get some subsidy that the government decides upon. Some people are going to get it; some people are not going to get it. It’s all part of the social engineering that this government has come up with.", "We just need to look, though, at their track record when they go and come up with these various schemes, their record of management, which has not been good. One of the other ideas they’ve come up with is electric charging stations for vehicles that, I guess, are going to be paid for out of the new tax, except that they couldn’t find anybody in Ontario to build these electric charging stations, so we’re going to hire Quebec Hydro to put in these electric charging stations. Now, there’s a good idea: We’ll send all this newly collected money to Quebec. That’s a really bright idea.", "Also, we’re part of the Western Climate Initiative, and California has been doing this for a few years more than we have. So what’s going to happen—an independent report came out last week—is that in Ontario we’re going to have to spend money and send it to California. The estimate from the report that came out, I believe, was over $300 million in the near future, rising to billions of dollars in a few years—so billions of dollars. I don’t know; I guess I’d ask the government: Is that US dollars or Canadian dollars? We’re going to be sending the money to California so they can make emission reductions or improve their situation, instead of spending the money here in Ontario, as is the PC plan: to keep all the money, not hurt the economy, spend the money in Ontario and not leave it up to the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change to come up with some crazy schemes that he tends to come up with.", "I’m sure the natural gas industry sector in Ontario will be putting out some statements about what they think about your social engineering as you try to get people off of natural gas.", "I actually think it makes a lot of sense to switch vehicles that run on normal gas to propane and natural gas. I owned a truck once that I converted to propane—again, to save money, but also it’s much cleaner than normal, regular automobile gas. But this government seems to have decided that natural gas is bad now—I’m not quite sure why—and they think, according to their report, that ethanol and biodiesel are better than natural gas or propane. I’m not sure whether that’s in fact correct.", "As the critic for the north, one of the things they talk about is more public transit. Well, what has this government done in the north? They shut down the only passenger rail service that we have in northern Ontario. They shut down the passenger rail service that went right through my riding. I would say it wasn’t being used that much, but I think it was more a sign of how badly the government was running it in that they weren’t providing good service. They shut down the only public transit we have in northern Ontario, and now they’ve lessened the amount of bus service in northern Ontario.", "I’m not exactly sure how you’re supposed to get around in the north other than with an automobile, and at this stage in time, I don’t think you’d make it on a pure electric vehicle. I’m just not quite sure whether the government has really thought through this at all.", "When I was in Timmins this past week, another thing that came up—we had a round table with the chamber of commerce, and they brought up cap-and-trade, very concerned with the uncertainty and how little businesses in this province really know about it. As I mentioned already, I talked to a large gold company. They’re talking to deputy ministers and assistant deputy ministers, and they can’t get answers from them—huge gold companies.", "The chamber of commerce just this week said, “Please delay it for a year so you get it right, or have a better chance of getting it right.” I would say, based on this government’s track record, the idea of them actually getting it right is maybe dreaming. I kind of hope this is one of the government’s stretch goals and that they aren’t really going to do this plan, because it’s so ripe for problems going forward.", "I just want to close with the article in today’s paper, in the Globe and Mail, where it talks about the social engineering: “The Ontario government will spend more than $7 billion over four years on a sweeping climate change plan that will affect every aspect of life—from what people drive to how they heat their homes and workplaces—in a bid to slash the province’s carbon footprint.", "“Ontario will begin phasing out natural gas for heating, provide incentives to retrofit buildings and give rebates to drivers who buy electric vehicles. It will also require that gasoline sold in the province contain less carbon.” They’re going to switch everybody to geothermal systems.", "I’m running out of time here, Mr. Speaker, but I would really like to know, for the many residents in my riding, as they go to new rules, switching everybody to pure electric—and I can say that in my riding, most people are trying to figure out how to get off electric because it’s so expensive. I’ve been asked this by constituents recently: Are they going to ban wood stoves in the province of Ontario? Because in my riding, so many people—in fact, I heat my house with wood. I just finished cutting next year’s wood supply, as a matter of fact. Probably 50% of the population in rural Parry Sound–Muskoka heats their homes with wood, so I would like to know from the government: Is that part of their plan? Are they planning on banning heating with wood as well as with natural gas?", "Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I’m pleased to speak." ],

We have northern members here who, time and time again, have debated that issue. The cost of energy and the cost of transportation in the north is disproportionate to other areas of Ontario.

He talked about owning hybrid vehicles. I think that’s fantastic, because the member is showing with his pocketbook and with his actions that he has got at least one foot on the right side of this issue. I appreciate that very much, because if others in the north were to follow his example and more people were buying the hybrid vehicles, then there would be a greater incentive for more hybrid vehicles to be built in Ontario—and mark my words, it’s coming.", "But secondly, Speaker, we talked a lot about the implications that he suggests on jobs and the economy. Let’s not forget that it’s anticipated that the movement to a carbonless economy is in the $7-trillion range. You can be a denier and take yourself out of this marketplace—when you think that in the technology economy, an upwards of about $2-trillion economy—we are at the forefront in Ontario of taking a leadership role in the carbonless economy, and we’re going to embrace that fully going forward.", "We talked also about issues like biodiesel. Why is biodiesel better than natural gas? Understand that biodiesel can be made from renewable resources. You can take waste products, such as waste vegetable oil from restaurants, and turn it into a propulsion fuel, rather than letting it go into a landfill where it will create methane and create carbon dioxide.", "I know this, Speaker, because I’ve said before in the House how my own car was an old Mercedes 300D that ran on vegetable oil from my restaurant. It allowed me to avoid having to use fossil fuel, a non-renewable resource.", "Let’s also be clear: By joining the Western Climate Initiative, we are sharing the economy across North America. We’re not protectionist, as the member would want us to be, only allowing Ontario to spend money in Ontario on Ontario companies. We have a shared economy that doesn’t know borders, and that’s the way we need to be in the future." ],

Some of them are talking about getting on to electricity to heat their homes; others are being a little more realistic and saying that there are people who weren’t able to get off electricity because of the cost. That cost is all about getting on to something before the sciences allowed you to make the conversion in a practical and sensible way.", "Getting into electric vehicles before the science gets there just means that either you won’t be driving or getting around the province—and maybe the member from Beaches–East York doesn’t realize this, but there are no transit systems in the north and rural Ontario. We’re lucky enough to get any money from this government to put roads in, which we don’t—because there’s no gas tax that goes back to help these rural municipalities if they don’t have a transit system.", "And again, integrated plans—on one hand, they’re cancelling transit systems; on the other hand, they’re talking about how they’ll be able to enhance them with all this money they’re taking.", "Time after time, everything we hear from this government is conflicting.

I appreciated that his remarks weren’t just written speaking notes. He actually talked about the people of northern Ontario, people I can relate to. A couple of his remarks really struck me.", "We were having a conversation just before, and he had said how he had driven through my riding. Well, I drive through his riding on a weekly basis to get here. I used to be able to take the train, which was much more environmentally friendly. Guess what? This government cancelled the train. We used to be able to take a bus. The bus would stop in North Bay, and you’d have about 15 or 20 minutes to catch the bus to go to Toronto. Now you stop in North Bay at 2 o’clock in the morning, and you have to wait for a couple of hours, in the middle of winter, to catch the next bus. So they may as well have cancelled that, too. I’m fairly young, in the grand scheme of things, but I have seniors who have to go to medical appointments and, effectively, they can’t use that bus in the middle of winter, in a cold bus station.", "So there are two examples of how the government talks about, “Oh, we’ve got this big fund,” but that big fund always seems to dry up when you come to the meat-and-potatoes things that impact people in northern Ontario.", "Another example is that the first $100 million that was announced was to retrofit homes and stuff, but it was going to be administered by Enbridge and Union Gas. Now we find out that they don’t really like Enbridge and Union Gas. Very few people in northern Ontario and rural Ontario heat with natural gas, so that fund was not available to them.", "Again, what people see and what this government says don’t match." ],

I just wanted to say how important the forestry sector is to the environment in Ontario and get this one statement on the record: “In the long term, a sustainable forest management strategy aimed at maintaining or increasing forest carbon stocks, while producing an annual sustained yield of timber, fibre or energy from the forest, will generate the largest sustained” climate change “mitigation benefit.” That was from IPCC Fourth Assessment Report: Climate Change 2007.", "In northern Ontario, we have a huge forestry sector. I just hope this government recognizes how important that forestry sector is and that we need it to be healthy.", "Interestingly enough, last week when I was up in Timmins and talking to one of the gold mines, they actually had a huge block of forest that they manage, and they’re also hoping that that forest is taken into consideration when it comes to their cap-and-spend calculations.", "Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to get on the record that the forestry sector is very important for the province of Ontario, and I hope it’s taken into consideration in the considerations for this bill." ],

  "text" : [ "It is an honour for me to rise today to offer some thoughts on Bill 172, the Climate Change Mitigation and Low-carbon Economy Act on behalf of the people who I represent in London West.", "Reducing greenhouse gas emissions, managing risks and adapting to climate change, and easing the transition to a low-carbon economy: These are, without question, some of the most important public policy questions that we debate as a Legislature here in this province, but they are critically important for the country and for all nations across the globe.", "The consequences of not taking action on climate change are being felt, however, not just at the provincial, national, and global levels but also very directly, at the community level.", "In my riding, in my community of London, there are a myriad of organizations that have formed to work on climate change. There are around 40 organizations that recently came together as the London Environmental Network. That network was created about a year ago. Almost half of the organizations involved in the network are involved in climate change issues. These range from climate action organizations like Citizens’ Climate Lobby Canada London Group; Transition London Ontario and Post-Carbon London, to renewable energy organizations like Green Energy London and London District Renewable Energy Co-Operative, and sustainable transportation organizations like London Cycle Link and London Electric Vehicle Association.", "Municipal governments in London and across the province are taking steps to prepare for the impact of climate change. Citizens recognize that this is a high priority, and municipal governments are equally concerned.", "In London, city staff worked with Western University researchers in 2011 to conduct a major study on the vulnerability of municipal infrastructure to climate change. That report, that came out five years ago, concluded that the city of London can expect to experience more frequent and severe precipitation events in the future, which will seriously impact various public infrastructure.", "Just in the last two years, in London, we’ve seen several major floods that are not only putting pressure on public facilities, but are also dumping raw sewage into the Thames River. In June of last year, a massive one-day rainfall overwhelmed London’s pollution control plants, leading to the dumping of almost 109,000 cubic metres of partially treated sewage into the river. Already, in the first three months of 2016, London has dumped almost 60,000 cubic metres of raw sewage and 91,000 cubic metres of partially treated sewage into the river, which is enough to fill about 60 Olympic-sized swimming pools.", "The leakage of this waste into the river system has contributed to the explosive growth of algae blooms in Lake Erie, which is where the Thames River ultimately flows. It has created dead zones in the lake. It has killed fish and plant life. It’s releasing toxins into the water supply, which my community and many other communities around the Great Lakes rely on, and is causing disruption to the entire ecosystem.", "In 2014, the Middlesex London Health Unit conducted a study on the health effects of climate change at the local level, and the report that was released by the health unit was the first of its kind in Canada in terms of its focus on local impacts and on the health risks associated with climate change for London residents. Some of those risks that they identified included more smog-related diseases, increased heat-stress-related morbidity, and more rapid spread of vector-borne illnesses like West Nile virus and Lyme disease.", "In that report, the health unit also made a number of recommendations for the development of a climate change and health action plan, for extensive education and outreach throughout the community, for evaluation of existing adaptations that are designed to protect Londoners from climate-related hazards, for continued surveillance and monitoring of climate-sensitive diseases, for a greater understanding of the differences between urban and rural areas of our community in terms of the impact of climate change and, finally, to deal with the huge uncertainty that we all feel about what is going to happen and how to deal with this uncertainty by developing strategies and policies and programs that address multiple risks concurrently.", "The adverse weather events that we have experienced in London—these floods not just in London, obviously, but across the province; the out-of-control wildfires that we have seen in northern Ontario and Alberta; the extreme heat waves—are not acts of God, Speaker. These are the direct result of human activity that has led to climate change. The reason we are having this debate before us today about this legislation is a recognition of the significant environmental, economic and political costs associated with climate change and the potentially devastating consequences if we don’t take action.", "That’s why New Democrats have been so invested in this legislation that’s before us today and why we have been so strong in our support for an effective cap-and-trade system. That’s why my colleague the member for Toronto–Danforth, who I know is held in great esteem by members across the way, devoted so much effort to introducing amendments to improve this bill. New Democrats appreciate that some of the amendments that were brought forward by my colleague have been incorporated into Bill 172, and certainly that is a departure from what typically happens at committee, when all the amendments that are brought forward by the NDP are voted down. However, even the few amendments that the government accepted have not gone far enough in ensuring that this bill is going to do what we need it to do.", "There is an urgency to take action. Climate change is real and the stakes of not taking the right action are high. We have already seen how the government’s failure to listen to expert advice and to implement effective environmental actions has contributed to public cynicism and has undermined public commitment to advance environmental initiatives. We can’t afford another green energy debacle that tainted the public’s view of a green economy.", "We need to get the most extensive buy-in possible. We need to engage all Ontarians in supporting and recognizing the need to take climate action. That’s why New Democrats have been so insistent that the cap-and-trade system that is being put in place by this bill must be fair, it must be effective and it must be transparent. These are the same three principles that we talked about during second reading debate, these are the same three principles that underlie all of the amendments that were brought forward during the committee, and they are the same three principles that we still feel are lacking in this bill.", "By “fairness,” we mean legislation that will unite Ontarians, as I said before, behind a climate change initiative, rather than divide them. Certainly, when there is a feeling that some people are being asked to do more than their fair share and others are getting a free ride—when that kind of a feeling is in place—that can be very divisive. We have argued throughout the debate on this legislation that the cap-and-trade system must not place a disproportionate burden on low-income Ontarians, because that is not fair. Low-income Ontarians pay a much greater proportion of their income on home heating, on gas for their vehicles than the rest of us.", "We have heard from this side of the House—from my colleague the member for Timiskaming–Cochrane and my colleague the member for Nickel Belt—about the unique realities of people who live in northern communities across this province, whether they are low-income or not. They have very few options available to help them reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. We’ve heard about the lack of public transit, the lack of train service from northern Ontario down to Toronto. Northern Ontarians don’t have access to transit. They don’t have any other choice but to use their cars to get around. This makes it very difficult for them to reduce carbon emissions, and they are going to end up carrying a disproportionate burden of the cost of a cap-and-trade system.", "The same thing, closer to home for me in my community, goes for renters in apartment buildings. London West has a number of apartment buildings. The tenants, in many cases, don’t control their own thermostat. They don’t have the ability to reduce the amount of heat that they use. They don’t have the ability to bring in energy efficiency retrofits. People like tenants, who tend to be low-income, will be disproportionately affected by this cap-and-trade system.", "We urged, throughout the committee, that Ontario look at some of what is being done in other jurisdictions, which really is the norm for the implementation of a cap-and-trade system. BC provides a special rebate for low-income families. California requires that 25% of cap-and-trade revenues must be spent on programs that benefit disadvantaged communities. Alberta’s new carbon tax plan includes a consumer rebate which will offset the impact of carbon pricing on low-income households. Throughout the consultation on this bill, as it was being drafted, throughout the public input that came forward during public input, a number of organizations reinforced this point: The burden has to be shared fairly, and low-income Ontarians should not be penalized by the way that the cap-and-trade system is designed.", "During clause-by-clause, I know my colleague the member for Toronto–Danforth introduced a series of amendments to do exactly that: to make the system more fair and to spread the burden more evenly. He moved that financial and investment assistance be made available to low- and middle-income residents. That amendment failed. He moved that the bill be amended to allow the provision of rebates or tax credits for low- and middle-income households. That amendment failed. He moved that the minister should identify communities that have a disproportionate burden. That amendment failed.", "Finally, he was successful. He secured agreement from the government that the only wording that they would support is that the climate action plan “consider the impact of the regulatory scheme on low-income households and must include actions to assist those households with Ontario’s transition to a low-carbon economy.” Certainly, that is a baby step forward. We would have liked to have seen stronger action, but it does address that issue of fairness that is so critical for New Democrats.", "Another aspect of fairness concerns the support to enable workers who are engaged in high-carbon industries to transition away and move to other work. Again, my colleague had moved an amendment that there be assistance provided to people working in high-carbon industries to make a just transition, where their livelihoods are affected. Once again, that amendment was not supported.", "I want to talk a little bit about transparency, which is the second key principle, which is also, in our view, somewhat lacking in this bill. The government says that the $1.9 million that’s generated through cap-and-trade revenues will be dedicated to climate action; however, the greenhouse gas reduction account is not a separate, special-purpose account at all. It is actually an accounting procedure that allows the government to spend the money on anything it wants, including—potentially—deficit reduction. There’s no guarantee that new cap-and-trade revenues will increase funding for climate change action, no commitment to record the inflows and outflows of money.", "During the input on this bill, New Democrats listened. My colleague the member for Toronto–Danforth listened carefully to what the Financial Accountability Officer had to say about this bill. The FAO felt that it would be useful if the minister’s review and evaluation that is provided for in the bill is structured in a way to maximize accessibility to the Financial Accountability Officer under the Financial Accountability Officer Act. For that reason, the NDP introduced multiple amendments to strengthen the cap-and-trade bill to include all of the FAO’s recommendations to increase the transparency and accountability of the cap-and-trade system.", "Unfortunately, again, Liberal members voted against these amendments. Not only that, but they claimed that the FAO’s concerns had been incorporated into their bill. The FAO later said that he had been misrepresented in the way that his recommendations had been framed by the Liberal Party. He said, “In claiming that the reporting requirement was ‘what [I was] looking for,’ the member misrepresented my opinion and level of participation in the development of amendments to the bill. Furthermore, the member did not ask me whether the requirement was consistent with my recommendations.”", "There are a number of other concerns about this bill related to transparency, and that is the lack of accountability over the programs that are going to be funded by the program fund that is created. We know that a number of people, including former Liberal finance minister Greg Sorbara, have raised concerns about the accountability and oversight over the dollars that are generated by the cap-and-trade system.", "Finally, I want to move to the third principle, and that is effectiveness. Again, the NDP proposed a number of amendments that would have improved the effectiveness of this legislation in actually dealing with climate change. We’ve seen too many examples in other jurisdictions where carbon pricing initiatives and cap-and-trade programs have been introduced, and because of the way that they have been implemented, they have not actually succeeded in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.", "Once again, my colleague the member for Toronto–Danforth introduced a number of amendments that would have very much contributed to greater effectiveness for this legislation and would have made the bill much more effective in actually achieving the targets that are stated.", "We know that dealing with climate change is important. We know that Ontarians want to see the government take action on this. We also know that they are a little bit jaded about the ability of the government to actually implement what it says it is going to do. So New Democrats will be continuing to monitor this legislation closely. We will be continuing to push for climate actions that are fair, that are transparent and that are effective, because, as I said at the outset, we can’t afford to do anything less. Our province cannot afford for us to show any less leadership than that. We must deal with climate change; we must reduce greenhouse gas emissions." ],

I was in here earlier, as well, when the official opposition was speaking on this bill, Bill 172, the climate change act.", "I think it’s another example of a piece of legislation that’s before us where there is far more commonality than there is something that distinguishes us. I know that the third party and the member from London West just spoke. They obviously support something. I’m not exactly sure where they’ll land on this. And we have heard, relatively recently, that the official opposition, the members of the Conservatives and their leader, have come out supporting, I guess it’s fair to say, a carbon tax or a carbon pricing mechanism of some kind. We find ourselves in a position where all three parties are acknowledging that there is an issue, acknowledging that there is a problem, and they are somewhat trying to distinguish themselves in terms of what the approach should be. That is as it usually is in this particular Legislature.", "I would say that there is a long history, actually, of agreement on this particular file. You can go back to the election of 2003, when all three parties of the day and all three political leaders of the day committed to the closure of all of the coal-fired generating facilities in the province of Ontario. Thirteen years ago, almost, or 14, when party platforms were being prepared, all three political parties and all three leaders of the day had made the same commitment to close coal. We did it. I know the file quite well. Two of the five coal-generating facilities were in my riding of Thunder Bay–Atikokan. We’ve moved forward and done that—the single biggest climate change initiative in North America.", "I simply say that as the conversation on Bill 172 unfolds and continues, I would just remind visitors and viewers who are interested in this file that there’s probably far more commonality on this issue than some might be led to believe as they follow the debate." ],

They consider the government’s approach and the things that they’re going to be doing to be quite unbelievable. Quite frankly, when I woke up this morning and read the Globe and Mail, I had the same reaction that my constituents in Lambton–Kent–Middlesex had to the fact that the government is planning to phase out natural gas for heating, provide incentives to retrofit buildings and give rebates to drivers who buy electric vehicles.", "I just think there’s a sense of disbelief. My perspective on this issue is that I think we have a government here that is completely out of touch with the way families in this province are trying to deal with day-to-day life and affordability.", "There’s grave concern, especially in southwestern Ontario, as the member from London West knows. I hope the NDP will advocate for the perspective of the auto industry in the province. We’ve been decimated in Ontario when it comes to manufacturing. Now we have a government that refuses to allow business and the free market to drive innovation and demand. This is a government and a Premier and a cabinet who are essentially telling the few remaining manufacturers in the auto industry that it’s her way, this government’s way, or the highway.", "This plan is going to take thousands and thousands of dollars from families’ pockets and it’s going to kill jobs in this province, and I want that to be on the record." ],

The unprecedented event—317 frozen services and 50 water main breaks—cost the city $2.1 million to remedy. The city had to replace about 1.4 kilometres of water mains because of breaks. This crisis emptied out the reserve fund for the city that they had built up over 10 years, so now they’re in dire consequences. They did apply to the Liberal government for some emergency management funding, and sadly, that was denied. No assistance was given for that.", "What happened in Owen Sound paints a bigger picture. According to the Ontario Sewer and Watermain Construction Association, which I met with this morning—there’s a reception here later this afternoon that all the members can go to and be updated on what’s going on. They share with me that the infrastructure deficit is between $20 billion and $40 billion. Its impact is felt through water main breaks and, most importantly, in a threat to public health and safety.", "In our conversation I talked about how it would be great to be seeing some money go into this that is preventative and is going to create jobs and help our economy, rather than a lot of blunder about what may happen or may not happen and the money that may get spent here.", "The environment minister, when challenged by my colleague from Huron–Bruce, Lisa Thompson, really doesn’t ever come out and say what the cost is going to be. Again, it’s “Just believe us. Just trust us that we know better than you, and at the end of the day it’ll all work out okay.”", "Well, at the end of the day, we’ve gone through that with the Green Energy Act. A whole lot of things in that Green Energy Act didn’t come through as they were purported to when they rolled it out—against the wishes of democracy, by the way. They took way all of the rights of municipalities to be able to vote whether they want them or don’t want them in their backyard—I’m referring to wind turbines. So Mr. Speaker, if we’re a little sceptical, you will hopefully appreciate that a little bit.", "Most of our water system was built in the 1950s, with some dating back to the 1870s. If we invested $1 billion in that industry alone, we would create up to 47,000 jobs. Consider that in comparison to the $700 million we lose to leaky pipes and the cost of energy and the resources dealing with those types of breaks. Underinvestment has major implications on our environment, economy and health.", "The government needs to develop a credible plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions but also protect taxpayers and the economy. That balance is so integral that we have to do it. It isn’t one or the other. It isn’t trying to put out spin and suggesting that if you don’t vote for this bill you’re a bad person, you don’t care about the world, you don’t care about our economy, you don’t care about climate and you don’t care about those pages sitting in front of you. No, it’s a case, again, of needing to do this credibly. We need to understand: If they’re going to do this, what is the impact going to be? Is that money that they’re going to collect actually going to go to impacting the environment and the climate in a positive way, or is it going into a slush fund, as many people have challenged and questioned the government on?", "Cap-and-trade is a new tax on your energy bills and it’s going to add taxes to virtually every consumable you can think of out there. One of my constituents came up to me just recently when talking about this and said, “The government can spin this, the Liberals can spin this, however they want, but any money from me as a taxpayer is a tax. You can call it a revenue tool. You can call it anything you want, but if it’s coming out of my back pocket to go to the government coffers, it’s a tax.”", "He was very concerned, at the end of the day, about what this tax is actually going to do: “What is it going to do for me as a taxpayer and a constituent and a resident of this great province of Ontario? Can you guarantee me that every single dollar is actually going to be put towards action that will improve our climate?” Frankly, Mr. Speaker, I couldn’t say yes to that because at the end of the day I don’t believe that that fund is going to be set up or that it’s going to be accountable. Part of that is my five-year track record here of this Liberal government, which has collected a lot of money—they’ve had record revenues—and yet they still incur more debt than they ever have in our history.", "Families have already faced hikes between $1,000 and $1,400 per year. Some 60 households in my riding of Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound alone had their hydro shut off in the fall of 2014. Small manufacturers are going to be hit with $170,000 in new energy costs. The Ontario Chamber of Commerce estimates the hikes will shut down one in 20 manufacturers.", "Another study by the major power consumers of Ontario also raised concerns over the fact that we’re paying the highest energy rates in North America. That’s indisputable, Mr. Speaker. This isn’t something we’re making up. This isn’t just opposition. This is just an actual fact of reality.

I think even if the Liberals were honest, they would admit to that as well.", "The other one that I keep bringing up in this House when we’re talking about energy is our schools and hospitals. They will have tough decisions to continue to make when the rates go up yet again. People don’t always connect the dots. If those energy rates are doubling and tripling, that is a fixed cost to those institutions. At the end of the day, they have very few pots that they can actually cut. So it comes back down, typically, to nurses in a lot of cases but also front-line staff and a lot of the great people who are in the support mechanism of a hospital or a school that face those cuts.", "Just think about it, Mr. Speaker: If an average school board pays about $4 million a year in hydro rates, then this will add another $1 million to that expense. Again, where do they find that $1 million? Typically at the front line. Sadly, in my riding of Bruce–Grey-Owen Sound, that represents—and I’m going to talk about this in a little bit—the actual education assistants. We have already lost 78, which were eliminated in the last year. You can’t tell me, Mr. Speaker, that there are less students with special needs the day after they made this decision than the day before. At the end of the day, they’re making choices. That’s the government putting a school board into a bit of a box, saying, “We’re giving you no more money.”", "But people aren’t, as I said earlier, connecting the dots: that it’s because of these increasing energy rates. Again, they’ve quadrupled in the last number of years, and we’re predicting—or they’re telling us from across the aisle that these are going to actually at least double again in the next four years. So we’re back to looking at what those impacts are.", "The same in health care: We’re cutting nurses, we’re cutting front-line care workers, because that operating budget has to be balanced. In legislation, a hospital cannot run a deficit, so they’ve got to start looking and saying, “Where are we going to do this to balance our budget?” It’s typically, sadly, the front-line care which impacts people the most across the board. At a time when this government is closing hospital beds, cutting seniors’ medication and slashing funding for doctors, more hikes, particularly energy hikes, would seriously undermine patient care and front-line care as well.", "Right now, everyone is concerned that the Liberals are getting this wrong. I don’t see a lot of organizations coming up and saying, “Bill, this is a wonderful thing. You should be supportive.” I certainly don’t have the chamber of commerce; I don’t have the Canadian Federation of Independent Business. I don’t have those people who are, again, looking out for the long term and the benefit of all consumers, all taxpayers and all constituents that this is a great thing.", "Minister Murray, in my mind, and what I hear from my constituents, is misguided. He has bought into this and he’s going to sell it, regardless of what anybody says—what rationale we can bring, what groups bring, what experts bring. He has got his mindset, and that’s going to be his legacy, come hell or high water, good or bad for the benefit of the people of Ontario." ],

I would ask: Why would we, again, continue down the path of following California and send $3 billion annually to their economy as opposed to our economy?", "I’m starting to run out of time so I’m going to flip back a little bit to talk a bit more about nuclear. I can’t fathom that this Minister of the Environment wants to get rid of the industry that actually produces 60% of baseload power for this great province. It’s emissions-free. It’s clean. It’s green. It’s baseload. It’s good jobs. It has a huge ripple effect in the manufacturing sector. It drives the economy of our province. It employs 45,600 people; $2.5 billion is the amount the nuclear industry generates in direct and secondary economic activity in Ontario every year.", "In 2016, this government, the Liberal government, actually announced that they were going to refurbish the existing fleet of nuclear reactors at both Darlington and Bruce Power. Yet the environment minister comes out and says that within 10 years he sees it gone. Maybe that was just him, not talking to his colleagues, not following scripted notes, but that raises big doubts for everybody. How can a government go down a path and say, “We’ve committed to this,” but then the environment minister comes out and speaks? There’s either something going on behind the scenes we don’t know about, or he needs to step up clean and put it in black and white that unequivocally our nuclear industry will move forward.", "He’s also talked—interesting, the same environment minister—about getting rid of natural gas. There’s a lot of work going on in three municipalities, Huron-Kinloss, the municipality of Kincardine and, closer to my heart, Arran-Elderslie, that do not have natural gas now. A lot of agricultural communities, the big grain dryers, they’ve been working extremely hard. In fact, they’ve signed an agreement with a company to bring natural gas, which is going to give them parity, the ability to compete equally with the rest of Ontario, and the rest of the country, frankly.", "Now we have an environment minister saying, “No, no, no, we need to get off of natural gas.” Most residents that have it, I think if you polled them one-on-one and said, “Do you want to get rid of natural gas to this cap-and-trade scheme?” and give the facts to them, I think it would be an unequivocal, resounding “Absolutely not.”", "At the end of the day, I’m not certain where this minister gets these ideas. Is he just trying to spin? We cannot afford to do environmentalism photo ops and try to sell our great public a bill of goods. We need to ensure that we know what we’re doing and that there are actually viable plans in place.", "The minister announced this just a month ago, after he announced the $100-million green fund to use natural gas to fight climate change. So again, I’m not certain. Minister Murray said, “This investment will help” keep “Ontario on the path toward a low-carbon future.” In the last election, they pledged $200 million to bring natural gas to rural communities.", "Mr. Speaker, I’m just not certain. Is it yin and yang? Can we not get our stories straight? Is it trying to deflect and defer, or is he just fundamentally, “I am going to do this because I have the power to move forward”? We can’t afford that. We’ve done it with the Green Energy Act and we’re all paying big prices for that. No one is denying that we need to be taking action, but it needs to be done in a balanced manner.", "Natural gas is a model for the world. Canada’s own environmental scientist and esteemed energy thinker, Vaclav Smil, has called it “fuel for the 21st century.” Why is this Minister Murray replacing what works with what doesn’t? Why does this minister think he knows better than an environmental scientist? Who do the people of Ontario trust, I ask you, Mr. Speaker: Glen Murray, the Minister of the Environment, or an environmental scientist who says we have to have natural gas as part of our mix?", "I have tried to suggest in here that we want some balance. We want to know that we actually are doing something that is going to help. We’re not going to stand here and tell you we’re going to solve climate change for the world when that’s not a fact that we can back up—although Minister Murray seems to think so. We’re certainly not going to just go out and do environmental opportunism when it’s people’s lives at stake.

Of course not. It is a global problem. We need to act as citizens of the planet. But as a developed country, and one that has built its economy on contributing for generations to greenhouse gas emissions, we have to be cognizant of that and we have to acknowledge that it is our responsibility to do the right thing, to play a role in setting a standard, setting a precedent, and also supporting those developing countries in their journey towards a low-carbon economy.", "It is imperative.

Something is definitely changing drastically. As some of the members on the government side have pointed out, especially the member from Etobicoke North, if you travel and go to other countries, you can see the results of some of these tragedies, whether it be earthquakes from fracking or whether it be mudslides or torrential rain or tornadoes.

You get credits, and you can sell your credits, if you don’t use them, to other companies. Well, my fear is that if you sell these credits to other companies, they’re going to use them as opposed to doing something about reduction themselves. If the credits are cheaper to buy from another company and use rather than doing preventive measures on your own emissions, then I think that’s going to be a negative and a drawback.

We wanted some accountability and some tax relief; they aimed for less accountability, less transparency and less tax fairness.", "Their cap-and-trade scheme will not effectively tackle climate change, and they can’t guarantee it will. That’s one of the concerns we have. It’s not just optics, Mr. Speaker. We need to be doing things that are going to make it a better life for Ontarians. What we see is that this will actually make life more complicated and less affordable for Ontarians, and increase the cost of doing business in our province across all walks of life.", "Ontarians are already being bilked out of billions for hydro. In fact, the Auditor General says we’ve overpaid for electricity by $37 billion between 2006 and 2014, and we’ll be overcharged by another $133 billion by 2032.", "Our leader, Patrick Brown, has already stated in this House that we’re going to send $3 billion a year to California by the year 2030. Just think of what $3 billion could do for our health care, for our hospitals and for our education system if it was left here in Ontario.", "The member from Sudbury said we’re going to hit a wall, and it’s a mirage. I would ask him about the debt hole that they continually scream towards and don’t veer off or put the brakes on. He said this bill is going to fix the planet. Mr. Speaker, I respectfully suggest to you that this bill may help in some ways, and hopefully there are some ways if they ram it through, but at the end of the day it’s not going to fix the planet." ],

  "text" : [ "Good afternoon, Speaker. As always, it’s a privilege to be called upon as one of the 107 voices in Ontario’s provincial Parliament.", "This Bill 172, An Act respecting greenhouse gas, will enact the Climate Change Mitigation and Low-carbon Economy Act.", "If I may, Speaker, allow me to state right off the top that New Democrats were looking forward to supporting a cap-and-trade approach in the fight against climate change. We wanted a system that would be seen by almost everyone to be fair, effective and transparent. We were optimistic that the Liberal members of the committee on general government would be open-minded. We were hoping they would see fit to listen to valid suggestions. We were expecting them to adopt reasonable amendments which would have made this bill more fair, more effective and more transparent. But, Speaker, I’m reminded of Paul Newman’s famous quote from the movie Cool Hand Luke: “What we’ve got here is a failure to communicate.”", "When this bill was discussed at the committee level, New Democrats put forward a number of amendments designed to improve the language of the bill. The Liberal reaction to those NDP amendments has left many of us dispirited, disappointed and disillusioned.", "The Liberals have been talking about doing something on the climate change file for the past eight or nine years. They’ve had five Ministers of the Environment in that time, and we thought we finally had one who knew what he was talking about. We put our faith in that minister. I still have faith in that minister, Mr. Murray, the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change.", "So I am befuddled, absolutely befuddled, as to why our suggestions on ways to make this bill more presentable were ignored by the Liberal members of that committee. How can this bill be seen to be fair, effective and transparent when there’s nothing in here that addresses the inequality and disproportionate burden that this bill will have on low-income families? How can this bill be seen as fair, effective and transparent when there’s nothing in here to offset the extra costs this bill will have on families in the more remote areas or the northern regions of our huge province? This bill is modelled on legislation already in place in Alberta and British Columbia as well as California. So why didn’t the Liberals follow those models and take low-income families into account?", "We all know families struggling just to put food on the table. They have to get by financially and they have to use more of their limited incomes to pay for fuel, to put gas in the family car or the family pickup. This bill should have had a provision that a proportion of the cap-and-trade revenues would go for a rebate for those most in need. This is the model adopted in British Columbia. This is the plan that will soon be in place in Alberta. The law in California mandates that at least one quarter—25%—of cap-and-trade auction revenues must be spent on programs that benefit what they term as “disadvantaged communities.”", "Speaker, this bill will see all of us paying more for our fuel. In our more remote communities, diesel has to be hauled in to run the generators that provide the power. These hardy souls don’t have the option of hopping on a subway or taking a GO train. They have no alternatives. They will be disproportionately disadvantaged.", "You can’t take a cookie-cutter approach to climate change. You have to make exceptions. You must look at the big picture and not penalize those who can least afford it. That’s not just New Democrats saying this. The Canadian Environmental Law Association called for a legislative requirement to use revenue from the cap-and-trade program to counteract the impacts of the program on low-income communities. They suggested that the California example of 25% to start with, but possibly more, should “be used to mitigate the impacts ... on low-income, First Nation and other marginalized communities.”", "So, Speaker, it didn’t seem to me to be an unreasonable request to the Liberal members on that committee that studied this bill to consider this as a matter of some significance. After all, their bill is based on others already in effect and already taking such action. But no, they wouldn’t. They wouldn’t have it. They wouldn’t have any of it.", "So I ask you, Speaker: Can the language before us today be even remotely seen as fair, effective and transparent? I think not. I think it’s looking more and more like a Liberal cash grab. It will be a slush fund that the Liberals will be using to scratch their way out of debt on the backs of the most vulnerable of Ontario’s citizens.", "New Democrats—in Ottawa and in our provinces—have always been champions of the environment. We believe in lowering the greenhouse gases that have contributed to climate change. We recognize the crisis our planet is facing. We don’t wish to see the Earth’s average temperate jumping by two degrees. We expect irreversible harm would result. That’s why we say it is so important—so absolutely vital—that we get this right the first time. We favour taking the politics out and putting some common sense back in.", "I mentioned last week, Speaker, that I’m very proud to have five grandchildren now: four girls and a boy. I want to leave this planet in better shape for them than it is right now. I’m sure I’m no different from anyone else in this chamber. We don’t want to sit back and watch the world destroyed by pollution. We don’t want to sit back and do nothing as our citizens in most need fall further and further behind.", "We have an opportunity right here and right now to correct a mistake. There’s no shame in admitting to a mistake. There is honour in correcting a wrong. It is wrong that, so far, the Liberals haven’t turned our attention to the details in this bill, details that harm our citizens living in northern and remote communities, our citizens living at the lower end of the socio-economic scale. We shouldn’t burden them with more costs. We should provide a rebate for their extra costs, and the Liberals can do it with a stroke of a pen.", "I know they’re anxious to pay their bills and show a balanced budget before the next election, but why not use some of this new revenue stream to offset the added bite that this bill will take out of the wallets of those who can least afford it? Think about it. It’s the right thing to do.", "Of course, Speaker, it would also be the right thing to do to make sure that Ontario’s Environmental Commissioner had a voice and a role to play with this new bill. Right now, she’s completely disregarded. She needs access to information so the cap-and-trade system can be properly assessed, so we can measure the effectiveness of this program, and so we can judge whether we’re doing the right things.", "The Financial Accountability Officer says he won’t be able to tell whether the government will actually spend the cap-and-trade revenue on new greenhouse gas reduction initiatives. Speaker, the purpose of the bill is to create a regulatory scheme to reduce greenhouse gases to protect the environment, to help us transition to a low-carbon economy and to coordinate such actions with other jurisdictions as part of a global response to climate change.", "Who’s to judge the success of that initiative? I would suggest the Environmental Commissioner, the Financial Accountability Officer and the Auditor General among others, as well as the general public. If the public doesn’t like what it sees, how it’s being rolled out, how their money is collected and spent and why, then the public will have the final say. Believe you me, Speaker, when the public sees how these Liberals are using these funds with no accountability, the public will indeed have the final word. Actually, Speaker, it’ll be two words: “You’re fired.”" ],

I sat as we went through amendment after amendment being proposed by the third party, and we accepted them. Maybe not precisely the moment they came forward, but we worked with them in order to craft an amendment that would work for all of us.", "In fact, in one amendment we were agreeing with them to go forward with it, but after an hour and a half of filibustering by the official opposition, we forgot what the motion was and we actually voted against it. We were able, through our initiative with legal counsel and the Clerk, to be able to get that motion back in another place because we were co-operating absolutely fully with the members of the third party. I’ve heard the minister repeated times give credit where credit was due to the member from Toronto–Danforth, notwithstanding his histrionics today, but giving credit because we worked together on it.", "I’d get this criticism if it were coming from the members of the official opposition because we didn’t accept any of their motions because there were no amendments there that would have done anything to improve the bill. In fact, the cruel irony of what the member from Windsor–Tecumseh has to say about the one amendment he talked about, the 25% going to low-income households—a noble objective, but what that in effect would do is take our cap-and-trade scheme and turn it into a tax-and-dividend scheme for 25% of the proceeds involved, which puts him now firmly in the camp—at least 25% of him—of the members of the opposition party who want tax-and-dividend programs.", "It’s absolutely important: This is not a social income distribution system under cap-and-trade. As noble as that objective is, this is about reducing greenhouse gases, and that’s why those kinds of amendment had to be rejected as we did reject the amendments associated with adaptation, because that’s not the intention of this bill." ],

I’ve heard a lot of things that certainly interest me, in different members’ perspectives on this bill and how they figure it’s going to work or not going to work. I think we should go back and get an idea of just exactly what cap-and-trade is, because that definition has maybe been lost a little bit.", "Under a cap-and-trade scheme, the government sets gradually decreasing limits, or caps—that’s where the “cap” comes in—on the amount of greenhouse gas emissions allowed from companies that meet a certain threshold. In Ontario, that threshold will be 25,000 tonnes for major emitters. And for major emitters, that will be something that will—a definition will come out for who is a major emitter.", "Companies that exceed those limits must purchase emission allowances from companies that come in under the cap. That can be a dangerous part of this whole thing. These purchases, or trades, put a market price on carbon. Companies can also exceed their caps by purchasing offset credits, which, in Quebec, include capturing methane from manure storage facilities and landfills.", "Despite the concerns of industry, Speaker, the government has rushed to table this bill. They intend to ram it through—of course, that’s what we’re seeing here—to get their cap-and-trade scheme, which was mentioned by the member from Beaches–East York, up and running and generating new revenue by January 1, 2017. Ontario’s scheme will be linked to those already operating in Quebec and California under the Western Climate Initiative.", "Speaker, the government intends to raise $478 million from this cap-and-trade in 2016-17. By 2017-18, the Liberals will increase cap-and-trade revenue to $1.9 billion. That’s actually up from their projections of $1.3 billion. This revenue will cover their spending spree on the Green Investment Fund as well as other major projects and programs that are supposed to be outlined in the government’s upcoming climate action plan.", "Speaker, in this province, we’ve had so much experience with the Green Energy Act—not good experience at all. This is another scheme that was intended to fill in or produce electricity and reduce greenhouse gases, and it was called green energy. The difficulty with this business is that when the wind isn’t blowing and the sun isn’t shining and these wind turbines aren’t producing and the solar panels aren’t producing, you have to have gas-fired generators online to take up the slack. So what’s green about it? You’re putting pollution back in the air.", "With all the subsidy money that has been spent on these turbines, they only produce about 4% of the electricity being produced in Ontario. All those turbines you see out in the country—they’re the most visible. From Essex, right up north, along the lake, along Huron county, into parts of Wellington county, which I represent, here it is, less than 4%, with all those turbines in the air. It hasn’t been a success at all, except if you happen to own the company that’s putting the wind turbines up. So it has been a terrible failure.", "They continue approving these applications. In fact, Speaker, whether you know or not, they’re actually going to put one up between a couple of airports up in Collingwood—terrible decision. I would hate to have trouble in a small airplane and have to dodge those things or get into some bad weather where you can’t see them—if you’re in a small airplane trying to land at that airport.", "The proposed cap-and-trade scheme would cover roughly 150 emitters and would operate within three-year compliance periods, the first being 2017 to 2020. The government will set an overall limit on emissions, and both sell and give free allowances to companies to emit up to that limit. Each allowance is equal to one tonne of greenhouse gases. According to the Liberals’ budget, they will set the initial carbon price at $18 a tonne. During the compliance period, emitters would be required to meet caps that decline between 4% and 5% a year. If emitters cannot meet those caps, they must purchase allowances to ensure they hold enough allowances to equal their permitted emissions during the compliance period. Some trade-exposed industries, like the cement, steel and chemical industries, have received their free emission allowances and therefore will not face higher costs to meet declining caps. However, the government is requiring the natural gas and petroleum industries to purchase all of their emission allowances during the first compliance period. That is why the cost of natural gas, gasoline, diesel and propane will go up.", "Speaker, this is of great concern to my riding and certainly many ridings in rural Ontario and many ridings in northern Ontario because we depend on some of these fuels to supply electricity to where we live and some of the industries we are providing. There’s a number of diesel-powered generators, as I said before, in my area, powering grain operations because now, unfortunately, it’s cheaper to do that than buy hydro from Ontario Hydro. It’s more cost-effective. Unfortunately, they are putting pollution into the air, and they know that, but there comes a time when, if the books aren’t balancing, you have to do something sometimes that maybe is not what you should be doing. But you still have to pay the bills. As we see with more of these things happening throughout Ontario, this type of thing is going to continue.", "I also worry, Speaker, as we’ve seen—and this has been brought up many times in the House today, at least by this side and the third party—in an article that came out over the weekend in a local newspaper, that even this government is having an issue with this whole energy business because now we find out that they want to get rid of natural gas in a number of years. The Minister of the Environment kicked around the nuclear industry last weekend and certainly attacked the car industry last week. So we don’t really know where they’re going. I don’t think they know where they are going on some of these issues. It sure caused a lot of talk in the business industry and in the energy industry as to just exactly what’s happening here." ],

It’s very clear on many levels that we’ve left an impact, that we’ve had an impact on our environment, whether we look at the greenhouse gas emissions that we’ve produced as a society, whether we look at climate change or something more concrete and real that no one can deny, that we’ve polluted our waters and our land, the earth.", "If we look at a real-life example, I was speaking with someone who told me they used to swim in the Don River, the river that comes through Toronto, that empties out in Lake Ontario. They used to swim in that river. He was mentioning how that same river that he and his friends used to come together and go on weekends to swim in is now so polluted that he would not be able to swim in it. That was in his own lifetime.", "If we look at the impact intergenerationally—not just in one lifetime, but in future generations—it’s something that’s very troubling. But there is hope. There is the possibility of changing this direction. We have an amazing capacity for innovation. We can positively impact our environment. Much like we are concerned about our homes—we want to make sure we take care of them, keep them clean, keep them safe—we have that same responsibility to our environment.", "While I’m encouraged by a plan that is purported to protect our environment through cap-and-trade, we need to make sure that this plan isn’t just a PR exercise or something that sounds good in a headline. It has to be effective in actually creating results. It actually has to change something. We don’t have the luxury of having a flashy news line; we need real results that actually improve our environment and reduce the emissions that we’re producing." ],

I know the member from Owen Sound would be the same. I just want to give you guys a little bit of a grammar lesson here, because “scheme,” as a noun, is defined as “a large-scale systemic plan or arrangement for obtaining some particular object or putting a particular idea into effect.” It’s kind of neutral.", "But if you want to get into the verb “scheming,” then as a verb, “scheming” tends to have more of a nefarious meaning. But as a noun, it’s perfectly right to understand that a “plan” and a “scheme,” in the context we’re using them, are perfectly acceptable. Some members might think I should withdraw or that I might clarify, but I have no intention of doing so. This is a scheme. This is a plan. It’s a plan to achieve a particular objective.", "The interesting thing is that it’s the particular objective which we don’t believe is shared by the member opposite from Perth–Wellington. They want to go down a tax-and-dividend route, which will not have the kinds of benefits we know we can get from a cap-and-trade program. If you just take the money through gas taxes and give it back to people, they won’t be making the kinds of significant carbon change reduction decisions necessary, unless that amount is extraordinarily high.", "That’s why in BC they’re not getting the reductions and carbon credits that they’d hoped. They’re not getting them because to do so, you’d have to increase the price of gasoline 30, 40, 50 cents a litre to change behaviour. I’ve spoken about this before. It relates to the inelasticity of demand for energy. So it’s absolutely important that we recognize that we are with a very important scheme here to do the right thing, which is to reduce carbon." ],

And that really generates another serious problem: As people start to get off the grid, who’s going to pay for it?", "Unfortunately, he talked about being confused and dazed at the committee meetings. I know sometimes it’s hard to keep interest in some of these meetings, especially when—we went through our amendments; they didn’t accept one of them. A lot of it was around the Financial Accountability Officer, where we were trying to listen to the warning he had given: that this bill was outside his reach and outside the reach of the Auditor General. I can’t help but wonder, why would this government do that? What are they afraid of to have an independent set of eyes looking at it? This is a huge amount of money. We’re talking not millions, but billions of dollars in credits and money that will be collected from this scheme." ],

It’s too bad—I guess I can’t say what I was going to say, but there’s a definition in here or an explanation from a former member of this House by the name of Greg Sorbara.

I have to be a little bit skeptical about the whole scheme, other than it’s going to bring a lot of new money into the government.”", "I think that’s the issue here. Certainly, we would favour a carbon-neutral plan, but that would be no good to this government because it would bring in no more money—no more new money—for them and we all understand the serious debt problem this government has.

However, we want the system to be fair, we want it to be effective and we want it to be transparent. That’s where I will focus the majority of my comments.", "My colleague the member from Windsor–Tecumseh talked a lot about the fairness aspect. He pointed to jurisdictions like California and British Columbia that have carved out portions of their cap-and-trade system in terms of the revenue that they receive, to identify the impact that their systems have on low-income and vulnerable citizens. It may be one of the more progressive things that those jurisdictions have ever done, in acknowledging, before they even implement legislation, that that legislation is going to hurt some people and, “We’re going to make sure that we mitigate that first and foremost.”", "Why do that? Well, my colleague spoke about our moral responsibility to do that. I think, again, as humans on this planet, we have a responsibility to ensure that there is equality and fairness and justice, and that every person has the ability to live in dignity and live without the burdens of poverty, especially if we know that the legislation and the actions of a government increase those burdens on people. It’s our absolute responsibility to acknowledge that, and it’s something that the government has failed to do.", "Why are we so strong on this issue and why are we so adamant that it should make up a portion of the cap-and-trade system? Any sociologist that you speak to around the planet, anyone who studies income inequality and poverty, will tell you that inequality threatens the social fabric of societies. It’s indisputable. Where you find growing levels of inequality is where you find the fabric being dismantled. You find higher rates of crime; you find higher rates of incarceration; you find higher rates of health-related, socio-health-related impacts.", "If you know, and it has been acknowledged by the member from Beaches–East York—I can’t believe he said it, but he has a tendency to say things that aren’t well thought out; it is at least a measure of candour on his part. If you know that this bill—they don’t really care whether it does harm some people. I think that’s a failure and I think it’s inexcusable to acknowledge that your legislation will harm people and yet you will do nothing to mitigate that.", "Again, acknowledging that the Climate Change Mitigation and Low-carbon Economy Act has the potential of increasing inequality, let’s imagine the costs associated with that increase in inequality. Everyone knows it’s going to cost us more downstream in higher levels of health care, in higher levels throughout our judicial system and our criminal system. This is just what happens. It’s not what we like, it’s not what we want, but, as society becomes less and less fair, people tend to look at other means to survive. We can’t let that happen. We have to address it; we have to acknowledge it. It costs money, frankly. I think it’s a reasonable starting point to acknowledge it and to set aside money in the case that those effects actually transpire. So that’s the fairness part of it.", "I’m going to jump to the transparent part of it because, as we know, through the mechanics of the climate change mitigation act, or through even a cap-and-trade system, there is revenue that the government will indeed take. Our contention is, of course, what will they do with that revenue? We’ve seen the priorities of this government before. We’ve seen them over the last 14 tired years of their tenure here. Of course, we can’t say with a good degree of confidence that they have made the right choices. Whether it be in health care or education or infrastructure or job creation, we’ve seen failure after failure after failure, and it’s about time, as far as I’m concerned, that they get it right the first time. It saves us a whole lot of money when you do that.", "We would point to the transparency aspect in terms of, what are they going to do with their money, with the money that’s recovered? As the legislation sits and states, there’s a potential for the government to actually take the revenue and just tack it onto the provincial debt. I guess they believe not only in trickle-down economics, but they believe in trickle-down climate change mitigation.", "I think I’m understanding the rationale there: that if they pay off their debt, then they will be able to, I guess, borrow at a more preferred lending rate and make other expenditures somewhere else—a convoluted way to go about addressing one of the most important issues facing our species." ],

Let’s ensure that we’re working in tandem with them and in partnership with them.", "Why point to this? Well, for the viewers who are tuning in, when we have our experts analyze the bill and the use of the proceeds in the greenhouse gas reduction account, the bill sets up an accounting procedure, known as the greenhouse gas reduction account, to track accounting transactions to be attributed to the cap-and-trade system. Unlike the existing greenhouse gas reduction account that was established with Bill 185 in 2009 to receive cap-and-trade revenue—so they were already anticipating a cap-and-trade system—this new account does not record the inflows and outflows of money like a bank account. So we essentially will not know how much revenue comes in; we won’t know how much revenue comes out. It’s bewildering, Speaker, that we can set up a massive new entity to receive and recover revenue and penalties through the cap-and-trade system and not actually know what the value of the cash flow is in that.", "Again, the GGR account has now become an abstract accounting procedure with rules for when the balance in the account may be increased and when it can be decreased. Anyone tuning in and listening to that example of how they’re going to ensure transparency on the money side, I guess, would be left with a whole host of questions, as I am—and we’re in the room here. Although the government isn’t putting up speakers to this bill, I would hope that they would clarify that aspect for us, but also for the general public. Because if they don’t know where the money is going and they don’t know how much you’re actually recovering, you’re not going to get support for this bill, and, my goodness, if we’ve ever needed support for something as transformational as this bill, it’s now.", "It is incumbent upon the government to deliver those answers. Be transparent. This has not been the record of the government over so many other files. We can point to Ornge Air Ambulance; we can point to eHealth; we can point to the cancellation of the gas plants. Transparency has not been a part of their mandate and their operating motives.", "So we would like them to do that. We would like them to acknowledge not only that this bill has the potential of going sideways so much as to have the unintended consequence of absolutely harming people, but also of having a failure to have citizens buy into what they know and what we know we need to do. We can’t afford—time is running out.", "J. Rockström, in a publication from Nature of September 2009, put a paper forward, some data that states that we have already breached the ecological boundaries of a safe operating space for humanity. We’re already blown past that. Whether it be climate change, whether it be biodiversity, hydrogen cycles or ocean acidification, we’re already blown through those thresholds.", "Again, it is our responsibility to do it right and get it right the first time." ],

I’ve seen all this. But why I’m saying that is because, for a lot of these considerations, they did not talk to the people in the industry.

These smaller companies and mid-size companies would not be able to afford it, so they would probably sit on their laurels a bit and not put the money into the systems because the systems are too expensive. So they’ll buy the credits and try to get by on the credits, as opposed to doing something in their own particular regime.", "I think what’s going to happen here is that you’re going to need what has always been around this place for the last 100 years: enforcement. Once again, you’re going to need inspectors. Once again, you’re going to need people to enforce this cap-and-trade and to actually track it. I think it’s going to be a huge bureaucracy.

It has been said that this is going to kill the automotive industry. I would submit that this presents an enormous opportunity for the automotive industry to transform. They already are innovative. They are already working within jurisdictions that have greenhouse gas systems and cap-and-trade systems. They are, actually, the leaders and pioneers of low-emission technology. They’re setting the standard.", "What kills jobs are multinational, multilateral free-trade agreements, signed by Liberal governments and Conservative governments, that open the doors to floods of imports that are made in jurisdictions that don’t have climate change accords—cheap labour jurisdictions—and that the Conservatives and Liberals continue to sign. The Trans-Pacific Partnership, that the ink is just drying right now on, that the federal Liberals have signed, is and will continue eroding domestic manufacturing.", "Climate change is an enormous issue that presents an enormous opportunity. But without actually analyzing what our current economic system is built on—cheap labour and the offshoring of good-paying manufacturing jobs—then you’re doing a disservice to the discussion and the debate. Let’s talk about fair trade that recognizes and trades with international partners and jurisdictions that have solid climate change plans that address the issues of trade-exposed industries and make sure that it’s fair. That’s how you protect jobs. That’s how you ensure economic stability, and that’s how you ensure a regenerative type of economy." ],

  "text" : [ "I’m pleased to finally have the opportunity to discuss Bill 172 this afternoon.", "The Climate Change Mitigation and Low-carbon Economy Act is a bill that warrants a lot more discussion than the government has allowed for outside of this House, so I’m eager to bring forward the concerns of my constituents from Lambton–Kent–Middlesex here to Queen’s Park today.", "This is especially true, since those who have raised concerns about this bill in particular, and the government’s approach to environmental policy generally, seem to find themselves demonized by this Liberal government. It’s a tactic that has distorted the conversation we are able to have about issues such as these and has led to this government creating policies in a vacuum, apparently unwilling or unable to work with almost anyone in the province.", "Suggesting there might be a better approach or a different way of tackling climate change is being painted as heresy and apostasy. I have heard a lot of valid concerns about Bill 172. I’d like to note that I have heard these concerns from people who very much want to see improved environmental policies. They simply don’t think this bill goes about it in the right way.", "Although the government might like to paint this as an issue of the environment versus the economy, that is an oversimplification that does a disservice to the process of policy development. I believe we can have a thriving economy while we take action on climate change. It doesn’t need to be an objective we pursue with scorched-earth tactics and a take-no-prisoners approach.", "With more accountability and openness from the Liberal government, this province could fight climate change with policies that are socially, environmentally and economically sustainable. The rushed, opaque process this government is pursuing, with a “damn the costs and the casualties” attitude, is not fair to the people of this province and it won’t effect the kind of wide-ranging change I think this government wants to see.", "But Mr. Speaker, there is an alternate course. I believe if we pursue comprehensive sustainability, then we can create real, lasting and positive change. Henry Ford once said, “If everyone is moving forward together, then success takes care of itself.” And that is exactly what this Liberal government is missing. The government has brought this bill to third reading while still being unable to give Ontario’s businesses basic information about how the system will work, what impacts it will have, or other key information they need to budget and plan, even for the year ahead, which makes it seem highly unlikely that the government has done their due diligence to assess what impact cap-and-trade will have on our economy, our businesses or on the lives of the families of this province.", "This government is already making our private sector fight with one hand tied behind its back by raising the costs of energy and creating new payroll taxes. But they seem bent on making sure they’re blindfolded as well, unable to prepare for even the short-term.", "Near my riding of Lambton–Kent–Middlesex, Gerry Macartney, head of the London Chamber of Commerce, said that the Liberal government is rushing the cap-and-trade system and summarized their approach as “ready, fire, aim.” London-area businesses, he said, would “like to see a little more aiming first.” In fact, after meeting with the Minister of the Environment, Mr. Macartney’s impression was that the minister himself didn’t understand the details of his own policy.", "How are Ontario businesses supposed to adapt and anticipate the effects of this legislation if the minister himself doesn’t even seem to grasp what’s actually coming?", "The concerns of Ontario Chamber of Commerce head Allan O’Dette have been well aired here and in the media, and that’s because he has given a very thoughtful, balanced critique of the Liberal government’s approach. It’s very easy to understand why he’s calling for a delay.", "The Minister of the Environment has said that those details are coming, but it seems to have taken some public pressure to force the release of the details of this strategy, which is absolutely absurd given that this is all supposed to come online in just over six months. To leave it to this late date is negligence. It’s negligence on the part of this government to be so irresponsible and to play so fast and loose with the economy of this province and the livelihood of its people.", "This is very basic stuff, but it seems to warrant an explanation since the message clearly isn’t getting through. Stability is critical for sustainable economic growth. Ontario businesses are not going to be encouraged to invest or expand here when the government keeps throwing curveballs at them. Companies looking at coming to Ontario are certainly going to be discouraged by the volatility they see this government generating.", "Fostering economic stability enables companies to pursue macroeconomic objectives and provide the market with stable prices and employment levels. It creates the right environment for job creation and for companies to maintain a balance of payments. In short, it leads to organic, sustainable growth. Stability generates confidence, and this stimulates investment in technology and human capital.", "Speaker, how can companies be expected to effectively plan or mitigate risk when the basic elements of the business environment keep changing? I know this government thinks they can build up the economy by just throwing money at companies they hand-pick, but that isn’t actually a recipe for sustainable growth.", "The government moving to push through and implement this scheme on such a short timetable unfortunately coincides with the pending release of the climate change action plan. The comments from the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change and the details of the plan that were leaked to the Globe and Mail have raised the alarm in the business community. We’ve heard bold targets and wild dictates, but very little on the how, who or when of these plans. With madcap ideas and audacious aspirational goals being bandied about by this government around climate change initiatives, it raises serious questions about how all this newfound tax revenue generated by cap-and-trade is going to be spent. Based on what we’ve heard from the Minister of the Environment and his flagrant disregard for the auto sector, it seems much more likely that these funds will somehow be used to kneecap our critical industries rather than foster real economic growth in this province.", "Speaker, this isn’t a government that has a strong track record of doing its due diligence or examining the potential unintended consequences of their decisions. We have seen something all too similar with the Ministry of Economic Development and their allocation of grants and subsidies. Under the broad objective of stimulating economic growth, this government hands out $5 billion annually almost entirely behind closed doors, mostly by invitation only, and with no real attempt to gauge whether this money does anything for the provincial economy whatsoever. The government refuses to tell the public where this money has gone, and they aren’t tracking whether these so-called investments drive innovation, increase exports or even create long-term jobs. What we do know is that their efforts seem to have made a lot of Liberal donors very happy.", "Now we have the Ministry of the Environment looking for its own big pot of discretionary money, and I see no indication that the methods and oversight used in that ministry will be any better than in the Ministry of Economic Development. If this government is going to be taking $2 billion out of the economy every single year, they need to answer for where it’s going.", "The Liberal track record on this is shameful, and I’d be remiss if I didn’t demand more accountability from this government on behalf of the people that I represent. Families are going to see their fuel costs increase by hundreds of dollars per year and their home heating costs will jump by almost $500 per year, because of this bill. Where will the minister tell them this money is going?", "So far, we’ve seen this government pay out nearly $800,000 in rebates for cars that cost over $100,000. That is the Liberal track record on this. That was taxpayer money, earned by the hard-working people of this province, which was funneled into one of the many substandard green initiatives brought forward by this Liberal government. How can the Premier possibly expect people to entrust an additional discretionary $2 billion every single year to her government?", "Speaker, there is a better way to fight climate change. The take-no-prisoners approach this government is pursuing on environmental issues is not egalitarian, effective or helpful. The people of this province deserve better governance, and they deserve well-thought-out, comprehensive policies that are economically, socially and environmentally sustainable. Bill 172 simply does not meet those criteria.", "With my few seconds left, I want to put on the record once again that people in my riding of Lambton–Kent–Middlesex—and, I’m sure, everyone in this province—woke up to that unbelievable story saying that natural gas was going to be banned in any new home construction in this province in about 14 years. That’s a disgrace, Mr. Speaker." ],

But anyway, we’ll be back in a couple of weeks, and there will be questions then.", "I am waiting to hear more from Unifor, and also from the Ontario Federation of Agriculture. There are going to be major changes there to that. Agriculture has been led to believe that they are going to put hundreds of millions of dollars in the expansion of natural gas into rural Ontario. The Premier challenged agriculture to increase their production. To do that, they’ve told this government—I know the president of the Ontario Federation of Agriculture, Don McCabe, very well. He has told this government, along with his federation, that they need access to that natural gas. I guess that they need to make sure they get that point across to Minister Murray, because obviously he didn’t hear that.", "Anyway, one way they could reduce greenhouse gases—they could do it very simply. They could adopt my private member’s bill about reducing greenhouse gases by adopting liquid natural gas for tractor trailers. They’re 3% of the traffic and 27% to 30% of the pollution.

But this morning, we had an issue where the Minister of Energy is saying that we are making a profit selling surplus hydro, when it’s actually costing us, and what he is calling a profit is the residual income.

The plan has to be fair, it has to be effective and it has to be transparent.", "Before I get into the components and the criteria that the government has to satisfy for a plan to be sufficient in order to address these very serious concerns, let’s lay out how important this concern is.", "Like our member from Timiskaming–Cochrane stated, there is absolutely no doubt that humans have left a negative impact on our environment. There is no doubt that we have impacted our environment through various steps that we have taken, whether it’s through polluting our water, polluting the air or polluting the land.", "In addition, as a result of the emissions that we produce as a society, there are greenhouse gases that are impacting climate change.", "We all agree in this House that climate change is a serious issue and the negative impact that we have had on this environment, on our environment, is a serious issue. We must do something about it. Whether it’s in our own lives, for our own quality of living; whether it’s with respect to the quality of air that we breathe; whether it’s with respect the water that we drink, we need to do something about the environment. We need to ensure that for one generation—for our generation—the environment is protected and, in addition, we have a responsibility to ensure that the environment is protected for future generations. That’s something that we absolutely believe in. That’s an absolute commitment that we all should have.", "Now, how do we achieve that? We need to ensure that any steps we take as a society are actually effective. That’s one of the key issues here: With respect to the plan proposed by the government, we have some serious concerns about its effectiveness. Will the plan proposed by the government actually reduce greenhouse gas emissions?", "One of the key concerns is that the plan the government proposes allows for exemptions for the major polluters. Now, while we absolutely support the idea that there are certain industries that are going to be put at an unfair disadvantage because they have to compete with other jurisdictions where there is not a similar cap-and-trade system, and they may be in a position where they are not as competitive, having an allowance—an exemption—to ensure that our industries are able to compete makes some sense. But a system that allows all the major polluters to have an exemption—a blanket exemption—doesn’t seem to make a lot of sense, and it does not bode very well for a policy that would be effective in reducing emissions. That’s one of our major concerns.", "The second concern is, with respect to having community buy-in, we need a plan that’s fair. On a moral level, it should be fair but also as it concerns buy-in. If a plan that’s proposed by the government disproportionately affects people from the lower socio-economic backgrounds or demographics, community members will be outraged that they are being forced to bear the brunt of a plan, but the folks that pollute the most are allowed to be exempt. A failure to provide any sort of consideration or attention to the realities of those folks is an unfair plan, and that’s one of the major criticisms of this proposal.", "Mr. Speaker, if the people of this province don’t believe in this plan, this is not something we can move forward with. We need a plan that has buy-in, that people feel supportive of. One of the ways we can ensure that people believe in this plan is to make sure the plan is fair.", "In general, fairness is a principle that should apply in all government policies, but in particular, with something like the environment, we don’t have the luxury of creating divisions. This is something that we must act on. This is something that requires the commitment of everyone in this province. If the government proposes a plan that divides the community—that pits people who are in a worse economic position against those who are in a better position—that’s simply an unfair plan. It’s not going to have wide buy-in, and that’s going to cause disruptions for a plan that we need to implement.", "With respect to transparency, some of the Liberal members got up and said, “Oh, this plan has transparency.” I strongly beg to differ. There are serious holes in the plan for transparency of what the government is proposing.", "First and foremost, we have an Environmental Commissioner who is completely absent from any of this bill’s discussion, from any of the elements of this bill. There is no consideration for the Environmental Commissioner. We have an Environmental Commissioner for a reason. They should be incorporated and involved in the process. The fact that they are completely absent in this legislation is a gaping hole. It is a serious concern.", "The other area of concern is that the government proposes that revenue from this cap-and-trade program will be directed towards environmental initiatives. However, the way that the government has laid out that initiative—that the revenue will be used for these environmental initiatives—the problem is that there isn’t a separate account that has been created. The funds will flow into a general account, and there’s really no accountability to ensure that the funds will be used to advance some initiative that will actually help the environment." ],

Having a slush fund, having a proposal that doesn’t specifically create a separate account committed or dedicated to environmental initiatives, does not create support or trust in the minds of the people.", "In fact, we have a number of examples where this government has failed utterly to follow through on commitments they have made. It is eroding public trust not only in the Liberal government but in governments in general. That’s something that is creating a great deal of apathy, and that’s something that does not bode well for our democratic systems.", "The other element that’s very troubling is we have had numerous examples where delegated administrative authorities are not accountable. They don’t have the oversight and are not institutions that are able to be properly supervised. They don’t have the ability for the government to provide the accountability that we need to provide. This proposal of the government is to create another delegated administrative authority. They lack accountability. They are essentially a public service or a public entity but without any public scrutiny. That doesn’t make any sense. We’ve seen what happens with delegated administrative authorities.", "One example is Tarion. The system that’s been created by Tarion—it’s essentially a public service, in the fact it only exists because it’s the only option for new homeowners in terms of their warranty. It’s essentially existing only because of the government, but it’s not accountable to the Attorney General, it’s not directly accountable to the government, and there have been numerous complaints about its effectiveness in whether it’s actually providing a service to the public.", "Similarly, if what the government is proposing here is to create another delegated administrative authority, we have that same concern. This administrative authority won’t have the scrutiny of the government, and will not be something that the Attorney General or the Auditor General will be able to investigate. Again, that creates some problems with respect to transparency and it creates problems with respect to the public trust.", "The point of any sort of cap-and-trade is to put a price on pollution. The goal of this placing a value on pollution is to reduce pollution. With respect to what the government is proposing, we don’t know for certain if this plan will be effective. We don’t know if the targets will be able to be achieved. We don’t have any accountability with respect to those targets and how they can be achieved. So there are some serious problems.", "Coming back to the initiative—we need a plan that reduces greenhouse emissions. We need a plan that reduces pollution. We need to do something to protect our environment. There is no debate. There is no question about that. We are committed to doing that. New Democrats are committed to doing that. I am personally committed to that, but what is the government proposing? Is it something that’s actually going to satisfy that concern? We have serious doubts and serious concerns about that.", "I want to say very clearly: This is a crucial turning point in our society. We have an opportunity to act now so that our future generations are protected. We have an opportunity now to protect our environment, not only for our generation but for future generations, and we don’t have the luxury of not acting. We must act now. We must do something now." ],

They are deeply committed not only physically to the land but spiritually to the land and culturally to the land—not only to the land, but the water, the air and all of the animals. The bill, out of respect—and more than just out of respect; there’s a body of knowledge there that we want to tap into. So the bill does include a provision that requires the minister to consider any traditional ecological knowledge that a First Nation or Métis community may have in respect of any action plan the government is required to prepare. That’s called TEK: traditional ecological knowledge.", "The bill also includes a provision making it very clear that nothing in the bill is intended to take away from the protections provided for aboriginal and treaty rights in the Canadian Constitution. That provision is intended to signify respect for those rights and is not intended to impact the interpretation or protection of those rights in the context of the bill.", "I’ve been to some 63 First Nation on-site visits, many of them in the far, far north, and I’ve seen the effects of climate change in the Far North and how it’s affected things like ice roads, fish, fowl and wild animals.

This government, if you go back less than two years ago, was very public when it was asked, during the last election campaign, whether they would move ahead with a carbon tax. They were very clear to say no, they wouldn’t. There’s a point there, that they don’t have a mandate from the people to do this. But if they’re going to go ahead, this plan is really all about getting more money. It’s not about making a difference.", "I heard a comment before: “Well, how would just putting a tax on it and making it revenue-neutral work?”—like they have in BC. It has shown that it has worked.", "Will they have to increase the price of carbon as they go forward? That’s something that they’ll likely have to do, just as you’d have to do here with cap-and-trade. If you don’t make the price of carbon significant, there’s not a change.", "By giving the money back to the people, there’s still that advantage of not spending or not wasting your money on carbon if you can actually look at an alternative. By putting money in your pocket, that allows you to look at an alternative, and it’s really a way that we could see as being productive and a plan that would actually work, instead of just taking money out of the economy and putting more and more people on social assistance, because we’ll have more and more people who will be out of work, and more and more people who will be in poverty because it will cost more to heat your homes and more to live in this province. That’s the plan we’re going to. Really, it’s all about a government that’s out of money.", "We think that our climate, and the world, is worth more than that.

When we talk about natural resources in our province and Canada in general—we have a tremendous natural resource: the natural resource of water. It’s so offensive to me that our fresh water, which is such a precious resource in this world, is polluted and sometimes not drinkable. That’s one of the issues that really speaks to the importance of environmental concern and protection. If we look at this precious resource and how it’s being polluted, it really offends me in my core that it’s not something that we should be able to drink at any point in time. Our rivers and our lakes should not in any way be contaminated. We should never have fear to be able to use that water, and the fact that we do have that concern is deeply troubling. It speaks to how important it is for us to commit to really working towards protecting our environment, not just because it’s a resource, but because this is our home.

We’ve been through first reading, second reading and, of course, through committee, where, we’ve heard today, the government amended their own bill 70 times. They didn’t pass any of our amendments that we tried to put forward to make the bill a little stronger. The government is using this to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Unfortunately, as I stated at second reading of this bill, that has been proven to be ineffective in actually reducing greenhouse gas emissions.", "More or less, it has been coming across to people in this province, especially in my riding, that this is nothing more than a cash grab—that this government is going to utilize this money and, of course, spend it on whatever they wish. They do say that they may have some accountability and transparency in the system, but it’s not a separate account outside of the general revenues; it’s a line item. Of course, we all know creative accounting can occur, especially with this government, and the money, we know, will not be spent as it should.", "We actually believe, on this side of the House, that if you’re going to collect that money, you should be refunding it in other ways to the people of Ontario to mitigate the increased expenses in their lives, on top of the huge costs that this government has imposed on the people of this province over the last 15 years, including the health tax, the HST, which they brought in, the high hydro rates—one of the highest in North America—that they’ve brought forward in the name of green energy into municipalities, which clearly have said no over time.", "It’s quite absurd, Mr. Speaker, especially in my riding, where I had two municipalities right beside each other, 40 kilometres apart: One didn’t want wind turbines, said no; it had a plebiscite with its constituents and 84% said, “No, we don’t want them.” Then I had another municipality not far away that said, “Yes, we’d love wind turbines.” This government gave the wind turbines to the community that said no. It’s that type of listening that gets us into trouble.", "In second reading, I mentioned that there are other ways this government can act to help the environment out and where they’ve failed. I know they’re trying to work on it now, but I mentioned wetlands. We’ve destroyed much of our wetlands in our province, which not only work to purify and filter out water but also help prevent the flooding that we’re seeing. Probably one of the reasons Toronto floods so much when we get huge downpours is that they’ve pretty much exhausted all their wetlands in the area.", "The other item that I’ve mentioned previously was in regard to stewardship councils, which were strong organizations throughout province. This government pretty much destroyed any stewardship councils. There are a few still going on out there, those that were strong enough to maintain. My Elgin Stewardship Council is quite strong because they have the resources themselves to maintain, but a lot of the stewardship councils in the province, through the changes this government has made, have disappeared.", "Stewardship councils are strong in this province because they’re the ones that will take a farmer’s land or take a wetland that’s been damaged and fix it up, rehabilitate it back into a wetland or create a wetland, working with organizations like Ducks Unlimited or the Nature Conservancy of Canada to ensure that that type of conservation is going on. I think that’s very, very important, which this government is missing out on. It’s utilizing conservation of our lands, utilizing the people in our province who will volunteer to work to create suitable environments that will help clean water and help prevent floodings and add an aesthetic effect to rural Ontario. That’s what they should be working on. Those are the people they should be engaging. Instead, this government barges ahead not listening to rural Ontario and is stuffing wind turbines down people’s throats.", "Bill 172 will also cause continued economic impact to businesses. We’ve heard just recently that the chamber of commerce wrote the minister asking him to delay it another year so that they can actually see the costs that are going to affect businesses across the province so that they can be more prepared for the impact of another tax coming from this government on businesses.", "As I said earlier, ratepayers already have to deal with high electricity costs. Now businesses are going to have to compound that—on top of the global adjustment charge that they get right now because of the Green Energy Act—onto this cap-and-trade scheme that this government has created. From what I’ve read, home heating will go up $160 by 2017 and $900 by 2030 because of this tax. Small businesses will see an increase of $170,000 more a year for energy costs alone next year and more than $900,000 by 2030, in combination. Mr. Speaker, that can only lead to job loss in this province. Many businesses, especially small businesses in this province, are having a hard time making ends meet, and the high cost of energy is only going to reduce it.", "This government’s bill—they did not change the transparency and they didn’t change the accountability. We’ve seen, through their inability to manage other facets of this government, waste continually occurring, misspending, of course leading to scandal, without any great oversight other than themselves to oversee the money.", "The bill itself does contain some stiff penalties for offences for both corporations and individuals. Individuals face fines of up to $6 million or five years in prison for fraud, market manipulation and insider trading. That’s well and good.", "Hopefully, the OPP is not going to be investigating this government on anything with regard to this cap-and-trade scheme. We already have five OPP investigations against this government. It’s almost as if the OPP have opened up an office just beside the Premier’s office in order to continue their deliberations with regard to this government.", "Mr. Speaker, I also brought up in second reading, which I thought was quite telling, Steve Paikin’s show The Agenda, where Greg Sorbara, who was former finance minister in this government during the McGuinty years and one of the head organizers of the party, came out and said this government will sell its “imaginary product called carbon credits” and it will raise prices on all products purchased by Ontarians. Sorbara questioned this Liberal government by saying, “Although the [finance] minister said there are no tax increases, the fact is that there’s a $1.9-billion increase. I call it a flow-through tax that will ultimately affect consumers.... It’s an interesting way to raise money while saying, at the same time, you’re not raising taxes.”", "It’s interesting that one of the masters of Liberal spin has actually called them out on the Liberal spin. It’s unfortunate that this government does not sit back and listen to its own members saying that this is a bad plan; this is a bad idea.", "Then, to top it off, as we’re finishing debate on third reading on this bill, lo and behold, the Globe and Mail receives a report leaked from the cabinet which obviously states that this government is in turmoil. There is no unanimity—is that the right—" ],

We have overspent to the tune of $8 billion on public infrastructure where we didn’t have to. Over the last nine years this government vaporized—actually they didn’t even vaporize it because had they actually lit the money on fire, we would have at least gotten heat out of the dollars. We didn’t even get that. There is nothing to show for the extra $8 billion that the Liberal government, under Kathleen Wynne as the Premier, has spent on infrastructure.", "Imagine what we could do to mitigate climate change. Imagine what we could do to fund our school system. Imagine what we could do through our health care system. But you’re going to make excuses for $8 billion of vaporized public money through infrastructure. How could you blame an honourable member like the member from Elgin–Middlesex–London when he says, “We don’t trust these guys to implement any type of system that deals with money”? There are some people you just can’t trust with the cashbox. More and more, the public are seeing and feeling that we can’t do that. We need oversight built in; we need accountability; we need transparency and fairness—things that this government is never able to deliver." ],

The electricity sector had no effective checks and balances. The Minister of Energy could direct billions of dollars of public expenditures with the stroke of a pen. Any new regulatory structure will require clear oversight to prevent or at least reduce imprudent investments.", "“Related is the need for greater transparency in decision-making.... This gave consultations the appearance of a façade” in the last go-round.", "“Finally, facts matter. Ontario energy decisions were made in a factual vacuum. Supply and conservation were pursued with little regard to system reliability needs, leading to massive surplus and acquiring resources that did not meet demand requirements.... The recent controversy over electricity prices going up as a result of conservation is a case in point.” The minister won’t even provide details of how much this is going to cost, so there needs to be some clear accountability. “Any new system should have strict cost-benefit requirements so that decisions can be made and evaluated through a straightforward analysis.", "“The prospect of a new agency to make decisions around investment in carbon reduction is daunting for those who fear a repetition of Ontario’s previous experience in energy management.”", "Mr. Speaker, I couldn’t say it any better myself." ],

The Auditor General has little to say with it. The Financial Accountability Officer hasn’t been invited to the table. They have a lot of explaining to do to the people of Ontario." ],

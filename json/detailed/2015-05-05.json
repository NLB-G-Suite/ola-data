  "text" : [ "Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. First of all, I have to apologize to you because I broke the door trying to get into the chamber so that I could take my place in the House. There’s a hinge that came out of the door; it’s going to have to be replaced. I know our staff were a little nervous that I wasn’t in the chamber at the time of the prayers, and I apologize for that, too.", "At the same time, I’m very pleased to have this opportunity to debate the budget motion that was tabled in this House shortly after the presentation of the budget. We, of course, have a nice blue copy—sorry, it’s red—a red copy of the provincial budget. Building Ontario Up is what the government calls it. It was presented in the House a few days ago, as we know.", "I want to begin my remarks by acknowledging an important day in the country of Holland. Today is the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Holland. As we know, Mr. Speaker, it was in part due to the sacrifice, the courage and the dedication of Canadian soldiers, who were primarily responsible for the liberation of Holland and bringing to an end the tyranny of the Nazi regime in that country during World War II. Many Canadian soldiers, believe it or not, are able to be in Holland today to mark that 70th anniversary. It may be the last time that the greatest generation will be able to be present in Holland for this commemoration. We’re thinking of the Dutch people today and also the extraordinary contribution that our Dutch-Canadians have made, because there was a huge wave of immigration to Canada after the First World War of people from Holland. They have made an immeasurable contribution to the country and to the province of Ontario, so we remember them today.", "I want to begin by clarifying something that seems to be a bit misunderstood around here, even in the Legislature, perhaps in the media and perhaps amongst some in the general public. We are debating the budget motion right now. This is the motion that is tabled after the provincial budget, and it’s very straightforward and simple. It’s one line, really. Proposed by the government, it’s suggesting that the House has confidence, in general, in the budgetary policy of the government.", "We in opposition do not have confidence, in general, in the budgetary policy of the government. So it would be logical—and I know you would agree, Mr. Speaker—if we don’t have confidence in the budgetary policy of the government, that we would vote against the budget motion. This is something that was somewhat distorted by Liberal strategists during the minority Parliament back in 2011. You’ll recall, Mr. Speaker, that in fact the Liberal Party paid for robocalls in the ridings of Burlington and Cambridge, seats that we held with our members Jane McKenna and Rob Leone, who had been newly elected in 2011. Robocalls were paid for by the Liberal Party into those ridings, telling the people of those ridings that if their Conservative members, Rob Leone and Jane McKenna, voted against the budget motion, they were therefore voting against their hospital projects. That is a false statement, and the Liberal strategists should have known that. I believe they did know that, and yet those robocalls were made.", "In my riding, there were Liberals who wrote letters to the editor—yes, that’s exactly correct. In my riding, there were letters to the editor sent by Liberals suggesting that if I voted against the budget motion in 2011—after the provincial election, when we were in the minority period—I was voting against my hospital projects. Again, absolutely a false statement. What we are voting on is the budgetary policy of the government in general.", "The fact is that of course the New Democrats, during the minority period, negotiated with the government, and certain things were included in the budget. For a two-year period they were prepared to, if not support the budget, at least abstain to allow the budget to pass, to prevent an election. But I would caution those members of the House—and I know there are many Liberals here who are interested in this; we all have a conscience—that it is completely false to suggest that any member is voting against a project in their riding if they vote against the budget motion and the budgetary policy of the government.", "Indeed, when the Liberal Party was in opposition, when our party was in government between 1995 and 2003, in every single case the Liberal caucus voted against the budget motion. There was no question about it. And it’s logical that they did, Mr. Speaker, because in those days, they did not support the budgetary policy of the Progressive Conservative government.", "I wanted to get that off my chest because it has bothered me for some time. I hope that the government members will contemplate it, and I hope that the Liberal strategists who authored that approach of doing robocalls into Conservative ridings don’t ever try that again.", "I want to mention the key numbers that are in this budget and compare them to last year’s. The provincial deficit for 2015-16 is $8.5 billion. This, in fact, is actually down from last year; there was a $10.9-billion deficit last year. But you’ll recall in the budget last year that they actually projected a $12.5-billion deficit and, in turn, before the budget, acknowledged that they’d come in under that projection, at $10.9 billion.", "There’s really little explanation for the difference, other than that the government patted itself on the back and said that they’d done a good job of managing the expenditures and that was what accounted for the difference.", "In fact, we sometimes wonder if the government uses assumptions that create a higher deficit number than is really what they expect, and when they come in under that number they take credit for their good management as a way of distracting and diverting attention away from the fact that it is still a very sizable number.", "Nevertheless, the government continues to claim and to submit to the people of Ontario that they plan to balance the budget by 2017-18. They are committed to doing this. We’ve been saying for the last two or three years now, as the deficit has actually gone up year over year, that it’s pretty hard to believe they’re going to be able to balance that budget. I will acknowledge that it is true that this year the deficit has in fact come down, and if the deficit continues to come down—say, $2 billion to $3 billion a year, or $4 billion a year—we get closer, of course, to that goal of a balanced budget. But I still would question the government’s commitment: when the tough decisions have to be made in the next three years, whether or not they’ll be prepared to make them to actually achieve that goal of a balanced budget.", "Of great concern, though, is the projected provincial net debt number, which continues to go up dramatically. This year, in the provincial budget: $298.9 billion—almost $299 billion; this is up from $284.2 billion last year—gone up $14.7 billion. The debt has gone up $14.7 billion year over year. That means it has increased—simple math—over a billion dollars a month. The debt has gone up over this past year.", "Provincial government spending this year is projected to be $131.9 billion. That’s $132 billion, rounded off. That is up from $129.5 billion last year—a $2.4-billion increase year over year. Again, the government would have us believe they’re holding the line on spending and being successful in that regard. In fact, their spending is going up $2.4 billion more than last year, according to their own numbers in the provincial budget.", "Another serious concern is the net debt per capita. That, of course, is the amount, in effect, that each of us owes because of years of provincial government overspending. Every man, woman and child in the province of Ontario, in effect, owes this sum of money because of years and years and years of provincial government overspending—spending beyond its means in a given year. The net debt per capita this year is now at $21,642; last year, it was $20,772. That means the net debt per capita has gone up $870 just in the last year. Again, that’s something that should concern us all if we care about the next generation, our children and our grandchildren. I certainly do, and I know most of us do, but unfortunately, in this budget process, it seems that that concern has been repeatedly overlooked, going back to 2003.", "Another important indicator of the crushing level of debt that the province of Ontario is carrying is the debt-to-GDP ratio. That takes the total debt and compares it to the value of the goods and services that we produce in the province of Ontario. That’s what the gross domestic product is: the total value of what we produce in terms of goods and services in the province of Ontario. That’s an important indicator because it allows us to look at how we can serve the debt. It’s our capacity to service the debt and pay down the debt, pay the interest payments, and hopefully someday get to the point of paying down the principal. That debt-to-GDP ratio now stands at 39.8%, up again from last year. It was 39.4% last year, so almost half a percentage point increase. Just to compare—again, this is getting close to 40%: Before the recession in 2008-09, that number was 26.2%. So that number has gone up dramatically as well. Again, it underscores the punishing level of debt that has been incurred in recent years.", "Of course, what does that mean to people? Well, we have to service the debt; we have to make interest payments on the debt. If the provincial government is going to remain solvent and meet its obligations, its debt service payments come first. If we stop paying our debt interest, of course, we would not be able to borrow money at all and we would be in a financial crisis in the province of Ontario.", "That becomes, basically—the first call in the government’s finances is to pay the interest on the debt. That number, not surprisingly, continues to grow dramatically. In fact, it is now the third-largest item in the provincial budget after health and education. It’s also, in recent years, the fastest-growing item in the provincial budget—something that I pointed out in question period a couple of years ago. It’s now well understood that it is the fastest-growing item in the budget. It’s expected and projected to go up 5.7% per year, on average, for the foreseeable future. That’s a number, again, that is taken from the budget papers. I know there are some skeptics. It’s on page 281 of the budget papers. It shows that the interest on the debt is expected to grow by 5.7% for the foreseeable future as far out as 2017-18. That’s as far as the graph shows.", "At the same time, the government would lead us to believe that they’re constraining costs in so many other areas. In fact, they are constraining health care costs, and they’ve seen a substantial increase in transfers from the federal government to the provincial government for health care.", "Again, I’ll refer to the budget papers document, where we see that the Canada Health Transfer—$12.4 billion last year—has gone up to over $13 billion this year. At the same time, the provincial government’s expenditures on health have gone up less than that. By my math, the provincial expenditures on health care are only going up $598 million this year, while at the same time the federal government is increasing the transfers for health by $652 million. The federal government is giving us more for health, and the provincial government isn’t even spending that increase on health. In effect, given the fact that the interest costs are going up dramatically, it’s pretty logical to conclude that the money that is earmarked for health care—that the federal government is intending to give us for health care—is in fact being spent to service the debt. That’s how bad it has gotten under this government.", "People need to understand. These are all big numbers and it’s difficult to understand them, but we have to educate ourselves in terms of financial literacy. If we don’t—if all the members in this House don’t understand the budgetary numbers—obviously, we’ve got a more serious problem, perhaps, than any of us realize.", "Again, the interest payments on the debt this year are projected to be $11.4 billion. That’s up from $10.7 billion last year—again, the fastest-growing item in the budget.", "Mr. Speaker, I don’t have very much time. I look at the clock and I realize the time has gone very quickly for me. But I also wanted to point out some of the economic policies that have been advocated by my colleague the member for Whitby–Oshawa, who of course is seeking the leadership of our Ontario provincial PC Party. I support her leadership bid, and I believe she is the most qualified person to be the next leader of our party and to be the Premier of Ontario.", "For me, it’s not all about winning elections. It’s actually all about good government. I realize that we have to win elections in order to form government. I realize that winning is obviously the objective of an election campaign, and during an election campaign we work all-out towards that objective. But when the election is over, it’s over, and we all have a job to do.", "I think it’s also true that, for the people who are involved in politics in my riding—in all parties—winning is important, but it’s winning as a means to an end. Winning isn’t the end in itself. Winning is the means to an end, with the end, of course, being good government. I would add that comment to this debate too, and ask members to consider that.", "Christine Elliott, in her speech at this Legislature—actually, in the wintertime—gave a very compelling plan to strengthen Ontario’s economy and encourage the creation of the new jobs that we need.", "She said that first of all, we must do a better job of building a competitive business climate to stimulate job-creating investment. She suggested that by making regulatory reform an immediate priority in the first 100 days of a government led by her, by taking steps to simplify the tax code, and by reducing business taxes, we would be sending a very powerful message to Ontario job creators that we are open for business once again. Of course, Mr. Speaker, that is very important for business confidence.", "We have to acknowledge that provincial government initiatives are only one element of creating or deflating business confidence. There are other factors at play, some of which we can’t control. But the fact is we do have an opportunity to encourage business confidence with the policies that come out of this place. Obviously, from our perspective, we would suggest that the provincial government hasn’t been doing that for the last 13 years, and we need to do better.", "Christine Elliott has advocated policies that would, in fact, create that strong sense of business confidence in terms of the support from the provincial Legislature and the government and, hopefully, that would stimulate the creation of many thousands of jobs in the province of Ontario.", "Secondly, she talked about a renewed focus on skills training and the need to reform the apprenticeship system. She said that that would pay immediate dividends in the form of job creation. I think she’s absolutely right about that and should be commended for that suggestion.", "She said that young people and employers need incentives to pursue the existing job opportunities in today’s economy. I agree with that, without qualification. Certainly, we have a very high youth unemployment rate in the province of Ontario. I think it’s about double the overall rate, and that should be of concern of all of us. We need to do better on that particular public policy challenge.", "She also suggested that we need to open up student loans to apprentices, ensuring that more young people would pursue careers in good-paying, skilled trades.", "She also advocated a new approach to supporting creative innovation and entrepreneurship in our economy. She suggested that by issuing a competitive challenge, rewarding excellence in achievement, speeding up the work of the Ontario Securities Commission and creating an advanced manufacturing fund to support research and development, this would help us to lead the world in innovation—again, all laudable goals that I support and that many in my community support as well.", "She also outlined her vision for strengthening our economy in the long term, including new ideas to pay for the new infrastructure that we need. She committed to bringing stability to our hydro rates, which have skyrocketed in recent years, which in turn has contributed to the loss of some 300,000 manufacturing jobs in the province of Ontario.", "I’m privileged to serve as our party’s critic to the Minister of Economic Development, Infrastructure and Employment. I certainly endorse the member for Whitby–Oshawa, Christine Elliott’s, economic plan and believe that it is obviously a plan that would take us in the right direction in the province of Ontario.", "I would also add in the brief time that I have left that we have a significant number of infrastructure projects in our riding. I’ve advocated for my riding, as you know, Mr. Speaker, on a long list of infrastructure projects. The fact is that the provincial government plans and certainly budgets to spend a significant amount of money on infrastructure. Again, page 291 of the budget papers shows that they intend to spend $13.5 billion this year on infrastructure projects. I know they’re going to spend that money; they plan to spend it, they committed, they talk about it all the time, and the Premier is tweeting constantly about the infrastructure plans they have. They are going to spend that money, so I am saying that in Wellington–Halton Hills, we have our infrastructure challenges, we have our needs and we need our fair share of that money.", "I again submit to the government the need for the Highway 6 Morriston bypass through Puslinch township, south of the 401 on the way to Hamilton. The Premier has acknowledged that that project is needed in this Legislature, and we ask that the Minister of Transportation—something I’ve been advocating for many years now—place that project on the five-year plan for new construction, which we know as the southern highways program. I know that the minister, after the tabling of the budget, goes through a process of reviewing the various project ideas that exist. His staff know about the need; I’m sure his staff will fill him in on any additional information he needs, but there’s a strong business coalition that has come together in support of this project, including all of the local councils, chambers of commerce and so forth. We need to see that project done.", "We need a new courthouse in Halton. We need a new Holy Cross Catholic school in Georgetown. I’ve supported GO Transit improvements for my riding going back to 2008. We need high-speed Internet service in rural Ontario. We need support for the town of Erin waste water management system, something that needs to be addressed very soon.", "I realize I’m now out of time. I’ve got a long list of other projects I’d like to talk about, and I will at another opportunity.", "Mr. Speaker, I do not support the general budgetary policy of this government and I’ll be voting against this motion." ],

Just today, there was some information in the paper—and it was on the news as well—about how more and more seniors are filing for insolvency. It speaks to the fact that seniors have a very difficult time paying the bills. They have a very difficult time affording the rent, paying for their food and then for hydro.", "In this budget, as the government proposed, they’re going to be selling hydro. What’s that going to do to the rates? What’s that going to do to the seniors’ budgets, their household budgets? They can barely afford to make ends meet now. It says that more seniors are filing for bankruptcy. How shameful is that, that seniors can’t live in dignity after they retire, with some comfort, some peace of mind? Selling off hydro is not going to help seniors. It’s only going to raise the rates, and seniors are going to be strapped even more and will find themselves in a more precarious situation, find themselves struggling every day just to put food on the table, because their hydro bills are higher.", "I received my hydro bill, and it went up last Friday.

I just wanted to point out that during the budget processes, when we look at some of our construction programs—we have an ongoing expansion of Cambridge Memorial Hospital that was cemented in the budget a couple of budgets ago, and I’m very proud of the fact that it’s still committed to finishing and completing this project. It has been a very necessary part of our health care system for the residents of Cambridge and North Dumfries township. We did the ground-breaking in September, and it makes me very happy to go past and see the crane there, see the construction equipment.", "All those things are still in our budget, to make sure that we continue on this very important project. It not only supports the construction workers and the highly skilled trades workers in Cambridge, so they have ongoing work for five years, but it also gives a sense of comfort to the residents of our community, who had been wanting and needing this expansion for so long.", "That’s one of the things that I would point out to the member from Wellington–Halton Hills: that it’s very important to actually vote for the budgets that have these big construction programs in them.", "I also just wanted to point out the investment in our youth, with the increases in the Ontario youth strategies and our investments in the pre-apprenticeship programs, which really benefit Cambridge students. We have Conestoga College, right in Cambridge, which has a lot of good apprenticeship programs for our youth in ongoing, highly skilled trades.", "Speaker, I know I’m out of time.

He says there’s “not a lot of substance” in this budget.

I asked rhetorically, when the announcement was made, whether or not this was an allocation of new money or a reallocation of existing funding programs that exist within the provincial government. I also noted in past years—although the minister said that it was a $15-million program being reinstated. In fact, in recent years, as much as $25 million was spent on the Connecting Link Program. So we’ll reserve our final judgment on whether or not the government is keeping its commitment, and obviously bring forward the concerns of our constituents in this Legislature as this goes forward." ],

I want to be sure that their voices are heard in this Legislature. I also want to know all that I can about issues that affect the province. So here I stand to discuss the budget and to fight to keep hydro public.", "The teacher in me cannot resist the opportunity to shed a bit of light on the proud history of public hydro and electricity. Since we are literally standing here on the verge of a new government-induced dark age—literally—our province is on the brink of a time that families and businesses won’t be able to afford to keep their lights on. Since that is the case, let me share a bit about public power so we can fully appreciate it for the next few weeks that we still have it.", "I’d like to share an article from the Dictionary of Canadian Biography on Sir Adam Beck. But before I do that, I’ll flash forward. Sir Adam Beck fought for public hydro. He was knighted because he championed good ideas for the people. In fact, a statue was erected in his honour; a bronze monument of Sir Adam Beck is not far from here. Schools have been named in his memory—schools that soon might not be able to pay for their electricity and, like so many others, might have to close when costs skyrocket and funding evaporates. But I digress.", "I’ll read part of an article researched and written by H.V. Nelles. “The Prometheus of Canadian politics during the first quarter of the 20th century, Sir Adam Beck, brought the inestimable benefit of cheap electric light and power to the citizens of Ontario through a publicly owned utility, the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario. He had to fight continuously to build Hydro, as it came to be called, but supported by municipal allies he succeeded in creating one of the largest publicly owned integrated electric systems in the world.... Adam Beck more than any other public figure in Ontario reshaped the institutional life of the province by making electricity a public utility and legitimizing, through his accomplishments, public ownership as an effective instrument of policy throughout Canada.”", "Beck is quoted as insisting that, “It is the duty of the government to see that development is not hindered by permitting a handful of people to enrich themselves out of these treasures at the expense of the general public.” What a great thought. In fact, Mr. Speaker, I’m going to read it again: “It is the duty of the government to see that development is not hindered by permitting a handful of people to enrich themselves out of these treasures at the expense of the general public.” Continuing from the article, Beck “extolled the power of abundant cheap light to brighten the homes of working people; cheap electricity would create more jobs in the factories of the province; hydro would lighten the drudgery of the barn and the household; and electric railways radiating out from the cities into the countryside would create more prosperous, progressive farms even as light and power made brighter, cleaner cities.”", "In 1914, just more than 100 years ago, he received a knighthood. Here we are, 100 years later, rush-debating—probably in six and a half hours—so that this majority government can tear public hydro down and sell it for parts to some backroom money crowd. When I realized that the Premier of our province in just a few weeks will have sold affordable public power without the understanding or support of the people of this province, all the while knowing it is a despicable thing to do—it turns my stomach. The Premier of this province and leader of the government of Ontario is actually undertaking to punch the lights out of the middle class and the business community and to make sure that our struggling economy can now look forward to struggling in the dark. She is ensuring that small businesses will always stay small and won’t be able to pay their bills. Wynne’s money crowd wants to make a quick buck while the rest of us pay the price.", "Just to review, Sir Adam Beck wanted to “brighten the homes of working people”; Premier Kathleen Wynne wants to ensure higher rates for families who are already paying the highest bills in Canada. Sir Adam Beck knew that “cheap electricity would create more jobs in the factories of the province”; Premier Kathleen Wynne wants to ensure that companies like General Motors pay more and more to do business here and is undermining the goal of strengthening opportunities for growth in manufacturing. Sir Adam Beck knew that “hydro would lighten the drudgery of the barn and the household”; Premier Kathleen Wynne doesn’t seem to care that constituents across this province already can scarcely afford to heat their homes or use their appliances, and now she might expect them to ration their electric light usage. She wants us back in the dark ages. This government likes to keep Ontarians in the dark, and now she wants Ontarians to live in the dark. If you think I’m being dramatic, which might happen, I will put you in touch with my constituents who are still trying to pay bills from two winters ago—people who live in a basement apartment and only have one baseboard heater that they have to ration use of so they can afford to eat. And that’s just because of deregulation since 1999. What on earth are they going to do once their rates jump another 20% or so?", "Sir Adam Beck proposed that “electric railways radiating out from the cities into the countryside would create more prosperous, progressive farms” while “light and power made brighter, cleaner cities.”", "But Premier Kathleen Wynne just celebrated a diesel train and has pretended that the point of selling off revenue-generating assets was to invest in transit. They’re sneak-selling a revenue-generating asset that puts money into our provincial health care, into our provincial education, into communities across the province to put 3% of what’s been promised into the Toronto pot for Toronto transit. I begrudge Toronto nothing, but 3% at the expense of every business and household across the province? Who came up with this plan?", "The Liberals across from us seem surprised by the little details that we’ve been bringing forward from Bill 91. Who wrote this bill? The Minister of Finance doesn’t seem to have read the fine print. Maybe things are different on that side, but over here when we write a bill, we’re involved in the process. I’ve got a private member’s bill coming up and I know what’s in it, because that’s my job. My name is going to be on it. It is intending to make something better, to fix something. Bill 91 is tearing apart our public power and making a mockery of our democratic process. Shame on this Premier and shame on the Liberal caucus that isn’t standing up to her and isn’t standing up for their constituents.", "To finish the story of Sir Adam Beck and to again quote from the article, “He worried on his deathbed that political partisanship would overcome it and that Hydro as an independent entity would not survive. But in his absence it continued to flourish, firmly rooted in the towns and cities, along the back concessions and amongst the merchants, workers, farmers and homemakers of the province. Hydroelectricity generated and delivered by a crown corporation to municipally owned utilities at the lowest cost had become an Ontario institution that would outlive changing governments and passing ideologies”—until now; until Premier Kathleen Wynne; until 2015, when this short-sighted Liberal government plans to pull the plug on public power.", "New Democrats have invited Ontarians to fight against the sale of Hydro One and, Mr. Speaker, you can too if you go to www.youpaytheprice.ca. We are also holding town halls and meetings across the province. Since you weren’t able to make it to our round table in Oshawa, I’ll be happy to tell you about it.", "Andrea Horwath and I hosted a round table discussion to hear from local voices about the sale of hydro. We are fortunate to have a very active local coalition called Keep Hydro Public and I am pleased to read to you from their presentation:", "“Keep Hydro Public is a group of concerned Oshawa citizens. We are not opposed to transit and infrastructure, and realize that every budget has plums and barbs, but the sell-off of Hydro One is a barb, will raise hydro rates and have a direct impact on manufacturing jobs all across Ontario and we believe it will be difficult to retain the jobs we presently have. Wasteful spending scandals on eHealth, Ornge, gas plants, software glitches etc. could have paid for transit and infrastructure without selling Hydro One.”", "Also at that meeting were teachers who recognize the damage that even less funding, as a result of less revenue, would do and how it would impact our education system and students. At the meeting were community members who can’t understand why this government won’t listen to anyone. At the meeting were electricians who were concerned about what privatizing and lack of oversight will mean in terms of safety standards and certifications. Electricity isn’t a game. This is serious. Again, it’s clear that this government is making a rash, short-sighted decision where communities will be paying the price.", "Oshawa, like cities across the province, is concerned about what this sell-off will mean. This isn’t partisan; this is a provincial concern.", "I would like to share the front page of Business Matters, which is a regular publication in my community from the Greater Oshawa Chamber of Commerce. The headline is “Budgets 2015: Business Drowning in Energy Debt and No GO for Durham.” I’ll read excerpts from it to share the voice of businesses on this issue:", "“With the Ontario budget just completed, the Ontario chamber and the chamber network are concerned about the government’s decisions that are negatively impacting business ... undermining the capacity of businesses to grow and create jobs in Ontario.", "“The Ontario Energy Board recently announced that starting May 1 rates will go up by $5.71 per month for an average Ontario household. However, this hydro rate increase has far greater significance for businesses. Increases will range between 7% and 15% per kilowatt hour, impacting, for example, restaurants, fast food outlets and small industry that operate during on-peak and mid-peak times.... This takes on much greater significance given the backdrop of an impending partial sale of Hydro One.”", "The chamber goes on, Mr. Speaker: “‘Budget 2015 does little to address business’ concerns over rising electricity rates,’ stated Bob Malcolmson, CEO of the Greater Oshawa Chamber of Commerce, ‘and according to the most recent Ontario Chamber survey, rising electricity prices are the number one factor hurting business competitiveness. Last year alone 2,700 companies left Ontario.’”", "Just this past week it was announced that 1,000 jobs at GM will be gone. That’s 1,000 good-paying jobs just gone. In the auto industry, one job in manufacturing has seven to 10 spin-off jobs in the connected industry. That’s a lot of workers. Those are a lot of families. Those are a lot of connected businesses. On the heels of that announcement, this government is ramming through this legislation with no one wanting them to do it; ramming through legislation to increase the cost of electricity and the cost of doing business in Ontario. How can businesses exist when they can’t predict the rising costs or afford to pay them? Who is driving this runaway train?", "Speaker, I wonder, through you to the Premier, what hydro experts they have talked to on this issue. What do you even know about hydro? What’s required to build and maintain an efficient hydro system? What do you understand about generation, transmission and distribution systems? Who is your expert, and what do they know about it? Ed Clark is a banker, so who is your hydro expert? Who is advising you? You don’t know what you’re selling and why you are selling it. If you haven’t talked to a hydro expert then you don’t know what you’re doing.", "Paul Kahnert worked in the industry for 33 years. He knows hydro. I’m glad to be able to share parts of a recent article that he wrote for the Hamilton Spectator. Paul worked in the industry, as I said, for 33 years and was spokesperson for the Ontario Electricity Coalition from 2001 to 2010, which campaigned against hydro privatization across the province and stopped the sale of Hydro One in court in the spring of 2002.", "The title of the article was “Wynne’s Sale of Hydro One Is a Betrayal of the Public Interest.” From the article: “If you’re driving your car and the steering wheel comes off in your hands, do you step on the gas or step on the brakes? Hydro rates are out of control in Ontario and with the proposed sale of Hydro One, Kathleen Wynne is stepping on the gas....", "“Where is the demand coming from? There are no public demonstrations outside Queen’s Park demanding that Hydro One be sold. The demand is coming from Bay Street and the investment community. Wynne is also looking for a quick fix for Ontario’s deficit.", "“There is no such thing as free money. There are permanent consequences from privatization.", "“Giving up forever all future revenue (now $1 billion a year) for a one-time cash payment for Hydro One is not a very wise thing to do.”", "He continues, “Wynne is promising that all money from the sale will go towards transportation infrastructure. Infrastructure lasts 40 to 50 years and then needs to be rebuilt again. The problem with selling public assets is that you can only sell them once. We said 14 years ago that it’s like burning your furniture to heat your home. What do you burn next? ....", "“The private sector does a fabulous job of manufacturing transformers, insulators, wire, relays, switches, connectors and all the materials we need to build our electrical system but they do a poor job of running hydro in the public interest. They can’t. Their fiduciary duty legally requires them to maximize profits for their shareholder. Now, more than $1 billion a year now goes out of the province in private power profits. That money used to go out to businesses and citizens in the form of low and stable rates.", "“Politicians did not sell Ontario Hydro during the depths of the Great Depression nor during the height of the Second World War. Those economic times were far worse than what we face now. Those politicians wisely kept hydro to create jobs and to help the economy recover from those lean times.", "“The world’s climate is in trouble. Now, more than ever, it is critical that governments have the levers of public ownership to curb global warming and institute real conservation programs.", "“The hydro privatization experiment has failed in Ontario. In fact, there is not one jurisdiction anywhere in the world where privatization hasn’t resulted in big rate hikes. The promise of deregulation was ‘lower rates.’ The promise of smart meters was that ‘smart meters will save you money.’ Both promises were completely false.”", "He continues, if can you imagine: “Kathleen Wynne needs to scrap the idea of selling Hydro One and put the brakes on hydro deregulation and privatization. It’s in the public interest, both for the economy and environment.", "“It’s important to note that during the provincial election on September 5, 2003, McGuinty, low in the polls, took the main campaign plank from the NDP and promised ‘public power.’ Closing the phony IESO electricity market and regulating rates would be a good start on that promise.", "“Let’s remember that Sir Adam Beck, a Tory, backed by business, after a 10-year campaign and 18 municipal referendums, brought public power to Ontario in 1905. For 95 years, Ontario grew and prospered under public power. On his deathbed, Sir Adam Beck said, ‘I wish I could have lived long enough to build a band of iron around Hydro, to keep it safe from the politicians.’ He might have added, ‘And safe from the profiteers.’” I’m pleased to be able to share these words from Paul Kahnert, who remembers because he’d gone through this back in 2002. And back in 2002, Judge Gans ruled on April 19 that the provincial government did not have the right to sell Hydro One and that it belonged to the people of Ontario.", "Ernie Eves didn’t like that, so in June 2002 Eves passed Bill 58, which gave the Tory government the legal ability to sell Hydro One. But they didn’t dare sell it because the Star poll of the day said that 94% of Ontarians didn’t want it. What a startling thought: The government of the day listening to the people of the province. But here we are with this government, on this day, determined to put us back 100 years. Is this a Liberal plan or is this a Kathleen Wynne initiative? I don’t know.", "On September 5, 2003, then-Liberal Premier Dalton McGuinty said in an exclusive interview with the Toronto Sun’s editorial board, “Deregulation and privatization hasn’t worked and we can’t go back there. I’ve drawn a lesson from that. Number one, we’ve got to keep hydro public.”" ],

Is it the part that says that Hydro One will continue to be regulated, with the Ontario government as the largest shareholder? Is it the part that says that the Ontario government will have a veto on all key decisions; the part that allows us, in part because of this transaction, to build the LRT in Mississauga; or the electrification of the GO train that is going to allow 15-minute service on so many GO corridors and two-way, all-day service? Is it the 100,000 jobs that our infrastructure plan is going to create every year? Is it the Eglinton Crosstown LRT that she doesn’t understand? Is it the Sheppard East LRT that she doesn’t support?

I think the Premier and this government have worked very hard to find solutions to some of the challenges they face, but to seize the opportunities for the future. This is a budget that thinks about the short term, but also one that thinks about the long term.", "There’s just a few things that I want to highlight in the budget to add to what the minister was saying earlier. On jobs and the economy: In this budget, you have the introduction of the Canada-Ontario Job Grant, covering “two-thirds of total eligible training costs” with “flexibility for small employers”—supporting business, supporting employers. We’re “renewing the Ontario Youth Jobs Strategy by investing an additional $250 million over the next two years,” helping our young people access the job market and address that youth unemployment we face. We’re investing $55 million towards in-class apprenticeship training and support programs, again, helping our young people get jobs. When it comes to developing our highly-skilled work force, we’re investing $75 million to support construction of a six-storey, 260,000-square-foot learning resource commons at Humber College. This is in my community of Etobicoke. I’m incredibly proud of that. It’s something that’s going to enhance the opportunities for young people in the years to come. I talked about the youth jobs strategy: $23 million towards the Apprenticeship Enhancement Fund, investing in equipment, technology and space, again, helping young people get jobs. We’re investing $130 billion over 10 years in infrastructure.", "Again, this is thinking about the future, not just thinking about the present. I think what this budget has done is all of this and many other things, while at the same time thinking about our fiscal future and ensuring that we’re good custodians of the taxpayer dollar. That means laying out a plan to balance the budget, doing so gradually, doing so responsibly, but doing so. It is so critical and important—not just to this generations but to future generations—that we do so, so that we have the funding to provide those programs and that quality of life that we’ve all come to expect and enjoy." ],

This is a critical issue that is costing everybody in Ontario extra time lost, extra time to pay for gas and extra time in delivering food, products and industrial products.", "These billions of dollars cost everybody, year after year. This is not a one-time cost, so building infrastructure—roads, bridges, public transit—is an imperative. We have no choice. Therefore, I wonder what their plan is to build transit or to build roads or to fix our bridges. They have none. All they say is, “We don’t like the way you’re going to do it.”", "Sure, the way we’re going to do it is outlined in the budget. They’ve got, as usual, everything negative to say about Ontario, everything negative to say about the future of this province. But the future of this province is in its economy, in moving goods and services. We’ve got an amazing workforce in this province, from Cornwall to Kenora, but we can’t let this workforce go to work if we’ve got people stuck in traffic and trucks stuck in traffic every day—$7 billion to $11 billion a year.", "What is their plan to do something? The plan is basically zero. All they say is, “Oh, we love Hydro One” all of a sudden. I’ve been sitting here for a number of years; I never heard one of them on either side ever stand up and say anything good about Hydro One in 20 years—now they love Hydro One—or the Beer Store—now they’re in love with the Beer Store.", "Now, all of a sudden, every day, they’re saying, “Whoa. Isn’t Hydro One fantastic?” They stood up here, day after day, hammering it as poorly run: “It’s got to be done better. People are complaining.” The Beer Store: “We’ve got to get more competition in the Beer Store.” We finally do something, and they say, “Oh, don’t do it. We love it as it is.”", "The status quo, Mr. Speaker, is not an option, because we can’t borrow any more. Maybe that’s what they want to do. Maybe we should increase borrowing." ],

I certainly welcome some of the comments from my colleague from Eglinton–Lawrence.", "One of the things that I’m really happy to see in this budget is the support that we’ve got for children and youth. I’ve spoken frequently in the House about my two appropriate-aged sons for the youth jobs strategy—I have an 18- and a 21-year-old at home—but it’s also the friends that they bring home from school and those friends who are looking forward to their future and wondering what’s out there for them. So I’m really pleased to see that we’re renewing Ontario’s Youth Jobs Strategy by investing $250 million more over two years. That benefits the students and youth in Cambridge, in particular, and I see a great benefit so they have more options for their future.", "I wanted to talk about Cambridge’s manufacturing sector. Cambridge was actually founded on manufacturing. I wanted to say that I’m really happy with the fact that our advanced manufacturing sector has grown over 4% in the last few years. It also means that our manufacturing plants need more highly skilled trades. I’ve often noted that Conestoga College in Cambridge has many skilled trades programs, and I’m really pleased to see another investment of $13 million over two years for pre-apprenticeship programs and investing another $19 million over the next three years to support training for apprenticeship programs. This really benefits the manufacturing plants in my city.", "Investing $23 million more over two years in the Apprenticeship Enhancement Fund in Cambridge is also great news. As I’ve said, we’ve been growing manufacturing, and I’ve had a lot of conversations and tours of our local manufacturing companies. They are very happy not only with the investment in the highly skilled trades department and the apprenticeship programs, but they’re also very pleased about the ongoing support with our Southwestern Ontario Development Fund. We have many businesses in Cambridge that have benefited from the investment from this fund, and many more that are looking to apply to this program. Recent examples are Meridian Manufacturing, Cambridge Towel, and COM DEV, to name a few. They’re very happy with the ongoing support.", "The Jobs and Prosperity Fund is also important to a dynamic business environment, in particular, again, in Cambridge because of our highly skilled and manufacturing plants.", "Some of the recent tours that I’ve had in Cambridge really confirm the fact that the energy program from the Ontario Liberal government over the last few years has been key to their success. Why? Well, I toured a plant on Friday, and part of their business is making vinyl products. When there is an interruption in electricity supply, the batch is ruined, and they have a whole protocol on how to shut down the machines and make sure that they can take the molten vinyl off the lines before it gums up and interferes with their machinery. This company has been in Cambridge for over 100 years, so they remember the times in the 1990s, and again the big shutdown in their plant in 2003 when the electricity system failed in our part of the world. They really do appreciate the fact that now when they flip the switch on, the electricity system is reliable, and that they’re able to continue to manufacture.", "As a matter of a fact, at a recent round table, there were 19 manufacturers and businesses at that round table on economic development put on by our chamber of commerce. Business after business kept praising the fact that they do have reliable electricity, which is key to making sure that their manufacturing processes are intact. It’s a real waste when they have to ruin a batch of product if the electricity fails in the meantime.", "We’ve had a recent company invest in Cambridge because of the low corporate taxes and because of the ongoing investment in the highly skilled trades project. We welcomed Héroux-Devtek just a couple of months ago to open their doors, and they’re building high-end landing gear for big aircraft. We’re really happy to have them, and it’s because of the ongoing support in this budget from the Jobs and Prosperity Fund and the ongoing investment in skills training.", "Speaker, I’m going to stop there and allow my colleagues also to enter in, but I’m certainly very, very supportive of this budget." ],

This decision was pursued and included in the budget bill presented to this Legislature on April 23, 2015. The proposal in this budget marks the most significant shift in public service delivery within the last 25 years, and the subsequent implications of the budget will resonate for at least a generation. Debate on the budget, including the sale of Hydro One laid out in it, has just begun, and the budget has not seen a minute of committee hearings.", "The government has been clear that the proceeds from the sale of Hydro One will be used to invest in the province’s infrastructure and transit. Yet the Globe and Mail on May 1, as well as other media outlets, have reported that the tentative deal with the power generation and Hydro One employees would include shares equivalent to 2.75% of their salaries every 15 years and 2.7% of their salaries every 12 years respectively. The government has consistently demonstrated an acute awareness of these negotiations of a tentative collective bargaining agreement with the Power Workers’ Union.", "I want to quote. This is a quote from Deb Matthews from the House on April 30: “We are very pleased that a tentative agreement has been reached with the Power Workers’ Union. It is a net-zero deal, but it is” ours “for ratification. I’m not going to comment on a deal that actually is before the members of that union so they can make their” own “decision about ratification. I’m going to respect that process.", "“But I am very, very pleased that the leadership of the Power Workers’ Union has expressed support. I’m actually very excited that workers who work in Hydro One are demonstrating that they may be interested in being owners of” a partially owned utility. “I really believe when workers own part of the company they’re working for, that” will make “for a stronger company.”", "Energy Minister Bob Chiarelli on April 30 in the Toronto Star said, “It’s a win-win for both sides.”", "“It’s a tentative ‘net zero’ contract. It’s compliant with our policies”—and I underline “our policies.”", "Again, the Toronto Star, Bob Chiarelli, April 30: “The tentative settlement ... is very broad-based and deals with all of the important issues that we need to accommodate on both sides.”", "New Democrats maintain serious concerns about the negative long-term effects and costs of privatization of Hydro One. We are equally troubled by the government’s decision to prematurely negotiate deals involving the distribution of Hydro One shares before the Legislature has approved such privatization. That really goes to the centre of what the point of privilege is all about. How can this happen, when the Legislature has not yet passed the legislation, that the government has somehow acquiesced to the ability of Hydro One to negotiate such a deal of shares with the Power Workers’ Union? It seems to us that that’s putting the cart before the horse, and also it’s flagrantly against what the precedents are in this House.", "It is our assertion that this action represents a breach of privilege and constitutes a contempt of Parliament. Clearly the government has given the go-ahead for hydro to negotiate this without the authorization of this Legislature.", "Information regarding the tentative deal reached by the government with Ontario Power Generation and Hydro One workers involving the distribution of shares that have yet to be approved by this assembly has been made publicly available and has been reported in the Globe and Mail, the Financial Post, the Toronto Star, Metro news and Newstalk 1010, amongst others. By pre-empting the bill’s progression through the House, the government has acted in a fashion that signals that the appropriate parliamentary processes are unnecessary for the completion of any deal. Again, Mr. Speaker, this bill is still before the House. We have not passed such a bill.", "In 1997, a prima facie ruling by Speaker Stockwell regarding a document involved with government advertising, warned as follows—if you remember, Speaker, it was related to the megacity bill. The government had put out advertising—specifically, had put out a flyer—where they were talking about what was going to happen should this legislation pass.", "Stockwell had this to say: He warned that “a reader of that document could be left with an incorrect impression about how parliamentary democracy works in Ontario, an impression that undermines respect for our parliamentary institutions.”", "An unassuming member of the public could infer from any of the media outlets above that the distribution of Hydro One shares by the government is a foregone conclusion and not contingent on an act of the House that has yet to occur.", "Erskine May explains the concept of contempt in the following terms: “Generally speaking, any act or omission which obstructs or impedes either House of Parliament in the performance of its functions, or which obstructs or impedes any member or officer of such House in the discharge of his duty, or which has a tendency”—and I say “tendency”—“directly or indirectly, to produce such results may be treated as contempt even though there is no precedent of the offence. It is therefore impossible to list every act which might be considered to amount to a contempt, the power to punish for such an offence being of its nature discretionary” to the Speaker.", "“Indignities offered to the House by words spoken or writings published reflecting on its character or proceedings have been constantly punished by both the Lords and the Commons upon the principle that such acts tend to obstruct the Houses in the performance of their functions by diminishing the respect due to them....", "“Other acts besides words spoken or writings published reflecting upon either House or its proceedings which, though they do not tend directly to obstruct or impede either House in the performance of its functions, yet have a tendency to produce this result indirectly or by bringing such House into odium, contempt or ridicule or by lowering its authorities may constitute contempts,” according to Erskine May.", "I finish on this: By negotiating the distribution of private shares of a public crown asset such as Ontario hydro before the Legislature of Ontario has approved the sale of such shares, the government undermines the authority of this House.", "It is clear that the concerns of various speakers identified not only in Stockwell’s 1997 ruling, but others, raises questions about the manner in which the government is negotiating the sale of Hydro One shares. It is for these reasons I hope that you rule in favour of a prima facie case of contempt and allow this House to investigate this matter fully." ],

It takes a while, as you can be aware, to do some research. I asked my staff to go through the media clippings in order to find clippings that would indicate that in fact the government did support this particular initiative, and that’s what they found. That’s why they’re included in the letter. It’s not because I read them on that day. It’s because they actually did the research, and we wrote this particular point of privilege yesterday. Unfortunately, by 5 o’clock I went to your office and you were not there. I got there around 5 o’clock. I’m not chastising you, but it’s just the reality that you weren’t there. That’s why I immediately went to your office this morning to bring it in.", "I also want to say, just on the last point, the issue here is that this Legislature has a function, and the function is to approve the budgetary process of the government and approve legislation. When a government decides to enact and to put into place what it is supposing to happen as a result of passage of legislation before the legislation is ever passed, I think it is an affront to this Legislature. That’s really what the crux of it is. I won’t repeat that, but I’m sure you understand why we raised this, and I ask you not to take into consideration the comments made by the government House leader." ],

We are now taking added steps to build on that success and to significantly reduce the risk of reoffending, especially among high-risk offenders. For example, we’re targeting more resources to our medium- to high-risk offenders because evidence tells us that we have more success in breaking the cycle of reoffending when their sentence is served in the community. That, again, is because of the hard work of our probation and parole officers and the network of thousands of community organizations and support groups that they are plugged into.

Today, the South Asian diaspora in Ontario includes more than one million people, mostly in the GTA, but also in Ottawa, Hamilton, London and Windsor.", "This community is, quite simply, one of the most diverse populations in Canada. Newcomers also arrive here from South Asian pockets in other parts of the world, created during colonial times. These include Uganda, Kenya, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, Fiji, and Mauritius. Speaker, these are communities within a community, and we are proud to have welcomed them into ours. As a result, South Asian Canadians represent a number of different religions and cultures.", "Through their diversity, they are making an important contribution to Ontario’s social, cultural and economic fabric. This includes their insights about a part of the world that is rapidly growing in economic importance. Indeed, every newcomer to Ontario from this region holds an important connection to their former home and can help bring more wealth and prosperity to Ontario.", "Ontario was built on immigration, and our future prosperity depends on immigration. Immigration creates the cultural and religious diversity that makes our province one of the greatest places in the world to live.", "This month, I urge my colleagues to think about the ways in which South Asian Canadians have contributed to our province and helped make it a better place. There will be festivities celebrating South Asian culture all across the province in May, and I urge all Ontarians to join in." ],

It is not the responsibility of women, who are constantly being told, “Don’t wear revealing clothing, don’t drink too much, don’t invite men into your apartment and always keep an eye on your drink.”", "Over the years, warnings like this have perpetuated a pervasive rape culture, particularly on post-secondary campuses where as many as one quarter of female students experience some form of sexual assault. Rape culture suggests that the onus is on women to prevent the assault and to prove that they were not responsible for it. By doing so, it removes accountability from the perpetrators who commit the assault.", "Shifting from a culture of “no means no” to “yes means yes” means teaching boys from an early age about consent, respect and rights. We need to stop blaming victims of assault, who can be men as well as women. We need to build a system that stops revictimizing survivors.", "A 2004 study in Canada found that a single incident of sexual assault can be a life-shattering experience, with survivors feeling fear, guilt, shame and low self-esteem. Yet many survivors do not report to the police because they fear being blamed and because they fear being stigmatized and traumatized by a system that results in a conviction rate of less than 1%.", "Let us commit to creating a coordinated, integrated and survivor-led approach to the prevention of sexual assault that focuses on public education, that truly supports survivors, that ensures trauma-informed responses from police, health care, education, social services and justice, and that respects survivors’ needs for constructive and supportive alternatives to the justice system." ],

The government promised to balance the budget by 2017-18. That’s only two years away. This budget should have laid out a real plan to get us there; instead, we saw spending increases of $2.4 billion.", "When the Liberal government took office in 2003, the provincial debt stood at $139 billion. A dozen years later, it now stands at $299 billion. If it were a government ministry, interest on the debt would now be the third-largest Ontario ministry after health and education. In fact, the cost to service our debt is up 5.7%, which would also make it the fastest-growing ministry. Compare that to health care spending, which is up just 1.9%. That’s not even enough to keep up with inflation and population growth, and it means further cuts to front-line services at hospitals and elsewhere within the system.", "I also want to point out what’s not in this bill or in this budget. Despite the increase in spending of $2.4 billion, there is no additional help for the farmers. There are no steps towards increasing the cap on risk management programs. Despite the increase in spending of $2.4 billion, municipalities saw another decrease in the important Ontario Municipal Partnership Fund grants. Despite the increase in spending of $2.4 billion, we are actually seeing less provincial money going into health care. The Canada Health Transfer from the federal government to Ontario increased by—and this is very important—$652 million, but health care spending in this budget only increases by $598 million, a difference of $54 million. That means there is $54 million less in provincial dollars going into health care.", "There are also no steps in this bill or this budget towards addressing the five key requests that the PC caucus put forward. We asked the government to streamline home care services. Instead, they created a new layer of bureaucracy.", "We asked them to put forward a serious, credible, detailed plan to deal with the deficit and debt.

Instead, they recommitted to the plan, which will only increase costs for both employees and businesses.", "We asked them to reject the planned implementation of a carbon tax, the so-called tax on everything. Instead, they are embracing it.", "We asked them to take action to make electricity rates more affordable. Instead, the government is proposing to sell our hydro assets and put an increasing burden on the ratepayers. Not only did the government not take action to reduce hydro rates, as we had asked, but this bill contains measures that will actually increase rates by selling off the majority of Hydro One.", "Mr. Speaker, this proposal to sell off Hydro One is a little like selling off the house to pay for a fancy new sports car. At first, it’s great, and you show it off to your friends. You drive it all over the place. But after a couple of years, you need major repairs or a new car. You have nothing to show for it, and the asset is gone.", "In fact, in 2003, the member from Guelph, who is now the Minister of Education, shared our views on this subject. At the time, she said, “They understood that we need to hang on to our public assets like generators and Hydro One.... They understood that if you just sell off public assets, that’s a one-year wonder. You do it once and then it’s gone, and then what are you left with? You’re left with a deficit.”", "The Premier has already stated that she can’t guarantee that this won’t drive hydro costs up any further. Over the last few years we’ve seen hydro rates spiral in Ontario. People and businesses don’t have any room left in their budget for more increases.", "I recently heard from a constituent who is now heating her home with wood and worked hard to get her hydro costs down. Her usage in one month was only $87.64, yet with the extra charges—delivery charges, debt retirement, regulatory charges and HST—the total amount of the bill was $274.87.", "This government doesn’t seem to understand the impact that these hydro rate increases have had, that people are being forced to choose between heat and eat. They don’t understand that people are being forced to leave their homes. This government doesn’t seem to understand that hydro increases are forcing businesses out of this province.", "In my recent Oxford business survey, 94% of the businesses said that they had been impacted by the increased cost of hydro. When companies choose where they build or expand, the cost of doing business is a major factor. For many companies, the cost of hydro is one of the reasons they choose to locate elsewhere. It’s one of the reasons that our businesses are struggling to make ends meet and to grow.", "The Ontario Federation of Agriculture’s column following the budget said, “With no mention of a province-wide farm electricity rate and a delay in the natural gas expansion program to rural Ontario, farmers will have to wait longer for more competitive energy costs.”", "The people and businesses of Ontario have been asking this government for help. They don’t want to give up control of hydro. They want you to use the control that you have to help people who are struggling. They want you to use the control you have to reduce hydro costs. Instead, this government is proposing to give away majority control and oversight.", "Last year, the CEO of Hydro One made $745,000, but that may be the last time that the people who are paying for his salary get to know what it is because this bill exempts Hydro One from the Public Sector Salary Disclosure Act or so-called sunshine law. When public salaries were released, CBC News reported, “There are about 12,500 employees from OPG, Hydro One and their subsidiaries on the 2014 list, up by nearly 1,000 over 2013, when the Auditor General warned those salaries were driving up electricity rates.”", "Now, not only will Hydro One not appear on the sunshine list; neither the auditor nor the Ombudsman would have the authority to investigate problems there. The government cannot give up this oversight. The hydro users of Ontario can’t afford it.", "The government will tell us that when Hydro One becomes an independent corporation, they can no longer give the Auditor General jurisdiction, but that simply is not true. I’d like to remind them that they managed to do exactly that with the Technical Standards and Safety Authority in 2009. They introduced and passed legislation which would give the auditor the authority to investigate the TSSA and access to documents, even though the TSSA is an independent, not-for-profit corporation, is not a government agency and the majority of the board are not appointed by the province.", "Under this proposal, the government will be prohibited by law from selling more than 60% of Hydro One. That’s what it says in the budget. But unfortunately, that only works if the government respects our laws. For instance, when we were in government we passed a law to ensure that if Hydro One was sold, the proceeds had to go first to pay down the remaining debt. This was to protect taxpayers to ensure that a future government didn’t go on spending sprees and leave taxpayers and hydro users stuck with the debt and no asset.", "However, this act would amend that law so that the minister has the ability to put as much of the proceeds as he wants into general revenues, which means that the government gets their spending spree and the people of Ontario will be stuck with the bill.", "Hydro isn’t the only cost-of-living-and-doing-business increase under this government’s proposals. This bill will continue the implementation of the ill-advised mandatory pension program. The government likes to talk about this pension like it’s free and that people are winning the Cash for Life lottery, but the reality is that every dollar that goes into the pension program is being deducted from hard-working Ontarians or taken from an Ontario business. It’s money that otherwise would have gone to paying the bills, paying down the mortgage or making sure that the kids had new, warm clothes for the winter. It’s money that these businesses could use to expand and create new jobs or, in some cases, use to just stay in business and keep contributing to Ontario’s economy.", "Recently, I had the opportunity, through surveys, to ask both my constituents and businesses in my riding about the proposed pension. Seventy-eighty per cent of my constituents who responded said they can’t afford to pay 1.9% of their income into the proposed pension program. They recognize that this isn’t free money. It’s money that is coming out of their pockets.", "Is it really up to the government to decide how this money is to be spent? Is it really up to the government to decide that it’s better investing in this pension scheme than paying down the mortgage or paying down the credit card, which they’re paying 19% interest on? Is it really going to leave people in Ontario better off if implementing the pension costs jobs, as the government’s own documents show it will? Ninety per cent of Oxford businesses said they would be impacted by the proposed pension plan and most of these said the impact would be significant.", "In the same survey, I also asked businesses about a carbon tax and 86% of the respondents said they would be impacted by it—negatively impacted by it, I might add.", "The Minister of Economic Development, Employment and Infrastructure stated that this carbon tax will take money out of companies’ hands and put it in government coffers. He said it would take money out of our economy.", "In jurisdictions where they’ve tried it, a cap-and-trade system has not led to significant emission reductions and this type of system has proven to be easily manipulated. This tax would drive up the cost of every product that my constituents use.", "Already the Premier said that consumers can anticipate an increase of 2.5 to 3.5 cents a litre on gasoline under this proposed plan. This is from the same government that said there would be minimal impact on hydro rates from the Green Energy Act. For people who live in rural areas, driving isn’t a luxury. The minister may not understand that. It’s a necessity to go to work, to get the groceries. It is another increase in the cost of living that they can’t afford. I believe in protecting the environment, but I don’t believe that the solution is to tax everything. I don’t believe the people of Ontario can afford that.", "Earlier I pointed out that despite the $2.4-billion increase in spending, municipalities are again seeing cuts in the municipal partnership fund grants. The government will claim that they are supporting municipalities through transit but, on page 49 of the budget papers, it states, “The province encourages municipal partners to explore financing tools, such as asset optimization, to help ensure these projects may proceed.” That means they’re going to force municipalities to sell assets to finance transit. Not only is this government selling the house to buy a fancy sports car, they are forcing municipalities to do the same thing.", "There are also a number of other changes in the budget and this bill that impact municipalities. For instance, section 41 amends the Taxpayer Protection Act to allow the minister to increase fees in unorganized territories without a referendum as long as it’s done by January 1, 2017. This is the first step in property land tax reform. The government will tell us that this is something that municipalities have been asking for, but that’s not completely accurate.", "What municipalities have been asking for is recognition that those adjacent to unorganized territories incur costs from residents of those areas. Many people from unorganized territories use community centres, libraries and long-term-care homes. Some municipalities supply emergency services to residents in unorganized territories. In one case, the mayor pointed out that on one built-up road residents on one side are in the municipality while the other side is unorganized territory. Their fire trucks don’t stop because the person who called is on the wrong side of the street.", "The government has committed to PLT reform and increasing the amount paid by the residents in unorganized territories, but nowhere in the speech at ROMA or in this budget do they commit to giving those increased revenues to the municipalities who are incurring the costs.", "I wrote to the Premier, asking for this commitment following the Good Roads/Rural Ontario Municipal Association conference, and we’re still waiting for a reply.", "The government is promising consultation, but northern municipalities have heard that before. What they need is a commitment that the government isn’t going to raise costs for people in unorganized territories and simply put it into general revenue.", "Also buried in the budget pages is a mention of the Power Dam Special Payment Program. Currently, hydroelectric generation stations in Ontario don’t pay property taxes to their local municipalities. Instead, they pay a gross revenue charge to the province which, according to the Ministry of Finance, includes their property tax. The ministry then pays the property tax to the municipality through the Power Dam Special Payment Program. In fact, the 2014 budget clearly stated that the payments reflect the amount of property tax the municipality received before the stations became exempt from property tax. Last year’s budget suddenly announced that these payments would be cut by 25%, with no warning. The government has promised to look at the long-term solution, but this budget demonstrates that nothing has been resolved. All the government has done is push off the decision, leaving municipalities under threat. We will be watching and working with the municipalities to ensure that there is a real solution to this problem.", "Mr. Speaker, municipalities aren’t the only ones who have to be concerned about what’s hidden in this budget. For instance, look at schedule 14 of this bill, which weakens the rules around government advertising. Instead of leaving it to the good judgment of the Provincial Auditor and her office, advertising will now be judged on a narrow set of rules.", "As the provincial Auditor General said, this would put her office “in the untenable and unacceptable position of approving ads because they conform to the narrow requirements of the amended Government Advertising Act, but may be clearly partisan by any objective, reasonable standard.”", "Mr. Speaker, I can assure you I’ve never had a constituent come up to me on the street and say that the Auditor General is being too strict on government advertising.", "The government says that the auditor is being too picky, focusing on things like colour. Well, if you think colour doesn’t matter, just ask my grandson. A few years ago, he declared that when he grew up, he wanted to be in politics, and he was going to be on the blue team, like Opa. The truth is that as politicians, we do think colours matter. If we didn’t, our election signs wouldn’t be in our party colours. The Liberals wouldn’t wear red jackets at the plowing match and have red websites, and there probably wouldn’t have been as much red in those ads that the Auditor General rejected.", "In my recent survey, I asked companies in Oxford whether they were receiving enough information from government. The majority said yes, but the common theme was that they wanted more practical, fact-based information. One said he needed “clear info—not ‘ads’ about changes.”", "Mr. Speaker, Ontario can’t afford a government that keeps spending with no regard for deficit or debt, and we can’t afford a government that ignores no-cost suggestions which would have made sure tax dollars were spent more efficiently. I want to give you three examples that could have been implemented in this bill.", "Last week, I pointed out again the huge burden of red tape and reporting facing our municipalities. One, I pointed out that Bill 73, the Smart Growth for Our Communities Act, adds more reporting requirements onto municipalities—" ],

For those who don’t know, social housing providers in Ontario are required by law to purchase natural gas and insurance through the Housing Services Corp.

I came across phrases like “asset optimization,” “maximizing value” and “initial public offering.” I saw the phrase “broadening ownership.”", "At least seven times I came across the Premier’s new favourite phrase, obviously written by a Liberal-friendly consultant as part of a $7-million outlay of taxpayer money paid to the government-friendly consultants who worked secretly behind closed doors on a propaganda plan to use smoke and mirrors to pull the wool over the eyes of Ontario taxpayers. What was that phrase, Speaker? No, not, “We will sell Ontario Hydro.” That would be too transparent. The phrase, Speaker, seven times: “We will unlock the value of certain provincial assets.” It doesn’t even sound like, “We will sell Ontario Hydro.” “We will unlock the value of certain provincial assets.”", "You can run on a campaign using that fuzzy-wuzzy language, but please don’t come in this House and say, “Everybody in Ontario knew we were going to sell Ontario Hydro,” because they did not.

He doesn’t want his workers to have their quality of life or family life interrupted.", "The interesting piece is, though, he actually called the minister’s office and they referred him to me—to call me in Welland—to take this issue to Queen’s Park.", "The Liberal government is proposing the sale of Hydro One, which will mean higher hydro rates, less reliability, no Ombudsman oversight, no FAO oversight, no FIPPA oversight, no Auditor General oversight, and an increase of more than the 42% already announced by this government.", "I don’t know about all of the members in this House, but certainly people in my community and in my fellow colleagues’ communities are having trouble staying afloat. In some cases, people are being forced to pay their energy bills or actually buy groceries.", "This budget is forcing Ontarians to pay for the billions of dollars that have been wasted in scandals and misplaced priorities.", "I actually had someone ask me the other day how much the OPP investigations are going to cost this government and the people of Ontario. It will be interesting to actually see how those budgets become bloated, once those investigations are completed.", "We’re seeing today—as our public education system is thrown into chaos by the Liberal government—teachers, students and families being forced to bear that brunt of more cuts. The Liberals, of course, are trying to blame the educators, when it’s really the educators who are just trying to protect the system that they have today, that will produce future generations and the leaders of the future here for the province.", "Instead of supporting them, we’ve had mass school closures; we’ve had children on buses for hours, having to go out of their community to go to school; we’ve had EAs and teachers fired; we’ve had plans to increase class sizes; and we’ve had mass chaos, most recently, in our public school system. This is caused by the Liberals, not the teachers.", "This budget cuts poverty reduction programs. It proposes selling off a hydro system—a publicly owned system—to Bay Street, and it opens the door for more privatization to come.", "In fact, the Premier really has Mike Harris to thank for setting up her privatization of Hydro One plans. He was the one who laid the foundation that allows Hydro One to be privatized today. For anyone who has forgotten, it was Ontario Hydro that was then split into five successor companies under the Harris government.", "But it’s not just about me and my NDP caucus, who are so opposed to this plan. It isn’t just about New Democrats. A recent poll in the Globe and Mail says, “A majority of Ontarians are against the Liberal government’s plan to privatize Hydro One....”", "A recent poll conducted by Mainstreet Technologies shows that 60% of respondents do not approve of selling off a majority of the public electricity company to the private sector. What’s more, 77% said they believe privatization will increase electricity rates.", "The article says that “the Liberals have tried to soft-pedal the Hydro One sell-off. They refuse to use the word ‘privatization’”—or “sell-off”. Instead, they opt for these buzzwords and buzz-phrases like “broadening ownership,” “unlocking value,” or “modernization.” You can call it what you want, Speaker, but at the end of the day, “privatization” means “sell-off,” in this case.", "Anyone who lived through the 1990s and early 2000s saw exactly what those repercussions were. They saw a big increase in hydro rates, that never decreased again.", "The Premier has tried to downplay her Conservative-style hydro sell-off privatization by distracting Ontario with grocery store beer sales, but I have to tell you that my inbox has had one Beer Store story for every 100 hydro privatization emails in recent weeks. My inbox will tell you that Ontarians cannot be taken for granted, despite how desperately the Liberal Premier tries to sugar-coat it. Privatization is privatization, and it equals sell-off.", "Each passing day, we’re learning from the Premier and her Liberal government that they’re taking pages from the Mike Harris Conservative playbook—the Common Sense Revolution, I believe they called it in those days. There’s not much common sense about this plan.", "To make things worse, the Liberal government is trying to ram this through and limit public consultation. I won’t be surprised if there’s a time allocation motion; there has been a time allocation motion for every bill in this House since we came back here in July of last year. It’s bad enough that the Premier refuses to be straight with Ontarians about the sell-off of Hydro One, but now the House leader and the Liberals are going to try to limit public debate.", "In fact, my House leader, the member from Timmins–James Bay, wrote a letter just last week to the government House leader asking them to reconsider the shocking time limits put on the discussion of not only the hydro issue but the budget bill in its entirety. Some of the most significant changes in Ontario’s history are embedded in this bill, and we’re only going to get very few days of hearings at this point, in Toronto.", "I can tell you that there are people from Thunder Bay to Fort Erie and from Windsor to Sault Ste. Marie who want to talk about this bill and want to get on that list to make their presentations. The government has a duty to do wide consultation because this bill, this hydro sell-off, will be felt in all corners of this province. We live in a democracy, and this should be a democratic process for all the people who actually live in Ontario.", "At the end of the day, about the hydro sell-off, even the Conservatives backed down 12, 13 or 14 years ago. For anyone on the other side who will argue otherwise, I would challenge the Premier and her government to have the committee travel across the province and hear from hard-working Ontarians.", "The sale of Hydro One is wrong. It’s the wrong thing to do. Privatizing was wrong more than a decade ago and it’s still wrong today. We know this. Hydro rates went up 25% shortly after the Conservatives privatized the generation of power—25% almost overnight. That’s why it ended. Nova Scotia privatized its hydroelectric system, and it now has some of the highest rates in Canada, almost rivalling the current rates—without the 42% increase already announced and the increases that will happen once the sell-off happens. This story has played out in many jurisdictions across Canada and the US. It’s also worth noting that the energy rates now are three times higher than they were in the Harris era. There’s no rhyme or reason for this sell-off.", "I mentioned earlier that my inbox was flooded with emails about hydro privatization, and I’m hearing not just from individuals; I’m hearing from local sporting agencies and from curling clubs; I’m hearing from manufacturing people in my community.", "I can tell you that when I go out to do my grocery shopping on the weekend, Speaker, I often visit Celi and Presti’s deli in my community, and I visit Arcuri’s Cheese World in my community. Each and every time I go in there, they say, “Cindy, to pay my hydro bill, which is $1,500 to $1,600 a month, I have to sell a lot of salami and a lot of provolone to just pay the hydro bills, before I even pay any of my employees or actually take a paycheque home.”", "I’ve heard from local manufacturers like ASW in Welland about how the hydro rates are actually hurting the company. I’ve heard from the Welland Curling Club in my community, who have made major capital investments in the curling club so that they can become as energy-efficient as possible, but every time they invest that capital, the Liberal government increases their hydro rates, so they’re no better off than they were before they created those efficiencies. So this Hydro One sell-off isn’t supported, really. I haven’t heard anybody who’s supporting it except Bay Street and Liberal insiders.", "Privatizing hydro will mean higher rates, we know that, and it will mean the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue—almost $1 billion a year—for a $4-million one-time hit. What are you going to sell when that’s gone?", "We’ve already seen the Liberal government waste billions of dollars at eHealth, at Ornge, the gas plant scandals to save a few Liberal seats, the Presto card rollout, $8.2 billion in P3s. All of that money could be going to transit and to infrastructure in this province. So this privatization agenda has left behind, and will leave behind, a costly legacy of waste and scandal.", "I want to move on to health care for a few minutes, because that’s where I actually come from. To quote the Ontario Health Coalition, “The real-dollar cuts across ... health care also mean damaging—and potentially irreversible—cuts, closures and privatization of needed health care....”", "The RPNAO, the Registered Practical Nurses Association, makes it clear that front-line staff “will continue to suffer from increased workloads, stress, burnout and moral distress associated with watching in frustration as their patients fail to get the level and quality of care they deserve....”", "We’ve had nurses fired across this province—I think almost 2,000 over the last two years—and we who work in the health care field know that every time you cut a registered nursing position, you increase the mortality rates for patients in this province. There have been a lot of studies on that issue, and so the government needs to take heed about that.", "On top of the cuts to our health care system, the Liberal government is also implementing its fourth consecutive hospital freeze, so we in rural and northern communities are seeing our hospitals close. I spoke about this this morning: Already in my own riding and the member from Niagara Falls’s riding—he is here today—we’ve seen Niagara-on-the-Lake hospital close, Fort Erie hospital close, Port Colborne hospital close, and now they want to close my hospital in Welland, even though it serves a population of 100,000 people." ],

She made $600,000-plus last year—$400,000 in wages and $200,000 in perks—that should have gone to patient care had the Liberal government, sometime in the last 13 years, moved back to a public community system.", "These are the most vulnerable patients coming out of the hospital today. You know, in the old days, when a patient left the hospital and needed home care, they were four, five, 10 days post-op, depending on the surgery. Today you go in for a hip replacement, and you’re being discharged the next day. The money that should be going to look after patients in the system is actually going to pad the pockets of CEOs who are making as much or more than the heads of our CCACs and the heads of our LHINs.", "The NDP has said over the last few years that we should be capping public sector CEO salaries, and that is one way that we could actually reinvest back into programs. But when you have a community system which is actually providing a large amount of health care now in a for-profit system, a large amount of the money is actually going to profit and to padding the pockets of the people who get into that business.", "In closing, I’m happy to have had the opportunity.

So the day after the budget, the usual suspects were saying, “Well, there’s nothing in it for Niagara.” It wasn’t the Liberal member for St. Catharines, it was the NDP member for Niagara Falls who on the radio the next day corrected them and said that Brock University had an investment of $10 million for their new business school.

The reason was, there was no money for it. Well, if this government keeps spending money the way they’re doing, there won’t be any money for any surgeries, going down the road. That’s quite a concern for the people of my riding.", "Instead, this government decides in this budget to roll out their pension payroll tax that’s going forward. They’ll argue that it’s not a tax. They can create the words how they want to, but taking money from somebody without their permission is either thievery or a tax, and on this government side, we’ll balance which way it goes.", "The other thing this government is going towards is selling off part of hydro in order to put the money towards infrastructure. To me, that’s like selling your house and keeping the mortgage. I don’t think there’s anybody in this House who would sell their house and keep their mortgage in moving on. This is what this government is doing with this asset sale. They’re not putting the money towards paying down the debt, which would reduce rates in our province.

It was a budget that we all knew was extremely progressive, and we were very disappointed in many quarters that the members opposite did not support that bill and we went to a general election. Of course, Mr. Speaker, as I have said before, I’m delighted to have had the opportunity to campaign on that budget bill, because it resulted in this opportunity for me to be in the House today." ],

You ask yourself, what would happen if the investors, when they looked at that first tranche, thought, “What an amazing deal,” 5.3% on their money? We might recognize, in fact, they might be satisfied with 4% return on their money, because 4% is a lot better than the 1.5% or 1.6% we’re getting on our savings accounts. If the people of Ontario should embrace that opportunity, then that 4% return would actually generate a value of this company in the order of $20 billion.

Putting beer and wine in Quebec stores caused a devastating effect to the spirits industry in Quebec. Before beer and wine went into the stores in Quebec, the spirits industry enjoyed a 40% share of the alcohols market. Since the sales went in, spirits—rum, whisky, rye, vodka—dropped from 40% down to 13%. That led to closures of a number of Quebec distillers and the loss of hundreds of jobs.", "Distilled spirits come from Ontario farms. They’re Ontario grains grown by Ontario farmers. Ontario jobs are on the thin edge of this budget if you don’t treat the spirits industry fairly when you’re talking about expansion of the markets for beer and wine and if you stick to limiting the sales of spirits.", "Just to give you an example of a steady revenue stream, there is a billion dollars a year or more, that comes from the sale of spirits, that goes into the Ontario treasury. If you want to put that on the line, go ahead and do it at your own peril, but you must treat the spirits industry fairly if you proceed with your plan to put beer in grocery stores." ],

It seems like every time the government stands up, absolutely, they’re spending more money on health care. But are they doing it properly? Are they doing it wisely? Are they streamlining the service? Clearly, they’re not.

No, okay, okay.", "The thing is that we’re obviously headed in the wrong direction when it comes to the sale of Hydro One—that’s where I was. What they are doing is changing the laws around the sale of Hydro One. According to the Electricity Act, they are supposed to be using the proceeds of the sale of Hydro One to pay down the debt that the member from Glengarry–Prescott–Russell was talking about earlier, that $27 billion in debt. They’re not doing that.", "What they’re doing is selling off a very profitable asset and not using the proceeds the way that they should, because if they did start to pay down that debt we would start to see lower hydro rates. I will get to that a little bit later on.", "The thing is, you can only sell these assets once. There have been mistakes made along the way, but selling Hydro One will only lower the deficit for one year. Next year, you’ve already spent the money that you got from the sale, you haven’t fixed the underlying problem with the deficit and now you’re getting a smaller dividend from Hydro One because you have a smaller ownership stake in Hydro One.", "The government, it appears, is hoping that it can make up the money through either increased economic activity or by selling more beer, neither of which is exactly a promising plan for balancing the books in the province. Clearly, what we’re seeing is that the price of hydro continues to rise, which is going to make us less profitable. It’s going to create more of an exodus to southern states.", "We had the perfect example of what’s happening in all of our rural ridings. That was illustrated this morning by the member from Haldimand–Norfolk, who talked about the fact that one of the manufacturers in his riding is being lured away with the carrot-dangling of three cents per kilowatt hour, an industrial power rate in a southern US state. We all, on this side of the House—and the member from St. Thomas is here—know that the manufacturing sector has been hollowed out and, in large part, won’t be able to return because of the increasing costs of electricity in the province.", "In 2003, when this government took power, we had the lowest hydro rates in North America. Now, 12 years later, we have the highest all-in hydro rates in North America.", "The member from Lanark–Frontenac–Lennox and Addington is a very studious lad. He went out and had the legislative library look at the all-in cost of hydro for all 10 Canadian provinces. By far, the price in Ontario is the highest—three times what it is in the province of Quebec.", "It’s a problem, and there’s nothing in this budget that’s going to address that. As a matter of fact, on May 1, May Day, it indeed was “mayday” last Friday, when the price per kilowatt increased by 15% right across the province." ],

Happy Cinco de Mayo to you, Percy.", "Normally in this province, when the dollar is down you notice that our economic activity increases because we’re exporting more of our manufactured goods into the US. The problem with that is that we’ve lost 300,000 manufacturing jobs over the last 10 years in the province. Most of that is directly related to a steady and then astronomical increase in those hydro rates during that same time period.", "In what will apparently come as a shock only to members of the government, manufacturing is an electricity-intensive process in Ontario. Many plants run on continental shifts, which means they’re running 24 hours a day. That means they’re being charged rates at-peak, mid-peak and off-peak. The government’s attempts to fix its energy mistakes by manipulating prices and trying to engineer when we manufacture and when we do laundry aren’t working. They aren’t helping anything. As a matter of fact, we just saw 1,000 jobs leave General Motors in Oshawa. We’ve seen Kellogg’s, Caterpillar, John Deere, Heinz and dozens of others pull up stakes and leave Ontario. Two weeks ago, we saw Goodyear turn its back on building a new facility in Napanee. The reason was because of the soaring costs of electricity and—not just that—the instability of the electricity system in Ontario.", "The government’s electricity policies have made it all but impossible to generate the kind of economic activity that we would need to balance the budget. Again, on the Goodyear Napanee situation, they didn’t leave for Quebec; they left for Mexico.", "We have a budget without a credible plan to balance that is privatizing assets, that’s relying on economic activity it has successfully driven out of the province and on an increase in beer sales in supposedly 450 grocery stores across the province.", "To be sure, electricity is a major reason that these manufacturers are leaving, but it’s not the only one. Businesses are constantly looking to operate more efficiently. They’re looking for more cost-effective ways to do business and more business-friendly jurisdictions. Capital is more mobile than it has ever been in the province’s history. The government’s solution to this has been to repeatedly make it more expensive to do business here. We’ve watched the Green Energy Act produce the highest electricity rates. Now businesses in the province are being hit with a double whammy in this budget. On the one hand, they’ll be expected to pay a new payroll tax that the government is trying to pass off as a pension plan, from which few people will actually benefit.", "The next thing manufacturers are going to be hit with is a cap-and-trade tax; that is, unless they or their industry have hired expensive Liberal lobbyists to make them exempt from this new program, or they pull up stakes and move elsewhere.", "Ultimately, all cap-and-trade systems become a lobbyists’ dream, because there are always loopholes written in that exempt certain industries, or increase the number of credits they have, or do whatever the government can do to engineer the credit market in favour of whoever has the best lobbyist. This keeps cap and trade from being effective.", "But the other thing that ends up occurring—and this was raised in the pages of the Globe and Mail over the weekend—is that it ends up incentivizing manufacturers to move their more carbon-intensive operations to other jurisdictions that don’t have cap and trade so that they can stay under the cap. They do that so they can sell their remaining carbon credits on the market and increase the profit margin for the company, which has little impact on greenhouse gas emissions here in Ontario.", "What you have is yet another Liberal policy whose major result will likely be offshoring thousands more jobs that used to be right here in Ontario. What we have is a measure that makes it more expensive to produce in the province, and a measure that makes it more expensive to hire in Ontario—this, while the government is relying on increased economic activity to help it balance the books. The government’s own advisers in the Ministry of Finance have stated that they expect these measures to cost the economy of the province thousands of jobs.", "But let’s get back to the deficit and why it’s not going away.", "What we’ve done is highlight the problem with planning on an increase in revenue by continually adding taxes to businesses. This is because Ontario doesn’t have a revenue problem. Year over year, Ontario continually sets new records for how much revenue the government brings in. What we have is a results problem, not even a straight spending problem. We’re spending too much money on things that don’t deliver value. Instead of trying to reform the system to deliver better, more cost-effective results, we’re crowding out government priorities to pay for an ever-growing debt load.", "As a result, we have a government that has laid off 400 nurses province-wide, including 58 registered nurses—at my hospitals; in my riding—at Quinte Health Care. That’s hospitals in Picton, Belleville, Trenton, North Hastings and Bancroft. As a result, we have $54 million in federal transfers for health care that isn’t going to health care.", "As a result, we now have thousands of kids out of class in Durham, Peel and northern Ontario, and we’re probably going to have thousands and thousands more out of class on Monday.", "People don’t get angry when the government does too much, but they do get angry when the government does too many things poorly, and that’s what this government has done. Rather than trying to get the fundamentals right, they think the solution is to simply spend more money; it’s to spend $130 billion on transit and transportation; it is to announce that it’s going to open beer kiosks in supermarkets.", "Over the last few decades, the people of this province have made it clear, what they want the government to do. They want the government to provide quality health care. They want good roads, and they want them taken care of. They want good schools for their kids, and they want their kids to be able to get jobs at the end of their education.", "We have a few basic and fundamental trusts that we are not only expected to deliver, but the public will demand that we deliver them. On many of those scores, this budget and this government are failing the province. The worst part is, this government pretends it either isn’t occurring, or it criticizes those who point out that it is.", "I’ve never seen a Premier so blatantly criticize the province’s Auditor General. When she points out there are problems with the province’s fiscal plan, which she does every time she addresses the media, this Premier is always there or her energy minister is always there, criticizing her findings.", "I’ve never seen a Premier who thinks that bringing up things that happened in 1999 or 2001, after her party has been in government for 12 years now—I’ve never seen anything like this. It forces me to ask how long you have to be in government before you actually have to take responsibility for what you’ve done over the past 12 years. In no private sector job could you consistently blame someone else for your mess-ups 12 years after the person left the job. This Premier does it almost religiously. It’s an article of absolute faith for this government that regardless of what they mess up or who criticizes them, they will either attack the source or they’ll blame Mike Harris—or periodically Bob Rae, as well.", "Part of being a grown adult is the ability to take responsibility, but this government never takes responsibility for anything. The responsibility for the hollowing-out of Ontario’s manufacturing sector falls squarely at the feet of this Premier, this government and the previous Premier. The responsibility for the mess that the electricity sector is in with regard to both customer service at Hydro One and the price explosion facing ratepayers lies squarely at the foot of this government. The responsibility for the fact that this government now has to pinch pennies in front-line health care and fire nurses lies squarely at the feet of this government. Those decisions are the direct result of this budget, of recent budgets and decisions made by this government that their pet projects are more important than nurses in Belleville, Trenton, Picton and North Bay.", "Somewhere along the line, this government made the decision that it could ignore these public trusts, provided it never simply took the blame for it, or provided that it take on what occurred and receive the same credibility as that of an independent trier of fact, like the province’s Auditor General. This government’s idea of facts is often in conflict with reality, as we saw last week when the Auditor General released her report on winter road maintenance.", "I could go on and on and on. This budget doesn’t encounter a single problem that it can’t ignore. In fact, it makes a number of the problems in Ontario worse.", "Mr. Speaker, I thank you for your time this afternoon." ],

They are very similar documents. They fire roughly the same amount of public servants. They cut roughly the same amount of public services. They extol the same virtues in terms of reducing the debt on the backs of working-class people.", "He spoke about the virtues of the finance minister at the federal level, somebody who has taken on the veterans of this community, of our country—who has attacked veterans, on the backs of those who put their lives on the line. They’re balancing the budget on the backs of the environment. They’re degrading our environmental resources.", "Guess what they’re doing with employment insurance at the federal level?

We’re losing the front-line services that every person in the province of Ontario, whether it’s the mom and dad with young kids at home or the seniors on a fixed income—they’re seeing, like the member from Prince Edward–Hastings said is happening in his community of Belleville, front-line cuts to hospitals.", "I can tell you, Speaker, that in Lambton–Kent–Middlesex, my riding, there are three rural hospitals.

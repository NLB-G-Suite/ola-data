On this one, Mr. Speaker, really, I don’t need any notes because it is a time allocation bill and it is on an issue that is near and dear, and frustrating a lot of people across my riding. People are finding themselves challenged, day in and day out, to make ends meet. People are finding themselves trying to express their views to the Liberal government. However, once again, what we’re dealing with here this morning is exactly what people are frustrated with: that they are not being heard. They are not being provided with the opportunity to shout out how frustrated they are with the direction this government has taken. And, again, with this time allocation on this particular bill, it expresses the true sentiments of what a lot of people in this province here are feeling.", "I want to just highlight a particular individual out of my riding of Algoma–Manitoulin. There are many individuals across Ontario who have taken up initiatives, who have taken up actions, who have gone forward and signed on to petitions, but I want to highlight one particular person: Her name is Tanya Giles. She comes from Manitoulin Island. One person decided and said, “I am going to be a difference maker. I am going to spread the message. I am going to initiate an action. I am going to create a discussion so that individuals across Manitoulin Island will be able to express themselves so that we, together”—and just so you know, Mr. Speaker, I presented her petition in the House just the week before last. She, on her own, managed to pull together almost 1,900 signatures on Manitoulin Island in order for them to express their views of disappointment by directing this petition to the wrong-headed direction that this government is taking with the sale of Hydro One. That is one individual who said, “I am going to stand on my feet, make my voice heard and do something for my community, my neighbours and my area.” That is commendable; it is remarkable.", "The problem with that, Mr. Speaker, is too many people are in that position in order to have their voices heard and make sure that their views are being expressed here at Queen’s Park. What happens is it creates a disconnect, because a lot of them have been voicing their disapproval of the direction this government is going in, with the continued wrong-headed decision of the privatization and the sale of Hydro One.", "A lot of people have been asking this government, “Get off of that direction. It is not reflecting what we want. We didn’t vote for this. We are disappointed with the direction of the Kathleen Wynne government. We don’t want this to proceed. We see what is happening to our hydro bills day in and day out, each and every month. We are struggling, and you are not listening to us. You are not hearing our cries for help.”", "So we get a step in the right direction—and I will say it’s a step in the right direction—but that step was never necessary. We should never have had to take that step, which is removing the HST off of home heating, because it should have never been part of our hydro costs.", "Those are some of the things that individuals across my riding of Algoma–Manitoulin are extremely frustrated with. Again, this is not something that people are going to let go. It will be there now, it will be there tomorrow and it will be there in 2018 when this government comes to judgment." ],

Now the heat in the kitchen is getting so hot they’re making a big deal out of giving us a rebate of our own money. Premier Wynne thinks she can fool us into believing she’s doing it not for political reasons. It has nothing to do with having the pants scared off her when Conservative Raymond Cho stole what was considered a safe Liberal seat in Scarborough–Rouge River.", "You see, Speaker, Toronto has been the bread and butter of the McGuinty-Wynne Liberals. That’s where the core of their supporters are, coming from the greater Toronto area. But when the chickens come home to roost and there’s a new rooster in the henhouse and he’s blue—he’s not red—well, they finally sit up and take notice.", "We’ve been saying for months that the voters in Ontario are unhappy. They’re unhappy with time allocation. They’re unhappy when hydro rates are out of control; hydro bills are going up again in November. I guess the Wynne government was busy with other matters and wasn’t really listening to what was going on. She wasn’t listening to the rest of the province, as we have been. Now when the voters in her own backyard kicked her in the pants, well, all of a sudden we’re getting 8% of our own money back. I represent Windsor–Tecumseh. This 8% in the HST, the PST, was brought in by the person I replaced, Dwight Duncan, the former Liberal finance minister.", "As you know, Speaker, New Democrats argued against this from day one. We said it should not have been put on hydro bills. It’s an essential commodity. In fact, I was blown away when the Minister of Agriculture stood up here in the House last week or the week before and said that philosophically, he was always opposed to it. Imagine that. He was always opposed to having the HST, the Ontario portion, charged on electricity rates, and he was a member of the cabinet. I don’t know who he was expressing his displeasure to. Whatever happened, it didn’t waft out anyplace else. I don’t know if other cabinet ministers opposed it, if they told the Premier that. I don’t think they made it much of a public issue until now, when they realize that everybody else in Ontario is dead set against it. Now they’re saying, “I’ve always been against it myself.” I don’t know, Speaker. It comes down to believability. It comes down to principle, I guess.", "They put it on as a cash grab. No way did New Democrats support it then; we don’t support it now. We knew the impact it would have on families in Ontario, on our senior citizens in Ontario and on our small business communities. Oh, we huffed and we puffed, of course, but we couldn’t blow down that big red Liberal House or the blue House up in Ottawa, for that matter, at that time. The HST on hydro bills was imposed by the Harper Conservatives and the McGuinty Liberals. Do the math. Premier Wynne was a member of that government, and the leader of the official opposition, Mr. Brown, was a member of the Harper Conservative government at that time when they started charging the HST on Ontario’s hydro bills. We tried to tell them it was a mistake. They wouldn’t listen then; they’re not listening now.", "A lot of people thought it was a terrible idea. A lot of people today say to the federal government, if they’re doing it in Ontario, take it off in Ottawa and the Canadian portion as well. It only makes sense. If it’s not good enough for the ratepayers in Ontario, it shouldn’t be good enough that we have to pay the federal portion of it either. What are we waiting for? These are their federal Liberal cousins. They said they now had a friend in Ottawa. Well, it’s time for that friend to step forward and maybe give us a high-five. It doesn’t always work with the royal family; maybe it’ll work with the Wynne Liberal government. We’ll have to see.", "I have to say that the political leadership we’re seeing on this bill leaves one to question what’s really going on. I think they’re trying to duck and cover on this, cover their—well, I’ll leave it up to you, Speaker, to determine what parts of their political philosophy or anatomy they’re trying to cover with this bill. Behind the headlines, behind the motivation, there is a bottom line: It’s the sudden realization that they’re in political trouble. What’s the least they can do now? That’s right: This is the very least they can do now, as they try to duck and cover. If they really meant it—as the Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs has said that politically, philosophically, he has always been opposed to it—they shouldn’t have charged it in the first place. They should be calling Ottawa and telling the Prime Minister their new views on this.", "Of course, the political difference is, on this side of the House, where we’ve always opposed it, we’ve stood in place and said, loud and clear, “Don’t do it.”", "It was wrong to charge Ontario residents 8% on their hydro bills, just as it’s wrong now to bring in time allocation on this bill to shut down debate as we bring forth the views of people across this province. It was wrong in 2010 to charge it. It was wrong in 2011. It was wrong in 2012. It was wrong in 2013. It was wrong in 2014. It was wrong in 2015. And it’s wrong today. It’s unnecessary to wait till 2017 for the rebate. Do it now. Take it off. Just stop it. Do the right thing. If it’s wrong, it’s not right. And if it’s not right, don’t do it. Don’t keep charging struggling families in Ontario a tax that you now say is no longer necessary. Don’t charge them and give them a rebate. Kill that tax. Tell the Liberal Prime Minister in Ottawa to kill that tax. Stop this time allocation. Let the people on this side of the House stand up and have their say on what you’ve been doing wrong over there. And you’ve been doing it wrong ever since you brought in this sales tax on an essential commodity.", "There’s another by-election coming up in Niagara West–Glanbrook. You’re not going to win there if you don’t kill that tax today. You haven’t got a chance there if you don’t kill that tax today. So when are you going to learn your lesson?", "There was a story in yesterday’s Windsor Star about hydro rates. One of Windsor’s most prominent business owners is quoted in the story by Grace Macaluso. Terry Rafih is the CEO of the Rafih Auto Group. He sits on the board of our regional economic development commission. And this goes to time allocation, Speaker. He says he opened his hydro bill last month and he almost choked—almost choked, Speaker. His quote is: “I saw this bill for $21,000 for one month.” That’s $21,000 for 31 days. He almost choked when he read the bill. Next to his labour costs, hydro and natural gas are his second-highest costs, and he says they’re out of control. Thank you, Terry Rafih.", "We know they’re out of control. I had an email just this week, Speaker, from a mushroom farmer in my area. He brings in mushrooms; he ships most of them across the border; a lot of them are organic. Denis Vidmar is his name. He brings in thousands of fresh mushrooms six days a week; most are grown organically, and he ships them across the border to Whole Foods stores in the American Midwest. He’s on Rhodes Drive in Windsor. He opened a warehouse last year. His hydro bills last year were $500 a month—$500. This year: doubled, Speaker. How do you come up with a business plan and create jobs in Ontario when your hydro bills are doubling year after year after year? This just doesn’t make sense. He wants me to tell him why. My only response is: Ask the Liberals; they’re the ones calling the shots." ],

  "text" : [ "I’m happy to rise to participate in this debate and talk specifically about Bill 13, the Ontario Rebate for Electricity Consumers Act, 2016, that would, if passed, put in place an 8% rebate on electricity bills for eligible customers. This legislative framework would put in place the requirement for this rebate to be provided by January 1, 2017, but not the mechanism needed to deliver the program. With a January 1, 2017, implementation target date, there is a pressing need to provide local distribution companies—your local utilities—and other entities responsible for delivering the rebate to consumers with the details on implementation in order to make the necessary adjustments to their billing and customer information systems. To ensure that all local distribution companies have the time and information required to deliver on the government’s intended rebate of the provincial portion of the HST directly on customer bills in January, there is a pressing need to expedite the legislative approvals.", "Updates to the LDC billing systems are time-intensive and, of course, operationally complex. The LDCs are requesting the opportunity to consult with the ministry on the specifics of what billing system changes would be required should the bill be passed. Following consultations, the LDCs will require certainty as to the required changes before adjusting their billing systems. Certainly for our local utilities, this would include a general regulation that’s made under the Ontario Rebate for Electricity Consumers Act in order to put in place the required mechanisms that would allow for electricity vendors to be reimbursed for the amounts credited to consumer accounts, as well as other important provisions related to payments, reporting requirements and, of course, billing requirements.", "Without these regulatory mechanisms, rebates cannot flow from government to utilities and then from, ultimately, the utilities to consumers. The regulation cannot be filed until the act has been passed and the authority to create the regulation has been established.", "Mr. Speaker, the Ministry of Energy has already been working with many of these local distribution companies right across our great province of Ontario, as well as the Electricity Distributors Association, the Independent Electricity System Operator—the IESO, as we know them—and the Ontario Energy Board to implement these measures, pending, of course, legislative approvals.", "For some LDCs, filing of the regulation will be required before the billing system changes are initiated. Should there be a delay in enacting the program, these LDCs may not have enough time to ensure they are operational for January 1, 2017.", "Mr. Speaker, providing the LDCs with program certainty and additional time to implement the 8% rebate program will facilitate a smoother transition on January 1, 2017, and ensure that Ontario consumers receive the 8% rebate in a timely fashion.", "It’s important to recognize that this legislation that we’re talking about through the time allocation debate creates a requirement that the rebate be provided but, after its passage—as long as this bill passes—there is much more work to be done to implement it by January 1. These updates—with our local utilities, the distribution companies—those billing systems are quite complex and time-intensive as well, so there’s a pressing need to provide the LDCs and other entities responsible for delivering the rebate to consumers with the details on implementation in order to make the necessary adjustments to their billing and customer information systems.", "So, concluding, making sure that we provide the LDCs with program certainty and additional time to implement the 8% rebate program would facilitate a smoother transition on January 1, 2017, and ensure that Ontario consumers receive the 8% rebate in a timely fashion." ],

I’ve already mentioned that I’ll be sharing my time with the member for Trinity–Spadina, so I’ll move along. The legislation I’ll be speaking to today was originally introduced by our government this past May. I had the privilege of reintroducing it earlier this month as a key plank in a suite of legislative priorities for the government to be achieved over the fall session.", "Bill 7, the Promoting Affordable Housing Act, is a landmark piece of legislation that, if passed, is designed to increase housing access and affordability for all Ontarians. Through our Long-Term Affordable Housing Strategy and legislation like Bill 7, Ontario is answering the call to provide more affordable housing across the province and end chronic homelessness within our communities by 2025.", "Too many Ontarians are struggling to keep a roof over their heads: the homeless teen on the street, the woman fleeing from domestic violence to the safety of a shelter, the young family struggling to make rent, the senior citizens fighting to hold on to a lifetime of memories in a home where those memories happened. We can and must do better for them and every Ontarian.", "We know that when people have a home they are healthier, able to pursue employment and equipped to participate in and contribute to their communities. By increasing the tools available to our local partners to improve access to housing, Ontario will continue to be a place where the work of building stronger communities begins at home.", "The Promoting Affordable Housing Act, if passed, would amend four existing pieces of legislation: the Housing Services Act, the Residential Tenancies Act, the Planning Act and the Development Charges Act. Its aim is to increase choice by introducing inclusionary zoning, expand existing housing availability by making it easier to develop second units in homes, and encourage small landlords to provide rental housing, all with the goal of increasing affordability and access for Ontarians. By increasing the flexibility of the housing sector, we can ensure that Ontario families find suitable housing, and keep the most vulnerable from going to sleep without a roof over their head. The member from Trinity–Spadina and I will speak more about these changes in a few moments. But before we do, I’d like to provide some context on the importance of these legislative changes before us.", "Bill 7 is a core component of Ontario’s Long-Term Affordable Housing Strategy, a strategy that was launched in 2010 by my colleague from the riding of Ancaster–Dundas–Flamborough–Westdale. Entitled Building Foundations: Building Futures, it was the first of its kind in Ontario and, as that member has said previously, recognized that local flexibility with accountability offers the best approach to housing, service delivery and building strong communities. The legacy of that first strategy, Mr. Speaker, is realized each and every day by those who have since embarked on an entirely new life trajectory because of the vision and practical solutions laid out in that strategy.", "One of those solutions was consolidating five separate homelessness-related programs into a single flexible outcome-focused program called the Community Homelessness Prevention Initiative, or CHPI for short. The outcome: 30,000 families and individuals who were lifted off the streets and a further 100,000 at-risk households who never had to learn first-hand what it’s like to lose a roof over their heads. I want to thank the member from Ancaster–Dundas–Flamborough–Westdale for his work toward ending chronic homelessness and laying the groundwork for its prevention.", "Improving access to affordable housing and ending homelessness, especially youth homelessness, are subjects that I hold near and dear to my heart. I cannot overstate the impact of this work on the lives of those individuals. But I have seen first-hand that there is still far more work to do. As the temperature cools around us here in Ontario, I want to take a moment to tell you about an extraordinary night I spent on the streets of York region, experiencing first-hand what homeless youth from our community go through every winter night.", "Some time ago I was participating in the second annual 360°Experience, where community leaders spend a bone-chilling winter night on the streets, each re-enacting real-life 360°kids client scenarios. Organizers wanted us to better understand what homeless youth in York region face every night and to raise funds for a new youth shelter.", "My scenario made me a 17-year-old single mom with a baby. It was minus 22 degrees, and the wind picked up as I and my partner, Bruce Bailey, who was then the chair of the organization, headed to the only shelter in York region that could take us in that night: the Blue Door Shelters for families at Leeder Place on Highway 11, north of Newmarket. Bruce and I were given two Viva bus tickets and $3 before being turned out of the 360°kids home base facility on Yonge Street at 8:30 p.m. That’s when that facility closed. Those bus tickets had to get us to the Blue Door Shelter and back. The $3 was to buy a cup of coffee. We were also shadowed by two volunteers, to ensure we didn’t freeze to death. But I’m pretty sure in real life no one shadowed the 17-year-old mom and her baby we were pretending to be.", "Arriving by bus at the Newmarket station, Bruce and I learned that there was no bus to the Leeder Place shelter, a five-kilometre walk north along Highway 11 in the dark and cold. Thankfully, an off-duty security guard took pity on us and drove us to the shelter on his way home. Would the 17-year-old mom and her baby been so lucky? We hope so.", "Safely inside the warm and bright facility, Bruce and I learned about Blue Door Shelters, serving York region’s homeless since 1982. We learned that in 2013, the shelters turned away almost 6,000 people because they lacked capacity. We learned that in 2014, Blue Door Shelters provided more than 80,000 meals and close to 28,000 nights of safety to homeless people and families in York region.", "Leaving the shelter, we faced a one-hour slog south along Highway 11 in minus-30-degree cold to the bus stop. There were no sidewalks. Thick, uneven ice was underfoot. Lighting was minimal and cars whizzed by dangerously close. Using our second bus ticket, we returned to Richmond Hill and spent the remainder of the night moving from coffee shop to coffee shop. A couple of middle-aged guys with silver hair were allowed to stay as long as they wanted in the early morning hours, but I suspect a young person who is homeless would soon have been told to move along. I’m told that coffee shops, all-night restaurants and bank foyers are favoured warming spots, and we saw that first-hand.", "Back at the 360°kids home base, our starting place, we were given a sleeping bag and a tarp and invited to spend the wee hours of the morning sleeping in the deep snow in the backyard until the facility opened at 6 a.m. I’ve done a fair amount of winter camping, and I was well equipped for the temperatures we were in, so digging a trough and curling up into it and falling asleep wasn’t a big problem for me. But I couldn’t help thinking about a 17-year-old mum and her baby: What would she have done on that cold winter night?", "What we learned that night was how tough and resilient the youth are who face this life without the support of family or community. When the doors at the 360°kids home base opened and the smell of a hot breakfast wafted out that morning, we all celebrated our survival. There were a lot of high-fives going on until we were asked who wanted to do it again that night and the night after and the night after that, like many young people must. I’ll tell you, it was a sobering moment. The jubilance at making it through the night was quickly gone.", "When I’m out late at night now, I pay special attention to the young people in coffee shops. Do they have a place to call home? Does someone care for them? Finally, I wonder about the 17-year-old mum and her baby whose nighttime trip in search of shelter Bruce and I re-enacted. I hope they face a better future. Here in this chamber, we have the power to make that happen.", "Ontario took an important step in 2015 to help advance our long-term goal of ending homelessness by striking an Expert Advisory Panel on Homelessness. I was at the table for the launch of the panel that was co-chaired by my colleagues the member from London North Centre and the member for Ancaster–Dundas–Flamborough–Westdale.", "As part of our second Poverty Reduction Strategy, the strategy I am now responsible for, Ontario set a long-term goal to end homelessness. The province worked with the expert panel to get practical advice on how to best approach this goal, beginning with ways to define and measure homelessness. With no consistent definition of homelessness or methods for counting the number of people experiencing homelessness in Ontario, defining the problem remained elusive and measuring the success of our programs difficult, so we needed to start at the beginning.", "The panel was established to provide expert advice to government on definitions, enumeration, setting a homelessness-related target and building capacity within that sector. In addition to setting a target to end chronic homelessness by 2025, we set four priority areas to guide provincial action, focusing on:", "—chronic homelessness;", "—youth homelessness;", "—indigenous homelessness; and", "—homelessness following transition from provincially funded institutions and service systems, such as hospitals, prisons, youth justice, violence against women shelters and the child welfare system.", "We heard many voices and perspectives on the panel from other panel members, from experts and most importantly from people with lived experience of homelessness. The 13 experts at the table brought a wide range of expertise and knowledge, including the medical community and those whose organizations deliver service to the homeless. One individual brought a unique voice to the table, having lived the experience of being impoverished and homeless. I’m particularly glad two representatives at the table had experience representing First Nation members.", "Working with the panel and meeting the organizations dedicated to helping the homeless and poor was a moving experience and one that left me even more determined to do something about this problem. Our long-term goal of ending chronic homelessness is an ambitious goal. We’re focused on it because it’s the right thing to do. We know it costs us more in health care, policing and justice than it does to help house someone. We’re looking at addressing Ontarians’ needs across the housing continuum, from homelessness and emergency shelters through to subsidized rentals and home ownership.", "It’s more important than ever before to make sure our dollars are getting measurable results and helping people. That’s why our Poverty Reduction Strategy ensures that our investments are rooted in evidence. We know that one size does not fit all in terms of solutions to tackling housing and homelessness. That is why we’re building on the foundation laid by the first Long-Term Affordable Housing Strategy.", "It’s been more than 20 years since the Ministry of Housing has had a stand-alone ministry, which highlights the importance our government places on this area as we move forward with the next phase of the Long-Term Affordable Housing Strategy.", "Before handing the baton to me as Ontario’s new Minister of Housing, the member for Ancaster–Dundas–Flamborough–Westdale provided an important update to the strategy just this past March. The update builds on the important work of the first strategy while creating new tools for increasing affordable housing and ending chronic homelessness. The update to the strategy is bold and transformative, and invests 178 million new dollars over three years. It focuses on increasing the supply of affordable housing, supporting people and ending chronic homelessness. It relies on partnerships with the private sector, our municipal partners and the federal government.", "The updated strategy takes into account the input the government received at 38 stakeholder meetings during the summer of 2015, and from 113 formal written submissions that reflect the housing needs of Ontarians across the province. From this feedback and under the strategy, we are making essential investments across a range of targeted projects. We’re modernizing Ontario’s social housing system to better meet the needs of tenants and providers, and to create more integrated communities. Currently, Ontarians in need of rental assistance rely primarily on rent-geared-to-income assistance, which is most often tied to specific units at specific addresses. So we’re working on a framework for a portable housing benefit that would give people receiving financial assistance more flexibility to choose where they live: closer to family, social support networks, schools and employment opportunities. The portable housing benefit framework would allow Ontario’s municipalities to provide more housing choices to more tenants and get them housed faster.", "Earlier this month, our government announced a portable housing benefit pilot program to help survivors of domestic violence escape unsafe situations. It allows them to immediately find housing in their communities instead of waiting for a social housing unit to become available. We are piloting this program in 22 communities across Ontario. In partnership with our federal counterparts, we’re investing more than $20 million over two years to provide ongoing assistance to approximately 1,000 survivors of domestic violence each year under the pilot program. Based on the outcomes, we will consider ways to enhance the program and extend the portable benefit to other communities.", "To help meet our government’s goal to end chronic homelessness by 2025, we are also investing in more supportive housing to the tune of $100 million over three years. This investment will be focused on the four provincial priority areas I mentioned earlier to support our goal to end chronic homelessness. We have heard from our sector partners that this is where the need is greatest, so we’ve taken action. Up to 4,000 families and individuals will receive housing allowances and the wraparound services they need. The funding will also support the construction of up to 1,500 new supportive housing units over the longer term, eventually assisting up to 6,000 individuals and families.", "As part of our efforts to end homelessness, we launched the Community Homeless Prevention Initiative. As I’ve mentioned, we affectionately call it CHPI. CHPI aims to improve access to suitable and affordable housing and homelessness services. It gives service managers greater flexibility to design programs based on local needs and priorities. Under CHPI, service managers can create their own local programs under four broad service categories:", "—emergency shelter solutions for people who are experiencing homelessness or are in a crisis;", "—long-term housing and transitional housing with supports;", "—service and supports, including street outreach, case management and transportation; and", "—homelessness prevention, including emergency financial assistance and education programs to help people stay in their homes.", "CHPI supports a transition towards a system that is focused on more proactive and permanent solutions to addressing homelessness. In 2014-15, our government enhanced CHPI funding by $42 million to a total amount of almost $294 million per year—a 17% annual increase of funding for homelessness services. We’re also providing an additional $15 million each year over the next two years, bringing our government’s annual investment to almost $324 million by 2018.", "We are developing an indigenous housing strategy in partnership with indigenous communities because we know that First Nations, Métis, and Inuit people are significantly overrepresented among people experiencing homelessness in Canada. A significant challenge is ensuring that culturally appropriate housing and homelessness services are accessible to indigenous people across the province, which is why a unique strategy is required. Since 2008, Ontario has committed over $150 million to off-reserve indigenous households in the province of Ontario. Our government will continue our sustained engagement with First Nations, Métis and Inuit partners to develop this important strategy.", "The investments I’ve mentioned are helping to make housing more affordable for people of all income levels in Ontario. They are also helping to keep roofs over the heads of those who have nowhere left to turn. But there is still much work to do. Housing and homelessness are about more than the bottom line, and the value of a dollar depends on the environment it is invested in. That’s why we’re proposing a suite of policy and legislative tools in Bill 7 that we hope will have a meaningful impact on affordable housing.", "During our government’s extensive consultations on the Long-Term Affordable Housing Strategy update, we heard about the need to foster diverse, inclusive communities. To help reach this goal, we’ve provided a range of planning, financial and other tools through the Promoting Affordable Housing Act to help municipalities create more affordable housing.", "One of those tools we’re proposing is called inclusionary zoning. The proposed change to the Planning Act would, if passed, give municipalities the option to require affordable housing units to be included in residential developments. This would enable the private sector to play a much larger role in providing affordable housing. According to the city of Toronto’s chief planner, Toronto could have built 12,000 affordable housing units in the last five years had inclusionary zoning been in place. We want to help municipalities ensure that they have a range of housing at their disposal that will give their citizens better choices, because affordable housing options should address the needs of those across the housing spectrum and at various income levels.", "Inclusionary zoning is just one of the many tools that the province is moving ahead with to increase the supply of affordable housing. We’ve consulted over the summer with our stakeholders on the former Bill 204 and on potential regulatory content to support inclusionary zoning. We met with various stakeholders representing the municipal, planning, housing, non-profit and development sectors. We know that these different sectors have different perspectives about how inclusionary zoning should be tailored for Ontario, but overall, our stakeholders were supportive of inclusionary zoning. In fact, Mitch Cohen, president of the Daniels Corp., has said that inclusionary zoning is “the only way to ensure that affordable housing will be built across this city.” The message is clear: Inclusionary zoning is a necessary tool that will change the affordable housing landscape in Ontario.", "Throughout the consultations, we heard a common view that municipalities should be given the flexibility to tailor inclusionary zoning to local social and economic conditions. We want to ensure that they have this flexibility, and that includes finding a balance between inclusionary zoning policies and section 37. Section 37 of the Planning Act permits a municipality to authorize increases in allowable height and/or density through the zoning bylaw in return for community benefits like daycare spaces, transit improvements or heritage preservation.", "Bill 7 would restrict municipalities applying inclusionary zoning from using section 37, except as provided for by regulation. The legislation would allow the minister to make a regulation that could specify the circumstances under which section 37 may be used by a municipality within the parameters of inclusionary zoning. Our recent consultations will inform potential future regulations relating to section 37 and inclusionary zoning. It’s important to note, Mr. Speaker, that Bill 7 would not affect the use of development charges or parkland dedication in combination with inclusionary zoning.", "Inclusionary zoning has been used extensively by communities around the world, including in England, and in over 500 municipalities in the United States. We want to make sure that our framework allows inclusionary zoning to be implemented in a way that works for Ontario’s municipalities.", "We are also proposing changes to the Development Charges Act to exempt secondary suites in new homes from development charges. Secondary suites are a source of affordable rental units for many low- to moderate-income renters. I’ve always believed in allowing secondary suites in established neighbourhoods. We know they are already being built in many neighbourhoods, but the proposed amendment would support increasing the supply of rental accommodation. These proposed changes would help to increase the supply and range of affordable housing options in Ontario communities.", "Our proposed reforms to the Residential Tenancies Act and the Housing Services Act would, if passed, help to further modernize social housing. My parliamentary assistant, the member from Trinity–Spadina, will elaborate more on the proposed amendments in these two pieces of legislation.", "Mr. Speaker, the reforms we are proposing reflect the significant input we received over the past year from municipalities, community groups and the public at large, and we continue to have conversations with our citizens, stakeholders and other levels of government about affordable housing. This past June, for example, in one of my first duties as minister, I participated in the federal-provincial-territorial ministers’ meeting in Victoria on the development of a national housing strategy. It was a positive meeting. We agreed to move forward collaboratively to develop a national housing strategy over the next few months, one that encompasses the needs of all Canadians. In service of that aim, I recently hosted a number of expert round tables across the province to discuss the national housing strategy. I will be hosting another one this week with our indigenous partners to get their feedback on how we can make a national housing strategy work for all Ontarians. Housing and poverty advocates across Ontario have been telling us very clearly for some time that the status quo is not working. We need a strong national housing strategy with the flexibility to address the specific needs of the provinces and territories.", "In the coming weeks, I’ll be sharing Ontario’s feedback with Minister Duclos and my provincial and territorial counterparts. Central to that feedback will be the core vision of the Long-Term Affordable Housing Strategy: that every Ontarian have access to an affordable and suitable home, providing the foundation to secure employment, raise a family and build strong communities.", "Mr. Speaker, we’ve outlined just some of the reforms today that we are proposing to improve access to affordable and stable housing for our citizens. Changing the housing system to make it work better for the people it’s designed to serve is going to go a long way to help us meet our goals. When one family achieves housing sustainability, it creates room for others to do the same. With the right tools, we can build a housing sector in Ontario that leaves no one behind.", "Our ultimate goal—increasing affordability and ending homelessness in Ontario—is a bold, long-term goal, and we will face many challenges along the way. But it is possible. It requires a system built on partnerships with the private and non-profit sectors and between all levels of government. We all have a shared purpose. By working together, we can start taking meaningful actions to transform Ontario’s housing system and to end chronic homelessness by 2025.", "This package of reforms we are proposing today will help to achieve this goal. I want to thank everyone who spoke to us about how to make more affordable housing a reality.", "I also want to leave my colleagues with one last thought. In November, I will visit London, Ontario, to attend the fourth National Conference on Ending Homelessness, hosted by the Canadian Alliance to End Homelessness. With the conference taking place in our home city, I know the words shared by the member for London North Centre at last year’s conference will be top of mind for me.", "During her remarks, the member and my predecessor as the minister responsible for the province’s Poverty Reduction Strategy posed the following question: If home is where the heart is, where is the heart of the person experiencing homelessness? It is a question I hope all members of this Legislature remember as we sit in this place we call the House, considering this important legislation and those who have no place to call home. It is for them that I urge all members to vote for the passing of this landmark bill." ],

I want to thank Minister Ballard for giving me the opportunity to speak today.", "In my work at Queen’s Park, I have come to understand first-hand the need for all Ontarians to have access to affordable, stable and adequate housing in their community. This rings true across the province, but the issue of affordable housing and homelessness presents a special challenge in our urban centres.", "In my riding of Trinity–Spadina, tackling homelessness continues to be a priority. I can think of many great organizations that have put their efforts into resolving this challenge for many, many years; for example, West Neighbourhood House. They have volunteers actually going out and visiting homeless individuals and helping them to see if there’s any way they can leverage government programs or government funding, or if they can help them to file taxes—making sure they’re tapping into those potential incomes. I think that is a very noble thing for them to do.", "We are making great strides to combat chronic homelessness. As part of the Long-Term Affordable Housing Strategy update, our government just launched a consultation with stakeholders on potential amendments to the Residential Tenancies Act, to improve how the rules affect transitional housing programs.", "Transitional housing provides a key role within the housing system. In addition to housing, it provides a mix of appropriate support services for vulnerable people to address specific needs; for example, people with mental health and addiction issues and survivors of domestic violence. It assists people to become more independent and able to transition to permanent, stable housing and independent living. This consultation supports Ontario’s goal of ending homelessness and addresses concerns expressed by our transition housing providers, so that they may be able to better serve the needs of their clients.", "As Minister Ballard mentioned, our government is also working hard to modernize the way we deliver social housing in this province. This is reflected in Bill 7, the Promoting Affordable Housing Act, with the proposed reforms to the Residential Tenancies Act and the Housing Services Act. The amendments would support vibrant, mixed-income communities and encourage a healthy mix of rent-geared-to-income and market rent tenants.", "By recognizing new and innovative forms of municipal housing assistance and increasing local flexibility to manage housing assets, we would empower service managers to provide assistance in a way that best meets their diverse needs.", "We also want to create better outcomes for tenants by ensuring that housing assistance meets their needs in a way that is more equitable, flexible and timely. When it comes to social housing, I can think of communities such as Alexandra Park and Portland Place in my neighbourhood. The volunteers and the staff do a great job to make everyone feel at home.", "The proposed amendments to the Housing Services Act represent the first step in modernizing Ontario’s social housing system to support economic and social inclusion for social housing tenants. These changes would provide municipalities with more flexibility in administering and delivering social housing, as well as require local enumeration to count people who are homeless in their communities, and we all know it’s a very, very difficult task.", "We hope that this will lead to more stability and security for service managers, as well as for social housing and not-for-profit co-operative housing providers.", "Arcadia co-op, Cawthra Mansions—these are just the two that come to the top of my mind, which I visited during the summer. They, again, do a great job of providing a sense of community to all residents around.", "Our amendments could also help to reduce the wait-lists, as people would be able to find and apply for the housing and supports they need more quickly and easily.", "Counting local homeless populations would provide valuable information about the diverse reality of Ontarians who experience homelessness, and inform smart approaches and program design.", "Mr. Speaker, our proposed changes to the Residential Tenancies Act would also help to clarify the treatment of rent-geared-to-income tenants. More specifically, tenants could not be evicted when they cease to be eligible for rent-geared-to-income assistance after paying market rent for 12 months or more. This change would ensure that social housing tenants are not penalized due to the positive changes in their household incomes.", "Other proposed changes to the RTA would bring all Ontario municipalities into alignment with respect to enforcing local residential rental maintenance standards. Most municipalities already do this either fully or partially, as they have their own property standard bylaws that include residential rental standards.", "Mr. Speaker, this legislation we are proposing today would allow us to make great strides in transforming and modernizing our social housing system. In giving municipalities more flexibility in administering social housing programs, we are accounting for local priorities and situations, because every community is unique and a one-size-fits-all approach does not work anymore. These measures, along with the other proposed amendments that Minister Ballard spoke about today, will enable us to make a big step forward to provide more affordable housing options and in our goal to end chronic homelessness in 10 years.", "Mr. Speaker, I join Minister Ballard in supporting Bill 7, and I urge all members of this House to vote for this bill and see the passage of this bill." ],

They are stretched now under this government. They’ve seen funding cut back from them. We need to give the option, of course, but there’s no funding attached to this, and that concerns us.", "Homelessness is escalating under this government. We see more and more people on the streets, and more and more people without help. A lot of the information seems to point to, in many cases, mental illness. We don’t have any increases or help for people that are experiencing mental illness. When you look through most families in this province, they have somebody that has a connection with or who is suffering from some type of mental illness. In many cases, that leads to homelessness. They’re unemployed. They can’t find a job.", "It’s something that, in many cases, is very treatable with the right help. I had the opportunity to talk to a doctor from a nearby village in my area yesterday. She talked about the lack of funding and the lack of help. People that we see on the street actually could be very much helped, but this government refuses to fund those services.", "We’re hoping, of course, to support this bill. We have some amendments to go in to it. But there must be some money that goes along with this, or else we’ll just see the price of housing go up for everybody, and of course that’s not good for the province." ],

I’d like to inform the minister that the heart of the homeless person lies here within the NDP caucus: the party of the homeless, the impoverished, the downtrodden—the very people that successive Liberal and Conservative governments have ignored for the past 30 years. So you know where the heart is, Speaker, and it’s over here.", "The devil is in the details. That’s why we’re waiting for the details on this bill to come forward, because right now there’s not a lot of information in there, not a lot of detail to speak about. I think that’s why the minister, when he first stood up, spent his first 15 or 20 minutes talking about his night on the street. The self-described—what was he?—middle-aged, silver-haired minister and his buddy Bruce spent a night on the street.", "He talked about a homeless shelter that has turned away 6,000 people, provided 80,000 meals and provided 28,000 nights of safety. I agree with that. I found it very interesting. I’m glad the minister took the opportunity to spend the night out in the snow as if he was homeless, because that gets to the heart of where we’re headed with this bill in many ways. But until we get into the details—because this bill is so lacking in so much of the detail—it’s going to be very difficult, until we get to committee and can put some flesh on the bones, if you will, of what is proposed here and find out exactly where we’re going with inclusionary zoning, finally." ],

These doctors wanted to talk about improving cardiac care services in our community. They offered details on how the program operates and how they wanted to see wait times improve. Their overall goal is to better serve heart patients in Kitchener–Waterloo and surrounding areas. It is said that St. Mary’s is a medium-sized hospital that punches way above its weight.

He advocated for an electrophysiology suite that would expand cardiac services.", "So I took their concerns to our health minister, Dr. Eric Hoskins, and to senior policy staff within the ministry.

They enrich our communities; they enrich our workplaces; they enrich our lives.", "Ontario, like other jurisdictions, is dealing with a major demographic shift that has seen the number of seniors in our province increase significantly, and we know that the numbers will continue to grow. This is what I think about every day: There are over two million seniors in Ontario; in 25 years, there will be about four million. For the first time now, there are more Ontarians over the age of 65 than there are children in Ontario under the age of 15—and I’m sure the pages are listening intently to that.", "What’s even more striking is the diversity of Ontario’s seniors. Just under half are immigrants, many live in rural and smaller communities, and as many as 7% are not fluent in either English or French. This is a change that is unprecedented in modern times for Canada, and the Ontario government, like governments in Canada and around the world, recognizes this reality.", "Today, people are living longer, active, productive, healthier lives, and that has a host of implications for policy-makers in all fields.

The action plan is a ground-breaking strategy that stresses, first and foremost, the importance of creating age-friendly communities.", "What do we mean by “age-friendly communities”? We mean inclusive, accessible environments with programs and services that make a difference in the lives of older adults. We mean communities where seniors are supported and empowered to stay healthy, active and engaged with the people and organizations around them for as long as possible.", "Supporting age-friendly communities is a key component of Ontario’s Action Plan for Seniors. Since the release of that plan, we have launched a number of initiatives intended to do just that.", "In 2013, we released the Age-Friendly Community Planning guide, which explains the characteristics of an age-friendly community and how it can respond to the opportunities and challenges of an aging population. The guide outlines step-by-step processes and tools to help municipalities and communities develop and implement action plans that will lead to senior-friendly communities which are socially and physically accessible and inclusive.", "We’re also supporting municipalities and communities in their efforts by investing $200,000 in the Age-Friendly Communities Outreach Initiative, which provides education and assistance to communities interested in adopting age-friendly planning principles. If there are MPPs here who’d like to see their communities involved with this, please let me know.", "Beyond education, however, we are also investing in specific projects. The Age-Friendly Community Planning Grant Program, which we launched in 2014, is already providing funding for 56 projects across Ontario. This funding is supporting communities in the development or improvement of age-friendly planning. The program is encouraging municipalities to apply an age-friendly lens to all areas of local planning, and it is also building awareness and momentum across the province, so that all communities are encouraged to embrace age-friendly planning and raise the standards they have in place.", "Another program we launched in 2014 was the Seniors Community Grant Program to support small community projects that help keep seniors connected, active and engaged. Grants under this program range from $500 to $8,000. I’m talking about things like dance classes, day trips and reading clubs, as well as information campaigns or speaker series on topics such as financial literacy, hands-on computer workshops and many intergenerational projects. These projects help seniors stay engaged, contribute to their local communities and avoid the harm of social isolation.", "Speaker, since its launch in 2014, the program has given more than 256,000 seniors the opportunity to enjoy activities in their communities and beyond so that the richness of their experiences and learning continues to flourish. To date, we have invested approximately $5 million in this program.", "Another important community resource for seniors are elderly persons centres, or EPCs. There are 263 of them across the province, and more than 100,000 seniors benefit from the services they offer every year. Seniors are offered access to social and recreational programs, such as fitness and cooking classes, Meals on Wheels, various transportation services and falls prevention classes. They also receive health, education and support services. Clearly, the EPC program is one we value, and it is key to keeping seniors active and engaged in their communities.", "Speaker, I have been speaking until now about the various ways we have been attempting to improve the lives of seniors within their communities. But as my colleagues are well aware, sometimes you have to do more than encourage a happy life; you also have to ensure a safe one. We never lose sight of our obligation to protect Ontario seniors. Sadly, one of the things we have to protect them against is elder abuse. This isn’t something anyone wants as an issue, but it is. It can be emotional, it can be physical, it can be financial or it can be just plain neglect. It is abuse, and our government is determined to address it.", "Ontario was the first province in Canada to introduce a strategy to combat elder abuse. This strategy focuses on raising awareness, coordinating community services and training front-line staff.", "Over the past five years, through our strategic partnerships, we have trained more than 29,000 front-line workers in a variety of sectors, from health to justice to the social services, education and volunteer sectors, to recognize and respond to elder abuse. We have also reached more than 46,000 individuals through public education sessions delivered across the province.", "We are in the process of reviewing our current strategy in order to ensure we are providing the very best services and protection for today’s seniors. I should note that we have also created mandatory annual training on elder abuse for the Ontario Provincial Police, and we have shared this training with other police services and community agencies.", "Elder abuse is a very serious issue, and I can assure my colleagues that this government is determined to do the utmost to protect our seniors.", "Another issue of great concern is related to the safety problems caused by dementia. Nearly 221,000 Ontarians have dementia, and many of them at one time or another have wandered away from their families, homes or caregivers. This is a grave concern. In 2013, in partnership with the Alzheimer Society of Ontario and law enforcement groups, we launched the Finding Your Way wandering prevention program. We’re investing over $750,000 in this program every year.", "This multicultural program is intended to help people with dementia, their families and communities to recognize and reduce the risk of going missing, and provides practical advice and tools for handling situations should a wandering incident occur. Program resources are available in 12 languages and include public awareness materials and a safety kit. Last year, we began to expand the focus of the program to help those with dementia live safely in their communities through such efforts as educating service providers—for example, emergency medical services—about dementia and wandering prevention activities.", "This year, we are rolling out newly developed training resources and recruiting more volunteers to improve community preparedness and response to wandering incidents. As you may know, the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care has been leading work on the development of an Ontario dementia strategy and last week launched consultations to help develop the strategy. I encourage all members to review the paper and participate in the consultation process, whether online or in the forthcoming town halls that the Ministry of Health will be leading. We know that dementia care and the availability of supports are important issues for seniors, their families and caregivers, and we wish to ensure that our partners and stakeholders are aware of this important consultation.", "We’ve also taken action to protect seniors from fire by requiring facilities housing vulnerable Ontarians, including retirement homes, to be equipped with automatic sprinkler systems by January 1, 2019. Ours is the first province to make sprinklers mandatory in existing licensed retirement homes and in facilities housing seniors and other vulnerable citizens. To help with this transition, I will be working with my cabinet colleagues in the coming months to develop a funding model to help small or rural retirement homes that would not otherwise be able to afford to install automated sprinkler systems in their homes.", "In January 2014, a number of fire safety measures came into force, including changes to the fire and building codes. In addition to requiring automatic sprinklers for all existing licensed retirement homes and care homes, other changes included requiring fire safety measures such as self-closing doors, enhanced fire inspections and staff training, and annual validation of fire safety plans by local fire services. These measures will increase safety and provide peace of mind to seniors living in retirement homes as well as to their families.", "Retirement homes, I should note, are also now required to implement a number of protection measures in the Retirement Homes Act that enhance the safety and care of residents and also give seniors and their families clear information to help them make informed choices about their accommodation and enforceable rights while living in retirement homes. That legislation was a historic step. For the first time in Ontario’s history, government established legislative protections for seniors living in retirement homes.", "The final thing I want to touch on today is the health of our seniors. I say with real pride that our government is in the process of transforming health care under the leadership of Minister Hoskins in order to make Ontario the healthiest place in North America to grow up and grow old. Our goal is to deliver health care that puts patients at the centre of the system, responds to their needs and makes it easier for providers to deliver care to those who need it, when they need it. This includes making investments across the health care system to better support seniors so they can lead a healthy, engaged and active lifestyle for as long as possible. We know that better community care is critical to support seniors who want to remain independent for as long as possible.", "As announced in the 2016 budget, our government is continuing to fund growth in home and community care at about 5% per year to 2017-18. We’re also investing an additional $75 million over the next three years in community-based residential hospice and palliative and end-of-life care.", "We are investing an additional $10 million annually in Behavioural Supports Ontario for initiatives to help residents with dementia and other complex behaviours and neurological conditions. We are increasing the income threshold for low-income seniors under the Ontario drug plan in order to make access to drugs more affordable for an additional 170,000 lower-income seniors.", "Just two weeks ago, I was able to announce that we are providing the shingles vaccine free of charge for Ontario seniors aged 65 to 70. Shingles is a painful and potentially life-altering disease.", "These are the kinds of support measures that will help more seniors live healthier, happier lives.", "I’ve not been in this position very long, but the months I’ve been here have convinced me that there are few responsibilities we have as a government more important than securing the safety, dignity and comfort of our seniors.", "I want to end by sharing a small story. This weekend I had the pleasure and the honour of attending the 100th birthday of a constituent of mine. It was such a wonderful experience because I went into this restaurant in the riding, and this lady, 100 years old but cognitively all there—she knew everybody. When I was introduced by her son, she knew exactly who he was referring to. She was thrilled I was there.", "To me, the best part of it all was that she was surrounded by 90 people, friends and family. Not only did she have all her children, not only all her grandchildren, not only all her great-grandchildren, but also her great-great-grandchildren. She was born in China, raised in India, lived in Aden and then finally moved to Canada.", "As I stepped out of there, I couldn’t help but think: If I was to live to be 100, how many people would show up at my 100th birthday party?

This is an important and revealing overview, weaved together by multiple senior citizens’ organizations across our province, and includes concerns echoed by the good people at United Senior Citizens of Ontario—USCO—and the Canadian Association for Retired Persons, CARP.", "Aging Ontarians, like other age groups, are feeling the effects of soaring housing, food and energy prices, resulting in rising seniors’ poverty rates. It’s estimated that one in eight seniors live in poverty today, especially across rural communities. If you ask a senior what they need, you will hear at the extreme end of the needs spectrum that they need access to a nursing home bed and care. Of course, this need arises when the person can no longer live safely at home alone. Yet this government has been slow to act on this need. Even though it talks a great deal about improvements to seniors’ care, evidence shows that the opposite is true.", "The reality that almost 25,000 seniors today are waiting for a nursing bed, a list expected to double to 50,000 seniors in six years, means that many of our frail and sick seniors are being forced to occupy a hospital bed or, worse, to stay in their homes without proper support, resulting in unnecessary suffering and hardship.", "Furthermore, Ontario has aging, crumbling long-term-care homes and 30,000 outdated nursing beds that need to be rebuilt to safe, modern standards. Also, let’s not forget that this government continues to fail to protect those inside long-term-care homes by not providing safer staffing levels of nurses and personal support workers to ensure that seniors are receiving high-quality and consistent care—an intolerable situation which I have addressed in estimates committee and directly with the minister.", "Three other main issues that arise for seniors are access to affordable prescription drugs, access to affordable and supportive housing and assisted living services, and access to transportation.", "For Ontario seniors, life is simply harder under the Wynne Liberals. Ontario seniors rely on their medications to keep them healthy and out of hospital. Unfortunately, just earlier this year, Ontario seniors had to fight this government over its proposal to hike their drug costs. It’s ludicrous to think this government was toying with a plan that would lead some elderly and vulnerable seniors to stop taking their prescription medications over concerns about costs and ultimately put them at risk of being hospitalized and requiring emergency care.", "This government has made some strides. We do commend them on agreeing to cover the shingles vaccine for eligible seniors in Ontario, which started this month.", "Yet what this government giveth with one hand it taketh away with the other. This brings me to a very contentious topic: age discrimination and stroke recovery. Instead of empowering stroke victims and helping them recover through rehabilitation services, this government is cutting them off. Approximately 5,000 post-stroke patients in Ontario are being denied public treatment services because of age.", "I share that this Thursday, the members opposite will have a chance to reverse their course in this blatant case of age discrimination by supporting my colleague Lorne Coe, the Whitby MPP, in his private member’s bill to remove the age limit in stroke recovery so that all seniors, regardless of age, can have access to the rehabilitation program they need. Ontario senior stroke victims are counting on your support this Thursday to help reduce their out-of-pocket costs and improve their health.", "When it comes to providing our seniors with security and peace of mind, access to safe and affordable housing is top of mind. Imagine my disappointment when I reached out recently to the seniors minister’s office about grants to assist senior citizens with housing repairs and accessibility and energy costs. Sadly, the response was zero support.", "With that, I’d like to touch on another critical plan that’s missing from this government’s agenda: the importance of maintaining a good quality life for seniors, which is to help them stay active and connected to friends, family and community through reliable transportation infrastructure. Across rural communities where there is almost no public transportation, seniors are being pushed into further isolation. The minister responsible was quick to use talking points about providing grants for seniors, but the truth is, her government’s policies are unresponsive to seniors’ transportation needs. I think this is a shame.", "In my riding of Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound, seniors are some of the most dedicated and hardest-working community volunteers. Implementing a reliable and effective transportation system would strengthen and, in the long term, increase their quality of life so they could travel to their medical appointments, to work, to shop, to volunteer or just to be able to visit family and friends.", "I fully expect this government to support our seniors’ engagement and community service by putting their money where their mouth is, providing money that they promised for community transportation programs. I’ll be watching this program closely.", "After 13 long years in power, this government remains unprepared to meet the health care needs of our growing and aging population. Seniors have seen their physiotherapy services cut, stroke recovery cut and wait-lists for nursing beds grow while hydro rates are making them choose between turning on the heat and eating. Our seniors deserve better. We want and expect this government to start standing up for them.", "As such, our expectations are that the minister responsible will take some time today to reflect on those major and ongoing shortfalls and take action to address them.", "I’d like to close by thanking all of our seniors and showing them the respect for leading the way for the great quality of life that we enjoy here in the great province of Ontario." ],

It is a time to think about our responsibilities that we have to ensure every senior in our province lives with dignity and respect.", "Ontario seniors are waiting for real commitments from all levels of government to address their concerns.", "Many believe we have a responsibility or a duty to care for seniors in our communities, but I believe our role as caretakers for Ontario seniors is an honour.", "Retirement should be a time to enjoy the fruits of a lifetime of labour, but the reality is that it isn’t always like that. The numbers don’t paint a very pretty picture, and I want to share some of those so we can reflect on the seriousness of the challenges facing seniors today.", "Currently, there are 600,000 seniors in Canada who live at or below the poverty line, and 12 million working Canadians do not have a workplace pension. Over eight million Canadians provide unpaid care to family members and friends with chronic conditions and disabilities. Caring for a loved one can be a rewarding experience, but it can also be personally challenging and overwhelming.", "One in five Canadians believe they know of a senior who might be experiencing some form of abuse. Seniors from all walks of life are vulnerable to elder abuse, and it is happening in communities across Canada.", "For many older Canadians, the traditional rules of retirement are no longer relevant. Many seniors today don’t have any choice but to continue to work to afford their daily lives. Skyrocketing hydro bills, the cost of prescription medication and a lack of affordable housing all add up to seniors being forced to make decisions they shouldn’t have to.

On ne pourrait pas dépasser 3 600 $. On parle de 1 200 $ à un parti au cours d’une année, 1 200 $ à un candidat d’un parti dans une période électorale et aussi 1 200 $ à une association de circonscription et à un candidat à l’investiture pour l’année civile.", "Un autre aspect que l’on propose à ce projet de loi, c’est que les partis devront afficher publiquement des renseignements sur les activités de financement sur leur site Web avant la date de l’activité de financement, y compris le montant des frais exigés et les bénéficiaires des fonds recueillis.", "On parle aussi des contributions de particuliers, comme je mentionnais, qui ne peuvent pas dépasser 1 200 $ pour tous les bénéficiaires à une activité de financement. Cette réforme, qui je crois soulève plusieurs questions, plusieurs beaux débats ici en Chambre et à travers la province, est quand même une réflexion du programme de financement au niveau fédéral qui avait été amené il y a plusieurs années. Il y a une certaine uniformité pour nous, parlementaires, pour nous aider dans ce processus, mais aussi pour nos associations.", "Un autre projet au niveau des publicités politiques que j’aimerais soulever : les partis ne pourront pas dépenser plus de un million de dollars pour de la publicité politique au cours de la période de six mois qui précède la convocation des électeurs en vue d’une élection générale.", "Je vais juste terminer en vous disant un aspect vraiment que je crois qu’on n’a pas peut-être beaucoup soulevé.

Selon le projet de loi proposé, les candidats à l’investiture devront s’inscrire afin de recevoir des contributions ou des dépôts et d’engager des dépenses, et devront faire rapport sur ces activités, ce qui est vraiment quelque chose de nouveau pour nous au niveau d’un système à l’investiture que j’ai même moi eu la chance de faire avec d’autres candidats.", "Donc, ça c’est vraiment quelque chose que je voulais soulever aujourd’hui avec vous.

We had many places that we wanted to go; unfortunately, not all of them had the two hours of people sign up to debate. However, the places that we did go, they were very welcoming. We listened to all of the participants. We had teleconferences. We were able to hear from people from many different organizations and walks of life.", "At this time, I’d like to thank all of the members of the committee because it did take a fair amount of time away from our constituency offices, and although it’s very important that we do this, it was a sacrifice that a lot of the MPPs had to make to do this during the summer months when it’s very important that we’re in our constituency offices.", "Throughout this process, our goal has been to change the way that politics are done in Ontario. We heard from many of the contributors that one of the most important things that we need to do is take the importance of money out of campaigns, and we hope to do that. As my colleague the MPP from Orléans said, we want to make sure that the democratic process is as equal as possible for all voters and for all of our constituents. That meant lowering some limits and doing some things that may not necessarily be that favourable with all politicians. However, our Premier has directed our caucus to stop hosting large-scale fundraisers where ministers interacted solely with stakeholders of their portfolios. We believe that’s right, and that has happened. That’s why we brought forward a bill that banned corporate and union donations entirely. This is so that, again, it will be an equal playing field for all people who are seeking election.", "Over the summer months, we heard from the opposition parties, experts and the general public on how we could improve this bill. As a result, we brought forth comprehensive amendments that included lowering the contribution limits even further than, I believe, the federal rules suggest at this point. We also want to create a clear definition of third-party advertising. There was much debate about this. It is important that we get this right. We hope to do that through this bill. We also want to strengthen the limits for government advertising before the election. Again, this has been discussed, and we want to continue to discuss this and get it correct.", "To address the issue of fundraising events, we proposed working with all political parties to develop a code of conduct. We believe this is very important. That’s one of the issues that we will continue to work on as this bill proceeds.", "In order to strengthen democracy and its institutions, we want to continue to show leadership by going another step further. That’s why we’re bringing forth an amendment to ban fundraising events for all MPPs, candidates, party leaders, nomination contestants and leadership contestants. Quite frankly, there were a lot of people who were surprised about this and may have thought, at first, that this would be very difficult. I believe there are ways to do this and that it is in the best interests of democracy that we do so.", "There were no amendments before the committee that went as far as we need to go on this issue. Rules on fundraising should apply equally to all political parties. Banning fundraising events is a significant change that will affect both the parties and the riding associations. That’s why our amendment will also increase the per-vote allowance for us to get through this time when the rules are changing." ],

They need $100,000 in order to try to win their seat.", "Now, unless you’re independently wealthy, like Donald Trump, who says he’s financing his campaign on his own, the rest of us have to find ways to fundraise.

That is why this government was forced to address it in Bill 2. But they still failed to even address in Bill 2 the key issues, which are the conflict of interests. If you have a Minister of Energy and he is sitting in a boardroom with six financial companies who will benefit from the sell-off of Hydro One—who, actually, we found did benefit from the sell-off of Hydro One to the tune of $56 million—then that is a conflict of interest.

What Bill 2 is attempting to do—and what the Liberal government is attempting to do with it—is not raise the bar, but they want everybody else now to wear the dirty laundry that’s been exposed during the cash-for-access scandals.

  "text" : [ "It’s my pleasure to rise today and to add to the debate on Bill 2, the Election Finances Statute Law Amendment Act, 2016. There are a few elements of the bill that I would like to focus on during my time this afternoon, including the government’s sudden change of heart when it comes to placing limits on third-party advertising, after voting against it multiple times, as well as their decision to award themselves millions of public dollars to fix the problem of unethical, at best, and corrupt, at worst, fundraising practices.", "At the same time, discussing any of the elements within the bill may prove to be a waste of time because the Attorney General himself admitted that the bill is incomplete and that we will see lots of changes to this piece of legislation in the committee stage. At least the Liberals are being honest when they say that they’re going to do whatever they want anyway.", "We’re discussing fundraising reform because the Liberals were caught engaging in incredibly unethical fundraising practices. Here’s a description of the events from the Globe and Mail:", "“Corporate executives and entrepreneurs who did business with the province would pony up as much as $10,000 for the chance to bend a minister’s ear over a glass of wine at an exclusive fundraiser. The party even set quotas for how much money cabinet ministers were to raise from stakeholders in the departments they oversaw.", "“The cash-for-access scheme was a clear conflict of interest, to the point that at least one former Liberal cabinet minister said he left politics because of it.”", "The exposure of these fundraising schemes is why we are discussing the issue today, not a sudden desire to do the right thing on the part of the government. They’re only trying to clean up this mess because someone caught on to their scheme. Bill 2 is an opportunity to tackle a key issue. But does the bill accomplish real change?", "Mr. Speaker, one element of the bill that I’d like to spend a few minutes discussing is the provision in Bill 2 to regulate third-party advertising in Ontario. Back in 2013, I introduced the private member’s bill seeking to place the same limits on third-party advertising that the vast majority of other provinces, as well as the federal government, already had in place. Limits on third-party advertising were called for by the Ontario Chief Electoral Officer numerous times, but each plea was ignored by the Liberals because they felt they had a good thing going and that there was no need to protect our democracy since the system worked in their favour.", "The Minister of Transportation completely dismissed the notion that Ontario’s rules needed updating. He felt things were just fine the way they were. That’s hardly surprising, given how he ended up in the position of power he’s in. He transported a lot of bags of money to the Liberal Party over the years. The minister stated that there was simply no need to regulate third-party advertising because, “The reforms and the regime that exist currently in Ontario do strike the right balance between transparency and free speech.”", "Another government member stated last year that limiting third-party advertising “is really dangerous, in the fact that it limits third parties from getting involved in the democratic process, in advertising.”", "The member went on to state, “There may be other groups that want to get out there and speak, and to limit them to a certain financial amount is not really the right thing to do.”", "Well, Speaker, I look forward to the Minister of Transportation and other members who clearly stated that they’re against limiting third-party advertising speaking out against this government’s bill—unless, of course, they have flip-flopped.", "Mr. Speaker, the very author of this bill has had a few flip-flops when it comes to his position on fundraising and democratic reform. The Attorney General was one of the Liberal MPPs that voted against placing restrictions on third-party advertising, not once, not twice, but three times. He first voted against placing limits on third-party advertising in 2011, on a bill presented by my colleague the member from Wellington–Halton Hills, and again in 2013, when he voted against my bill, and a third time in 2015, when he voted against a bill brought forward by the member for Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound. Now the minister has flip-flopped and is in favour of third-party advertising limits, which he voted against multiple times in the past. I’d like to congratulate the minister on finally recognizing a good idea; it’s better late than never.", "The entire reform process has been treated as a joke by this government from the very beginning, when the Premier announced she wrote her government’s plan by herself at home over the weekend." ],

From that moment on, it was clear that the changes to our democracy would be dictated from the Liberals, not decided upon collaboratively.", "What did Premier Wynne suggest we do to fix the problem of the Wynne Liberals selling themselves off for intimate dinners? The Premier actually suggested that her party should be given millions of dollars from taxpayers in the form of a per-vote subsidy. The Globe and Mail estimates that the Liberal Party of Ontario alone would receive more than $5 million per year as a result of a generous per-vote subsidy. It’s beyond parody at this point, Speaker. Premier Wynne and her government got caught with their hands in the cookie jar and their recommendation was that they should be able to take all the cookies.", "Not only is this government trying to ignore the problems like toddlers and insist they’ve done nothing wrong, they’re even referring to their cash grab of tax dollars as an “allowance.” I’m not sure how many people in Ontario would refer to $5 million as an allowance, but it does show just how the Ontario Liberals really do consider tax dollars their fun money.", "Nurses are being let go. The government’s going to war with doctors and trying to cut their pay. Yet there are apparently millions of dollars just lying around that can be sent directly to political parties. That is unacceptable. It once again goes to show how the Liberals have lost their way and somewhere along the line started caring more about their own political futures and filling the pockets of political hacks than the future of this province, and it’s shameful. It sends a terrible message to anyone in this province who has had to deal with cutbacks. There is plenty of money for Premier Wynne and her party, but no money for you, the taxpayer. Is that the message our government should send to its people?", "Only in Kathleen Wynne’s Ontario would charity groups need to fundraise while political parties receive millions of dollars from the public purse. It’s hardly surprising that the Liberals want the payouts to be based on the 2014 election results instead of future elections, as their popularity has plummeted over the last two years. They will receive much more money under that vote tally than they likely would if the payouts reflected current levels of support.", "As a matter of fact, recent polls have pegged the Liberal Party falling to 25% support, down from the 39% of the vote they received in 2014. The Premier currently has an astonishing disapproval rate of 74%.", "Further complicating matters is the fact that the Liberals have already lost one seat since the 2014 election; they may lose a few more seats between now and the next general election. Would the Liberals receive a payout for seats they no longer hold? I think that’s a question, actually, that will have to be answered. We can only assume that the government will opt for a system that gives the maximum payout to the Liberal Party of Ontario. Ultimately, we can only guess, as the government has already stated that this bill will be rewritten as they see fit anyway. So who knows what snap changes they will introduce without warning or consultation?", "One of the snap changes that this government has made came when they announced they would prevent all provincial politicians from going to fundraisers. They would still be allowed to make phone calls to ask for money. They could still personally sell tickets for the events but would not be allowed to physically attend them. This change makes little sense. It would not stop the worst abuses that have happened under this Liberal government in regard to selling access to ministers, and it is unsurprising that no other Canadian jurisdiction at any level of government has gone forward with such a policy.", "The Liberals pretend that local fundraisers such as community barbecues for individual backbench MPPs hold the same weight as thousand-dollar fundraisers where industry insiders talk privately with ministers who can sign off on billion-dollar deals. Also, does it really solve the problem if many of the ministers’ senior staff or policy advisers attend these cash-for-access events instead of the ministers themselves? Clearly not.", "A Globe and Mail editorial questioned how anyone could believe such a change would make any difference at all: “Do the Liberals now expect anyone to believe that, just because a cabinet minister can’t attend a fundraiser, he or she won’t be beholden to major donors? If donations are being actively traded for favours, what possible difference can it make whether or not a cabinet minister is present when a cheque is written?” Even the Premier’s reasoning for this sudden change is questionable.", "A Globe and Mail report stated the following: “Asked to explain her sudden change of heart, Ms. Wynne said she decided to bring forward the fundraiser ban because opposition proposals to end cash-for-access did not go far enough. The Premier said opposition amendments to the bill covered only cabinet ministers and not all MPPs. Her claim, however, appears to be incorrect: Out of four cash-for-access amendments from the Progressive Conservatives and the NDP, two would have applied to all MPPs.”", "Many have asked why the Liberal government is running this fundraising reform instead of Elections Ontario, given that they’re in a position to rig the system in their favour. That’s exactly what they’re trying to do, but don’t just take my word for it, Speaker. Listen to the serious concerns raised by Ontario’s Auditor General.", "Last month, the Toronto Star reported that, according to the Auditor General, “Ontario’s Liberal government would enjoy a ‘political advantage’ over rivals under Premier Kathleen Wynne’s proposed campaign financing reforms.”", "The Star’s report on the Auditor General’s warning went on to say, “While there are spending limits on advertising for opposition parties and lobby groups in terms of advertising six months before and during elections, there are no such restrictions on the government....", "“‘There is an advantage to the governing party if it is able to advertise on any issue, at any time prior to an election, and at any cost in the guise of government advertising.’” That was said by Auditor General Bonnie Lysyk.", "Speaker, what’s worse is that the Liberals recently stripped the Auditor General’s power to decide which ads are partisan and which are acceptable for government to run on. A freedom-of-information request filed by the Canadian Taxpayers Federation revealed that the government spent nearly $600,000 advertising the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan during the federal election campaign alone. Overall, initial estimates have stated that the Wynne Liberals spent roughly $2 million on ads promoting the Ontario pension plan that never came into existence. Prime-time ads do not come cheaply. These millions of dollars were spent promoting a pension plan that did not even see a single cent go to Ontario seniors.", "Shifting gears, a Globe and Mail article on the report stated, “Ontarians have paid $37 billion more than market price for electricity over eight years and will pay another $133 billion extra by 2032 as a result of haphazard planning and political meddling, a report from the Auditor General says. The Liberal government has repeatedly overruled expert advice ... in favour of political decisions that drove up power costs for consumers.”", "Why would a government possibly overrule expert advice and drive up energy costs for their own citizens? I liken it to, “Don’t confuse me with facts. My mind is made up.”", "Where are these extra billions and billions of dollars going? Where is the money going? We may never know.", "On an unrelated note, it was revealed today that Premier Wynne is planning a $1,000-per-person fundraiser on October 6 at a Toronto office of Menergy Corp., a Chinese energy company.", "We know two things: (1) Ontarians have paid billions in extra electricity costs, and (2) the Ontario Liberals have made hundreds of thousands of dollars off of secret fundraisers with the energy sector. And these are just a few of the fundraisers that we know about.", "The Liberals were, of course, caught red-handed—interesting phrase, “red-handed”—earlier this year selling access to ministers of the crown to the highest bidder in secret.", "The Premier was then crystal clear when she vowed that never again would the Ontario Liberal Party hold a secret fundraiser. She promised that her party would disclose each and every fundraiser, especially ones attended by ministers commanding hundreds and sometimes over $1,000 for a special night.", "Not many people trusted this promise at that time, and it didn’t take long for the government to break this promise of transparency. Liberals were caught breaking their own rules just yesterday. As transparent as mud, as I would describe it, Speaker.", "The Toronto Star reported yesterday that “Premier Kathleen Wynne has ordered the Liberals to stop attending private fundraisers—they define the events as public if they are posted on the Liberal Party website.", "“But Progressive Conservative Todd Smith noted in question period Tuesday that a $700-per-ticket fundraiser with Energy Minister Glenn Thibeault and Transportation Minister Steven Del Duca on October 5 wasn’t posted online.”", "The minister offered a laughable justification by saying that even though the secret fundraiser was not publicly listed when he was called out by the member for Prince Edward–Hastings, the fact that he made it public after the secret fundraiser was exposed somehow meant that it was never a secret. Oh, “that” secret fundraiser? He was just about to tell the public about it. “I was just about to tell the public about it,” he went on to say, “and I promise.” Does that make any sense to those watching at home? Does anybody buy that?", "As I wind down my remarks, I would like to state that I am disappointed that this government is wasting a chance to build our democracy for the better. Bill 2 is what happens when a government is more interested in protecting themselves than our institutions. Just like many other issues in Ontario, cash-for-access was not a real problem until it started to hurt the popularity of the Premier.", "Bill 2 deals with a serious issue. Secret fundraisers and selling cash-for-access to ministers has damaged the public’s trust in our democracy. The fact that so many people in Ontario feel that their government has been bought and paid for is a shame. By so clearly losing this opportunity to strengthen the integrity of our democracy—one that would outlast each and every one of us and should be our top priority—the government has once again shown that their true concern is the financial well-being of the Liberal Party of Ontario. Everything else, Speaker, comes second.", "To truly tackle the problem of selling access to ministers for cash, a public inquiry should expose all of the wrongdoings of this government.", "I can hardly wait to hear further what this government has to say pertaining to Bill 2." ],

The reason this bill was brought about, as many members have raised, was because the government was found to be engaging in activities that were perceived to be improper. Some of them are perceived in a very—one could infer the impropriety very clearly. The clearest example is this: The sell-off of Hydro One does not benefit the province of Ontario at all. In fact, we have very independent evidence that suggests it puts our province in a worse financial position. It does not actually allow us to fundraise or raise funds for transit or infrastructure. It does not do that, and that suggestion flies in the face of the evidence. It flies in the face of the evidence.", "The government says that we’re going to do this sell-off not for the benefit of the people of Ontario but for the benefit of a small group of bankers and lawyers called a syndicate.", "Now, this very same group called the syndicate turns around and does a fundraiser for the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Energy, the very two ministers responsible for facilitating the sale of Hydro One. That was something that was seen to be very troublesome. The Integrity Commissioner said that a reasonable person would be led to believe that this was a conflict of interest. It’s these types of activities that we wanted to stop, but the government is doing nothing to actually stop those activities.", "In addition, the government can continue to spend public dollars on partisan government ads that the Auditor General has deemed she would not have approved if she was still allowed to have the power to say yes or no to these ads. The government got rid of that ability for the Auditor General and they are moving away from transparency; and this bill, again, is not going to address the problem." ],

So just in case he forgot that, we already have a mechanism right now to ensure timely reporting of all donations. Maybe the opposition should consider that piece as well.", "But the bigger piece here about the proposed legislation: I was attending those public hearings during the summer to hear from Ontarians across the province. I attended some of the hearings. We heard very loud and clear that they do want election finance reform. They also told us they will support the whole issue of a per-vote contribution to the parties. But more importantly, I think the time has come for more transparency, and with the proposed legislation, if passed, there will be more transparency in terms of the legislative process.", "At the same time, I want to hear from the third party and their views about the whole issue of corporate—but, more importantly, the ban of union donations, because we know that when we ban all donations, especially the corporate and union ones, there will be implications for all parties, not just on the government party’s side.", "The other piece here is that at the end of the day we want to make sure there’s transparency. There’s been express concern from the member opposite, the member from Chatham–Kent–Essex, about the whole issue of the so-called buying-for-access piece. I would challenge him because I know, from my riding of Scarborough–Agincourt, that’s not the case. The Premier and others have visited my riding. There is no donation, there is no access issue.

This reflects on all of us. This is what people outside of this little bubble that we live in are reading about our dealings here.", "“It will probably take a crew of 10 people working for a solid week to remove the skid marks at Queen’s Park caused by the Wynne government’s sudden U-turn on the issue of cash-for-access political fundraisers….", "“The cash-for-access scheme was a clear conflict of interest, to the point that at least one former Liberal cabinet minister said he left politics because of it.” Now, that’s powerful.", "“It’s a move that looks less like the zeal of a convert, and more like a petulant act of spite….", "“The scandal that forced the Liberals to introduce Bill 201 was not about a local MPP attending a potluck dinner in their riding, where tickets cost $50. The scandal was the Liberals using their advantage as the governing party to collect large cheques from people seeking favour with cabinet members. It was cabinet members trading access for cash, or giving the appearance of doing so.", "“Do the Liberals now expect anyone to believe that, just because a cabinet minister can’t attend a fundraiser, he or she won’t be beholden to major donors….", "“But instead of seeking to focus attention on a demonstrably real problem, Mr. Naqvi is suggesting a blanket ban on MPPs being physically present at fundraising events.” The editorial: “On Cash for Access, Have Ontario’s Liberals Lost the Plot?” The Globe and Mail, September 1, 2016.", "Why are we here today? They are right there. Outside of our bubble, that’s what people are reading. That’s how we’re being painted—every single one of us in this room. It doesn’t matter what side of the hall you are on. It goes on, and there is more:", "“Now, by suddenly proposing banning any MPP from attending any political fundraiser, Mr. Naqvi has further exposed the depths of Liberal cynicism.

They are there to support an individual and his or her agenda in an entirely legitimate manifestation of the democratic process. When the energy minister invites a few electricity-sector executives to a private dinner in exchange for thousands of dollars in donations, however, you know said executives don’t show up to talk about the weather.”", "There’s more. “Everything about the Wynne government’s handling of the cash-for-access scandal reveals its true colours.

Most of them pay their taxes. Most of them come forward for the right reasons. They’re ordinary citizens. They earn a good wage. They often leave businesses, they sell businesses to come here.

We want the most volunteers. We want the most phones. We want the most central office. It’s perfectly normal what we do.

People have looked at other jurisdictions around the country and over the past few years at the federal level and in other jurisdictions. We’ve seen it drift away from the allowance of corporate donations and the allowance of union donations, for example. At one time, that was considered perfectly proper and part of the way things were done. By today’s standards, it simply doesn’t meet the test. It doesn’t meet the test of public opinion.", "When we see the large fundraisers that used to be—you can even go back to the days of Sir John A. Macdonald and others, when everyone would rally in the centre of town. I’m sure there was a little bit of fundraising that went on back then. That’s how you interacted with your stakeholders. That’s what you did.", "Over the summer months, there were hearings that took place. I wasn’t part of them, but certainly I followed them. We heard from the opposition parties. We had experts in this field come in. We had the general public come in. We came in with some amendments that we thought reflected what people were asking us to do. What they were asking us to do was to be very clear what you mean by third-party advertising, get a very clear definition of it, strengthen the limits for government advertising before an election so it couldn’t be used to anybody’s advantage, work with all political parties to develop a code of conduct and lower the contribution limits even further. It seems to me that what we have before us today are things that do that, things that are going to strengthen the democratic institutions. They are rules that are brought forward to level the playing field, so that we’re all operating by the same rules. I have no problem with that.", "The amendments that are coming forward are what we’re hearing the public wants, what we’re hearing can be applied to all of us equally and should apply, obviously, to all political parties. I would hope nobody would argue with that. I think it’s more reflective of changing times, of the ability to fundraise. We’ve got mailing lists now. We’ve got people who call on a regular basis. Fundraising is a bit of an art and a bit of a science as well, and we all use fundraisers. The fact we’re trying to point fingers at each other and say, “Well, you’ve done this worse, or you’ve done this,” that just simply hasn’t been the experience.", "What I’ve found is, politicians I’ve worked with from all three political parties are the sort of people I’d like to see getting elected. When they come here, I think they do their best. I think we diminish ourselves by some of the comments. If there are criticisms about the rules—they don’t go far enough, maybe they go too far—that type of debate is the sort of debate we need on this issue. What I don’t think we need is the needling of each other and the to and fro that really diminishes this place and all the people in it.", "Speaker, I obviously will be supporting the act as it moves forward—or the bill, as it moves forward to become an act. I’d ask all members to put forward whatever suggestions they have that would perhaps allow for some change. That’s what I’d like to hear. When I do come here, I do listen. When I have the opportunity to, I try to work with members of the opposition on private members’ bills, on committee work, that type of thing; because I think when we do that it raises us all. It raises the opposition parties and it raises the government side as well.", "So I’d ask members to perhaps concentrate on what the changes are, whether they be good or bad in the opinion of the members, but to leave the personal stuff out. Because my experience, as I said, over the past 32 years, is that very few and far between is the number of people who entered Canadian politics for the wrong reasons, and I don’t think any of them are in this House today." ],

They came out because they wanted to have people such as myself elected, and it provided a tool by which to do so, a tool that we all need. It’s something we do in all parties: We fundraise. We fundraise with integrity and we fundraise because it’s a necessary part of the democratic process. We all do it.", "So I am a bit mystified as to why there is this uproar that it’s for access. It’s not that you’re paying for access. People don’t pay for access. They come out, they have a good time, they socialize and they interact. They exchange ideas that make the whole province better and make this country better in general.", "So, Mr. Speaker, from where I’m coming from, these changes have come about to make the process transparent, and to make sure the public knows that when you meet with a minister, it’s not because you want to sell access or you want a special program or advance a special cause. They’re doing this to educate and enlighten the community as to what government is all about. That’s what ministers talk about. They talk about the things we are doing to enhance this province and to enhance the well-being of every citizen in this province.", "From where I’m coming from, I don’t believe any minister—not on this side of the House—is meeting with any particular group to sell access or to provide access for any political gain, other than the enrichment of our community and the enrichment of society.", "These changes, I see them—we don’t have to agree with all of them. This bill is going to go to committee. It’s going to go out for consultation. As a government, we do listen, and we’re going to listen to the people, and we’re going to make this bill the best bill possible to benefit all Ontarians and to enhance and enrich the process in this province. There will be opportunity to modify the bill, to make it better. We will accept submissions from the public, from both political parties and from all interested parties to make this the best bill and to make this something that we can all live with, and progress, enhance and enrich the democratic process in this province and in this country.", "Again, Mr. Speaker, I will be supporting this bill. I encourage all members of this House to support this bill. It’s not a perfect bill, but we’re going to make this a bill that enhances and enriches this place." ],

We don’t want the public out there to think that, “Oh, you politicians are all the same,” and cash-for-access and all that stuff. I say that to members across the floor, anyone that talks about fundraisers in that tone, unless in their fundraiser they don’t speak and they don’t talk about policy, there’s nothing wrong with it. They will, perhaps, be seen as doing the same thing—cash-for-access—because they come over to ministers and speak to specific issues, cases, individuals or organizations in their ridings and lobby on their behalf. So, can we say that is cash-for-access? No, I wouldn’t categorize that.", "I think it is important to realize that there are rules in place, rules on how to advertise for fundraisers. Ministers can’t call themselves ministers; they have to be advertised as MPPs, just so everyone is equal. There are rules about how to receipt, how much they can contribute. I want the viewers in front of the TV to realize that there are very strict rules and everyone in this House and their local riding association is subject to the scrutiny of Elections Ontario. That’s why we have a very good system, a very democratic system, right as of now.", "However, I think we have a good opportunity in front of us. Through the introduction of the election financing act, we can establish a goal to change the way politics are done in Ontario. The Premier actually directed the caucus to stop hosting large-scale fundraisers where ministers interact solely with stakeholders of their portfolio. This is something that we have seen governments prior to this administration and governments at other levels do all the time, and they have done that in the past. I shouldn’t say “all the time.” The rule has been changed at the federal level. But in the past, that’s how things were done.", "Again, like I said, these stakeholders have access to ministers any time. Just pick up the phone and if the minister’s schedule allows meetings, they will welcome their input. It’s not that they only go to fundraisers to speak about their ideas or about a suggestion or whatever perspective they have on their industry. To be honest, at fundraisers—I know the members across the floor know, in their experience—you don’t get too many chances to talk to individuals in depth about whatever they want to talk about. It’s the same thing as opposition members: If they have a specific issue, they can come to a minister and speak to it.", "I want to, again, caution the members of this House, be very careful using the term “cash-for-access,” because you are making an allegation. The last time I checked, no honourable member of this House has been charged for things they are alleging, things they are hinting. They should be very, very careful when they use that term.", "I listened to the member from Bramalea–Gore–Malton. He brought forward a couple of weaknesses of this bill. I want to inform him that we’ve brought forward comprehensive amendments that will include lowering contribution limits even further, creating a clear definition of third-party advertising—he mentioned third-party advertising; we’re bringing forward a clear definition—and strengthening the limits for government advertising before an election.", "I think this is very, very important. If you remember, back in 2006, this government, the Liberal government at the time, under the previous Premier, Premier Dalton McGuinty, passed legislation to ban partisan advertising for the government. So I think this bill will further strengthen the limits on government advertising, and this is something that the public wants to see.", "Lastly, I just want to say again, rules on fundraising should be equal to all members of all parties. Let’s be fair: If we need to fundraise, they need to fundraise. We respect how they fundraise, and I expect the same respect from the members across the aisle." ],

They’re not. When a carpenter comes to my fundraiser, they’re not looking to get a contract at Queen’s Park.

With that power and influence comes responsibility, and therefore the level of scrutiny should be higher.

Yes, but this bill is trying to paint everyone with the same level of responsibility. Let’s face it: On the opposition side, we are not ministers. Ministers have more influence. We all have to fundraise, but there is a difference between being a minister and being an MPP on the opposition side; let’s make that clear.

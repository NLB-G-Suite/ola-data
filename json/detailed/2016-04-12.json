  "text" : [ "Yes, indeed. Let’s applaud Minister Sergio.", "We’re very pleased to be able to continue debate on Bill 181, an important piece of legislation, I think. Second reading debate was led off yesterday by the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing, who has worked very, very hard to put together a piece of legislation that will be bringing forward changes to the Municipal Elections Act.", "I think, in an overall sense, the goal is to ensure that the rules governing how municipal leaders are elected are clear and reflect, perhaps, how we can better run modern campaigns and elections. The ministry actually reviews the Municipal Elections Act following each municipal election. The goal is to ensure that the act does meet the changing needs of Ontario communities.", "I recall part of Minister McMeekin’s comments yesterday, that over 3,400 submissions about how the act could be improved were received from the public, from municipal councils and from staff across the province as part of the consultation last year.", "The purpose in us bringing forward this legislation now is that we want to do it well in advance of the next municipal elections, in 2018, to allow our municipal partners sufficient time to prepare for the next election cycle in their communities.", "I don’t think I need to speak to anyone in the Legislature about the important services that are provided by our municipalities. Many people in the Legislature are former members of municipal councils, and certainly all of us work closely with the municipalities we represent to ensure that we are indeed reflecting their views. Certainly my goal as an MPP is to work with the municipal councils I represent: the city of Thunder Bay and many other municipalities in the riding of Thunder Bay–Superior North. One thing that I think we have all come to truly recognize is that municipal governments are the governments that are closest to the people; they are the ones that are going to be hearing directly from their constituents. We, of course, operate on very much the same basis. Certainly we have a very close relationship with our constituents.", "The bottom line is that our communities certainly need to be strong. They need to be vibrant places where people can live, work and raise families. That’s why I think it is important that we need to ensure that local elections are as efficient as possible. One of the ways I think we can do that—and that’s reflected in this legislation—is by increasing transparency and accountability, and allowing more choice in municipal elections. That is very much part of the government’s plan to build our province up.", "One part of the legislation that is certainly of most interest to municipal leaders—and, I think, to people across the province—is ranked ballots. What we are working on to try to improve, at a time when voter turnout is going down in many communities—that has certainly been the case in municipal elections—is that we think it is timely to look at ideas that could potentially, and we believe will, reverse that trend.", "What we are proposing is providing municipalities with an option. The option is to introduce ranked-ballot voting in their communities, if they so choose. I can certainly speak on behalf of those who have spoken to me about ranked ballots. The proponents of ranked ballots certainly believe that this method of voting can make election campaigns more civil; I think that is probably the case. Jurisdictions that are using ranked ballots have seen better engagement and better debate, and certainly the evidence is that they’re seeing higher turnouts. So that is one of the main aspects of it.", "There’s also a piece of the legislation related to campaign finance. If this legislation is passed—and we’re obviously looking forward to a full debate—these changes will certainly help ensure that campaign finance rules are clear, are simple to follow, are easier to enforce and increase transparency and accountability in municipal elections.", "What we are proposing, Mr. Speaker, is a framework to regulate third-party advertising to increase accountability for advertisers and ensure more fair and more transparent support, including setting contribution and spending limits. I believe that any discussion about modern elections must include whether we ban corporate and union donations, and these changes would give municipalities this option. Again, we want to make sure that our municipalities, our cities and our towns have the opportunity to undertake this conversation with their citizens, and that’s very much the goal of this legislation.", "We are proposing, for example, that clerks refund nomination fees to candidates only if they file their financial statements by the deadline. This way, candidates would be more than encouraged to file on time. There’s an issue related to municipal elections, which we all speak about frequently, in terms of the actual campaign period. Right now, Ontario has the longest nomination period of any province. It probably is not a stretch to say that it contributes to campaign fatigue among candidates and voters. If this legislation is passed, candidates would be able to register between May 1 and the fourth Friday in July instead of from January 1 to the second Friday in September in the year of the election. We think that is a way we could actually reduce the impact of campaign fatigue—change the way that things are set up now, in terms of the election period that is in place.", "There is also a goal to make sure we make elections more accessible for everyone. Our proposed changes would certainly require clerks to prepare accessibility plans to identify, remove and prevent barriers that could affect voters and candidates with disabilities. We would be asking for the municipalities to make the plan available to the public prior to voting day.", "I’ll be passing it off to my colleague shortly, but I want to also make a few more comments about the voters list itself. We are also proposing improvements to the voters list. We need to make it easier for voters to add their name to the list or make changes to their information, as well as to make it easier for clerks to remove the names of deceased voters or deceased electors from the list.", "This is very much a reflection of a very significant consultation that was undertaken by the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing. As I referenced earlier, Minister McMeekin informed us that there had been over 3,400 submissions that came forward in relation to what changes may be put in place. We want to be able to give the municipalities the option to look at the ranked ballot system, one that has been a great discussion among many municipal leaders, and that is certainly the purpose of this legislation. I’m delighted to have had a chance to speak in support of this legislation and will at this point pass it off to my colleague the minister responsible for seniors." ],

You look good in the chair.", "It’s delightful to have a few minutes to speak on Bill 181, the so-called Municipal Elections Modernization Act. This is the second reading we are doing on this bill. It still has some time to go. Let me say first that I have to congratulate Minister McMeekin, the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing, for spending considerable time on this particular item. He has been consulting with various stakeholders, and I’m very pleased that it’s in the House.", "I believe citizens at large have been asking for some changes, some improvements to the Municipal Act; in other words, how municipal elections are taking place in our province. I don’t have to tell you, Speaker, that we have hundreds of municipalities and cities, and some of the laws vary within some of the existing municipalities as well. I think the changes that have been proposed are welcome. I would like to say at the outset that I will support the recommendations the minister has made. We’ll see how far we can get on it, how quickly we can move it.", "The proposal is to see that this recommendation will be delivered to the local municipalities to implement if they so wish. It’s only an option. They have the option to either implement this recommendation or change it and make further amendments. But I believe it’s important, as Minister McMeekin has recommended, that we direct local municipalities to look at changes in how local municipalities conduct elections.", "I have to tell you, Speaker, that this is very important. I come from a municipal background, and we always say that we are closer to the people when we deal with day-to-day issues. Who can say no to the people when they say, “This has really impinged on the way I live my life.” If it’s a sidewalk issue, if it’s to make sure that when you open the tap that the water is running, that the lights are on, that the services are there—it’s so important. Speaker, I don’t have to tell you, I’m sure, that every member in the House receives calls from people not knowing what is municipal, provincial or federal. I have to say that 60% of the calls I get are municipal issues. So this shows how important it is that our people understand what belongs to them locally, federally or provincially. When people come in to our office, we do listen. We’re trying to help them as well.", "It’s so important that we send this direction to the local municipalities for possible changes, because there are areas that need serious improvement. I was pleased to hear the Minister of Northern Development and Mines addressing some of the issues and the proposed recommendations. One of them that we’ve been debating for a long time—and there are people who are really passionate about it—is ranked ballots. It’s not confusing, but until it’s there and it’s done, people won’t get used to it. It needs some explanation, yes, and it’s one of the ways of electing our local politicians. Whether the cities or municipalities go along with this recommendation is another matter, but at least we are saying, “Let’s do it more democratically and more transparently. Let’s give the people more opportunities.” I don’t have to tell you, Speaker, that voters, especially at the municipal level, are not so affluent. We see 27%, 30%—very low turnouts in municipal campaigns.", "We need to clean up several issues in every election, but especially municipal campaigns. This would perhaps help increase the turnout at the polls. Ranked ballots are one issue, campaign financing is another, increasing transparency and accountability is another, and banning corporate and union donations is another. Filing returns from candidates has been a big issue. It’s sometimes very difficult for local clerks to deal with, because candidates—it’s not that they’re caught in bureaucratic paperwork or whatever it may be, but I think we have to send a clear message that the clerks are responsible for doing that particular work. Then the clerks will have to report as well.", "The campaign period has been something that I have always been—let’s say politely—not very happy about. Because when January 1 comes and the election is in October or November, it’s like the world stops and everybody is thinking about trying to get re-elected from January all the way to October or November. What happens in between? Why such a long period of time for someone to get organized and put up signs or whatever? In other words, work practically stops, and it shouldn’t. It doesn’t. We always have staff and professional people in the various departments—public works, transportation or whatever—that they look after. But taxpayers feel, “Why do you need from January 1 to November to run the campaign?” This is an area that I believe municipalities will have to address, and I hope they will.", "Now, I have a bit more to say, because I spent 18 years at the municipal level. I would say that I know how municipal campaigns are run and what taxpayers expect, and rightly so. One of the important issues at the polls on election day is accessibility: finding polls in the proper location, not 10 blocks away, disenfranchising people.", "My time is up, unfortunately, but, as I said, I come from a municipal government; I spent some 18 years there. I hope that some of these recommendations will have some legs, that we go with second reading and let the municipalities decide how they can better improve municipal elections and municipal campaigns. I thank you for the time, Speaker." ],

  "text" : [ "It’s a pleasure for me to provide a couple minutes of questions and comments on Bill 181.", "I listened to the ministers’ speeches this morning. I don’t disagree with the way that they’re marketing this bill, and I’ll tell you why. When I ran for mayor, I waited till the last hour when nominations closed—and I suggest there are many members of this House who may have done the same—which made it about a month-long campaign period. The writ would have been a month, back in the day when I did that.", "So when the government talks about the writ, the registration period—and I’m also going to talk about the lame duck period—I think it’s interesting to note that they have made the writ a lot longer under this bill, because the writ will now, in this bill, begin in July. The municipal election will be from July to the election date. I suggest that might be problematic for some people who are considering whether to run. I think it might do the reverse: It might deter people from running for office.", "Yes, they have decreased the deadline down, from January 1 to May 1, but there’s one thing that they’ve missed, and many municipalities have talked about this. It’s the lame duck period. For example, when I was elected mayor, the election date was on November 8. We took office on December 1. It was just a little over three weeks. This now again, like the last election, pushes it out so that municipal staff would basically run the municipality for almost six weeks. For many, many, many councils, that’s problematic. I would think that you would want the council to hit the ground running and you would want to have that short period where they could be oriented. There are issues around meetings and whether the meetings are open or not. New councils aren’t open until they get sworn in under those same provisions. So I think the government needs to take a second look at the writ period and also the lame duck period." ],

That hasn’t really given opposition members an opportunity to comb over it, see what the bill is all about and then go back to our municipalities and speak to our city councils, our mayors, talk to our constituents and see what they think. I know the government says they’ve consulted. I believe a year ago, they announced they were going to go out and consult. But it could be history repeating itself.", "We look at a budget that they said they consulted on. They have wasted a lot of people’s time and efforts during consultations. They didn’t wait for the committee to come forward and report on those consultations that they did on the budget. They tabled the budget before the committee even reported. So we have some concerns on this side. I certainly have concerns about how much consultation actually took place. Were they really listening and really taking to heart what the municipalities were saying? Or did they already have this legislation drafted the way they want things to be done and just pretended they were consulting, pretended they were listening to the municipalities?", "I have great concern over the legitimacy of this legislation. I look forward to having more time to read through it and to go back to my city council, my mayor and my constituents of Windsor West to ask what they think, because I just don’t trust the consultations that the government side does." ],

We’ve had the first-past-the-post system since Confederation. It may not be perfect, but it has worked quite adequately and quite well. But if you’re going to change the way that you elect representatives at any level, whether it’s federal, provincial or municipal, then I believe that in this legislation there should be the requirement for a municipal referendum so that the people have their say.", "This is not something that a council should be able to adopt as the way that they’re going to change how people are elected in that community. Nobody’s asking for it. In fact, the city of Toronto has withdrawn their request for ranked balloting. So if there’s nobody requesting it, the people within a municipality should have the final say in our democracy as to whether you’re going to change how people get elected to the positions that they hold. I think that that is absolutely necessary.", "In fact, I’ll give the government credit here: In 2007, on the issue of preferential voting or mixed member representation, the McGuinty government held a referendum so that the people across Ontario could have their say. Don’t make this change without allowing the people to have their say. We live in a democracy. The people get their say." ],

That was during a debate that we had with regard to the private member’s initiative from the member from Ottawa–Orléans. Her private member’s bill received unanimous support to recognize the first two ladies who were ever elected into the Ontario Legislature, Agnes Macphail and Mrs. Luckock.", "During the debate, I mentioned that I grew up with a municipal office in my home until I was a teenager. I remember everything very well, every nuance that’s involved in a person being a clerk-treasurer and ultimately administrator for a local municipality. I was very proud that day to share that my mother, Winona Thompson, was either the first or second woman ever to be named clerk to a municipal township in Huron county. I was hesitant; I said “first or second.” I shot mom an email very quickly, and she got back to me right after the debate. I just wanted to make sure, because this is something that we need to celebrate. The first clerk ever named in the county of Huron, specifically for the township of West Wawanosh, was a dear family friend, Joan Armstrong. Mom was the second clerk that was named in Huron county, to the township of East Wawanosh.", "It’s really nice to have a chance to celebrate this type of leadership and mentorship, because back home in Huron county the retired clerks have a club where they get together for lunch once a month. I’m sure they’ll be talking about this. They welcome people to their club on a regular basis. But there’s a lot of camaraderie and a lot of pride that goes along with working and serving the people of local municipalities. One thing, one thread that ties all of those people together, past and present, is the serving of the public and making sure democracy is upheld.", "This is where I pull my link back into the debate for Bill 181, because democracy has to be upheld, and people really, truly need to have their say. In that regard, I’d like to reflect on a comment that I just heard this past Saturday night. It was a comment that came from the CAO of the township of Morris-Turnberry. She’s very concerned, Speaker, and I will share that concern in a second.", "But when the member from Leeds–Grenville, during his two-minute hit on the government debate, referenced the concern over the extended lameduck period, I couldn’t help but transition that lame duck concept over to this government, because what I heard from the CAO of Morris-Turnberry is that they’re very concerned about this lame duck government because they’re holding municipalities hostage to their lack of follow-through.", "Education rates, education levies have yet to be set by this government, and it’s holding up municipalities from finalizing their budgets. Honestly, if it’s not one thing, like further downloading or decreased upfunding, now they’re holding them hostage to their lack of performance. Speaker, this government needs to pull up its socks and do right by people who are striving and who pride themselves on working so well for their local municipal taxpayers. But again we find another example: This government has yet to set the education levy for this year, and it’s holding municipalities back from setting their budgets. Time and time again, a lack of performance and lack of prioritization is causing people in Ontario to be frustrated and not able to fulfill their responsibilities.", "As we go back to take a look specifically at Bill 181, there’s no greater responsibility than that of our democratic right of electing people. We feel very strongly that the changes this government is suggesting to the Municipal Elections Act, the Assessment Act and the Education Act with respect to third-party advertising, campaign financing, compliance and enforcement, accessibility, the election calendar, voters list, eligibility to vote and run in municipal elections, election administration, as well as ranked ballots, is a little heavy-handed. It’s taking us backward, especially when they’re proposing all of these changes without an opportunity for people to have their voice, to exercise their right through a referendum, for instance.", "We have to take time on our side as the loyal opposition to make sure municipal voices are heard, in order to ensure this bill accurately reflects what they need to run modern, successful, democratic and effective municipal elections.", "I’d like to start by echoing what my colleague from Oxford, Ernie Hardeman, stated yesterday. There are some beneficial aspects to this bill. We, however, are concerned with key components that have the potential to ignore fundamental aspects of the democratic process.", "For instance, the electoral process is an important and intrinsic part of any democratic society. As such, whenever changes are proposed to that process, our party firmly believes that serious and substantive consultation should be conducted. I have said that on numerous occasions about numerous issues that have been perpetuated by this government. Most important to consultation on this particular issue is the need to allow the public a forum in which they can voice their opinion on that matter. I’ll touch a little bit more in detail later on that issue in my debate, because this Liberal government—which ran on a platform, ironically, of open and transparent governance—has been failing the people of Ontario in this respect. Bill 181 is just another long list, as I’ve alluded to.", "There are three key issues we—and I, specifically, during my time—would like to address: the abolishment of the leave of absence exemption for volunteer firefighters who choose to run for municipal office; the continued practice by this Liberal government to leave the working-out of critical details to regulation—and seriously, any time a government chooses to put the meat on the bones behind closed doors, it should cause everyone reason for concern—and thirdly, the concerning lack of public consultation that this bill allows for.", "We just heard from the member from Renfrew–Nipissing–Pembroke that people deserve to have their say, and I totally agree with that. I’d also like to get on record, for the people watching this debate at home, what exactly this government is trying to propose with regard to a ranked ballot system. I know our esteemed colleague from Oxford highlighted how the system worked yesterday, but it’s a complicated method of voting. If we’re going to have any sort of informed debate, we must ensure that everyone understands how that works. So I’m just going to go over that again this morning.", "In a ranked balloting system, a candidate is required to get 50% of the vote plus one. When you receive your ballot on election day, the candidates will be listed on it in no particular order. As the voter, you then number them as 1 for your most preferred candidate, 2 for your second preferred candidate, 3 for your third and so on, down to your least preferred candidate.", "After the polls close, the number of times each candidate was selected as first choice is tallied up. The candidate with the least number of first-place votes is eliminated. The eliminated candidate’s votes are then redistributed to the second-place choices on all of the ballots where the eliminated candidate was ranked first. This means that on a ballot where the first-choice candidate was eliminated, the second-choice candidate becomes the preferred candidate. The ballots are recounted and the process continues until a candidate receives the required number of votes to win.", "Again, as a kid, I remember the great effort and pride that went into pulling together the voters list and making sure they were distributed throughout the community and throughout the township at the community hub, so to speak, so that everyone could ensure their name was indeed on the voters list. Because back in that day, people knew it was a privilege and an honour to vote, to cast their opinion as to who they wanted to see in their municipal leadership, their municipal council. I hope with all my heart that that privilege and that honour is sustained as we look to a voter turnout—be it municipally, provincially or federally—that seems to be dwindling throughout the years.", "Looking at my riding of Huron–Bruce, I’m very proud that, in 2011, Huron–Bruce had the greatest voter turnout in the provincial election and, in 2014, it had the second-highest voter turnout in that particular provincial election. I just want to applaud the good folks from Huron–Bruce at this time for their efforts to get out and exercise their voice and vote, and I want to encourage them to continue to do so.", "It gets a little grey when this government starts introducing the concept of a ranked ballot system. It very well could be confusing to some and turn them off, and we don’t want to do that. As was pointed out yesterday, we want to ensure that people embrace this new approach to electing a municipal council. While it appears that this government may have conducted some consultation to implement a ranked ballot system, it appears that there has been a lack of consultation on what system, specifically, would be preferred.", "I’m not sure about the rest of the MPPs in the House today, but I know the realities, in my home municipality of South Bruce and across the riding—and, I would dare say, there’s probably a theme throughout Ontario—are that we can’t make it more difficult for individuals to throw their hat in the ring to run for municipal council. We can’t make it more difficult to encourage people to come out and vote. In many instances in our wards, people are being acclaimed and, to me, that’s a little bit of a worry, because, given the direction this province is currently heading under this government, I would hope more and more people would want to be engaged, would want to embrace the opportunity to try and make a difference and to correct the path that we’re on. Again, we’re finding there’s a trend where acclamations are probably more the norm than not. We don’t want to confuse and make things more difficult.", "We’ll talk about that, that the example—", "Interjection." ],

It’s interesting: The conclusion to all of that, after I read that article, is that there’s nothing impartial about dictating which electoral system is best for the people without consulting them.", "I mentioned volunteer firefighters and I want to jump into that in a little bit more detail. A few months ago, one concern we had in the PC Party was the impact on first responders. Under this bill, the leave-of-absence exemption for volunteer firefighters will be removed. This means that if someone in this capacity wants to run for office, they would be unable to serve in their community for a minimum of 13 weeks.", "Again, this just shows the absolute disconnect this government has with the realities of rural Ontario. Our fire departments, thankfully, in all the communities in my riding, are supported by a wonderful team of volunteer firefighters. They have their families to care for, they have their daily jobs that they go to, but, honestly, that team of volunteer firefighters is finite. If somebody would like to throw their hat in the ring for consideration for municipal council, to have them leave that volunteer fire department for 13 weeks will leave a hole in our volunteer teams. That’s a concern. It’s something that was probably completely overlooked by this government when they rushed the legislation and their consultations in that regard.", "I know that in the riding of Huron–Bruce, many of our fire stations, as I mentioned, are comprised of volunteers: The Central Huron Fire Department relies on 20 volunteer firefighters; the Blyth and District Fire Department consists of 22 volunteer firefighters; the Ripley-Huron Fire Department is staffed by 10 volunteers; the Lucknow and District Fire Department is served by 24 volunteers; the Walkerton Fire Department relies on 29 volunteer firefighters; and the Teeswater fire department is comprised of a great team of 22 individuals who are proud to call Teeswater home. But again, they’re on rotating teams. Thinking that they might like to make a difference at a municipal level would remove them from that team and remove them from their camaraderie and their commitment to keeping our community safe.", "I’m concerned. What are they going to do? They’re going to either keep people away from pursuing an interest in serving their communities at the municipal level as a potential councillor, or our volunteer firefighters and our fire departments will suffer and not have as many volunteers to call upon. It’s not right. This government, as I said, has proven themselves to be yet again disconnected from the realities of rural Ontario.", "Now, let’s talk a little bit about regulation. In the PC Party, we also have concerns that many of the important details of this bill are left to regulation and not subject to parliamentary process and public scrutiny. It makes me think of Bill 172. A lot of the cap-and-trade scheme, if you will, that this government is introducing will be achieved through regulation. I can’t stress how many businesses, how many organizations, are very anxious and worried about what regulations will do to them and their businesses and their future, for that matter, as they define this scheme behind closed doors via regulation.", "In fact, going back to Bill 181, whole sections of this proposed legislation could be overruled by regulation, despite having gone through the legislative process. Again, how democratic is that? Regulations defined behind closed doors, behind these closed government doors, will not be open to debate in the public forum of this wonderful chamber in the legislative House of Ontario. Instead, it will be decided upon behind closed doors, by bureaucrats who have been given their lead by the minister or cabinet.", "One example that I specifically want to outline today is section 41.1, subsection 6. It states, “If, in the opinion of the Lieutenant Governor in Council, it is necessary or desirable in order to further the purposes of this section and this act, the regulation may vary the operation of any of the following provisions of this act or may provide that any of the following provisions do not apply with respect to a ranked ballot election....”", "Following that, there are no less than 10 sections, subsections and clauses that could be changed or entirely struck out at the whim of a regulation. This should give everyone cause for worry. The legislative process, as you know, Speaker, is in place to ensure that there is accountable, transparent government. That’s what this government across the floor stood on. That’s what we heard about in the throne speech after we came back.", "Sadly, there is absolutely no proof through the years and the last few months that this government is adhering to its own path of transparency and accountability. They have totally thrown that to the wind. Instead, they’re covering their backs, they’re circling their wagons and they’re closing their doors because they know they’ve failed Ontarians and the only way forward is to continue to do things behind closed doors.", "The people of this province have a right to know the details of how they select their representatives municipally. That should not change, election year to election year, simply because three ministers are able to sit in a room together and contrive a new approach. Speaker, we’ve heard that people across Ontario and Canada are struggling to feel like their voice counts. If that process is allowed to continuously change at the leisure of those who control the system, the good intentions to increase voter turnout will ultimately fail. That was one of the worries that I shared at the onset of jumping into this debate today.", "Public consultation is absolutely void in this government. It doesn’t matter whether it’s the Green Energy Act—we just met with the Environmental Commissioner last week. The member for Haliburton–Kawartha Lakes–Brock had a representative of a local municipality in her riding come forward and say that they’re actually redacting and and disallowing the realities around noise with regard to the industrial wind turbines. They’re absolutely not allowing it. Then they have the nerve, in an ERT, to come forward with a position saying, “Well, there were no complaints.”", "Interjection." ],

I think that’s where we should be starting our conversation from, a spirit of engagement, because if we’re going to talk about democracy, we do need to focus on engaging people and bringing them into the process and making sure that any barriers to engagement don’t exist, whether that’s for those who are seeking to run as candidates or for those who are wanting to vote.

That choice is given to every local municipality.", "The other changes proposed in the act, a lot of them, are quite complex, and to try to get agreement on all of these is going to be quite interesting, because I’m sure if you talked to the over 400 mayors and reeves across Ontario, you’re going to get so many different opinions and so many different variations.

I know people think there is a magical way of increasing voter turnout. The best way I see of increasing voter turnout is by interesting the electorate. If you’ve got boring campaigns, boring candidates, the electorate doesn’t come out to vote. Luckily, in Toronto over the last decade, we’ve had a lot of interesting engagement, and it’s very healthy in terms of seeing the turnout go up.

Many, many councillors in my riding and across the province ended up paying thousands of dollars—some in excess of $10,000—to go to the judge and basically say, “I didn’t know the provisions,” or “They weren’t explained to me.” And every time, the judge gave them their seat back.", "I went to ministers over and over and over again and said, “Why are the penalties so excessive for municipalities as opposed to, for example, provincial politicians?” I think it was my NDP candidate in the last two elections who didn’t file on the deadline, applied to the Chief Electoral Officer and was given an extension. Pretty easy, right? But in this case, previous to this section of the bill, that wasn’t possible. In fact, in my riding, one of the clerks had a death in the family, and in fact, every member of council and every candidate was disbarred from office. They all collectively had to go to the judge and make an application to get put back. Not at any time did anybody from the ministry or any minister make any opportunity to make those changes. I had meetings with each and every one of them and asked them specifically to fix that.", "Finally this section is fixed. I’m not particularly happy about the late filing fee of $500, even regardless of whether they can get it back.

She said, “The local voice does matter, but we are not prepared to give people a veto.” This government is all over the map.

  "text" : [ "It’s my pleasure to join in the debate. First off, I think it’s important that we address some of the concerns that have been raised in the previous municipal election, and this review resulted in some issues that were raised. Some of the key areas that people were concerned with were the way people were selecting their municipal leaders and the idea of a ranked ballot. There were some issues around the election calendar, and other key areas were some of the enforcement, which previous members have talked about; some of the imbalances with respect to the way the enforcement would apply to municipalities—they’re much more strict; and how provincially, the enforcement rules are far different.", "Some of the key areas that I want to touch on, and some of the key areas that I think are important to address—first and foremost, a ranked ballot option. I understand that this provides that option to municipalities. Now, we see all too often in elections, generally speaking, that the turnout is abysmally low. It’s a serious problem. We look at the Canadian system, and the highest turnouts are in our federal, and then with every other level of government it becomes lower and lower. When it comes to provincial, it’s lower than federal, and municipal elections are some of the lowest turnouts.", "The funny thing is, and I’m sure you hear this all the time, Mr. Speaker, is that it’s the municipal levels of government that probably have the most impact on our day-to-day lives, but that’s where we have the lowest turnout. Some of the concern is that perhaps the system, or the way that the election process goes about it, is disenfranchising or discouraging people from being involved.", "One of the solutions may be this ranked ballot system. It allows for a more interesting manner in which we select our leaders. But more important than allowing it in a more interesting manner, one of the things we see that we lack here in Ontario, specifically in Toronto, is that Toronto is probably one of the most diverse cities not only in Canada, but probably in the world, and despite that diversity, we don’t see that diversity reflected in the municipal leadership.", "What can we do to encourage the representation of more women, more racialized community members and people from different backgrounds? What can we do to make it more accessible? There is significant research and arguments are made that a ranked ballot system would make it easier to allow other individuals who are historically marginalized to be elected. Wherever there have been ranked ballot systems, more women have been elected and younger people are often elected, as well as more racialized members of the community are elected. That’s a positive thing. If we can encourage that, I think that’s something that should be supported. Allowing that opportunity or that option to municipalities is something that we should certainly look at, and I think that’s a positive step in the right direction.", "Generally speaking, though, we need to do more to make it easier to vote. I think that’s something that’s not really addressed in this bill that could have been addressed. I think, looking at this modern age—the 21st century, the digital age—we really need to look at how we can make it easier so that people can participate in the democratic system. It needs to be something that everyone is involved in. It needs to be something that is easy. We find that, whether it’s in health promotion, people will do what’s healthy if it’s the easier option. People will choose the easier option. If you make the healthy option the easier option—which is a strong campaign in the health promotion field—people will choose that healthier option. So in the democratic realm, if we make it easier to be involved in your civic responsibility of voting, if we make it more accessible, the idea would be that more people would be involved and more people would participate.", "That’s an area that this bill doesn’t address, and I think it’s something we should discuss here. Perhaps we can find ways to make some amendments in committee to ensure that—we can look at extending the hours. Many people work in the evening, and the cut-off being a strict 8 p.m. or 9 p.m. sometimes doesn’t allow for people to get home from work, to refresh and then get back out into the lineups and vote.", "We need to look at something that has been considered a number of times: Are there ways that we can find an online process, a digital process, where we can vote? I know the first response to that is always, “How do you prevent fraud? How do you prevent people from voting in an inappropriate manner?” I’m sure we can come up with some creative solutions, but to me, it just doesn’t make sense that we’re not making full use of the available technology to ensure that people vote; particularly, the accessibility issue for people who have different abilities, who aren’t able to get out there physically and go vote, for whatever physical limitations in terms of their mobility. We need to have a strong and easy system for people to make sure that they can get out and vote.", "Another area this bill talks about is third-party advertising. That’s something that has been addressed and raised in all levels of government, whether it’s federal or whether it’s provincial and, again, obviously, at the municipal level as well. As a broad principle, the way our current system is laid out, it should be the case that the everyday person—that their voice is not eclipsed by individuals or corporations who have more power or more access to resources, and that shouldn’t be a way of defining or a way of determining their ability to impact an election.", "In the current system, with the third-party advertising rules as they are, there is the potential for people, organizations, corporations or entities with deep pockets to be able to influence elections in perhaps a way that discourages the true principles of democracy. That’s something that people have raised as a concern. However, we also need to be very aware that, in addressing third-party advertising, we don’t unfairly impact community organizations, which are actually the voice of the community. They’re not an unfair representation of the voice of one small group, but in fact a representation of the entire community.", "There are groups like ACORN, which speaks on behalf of tenants. They have a campaign called Toronto Tenants Vote, which encourages tenants to vote. We often find in voting turnout that those who own their own property are more likely to vote, but people who are renting—those who are tenants in an apartment building—are less likely to. So ACORN mounted a campaign to encourage more people to actually get out and vote. The concern is that, with very strict third-party advertising limitations, perhaps a campaign which is to encourage people to vote might be limited by these types of rules. So we need to be sure that we’re addressing the actual concern, which is the disproportionate impact of an entity being able to have too much of a say or too much of a voice versus allowing community voices to be heard. In fact, a community organization which is actually trying to encourage more people to vote—that shouldn’t be stopped.", "There are other groups that do great work in our community that are by no means trying to usurp democracy or trying to overshadow the voice of the everyday person. Campaigns like the cancer society’s Fighting for Life campaign was something that was a demand that this organization had to encourage municipalities to disclose the use and location of carcinogens. Now, that’s a very fair demand and they’re trying to speak for the concerns of everyday folks and people about where carcinogens are located, where they’re being used and if municipalities are using them.", "That type of campaign or that type of organization might be limited by the proposed laws. I guess that’s something that we really need to focus in on. Are those the types of campaigns that we want to discourage? Is there a distinction between what we really want to limit when it comes to third-party advertising?", "Another example: There’s TTCriders. They do phenomenal work in our community with respect to promoting public transit. If during a campaign period they were to advertise the importance of public transit, that the community needs more public transit—as New Democrats, we fully support the idea that we need to aggressively invest in improving our public transit and infrastructure. If they were to mount a campaign to promote these issues during a political campaign, they might be precluded from doing so, though their whole organization is built up on membership of local community members. They are the voice of people in the public, in the community, and they’re simply voicing the concerns of their members. Now, if they’re precluded from being involved in voicing their concerns and the concerns of their members, again, are we really addressing the real concerns when it comes to third-party advertising? That’s another concern.", "To bring it closer to home on a specific issue, the sell-off of our Hydro One is an issue that impacts various community members. It’s something that’s going to impact our province, broadly speaking. Community organizations that come together to say, “This is something we need to oppose,” and perhaps there’s a campaign during an election period where they want to talk municipally about this issue and say, “Listen, this is something that should be brought up by our municipal leaders”—if various groups come together and band together on this issue, the concern is that they might be precluded from using a united platform to raise this issue and perhaps engage in town halls or engage in some form of organizing to get people together to say, “Listen, this public asset is being sold off. Let’s organize so that, at least on the municipal level, we can have a voice in our municipal level of government that opposes this.” Perhaps that organizing itself might be limited due to this proposed amendment of third-party advertising.", "That’s, again, why it’s so important for us to really home in on what it is that we really want to limit. We want to limit the unfair advantage that deep pockets or greater resources might have on your ability to have a louder voice in a democratic system than one individual or groups of individuals. That’s something that we really need to focus in on: Do we cast the net too broadly and cover organizations or community groups that are actually doing important work in expressing the concerns of the community, providing a platform for that? Are they going to be precluded because of these rules? That’s something we certainly need to take a look at.", "Mr. Speaker, I’m mindful of the time. I don’t want to go over and leave you in a position where you have to quickly stop me. I’ve noticed your indication; thank you very much for that.", "In wrapping up—I will have more time to address these issues in more detail later on—there are a number of very good changes that are proposed by this bill. There are more areas that need more clarity. I look forward, later on, to providing more details and perhaps some suggestions on how we can improve. Thank you." ],

Frank held that seat for four years, until 1999, when the riding boundaries changed to include a very different political climate in that riding.", "Frank had a reputation for being a community heavyweight. He’s remembered for his tireless work and how he championed his community and his constituents. His reputation for never being able to sit down, keep still or slow down is reflected in the countless number of causes he led and championed and many that he founded. Whether he was busy with chairing the Red Tape Commission in those days or co-founding the local Wayside House in his community, which was a transitional housing program for recovering drug addicts—just a couple of many initiatives that Frank undertook and helped lead for more than 40 years in the Niagara area. These are just a few of the testaments to his willingness to work hard and want to leave his community in better shape.", "In the lead-up to his political life, he was hoping to follow in his father’s footsteps to become a plumber and get involved in the plumbing business. That proved to be not in his cards, so he went on to the insurance business instead, founding a well-known insurance company, Sheehan and Rosie, which he ran successfully for more than 50 years.", "His motivations to enter politics really speak to the person. He said that he didn’t like the way things were and so he wanted to make a difference. His principles and his fearlessness on issues that were not always popular here and otherwise were nonetheless respected, if not always supported, even within his own caucus. It is often said that you knew exactly where he stood on any issue. He was blunt, frank—no pun intended—and honest, traits appreciated by many. It was never personal. He fundamentally believed in tackling issues and not people.", "The footprint Frank left behind in Niagara alone is a testament to that. When he wasn’t busy championing issues here at Queen’s Park for his constituents, he was busy helping at-risk youth and community members as the former president of the John Howard Society in Niagara. He left an invaluable mark on many programs and initiatives and, of course, the people who served in those programs. He dedicated much of his time to a program that’s still running in the Niagara region, the Out of the Cold program, an emergency program that provides warmth, a meal and fellowship in participating churches and public buildings.", "The Ozanam Centre of St. Catharines wouldn’t be the same without Frank’s leadership and time. The centre in St. Catharines opens its doors and serves more than 100 people a day with lunch and friendship. He also was very active in driving cancer patients to and from their treatments, from Niagara—just a few of the organizations that Frank was involved in that spoke to his nature, his community spirit and his caring values.", "In closing, I know that many of us, politicians included, often cringe at the thought of reading about ourselves in letters to the editor, or comments about us in local newspapers. But in reading some of the comments after Frank passed away, I thought they were important to share.", "One person commented after his passing that he was a “man whose word you could take to the bank! A missing feature in most other politicians today!” Another person’s comment: “My father passed away in June of 1995; his visitation was on June 8, the day of the election” that year. “During the evening visitation, when the elections results were starting to come in, Frank Sheehan quietly arrived at the funeral home to” pay respect and to “extend his sympathies to my mother.... I have never forgotten that moment.”", "In closing, although I only met Frank once or twice while he was in politics, it was a pleasure to do a little research, to discover his many qualities that I was not aware of and to have the honour of paying tribute to Frank Sheehan." ],

There are some people who will be forgettable, perhaps because they did not have huge impacts, one place or another. Frank was unforgettable; I can assure you of that.", "The very fact that Mike Harris, the former Premier of the province of Ontario, is here today is evidence of the very significant role that Frank played within the Common Sense Revolution that was part of the regime of Mike Harris when he governed the province from 1995 to 2003, with Ernie Eves as the Premier at that time.", "Frank was a guy who—even those people who disagreed with him really grew to like him very much. We used to sit at night from time to time, and I’d get an opportunity to go across the floor and chat with him about a number of things that related to St. Catharines, some of which didn’t relate to politics at all. You could see his deep love for and involvement in the community.", "Many people said he was a penny-pincher, and he was a penny-pincher, but a penny-pincher with taxpayers’ dollars. With his own dollars, he was extremely generous to the people of our community and well beyond our borders—generous not only with money but generous with his time and with his involvement in the community.", "You would expect that when the regime was in power at that time—they were a law-and-order group of people—Frank would be totally law and order, and those who had been convicted at some time or other would have been persona non grata. Frank actually took people like that under his wing. With youth, he tried to ensure that they would not become involved on the wrong side of the law. When he ran Wayside House, people would say, “Here’s a right-wing Conservative. What is he doing running Wayside House?” That was the feeling he had for people in the community who had gone astray in one way or another.", "At the John Howard Society, again an organization that dealt with people who were on the wrong side of the law from time to time, Frank wasn’t afraid to take that on as a personal cause. I remember that there were cuts made, so that Wayside House had to essentially close. To show his consistency—Frank was always consistent. He could have said, “Everything else should be cut, but not Wayside House.” He didn’t say that. His reaction at the time was to say, “If we are going in this direction, if we have to make cuts, then I can’t be exempted and my organization can’t be exempted from those cuts.” So he was very, very consistent in that regard.", "I think there were three nuns and two priests in the family. Frank would not fit into that category, I can assure you—either one. He was once asked why he got into politics. He said he was tired of the frigging NDP and the frigging Liberals. Somebody asked him about that later; he said, “I didn’t say ‘frigging.’”" ],

There was a long line of people. If you wanted to greet the family on the occasion to express your sympathy, you were in a long line at the funeral home, because that’s the impact he had across the community.", "I mentioned him being rough and tough. He was also head of the Niagara Symphony Association at one time. He helped out with Women’s Place, which is a shelter for abused women and members of their family. He had touched a lot of people in the community.", "It was a full house for the funeral and there were people from all kinds of backgrounds, some who no doubt had cursed Frank at one time or other, who were there to pay tribute to him because they knew he was consistent and that he was a man of immense principle, as far as I could see.", "By the way, you know how sometimes people try to develop a consensus on an issue? Consensus was not in the vocabulary of Frank Sheehan. He staked out his position and he defended that position with his heart and his soul and his mind.", "Most of the attributes that he had can be found in the members of the family, whether they are siblings or whether they are children. Frank set a tough standard for members of the family, and they lived up to it. We’re extremely grateful to the family for sharing Frank with us in the Legislative Assembly for a period of time.", "Members of the Legislature—there are lot of people who will sit on the sidelines and throw rocks at those who are in public office. I always admire a person who will put his or her views on the line and run for public office, and Frank did, for the Roman Catholic Separate School Board in Lincoln, and later for the Legislative Assembly. Then he took on a tough fight against another icon in the Niagara Peninsula by the name of Peter Kormos. He wasn’t afraid to take on that fight and he wasn’t afraid to lose, if he knew he was going to go down standing for something he believed in.", "I can speak for our community, and I think our Legislature, in saying that we were a better place in here and a better place in our community because of the generous contribution that Frank Sheehan made to St. Catharines and Niagara, to the province of Ontario and to our country." ],

  "text" : [ "Francis Xavier Sheehan was one of 10 kids in his family. As Mr. Bradley noted, the first three, the elder three sisters, were all literally sisters—they’re nuns—and two Basilian priests as brothers. So when Frank passed, he certainly had a lot of folks who could put a good word in for him to get through the Pearly Gates.", "But I think Frank made it on his own, so I’m going to tell you a little bit about why I can say that. Believe it or not, Frank actually did follow the family tradition and enrolled in seminary. He was there for six months. It didn’t take. There was a little too much mischief, I think, in those eyes, to all those who knew Frank, for it to last. Eldest son Gordon said, “Thank God it didn’t,” or the gallery would be less full today.", "Frank had an extraordinarily big heart. He came back from seminary and he was trying to figure out what to do with the rest of his life and, as was mentioned by my colleague from Niagara Centre, he went to work for his dad in the Sheehan Plumbing and Heating business in St. Catharines. I didn’t know Frank’s dad, but I’m going to guess they were quite similar, because Gordon related a conversation to me where Frank came on board and it just didn’t take, it didn’t work out so much in the business. So his dad said to him one day, “You know, Francis, you’ve got a big mouth.” Francis replied, “Well, you paid enough for it.” Then dad said, “I don’t think this is working out.” Frank said, “Me, neither,” and he up and quit. A little while later his dad said, “Frank, what do you want to do with the rest of your life?” Frank said, “I don’t know.” So he said, “Why don’t you go and join your uncle?” Uncle Hubert had just taken over the family insurance business, Sheehan Insurance. Frank said, “I don’t know anything about insurance.” His dad said, “Neither does Hubert, so why don’t you go ahead?” And that took.", "Frank was a legend in the insurance business. He built up Sheehan and Rosie. He was extraordinarily generous, through the company and through himself. He took a leadership position provincially—I think nationally, if memory serves—with the insurance brokers as well, and then found his way here in 1995 in the cast of 82 characters we called the government, in June 1995.", "Premier Mike Harris is here today. It’s no surprise to see the Premier here, because he said he looked at his entire team, and the one person in his caucus who had the principles and the backbone to be his leader of the Red Tape Commission, by and far—easy call—was Frank Sheehan. He made the right call.", "I’ll tell you a quick story. In cabinet one day—and Frank was there. To Premier Harris’s credit, the head of the Red Tape Commission was at those cabinet meetings. One veteran minister—not present company; no longer here in the assembly—was bringing through a new bill. The bill had all kinds of new rules and regulations in it. Frank took them on, right there at the cabinet table, and said, “This has got to go through” what he called “a regulatory knothole.” That was his term.", "The minister got frustrated. “Who is this? He’s not a minister. What’s he doing at the table? I can get what I want.” The minister actually said, “We’re just getting rid of red tape and doing blue tape instead.” Premier Harris said, “That’s exactly the point,” and Frank got his way.", "Then, as cabinet, we knew what the ballgame was. We took Frank seriously, the committee work that he did. You had to get his blessing to get a bill through. Then, after all those years, he kicked down 2,100 unnecessary government regulations. Fifteen red-tape bills actually passed here in the assembly.", "An interesting thing about Frank, too—because he was not a big-government guy—he had tremendous respect for the civil service.", "He actually compared reducing red tape to teaching elephants to dance. He said, “It’s really hard, but when you get it done, it’s an awesome spectacle.”", "Frank got it done. I spoke with Bill Mantel, a current ADM, who was one of the key people on the Red Tape Commission and a respected civil servant. I said, “Bill, why did this work?” He said, “Because of two reasons: Frank didn’t suffer fools. He wouldn’t take no for an answer.”", "He made progress. If a minister was not following the line that Premier Harris laid out, Frank would end the meeting and walk out on the minister. That sends a signal pretty fast. It also gave ministries an opportunity to actually get stuff done that otherwise they wouldn’t. There was tremendous respect for what Frank did and for his leadership, not only on the political level but throughout the civil service.", "One story I’ll quickly tell: Frank and I also had a huge fight. I probably would have lost that fight, because it’s hard to think of another more determined, focused and driven individual I’ve had the honour of serving with here in the assembly. It was because our ridings came together in 1999. Here I was, coming from Erie; Frank was Lincoln. The two ridings merged. A lot of MPPs fought. I said, “Holy crow, now I’ve got to take on Frank Sheehan. How’s that going to work out for me, as a rookie MPP?”", "Frank took me aside and put his arm around me. This conversation was probably in early 1999. He called me Timmy, like he was my football coach or something. He said, “Timmy, you’ve got a bright future in this business. I’m not going to run in Erie–Lincoln. And besides that, somebody’s got to take on that socialist in cowboy boots next door.” Frank took him on, and I think he gave Kormos a scare too, which is, I think, an incredible thing. Maybe that debate continues somewhere else today.", "My colleagues talked about how Frank had a reputation for being gruff, tough-minded and determined, but they also talked, accurately, about how he had a big heart, in some personal stories.", "There’s a theme, too, that you pick up of the prodigal son, if you will, in Frank’s good deeds. Wayside House helps recovering drug addicts get back on the straight and narrow. He was a big leader in the John Howard Society, helping people who had been in prison to get back on the right path.", "Robert Land Academy is here today as well. I’m honoured to serve on their board. This is for young boys who have wandered away, to help bring them back. Frank was a regular guest there. In fact, headmaster Scott Bowman told me, “Frank would often tell the cadets some rather salty stories, but they loved it.” When the headmaster tried to censor Frank and look at his remarks beforehand, Frank Sheehan never listened. They loved him at the Robert Land Academy. He was a guide for them, for a man of principle and the success he can have.", "At the end of the day too, I think what was remarkable was—Jim mentioned his funeral—there were people there from all walks of life, all political parties. There was a wake, with lots of dignitaries there at the same time. It’s because we always have this image of the politician who is a generous and public person but a miser with their own. Frank was the absolute opposite of that. He was that way not because he thought government was bad. He just believed that a lot of people didn’t have much money left in their pockets after a lot was taken away. But he also had a big faith in humanity because Frank believed, too, that if more people had money in their pockets they would give generously, just like he did. He was, at his heart, an optimist and loved people.", "A lot of folks wondered who among all of these dignitaries was going to make the big speech at the wake after the funeral. Gord decided Frank wouldn’t want that. In Frank’s life he always said that the good deeds speak for themselves; you don’t wear them on your sleeve. That’s exactly the most important lesson of what Frank Sheehan has taught us. Thanks for those good deeds. God bless. Thank you." ],

After constructing a boat and successfully practising on a placid pond in Ashburn, where Gerry and Ross both lived, the actual event in the harbour was anything but placid. The twosome did not fare so well when confronted with winds and high waves in the bay of Whitby harbour. Their boat turned into a submarine very quickly that day.", "Ross Batten was truly a kind and decent man.

Since the global recession of 2009, we have remained firm in our commitment to improve the provincial economy and to protect the public services that many Ontarians rely on.", "In the 2015 budget, we established the four pillars that guide us on our journey to balance budgets. This four-part plan rests on (1) investing in people’s talents and skills; (2) investment in public infrastructure; (3) creating the conditions to support innovative, high-growth, export-oriented businesses; and (4) building a secure retirement savings plan.", "In the 2016 budget, we continue to implement our plan. We’ve created a climate for business and investment that is one of the most competitive in North America by keeping our taxes competitive, by cutting the marginal effective tax rate on new business investment in half and by eliminating regulatory red tape.", "These measures are working. Since 2009, our businesses and entrepreneurs have helped create more than 600,000 net new jobs. The vast majority of these jobs are full-time and in industries that pay above-average wages.", "For the last two years, we’ve attracted more foreign direct investment than any other Canadian province or US state. Those investments have also created jobs for Ontarians, and Ontario is getting ready to create an additional 320,000 more jobs by the end of 2019. That would bring Ontario’s total job creation to more than 900,000 in just 10 years.", "We know from experience, however, that the global economy can turn very quickly. Right now, the economic uncertainty outside of Ontario is providing favourable conditions for Ontario. A low dollar, low oil prices and steady US demand all favour Ontario exports. But we can’t simply stand idle and hope these conditions will continue to favour Ontario. We must make our own future.", "The Jobs for Today and Tomorrow Act (Budget Measures), 2016, is a part of our plan to do just that—a plan devised after consultations with the people of Ontario, who let us know what was most important to them—their values and their priorities. Over eight weeks, 1,732 ideas were shared; 53,402 votes were cast; 4,340 comments were made. We thank Ontarians for their input.", "I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the members of the Standing Committee on Finance and Economic Affairs for their input on this important bill as well.", "The Jobs for Today and Tomorrow Act (Budget Measures), 2016, is part of our plan to grow the economy and create jobs right across Ontario; to help us invest in infrastructure and in a low-carbon economy, driven by innovative, high-growth, export-oriented businesses; to invest in people’s talent and skills, expanding access to high-quality college and university education; to help more people get and create the jobs of the future; to help more Ontarians achieve a more secure retirement; and, of course, to balance the budget by 2017-18 and again in 2018-19.", "Mr. Speaker, I would like to call on my colleague the all-wonderful, extraordinaire parliamentary assistant, Laura Albanese, to speak on some of the specific details that are proposed in this bill.", "Over to you, Laura." ],

  "text" : [ "Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Let me begin by thanking Minister Sousa for his introduction and for allowing me to expand on some of the aspects of Bill 173, the Jobs for Today and Tomorrow Act (Budget Measures), 2016.", "Broadly speaking, this bill contains a number of new items, as well as a number of amendments to existing legislation that are aimed at supporting our plan to balance the budget in 2017-18. We will do these while we continue to invest in key public services that Ontario families rely on.", "For instance, we are taking steps to make post-secondary education more affordable to students. This is why Bill 173 contains measures based on recommendations from a number of stakeholders, including student groups and the Commission on the Reform of Ontario’s Public Services.", "Broadly speaking, this government is proposing a redesigned student financial assistance program that would make it easier for students and their families to understand the program and to access the funds. In short, the new Ontario Student Grant provides tuition upfront in order to reduce the sticker shock that causes students to shy away from even applying to college or post-secondary education. This simplified system would include one single upfront grant for the Ontario Student Assistance Program, the Ontario Student Grant, starting in the 2017-18 school year. The OSG would replace a number of existing grants, including the 30% Off Ontario Tuition Grant, the Ontario Student Opportunity Grant and the Ontario Access Grant. Bill 173 includes measures to discontinue the tuition and education tax credits. The additional tax revenue from discontinuing the credits would be reinvested to support the new OSG or other post-secondary, education, training and youth job programs.", "Our government wants to ensure that when people start a business in Ontario, they know that they will have access to highly skilled and talented workers. This is an advantage in the global knowledge economy.", "Our government is also committed to establishing clear and consistent rules to protect Ontario consumers and drivers. With Bill 173, the government proposes amending the Insurance Act to allow for regulations to be made to help ensure that consumers are provided with complete information about the automobile insurance claims repair history of used vehicles. This is a proactive change to ensure that consumers continue to be properly protected in the future.", "There is another area where added protection will be implemented. Bill 173 proposes a number of changes to the Ontario Securities Act. As outlined in the 2016 Ontario budget, the proposed changes to the Securities Act would strengthen enforcement provisions, create additional tools to provide protection for whistle-blowers, update the Securities Act to allow information obtained in investigations to be used in a broader array of proceedings under the Securities Act, and provide that certain rules relating to the publication of derivatives trades would not apply to the crown and certain crown agencies.", "As you know, Mr. Speaker, the financial services sector is a major, direct source of growth in our province. It is a sector that accounts for almost 10% of Ontario’s GDP. It provides about 390,000 jobs, with wages averaging over 25% above the overall Ontario wage average. It is also a key enabler of growth in other sectors and the economy as a whole, supporting investment and savings, access to capital and wealth creation.", "The government supports the growth of financial services by investing in skills, education and modern infrastructure, and by establishing a competitive tax system and an efficient provincial regulatory climate. The changes contained in Bill 173 would update securities laws and continue to strengthen the financial services sector, protecting consumers and investors and bolstering the stability and efficiency of financial markets.", "Bill 173 also proposes changes to tax credits. Over the last year, the research and development tax credits were reviewed as part of the Program Review, Renewal and Transformation—PRRT—process to ensure they are efficient, effective and sustainable. As part of the PRRT process, the government proposes to reduce the level of support provided through the Ontario Research and Development Tax Credit and the Ontario Innovation Tax Credit.", "In Bill 173, the government proposes the following changes, effective for eligible R&D expenditures incurred in the taxation years that end on or after June 1, 2016: decreasing the Ontario Research and Development Tax Credit rate from 4.5% to 3.5%; and decreasing the Ontario Innovation Tax Credit rate from 10% to 8%. The rate reductions would be pro-rated for taxation years straddling June 1, 2016. The proposed R&D tax credit rate reductions are estimated to save the province approximately $35 million in 2016-17, $65 million in the following year and $65 million in 2018-19.", "But research and development remains a key priority for the government, which is why the province will reinvest savings from the proposed tax credit changes into new targeted investments across key sectors of Ontario’s economy. The government is investing, for example, $35 million over five years towards establishing the advanced manufacturing consortium, $20 million over three years to partner with colleges to tackle industry challenges through innovation projects, and $50 million over five years in world-leading research at the Perimeter Institute. The province will continue to examine ways to encourage R&D investments in Ontario, increase the commercialization of research, and better support export activity, in line with its business growth initiatives.", "Bill 173 also contains proposed amendments to the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation and Public Protection Act, 1996. These amendments would increase the tax rate of wines made of a blend of Ontario and imported wine content that are sold at winery retail stores. Implemented over the next four years, the increases to the basic tax for blended wine would help close the gap between the markups applied to products sold at the LCBO and taxes in the winery retail store network. This will increase government revenues to support key priorities such as health care, education and skills training, and infrastructure and transit investments, all of which benefit Ontarians.", "It is important to note that the current tax rate on 100% Ontario and VQA wine will be maintained. This is consistent with Ontario’s wine and grape strategy.", "Bill 173 would also improve the way benefits are distributed to Ontario residents. As part of a broader transformation of services to the public, the government is proposing to improve the way certain benefit programs are delivered, making it easier for lower-income Ontarians to access benefits. The province provides a wide range of direct and in-kind benefits across a spectrum of needs, including health, dental, housing and child care. To improve access, the government is exploring initiatives that include online applications for multiple benefit programs and increased automation of back-office functions.", "Mr. Speaker, you will recall that in 2015 the government initiated a review of the Business Property Tax Capping Program, in response to requests from municipal and business stakeholders to address the potential for inequities and economic distortions. As a result of previous enhancements, the proportion of business properties captured by the program has decreased from about 90% in 2004 to approximately 10% in 2015. Based on this review, the government announced significant enhancements to the Business Property Tax Capping Program in the 2015 Ontario Economic Outlook And Fiscal Review.", "The Jobs for Today and Tomorrow Act (Budget Measures), 2016, would transform the Business Property Tax Capping Program. Beginning in 2016, municipalities would have increased flexibility to accelerate progress to current value assessment level taxes. In addition, municipalities that meet certain eligibility criteria established by the province would have the option to exit or phase out the program, if doing so would have a limited impact on business properties. As a result of these enhancements, municipalities would be able to adjust the capping program to best suit their local circumstances and improve the equity and transparency of the property tax system.", "Bill 173 is also taking action on strengthening the Municipal Property Assessment Corp. The Ministry of Finance will be consulting on potential further changes to MPAC’s governance structure. This will help the corporation to support its objective of remaining accountable to stakeholders, while maintaining excellence in assessment service delivery.", "A collaborative approach to consulting with municipalities and stakeholders has been key to implementing improvements to the property assessment system. The ministry intends to continue this collaborative approach and is working with MPAC to engage the Association of Municipalities of Ontario and the city of Toronto to better understand issues and opportunities for improvement related to MPAC board governance.", "Pension reform is also an important issue for many Ontarians. Pooled registered pension plans, or PRPPs, are a new type of voluntary, tax-assisted individual retirement savings vehicle. PRPPs are administered by licensed third-party administrators, such as regulated financial institutions, with investments pooled to reduce costs and improve returns. The 2016 budget announced that amendments to the act would be introduced to further facilitate harmonization with other jurisdictions and ensure the efficient operation of PRPPs.", "A PRPP framework that is harmonized with other jurisdictions would help create economies of scale and minimize costs. It would also foster a greater portability, supporting a modern, mobile workforce. As the government moves forward with the implementation of PRPPs, it will continue to work with other jurisdictions in an effort to promote harmonization." ],

So I urge all those in attendance today to vote in the future for the Jobs for Today and Tomorrow Act (Budget Measures), 2016.

  "text" : [ "I appreciate the opportunity to speak to Bill 173.", "I want to begin by talking from the beginning, when we had pre-budget consultations. This was before Bill 173 was brought to this Legislature. Myself, our PC member Toby Barrett, the NDP and the Liberal Party all took a pre-budget consultation tour throughout Ontario. We began in Hamilton, Windsor, Thunder Bay, Sault Ste. Marie, Ottawa. Many MPPs—in fact, some of those who are sitting here—joined us across the province at these pre-budget consultations. We held two days in Toronto here.", "It was very disturbing to learn that the budget was going to be presented while we were still making pre-budget consultations. Then, of course, as time went on, we actually learned the budget was in translations while we were still meeting with people, never mind the fact that this Legislature spent $100,000 or whatever the number was to fly all of us, Hansard recorders, translators, Clerks, all of this group all over the province to have pre-budget consultations, only to learn that the translations were being done while we were still meeting with all these people who themselves travelled all over Ontario to be heard. They wanted to be heard. They wanted to talk to the government pre-budget. That means before the budget. To learn that, I think, was insulting not only to all three parties, to the nine members and all of the staff that accompanied us, but also to the people who travelled so far, especially in northern Ontario, to the communities that are so far away. I found that to be insulting, and I find that the entire pre-budget consultation was nothing more than a charade, a sham, and more evidence that, while Premier Wynne talks a big game about openness and transparency, there’s nothing like that in reality. That is just absolutely known to be untrue now.", "Speaker, I want to talk about where we were at estimates this morning. We had the Minister of Finance at estimates this morning. We were in a room, and I looked around as I opened the discussion and said, “I remember this room very, very well.” I spent almost two years of my life in that room on the gas plant scandal hearings. I bring this up because of the documentation we obtained that has a lot to do with what we are talking about here today.", "I stood in that room and said to the minister, “My gosh, this room brings back a lot of memories.” Certainly, when the government told us that cancellation of the gas plants was going be $40 million and the Auditor General told us $1.1 billion, we knew then what to expect from this government with respect to any numbers they’d give us, Speaker. They don’t know how to give numbers correctly, either by choice or by chance. They choose not to give us the right numbers. We’ve seen that; that’s evident now.", "What we also got at those gas plant scandal hearings was a series of documents that had a lot to do with finance, and that was because they were compelled to turn over tens upon tens of thousands of documents, which they eventually turned over. One of the documents is a confidential Ministry of Finance document from March 2013.", "Speaker, it was confidential; it was meant for cabinet only. It was never, ever expected that any human outside of cabinet would see it. This came from ministry staff, so I trust this document, because nobody was ever supposed to see it, so they were telling it like it is. The document says, “For 2014-15 and 2015-16”—they’re speaking about the government—“not on track to meet the ... budget deficit targets.” That’s the truth. They are not on target.", "What happens only days later? The Minister of Finance stands in here and presents a budget. In fact, in the 2013 budget, on page 103, he stood here and said, “The government is on track to eliminate the deficit.... ” Speaker, their own document only days before, which they read, told them that they are not, and yet they stand here and tell us a completely different story. They told us that they were on track.", "That opens the door. Now they’ve got to go back and figure out, “What the heck are we going to do? We just told the public something about which we know the complete opposite is accurate.” So they hatched a plan. The nicest way I can say it is that they hatched a plan. The plan was to sell assets and use that money to lower the deficit. That’s the plan they hatched.", "Let me take a short while and talk to you about how that went together and the moves the government made so that people would never really figure out this plan that they hatched. It was so diverse. There were so many different pieces of the puzzle that would normally be unrelated, but if you put these pieces together, you see the picture very, very clearly. They hatched a plan, and it took a year to implement this plan.", "It starts when the Premier stood under a big banner that said, “Beer in grocery stores.” I was there. I snapped a photo of it. It’s this massive 40-foot-or-so banner. I don’t know how high; it must be at least 15 feet or 20 feet high: “Beer in grocery stores.” There are other ministers huddled around her—by the way, this beer in grocery stores was going to be the most dramatic thing we have done to alcohol since Prohibition. Actually, it turned out that they’re going to sell a six-pack in a corner store. That was the most radical thing they could come up with. “Oh, and by the way, while we’re at it, we’re going to sell Hydro One.”", "They kind of slipped in the Hydro One sale back then. It was never in Ed Clark’s original report. Ed Clark said, “We’re not going to sell Hydro; we’re going to enhance it and get better value out of it. We’re going to work hard and make improvements.” And they said, “No, no, no. Get back to the drawing board, Ed, and rewrite the plan.” He came back five months later and said, “Yes, we’re going to sell Hydro.”", "Speaker, you have to look back before that happened. The government announced a $130-billion infrastructure program. They announced it in the 2014 budget. In that budget, they said, “We’re going to need some asset sales,” but they talked very explicitly about what they were. They said that they were going to get $3.1 billion over four years, and $1.1 billion alone came from the GM shares that they sold and got back. So that’s the bulk of it, the GM shares. Over the next three years, they were going to sell the LCBO headquarters, the OPG headquarters across the street and a couple of other real estate assets they were talking about, which altogether brought in $2 billion over three years. We understood that. We don’t necessarily agree with it, but we understood it: In 2014, they were going to need $3.1 billion, including the GM shares, to help pay for that infrastructure.", "But here we are, a year later now, in 2015: They made a grandiose announcement about the sale of Hydro, and they’ve said that that money is going to transit and infrastructure and is not for nothing else—but we’ll get to that in a minute, Speaker. All of a sudden now, infrastructure is re-announced in the 2015 budget. It’s absolutely identical. It’s $130 billion, just the same as 2014, but now they need a $9-billion fire sale of Hydro One to make that work. Speaker, that doesn’t make any sense. If they had already budgeted the $130 billion with only a small amount of assets, why do they now need the Hydro One sale tied into that? It never made any sense then; it doesn’t make any sense now.", "It was clear, at that point, that it appeared that they were going to take the money from Hydro One and use it to balance their budget, to artificially balance their budget. In fact, very astutely, right away—right after that happened—the Ottawa Citizen had an article, and I’ll read you just the one paragraph of two sentences here:", "“A reasonable person might wonder why we need to sell most of a significant public asset ... just to keep doing what we have been doing for years. The real answer, I suspect, is that putting some billions of new money into the province’s transit trust will enable the government to quietly shift existing money to help it reduce the deficit or pay for other spending.”", "Bingo. He hit the nail on the head. This is now more than a year ago that the Ottawa Citizen figured that out.", "Now we need to compile the evidence that that is indeed what was happening. What has happened from there is that the government said, “No, no, no. Hang on a second. That’s not what we’re doing. We’re putting the money in a Trillium Trust. That’s where the money is going.” Well, if you look at the Trillium Trust, Speaker, it says they “may” put a “portion” of the money in the Trillium Trust. We brought amendments last year, if you remember correctly, that said, “No, no, no. Change the word ‘may’ to ‘must’ and the word ‘portion’ to ‘all.’ You must put all the money.” The government voted it down. They would have no part of that, no part of it at all. That’s why, to this very day, it still says they may put a portion in the Trillium Trust.", "So we brought another amendment that said, “After the sale of every significant asset, the Auditor General will report to this Legislature within 90 days what was sold, how much it was sold for and where the money went.” That’s pretty basic. That’s pretty open and transparent; no trickery there. This is just pretty easy stuff that we asked for in the amendment. It got voted down. That is what’s happening. I call it covering their tracks. They wanted to make sure that there’s no way to really, truly find out what was happening.", "Then what they need to do now is shield everybody from ever having any knowledge of what’s going on. So they go in and they shut out the legislative officers. The Auditor General now can’t look into Hydro One. The Financial Accountability Officer can’t look into Hydro One. Freedom of information, the Ombudsman, the sunshine list—all eight officers of the Legislature wrote a scathing letter to the Premier saying, “How dare you cut us out from the information.” So that was part of their plan, I call it, to cover their tracks and to make sure that we don’t ever know what was really going on.", "In fact, the Auditor General ended her budget committee hearings by saying that their value-for-money audit of the smart metering initiative and two of their value-for-money audits under way—electricity power system planning and electricity transmission and distribution—“are examples of work that we would not be permitted to do once the proposed amendments take effect.” The government said, “Too bad. You are not getting to look at the books ever again.” They cut everybody out. The Financial Accountability Officer had a lot to say because he was allowed to have six months’ leeway. Boy, did he ever take great advantage of his time.", "The next stage that came out was the prospectus. It told a little bit more of the details. That is when we learned that in the prospectus—first of all, as soon as the prospectus was filed, Moody’s downgraded Hydro One debt from A1 to A2. That was an immediate response by the bond rating agencies over this particular deal.", "One of the things that was in the prospectus was also the fact that they were going to shell out several million dollars to the Hydro One staff as well as the OPG staff. It was $87 million. They were going to receive shares to the value of $87 million: $75 million to the Power Workers’ Union and $12 million to the Society of Energy Professionals. That was part of the deal.", "The Financial Accountability Officer then couldn’t take any more. The brand new Financial Accountability Officer, on his own initiative, decided to write a report on the sale of Hydro One. It was called An Assessment of the Financial Impact of the Partial Sale of Hydro One. This was his first-ever report. He said, “The initial 15% sale of Hydro One would significantly reduce the province’s deficit in 2015-16.” He figured it out. It didn’t take him very long; it took him probably about two minutes to figure out that these guys were going to be using the Hydro One money to lower the deficit. That was the opening sentence in his summary in the report.", "He went on to say, “In years following the sale of 60% of Hydro One, the province’s budget balance would be worse than it would have been without the sale.” He concludes the report by saying, “The province’s net debt would initially be reduced, but will eventually be higher than it would have been without the sale.” So he has told the Legislature, “Hey, we’re on to you. We figured you out. You’re selling Hydro One and you’re using that money to lower the deficit.” But they won’t come clean with it. They still, to this day, continue to say, “No, no. Hang on a second. That money is being used for transit and infrastructure.” They’re sticking to their story. Well, the story is fine until the plan gets exposed, and the plan gets exposed when the fall economic statement comes out.", "First of all, it starts to break apart with public accounts. The budget looks forward and tells you stories that they hope happen. It’s aspirational. Public accounts looks backwards and tells you what really happened. So we started to see the story fall apart in public accounts. But it really crumbled when they had to come clean in the fall economic statement.", "In the fall economic statement, there’s a chart. Page 106, page 107, page 99, page 98: All of these pages allude to the fact that the money has gone right into general revenue. They took over $1 billion and put it directly into general revenue. They did not put it into transit; they did not put it into infrastructure. They put it into general revenue, plain and simple. It’s in the budget. It’s in the fall economic statement. It’s printed there, flat out.", "“How could they do that?” you would wonder. “Hey, I thought they were supposed to put it in transit.” They continue to say that.", "How they got around that—and that’s what I mean; it was a workaround. Again, all of these little pieces that are unconnected and disconnected, eventually, when they’re all out there and we expose each one of them one by one, it makes sense.", "So one day, out of the clear blue sky, they showed up with this Bill 144, a finance bill. It’s like a mini budget. It showed up one day and, 14 days later, they had stopped all debates, had quick committee hearings, had quick clause-by-clause, had a quick vote—boom. Only 14 days: That’s about 10 working days, and it was all over. This was a mini budget. It was an omnibus bill, as many of us called it. It went from tobacco to horse racing and everything. But all of that was all gibberish, meant to cover up one sentence. One sentence in that bill unlocked the value of Hydro and allowed them to use it.", "Let me tell you, it’s a 167-page book. On page 162, there’s one sentence in schedule 22, the Trillium Trust Act, about authorized expenditures—what they can spend the Trillium Trust on. It says:", "“The Trillium Trust may be paid out of the consolidated revenue fund for the following purposes:", "“1. To fund, directly or indirectly, costs relating to the construction or acquisition of infrastructure.”", "Okay. They said that they’re going to use it to pay for infrastructure. All right, so here it is: It says that they have to take that money out and use it for infrastructure. But Speaker, paragraph 2: One little line says that they can “reimburse the crown for expenditures incurred by the crown, directly or indirectly, for a purpose described in paragraph 1.”", "They can reimburse themselves for money they’ve already spent or budgeted for. It has been laid bare by their own hand. They printed it because they had to give themselves the out to be able to get that money, put in the trust and use it to pay for things they’ve already announced. This money from Hydro One will now definitively be used to pay for the $130 billion in infrastructure that they already announced.", "It’s now laid bare. The Financial Accountability Officer has acknowledged that. All of the experts—the Bank of Montreal, all of the capital market groups—are saying loudly and clearly that this is a payment for monies already spent.", "Speaker, there’s nothing more for me to add, other than exposing that." ],

Therefore, we have a flawed budget.", "This morning at estimates, it was really quite a very emotional exchange, because I think the finance minister had expected a lot of praise for this budget. With every layer that we pull back on it, we find flaws contained within it. That’s why I go back to the process part.", "In the past few weeks, we have had opportunities to discuss this budget, which the government honestly has the hubris to call Jobs for Today and Tomorrow. As I said, we have given some good reasons and corresponding evidence to address why this budget misses the mark on job creation and on social infrastructure.", "What is quite amazing to me is that this government has the gall to brag and to boast about the low program spending in the province of Ontario to some audiences and then they move to other audiences and change their tune.", "But before I continue, I think it’s important to remind this House today about the tradition of how a budget is crafted, because budgets are supposed to be moral documents. They’re supposed to speak to the values of the people of the province. They’re supposed to be developed with the people of the province in mind. The tradition of this place is that the finance committee travels around the province and listens. It puts the call out to people across this province to listen to them—actively listen to them—and make a promise to them that they are going to take what they hear, take what they learn, and inform the budget bill.", "That did not happen, Mr. Speaker, for the 2016 budget. The first deputations happened in mid-January, and the last one on February 2. The committee normally writes a report based on these findings in order to reflect what the people of this province want most to see in the government’s budget—like child care funding, which is not here; like housing funding and developmental services, which are not here—and that information that we hear informs the budget.", "This government was happy—happy, and quite defensive of the process—to completely circumvent the process that they claim to value. It was such a serious departure from the parliamentary tradition of this place. So I share the concern of the PC critic in this regard that this promise of accountability and transparency and open government from this activist centre is a complete farce. It reminds me of that fairy tale, The Emperor’s New Clothes, because now there’s no charade. What we see before us is a government that is happy—that is even content—to circumvent the democratic process on which this Legislature has depended for so many years.", "The budget itself was tabled on February 25, which already at the time showed a blatant disregard for the process of pre-budget consultations. Our committee hadn’t even tabled the report on these consultations. It’s this report that supposedly informs the budget. Just so that people understand, we just got this pre-budget consultation report, like, 10 days ago. It is dated April 2016. It is April 2016 today, and we are debating for a time-allocated debate on budget 2016. The ruse is up, Mr. Speaker.", "Since then, we’ve learned more about how the budget process unfolded, just to add insult to injury. This government had the budget—a completed budget document—sent for translation on January 27. You can’t deny that the budget process was flawed. I hope that this government learns from this. But it’s important to acknowledge that they didn’t just ignore the standard process of the committee; they also felt like they could have a budget written before even hearing from everyone. This is the new selective inclusion in the province of Ontario, and it’s no wonder that this Liberal budget is so misguided.", "I wanted to share a little bit around the committee process because the finance committee has to go through this budget clause-by-clause, as you know, and we have to go through the entire document. It’s important for people to hear how that process went for the opposition parties.", "In the 2007 election, the Liberals promised that the government would review all Ontario laws for accessibility barriers.

New Democrats have heard from Ontarians with disabilities, and they have said that they were not meaningfully consulted in the drafting of this budget bill, which comes as no shock given that the budget was written before the pre-budget consultations even happened. This is an example of voices being missed.", "Whether or not it happens in consultations, it is still important that this government recognizes the lived experiences of Ontarians with disabilities. This should inform what barriers exist and how they can be eliminated. With that in mind, New Democrats proposed 13 amendments to this budget bill, including making the AODA act more accessible. This government decided not to embrace those amendments. In fact, they voted against all 13 of the amendments to make the budget bill more accessible.", "One example of that is that—and it was so small. That’s what surprised us so much, genuinely so. Sometimes you get in these situations, and there are good people on that side of the House and there are good people on this side of the House, and sometimes you think you can make some progress. We thought we had an opportunity to fight for the rights of those who have disabilities in the province of Ontario. But listen to this: All of the amendments had to do with a minimum—it would require that documents be in a format that can be read by a screen text reader or changed so that it can be read by a screen text reader. This means that anything that comes from this place—any legislation, any directives—be in a format where someone who is visually impaired could actually read it on their computer. It’s a small, small thing. Each time, the government side voted this down. I was told time and time again by the members of this government on the committee that this was a good initiative and they agree with the policy, which made me feel so much better. It’s a simple change that can make a world of difference to people living with visual impairments. Members of this government said they agree fully with the intent of this policy amendment, but time and time again they voted it down.", "Once again, in the standard process of seeing this budget through, it has become obvious that the government doesn’t understand what priorities make sense. Certainly, making a budget bill and making legislation and making this place more accessible is in the best interests of Ontarians. Surely we can agree on that.", "One of the major things that we did here, across this province, throughout budget consultations had to do with child care. There were so many ways where we could see this government has ignored the needs of Ontarians in this budget. To begin with, the budget promises no new money for affordable child care. It’s incredible. In fact, the regulations that are currently on the books actually demand more of the child care sector, that they do more with less, which includes having a 12-month-old baby in with toddlers. They see these little units as being very similar, when they are very different.", "This is what we know—because do you know what? It’s 2016. Investing in child care is a complete no-brainer. It helps the thousands of Ontario families whose children are on waiting lists to access quality care. There are 16,802 families in Toronto alone on a wait-list, and this government decided not to invest any new money in this budget. If you want to make a difference in the lives of women, if you want to make a difference from an economic perspective, this is where the evidence says you invest, Mr. Speaker. But beyond that, by investing in child care, this government could be putting money to good use in closing the gender wage gap. I think it’s next Tuesday when we hit that point where women have been working for nothing until that point and we actually start making—there’s gender pay parity next Tuesday. If you want to make a difference to women in the province of Ontario, you invest in child care.", "We’ve heard lots of rhetoric from this Premier on child care over the years. The reality today is that it’s women more often than men who take on the main responsibilities of child care, both at a professional level and in the home. Money spent on early childhood education is just a smart investment. One study in Ontario found that every public dollar spent here on child care generates an economic output of more than $2.27. That’s a better return on investment than selling off Hydro One, Mr. Speaker. There’s so much I can say on that.", "We simply cannot afford to keep ignoring child care in Ontario, but we see it happening with this budget. Even the Toronto Star said that Ontario’s budget leaves Ontario’s poorest children behind. This is an editorial from February 29. They point out that there’s no money for affordable child care. They point out that there was no money for Ontario’s 47 children’s aid societies. We’re still waiting for that database. You remember the one, Mr. Speaker, that’s actually going to help us track vulnerable children across the province, the one that this government has kept pushing back year after year after year. This contract that this government keeps giving these companies to not perform the work that they were asked to do—come in over budget, not on time; more importantly, leave vulnerable children in the lurch. It really does shock us year after year that the funding issue around that contract continues to be pushed back.", "There was a miserable 1.5% increase in social assistance rates. There’s this promise out there that this government is going stop clawing back the $40—the child support payments that come into those families. It’s really incredible, when you think about it, that this government can’t collect on the road maintenance fees and fines that they themselves have doled out through the Ministry of Transportation, to the tune of $49 million—they can’t collect those fines, but they can dip their hand into the purse of a young mother on social assistance and claw back $40 because the spouse finally anted up for some money for that family. I mean, the juxtaposition is incredible around the priorities of this government. When you compare the rhetoric and the reality, the great divide, it’s like the twilight zone.", "There was no funding to alleviate the massive backlog in the province’s courts.

Treasury Board President Deb Matthews, who presented the government’s latest poverty reduction strategy ... said: ‘We are recommitting to reducing poverty among children and youth through targeted investments and supports.’ There was scant evidence to back up any of that in last week’s budget.” That’s a direct quote from the editorial in the Toronto Star.", "The reason that you did not see the priorities around poverty reduction or in a comprehensive child care strategy or in a comprehensive senior health strategy or long-term-care health strategy, the reason you did not see a made-in-Ontario plan to create affordable housing—because we will never address poverty reduction until we have a strong housing process and strategy in the province of Ontario; that just will not happen.

The critic from the PC Party and I went on Steve Paikin’s show, The Agenda, and he asked, “What is good about this budget?” We both said, “The autism money. It’s so needed.” I have to apologize to the parents in Ontario for saying that because, at the time, I didn’t know that this budget was going to clear out their wait-list by preventing those children who are five and older from accessing IBI treatment, which some have waited for, as we heard this morning, for four years.

To date, the $4.4 billion that this government has promised to spend on infrastructure—they have not honoured that. They do not have to sell Hydro One; they just have to figure out how to build infrastructure in the province of Ontario and figure out how to honour their promises of building Ontario up—not on the backs of the people of this province as you sell off the public assets, which you have no mandate to do, which you have no right to do and which is not in the best interests of the people of this province.", "New Democrats cannot support this budget.

  "text" : [ "Thank you, Speaker, for allowing me to bring the perspective of the people I represent in Leeds–Grenville to the budget debate, Bill 173.", "First of all, I have a question for the House today: What happens when a government tunes out the voices of those who can’t afford to attend the minister’s $6,000-a-plate fundraiser and forges ahead with their own agenda? The answer, quite simply, is that you get a budget like the one that’s before us today; a budget that is so disconnected from the day-to-day realities of Ontario families and of seniors on fixed incomes, and that everyone else is facing. In short, it’s a budget that makes it harder for all Ontarians.", "If you want to know how disconnected Premier Wynne and her government are, consider what they tried to do with seniors’ drugs costs. To them, seniors bringing in $19,300 a year are so well off that they can dig a lot deeper to buy the medicine that they need to keep them healthy. That’s how disconnected this government is.", "These Liberal members have to be getting the same emails that members on this side of the House are getting from seniors who were extremely concerned with that policy. They have to know that the soaring cost of electricity is already forcing them to be choosing between heating and eating. So they’re either ignoring the pleas, or they’re just tuning them out completely. How else can you explain the plan in the budget to hike drug costs for 92% of seniors? Well, Speaker, they got caught, and they’ve shelved that increase until August 1, thanks to the thousands of seniors who took up the opposition call to flood the government with emails, letters, phone calls and petitions.", "The Premier says she will consult before making changes to income thresholds for the drug program’s deductible. We’ve heard that before. We’ve heard that before from this government, so pardon me if I remain skeptical. I’m going to keep a close eye, and I know members on this side of the House are going to keep a close eye, on this government during that review.", "But it’s not only seniors that have expressed anger about the priorities of this budget. I’ve heard from families in Leeds–Grenville who are literally devastated with the changes to autism treatment. When I heard the announcement first, I had to double-check to make sure. I couldn’t believe that they were doing what they were doing. It just was unbelievable to me.", "It goes back to what I said during second reading about having to look beyond the headlines with this government. You see, in the days after the budget, there was praise, even from some members on this side of the House, for the investment in autism. But when the details emerged and we learned that they’ve cancelled IBI therapy funding for children over five and suddenly kicked 2,000 children five years or older off the waiting list—in one fell swoop, Speaker, they were deprived of that therapy that’s critical to helping them reach their full potential.", "I have some of my constituents’ comments that I want to put on the record today. For parents like Chelsea and Mathew Metcalfe in my riding, the decision on autism was devastating. Their eldest son was six when he began IBI, and he completed the program just before his eighth birthday. They told me that the impact IBI had on their son was remarkable. It helped him flourish in school. Now they’re terrified about what’s going to happen to their five-year-old son, who had waited two years to get IBI treatment and was finally in the program.", "Here’s what Chelsea and Mathew wrote to me last week: “With the new Ontario Autism Program, he will be kicked out of IBI before he is ready, and will never have the opportunity to access this service again.", "“We cannot afford the $50,000 it costs annually for private IBI services. As I’m sure you can sympathize, an $8,000 payout is both unacceptable and insulting.", "“$8,000 will only cover two months of private IBI therapy. As we learned through our eldest son’s experience with IBI, it can take months for therapists to gain the instructional control required to complete programming.", "“If all families can afford is two months of therapy, they will undoubtedly see no improvement in their children—which is heartbreaking.” That’s their quote, Speaker.", "Unfortunately, it doesn’t end there. I’ve heard from several families in Leeds–Grenville with children at Sagonaska Demonstration School in Belleville. I know they’re coming here to Queen’s Park on Thursday to tell the government exactly what they think about this rigged process—the government calls it a review—about provincial and demonstration schools. Like their actions on autism, what we’ve seen under the so-called cloak of secrecy, the so-called review of demonstration schools, is unbelievable. They’ve frozen admissions for the fall and sent teachers back to their home boards.", "As Lesley Lehman, a parent in my riding and one of the passionate voices leading the fight to keep these schools open, has stated, “How can you have a school with no students and no teachers?” How can you do that, Speaker?", "While the minister doesn’t have the courage to admit it, she has set up this rigged process to close down these schools and shelve their life-changing programs. I wrote to the minister last month to share the stories from families in my riding. On their behalf, I want to ask that the review be put off and a fair process be started in the fall.", "I want to share one comment from one of the parents hoping to enrol their student at Sagonaska: “This school will not just educate my child but will change the trajectory of his life. He will be the only one in our family to walk across a stage and receive a high school diploma someday. And when he succeeds, my whole family succeeds.”", "Again, you’ve got vulnerable students whose futures are being put in jeopardy because this government has chosen the wrong priorities.", "In the time I have left—and I just have a few minutes left—I want to focus on an issue that has developed over the last couple of weeks, and that’s the sudden suspension of the Ontario Trillium Foundation capital grants program. No consultation, no warning—just an email at 4:53, the day before Good Friday, two weeks before the deadline for new grant applications under the program.", "The Minister of Tourism, Culture and Sport can spin it any way he wants, but that’s bad news for volunteer groups, non-profits and charitable organizations. Trillium was their only source of capital funding. These funds allowed them to make critical investments to upkeep their facilities and enhance their work. As I said in my question last week, it literally keeps the roof over their heads.", "What was interesting in the budget is it showed that Trillium’s funding was holding firm at about $115 million. But I’ll tell you something. It wasn’t until we saw the ministry’s estimates when we learned the truth: that the budget was actually being reduced by $25 million. The $25 million which supported the Ontario Trillium Foundation capital grants program was instead earmarked for a new program to celebrate Canada’s 150th birthday.", "What was the reason, Speaker? This government is so broke, it can’t even fund a program that accounts for 0.02% of its total budget without putting vulnerable volunteer groups at risk. Just like seniors, kids with autism, students at provincial and demonstration schools, they are the victims of this Liberal government’s waste, scandal and mismanagement.", "Despite the Premier’s attempts to convince us otherwise, these are the real faces of this budget, a budget that makes life harder for them, their families and their neighbours. I wanted to make sure, Speaker, that their voices were on the record today.", "Those were just four programs. I could have gone on and on all afternoon. I appreciate the opportunity, and I know that my colleagues have other comments this afternoon." ],

She’s not the only one who feels that this budget was a complete missed opportunity to treat people fairly.", "I want to quote a little bit from the Minister of Health, to help put things into perspective. On Monday, December 15, 2014, Eric Hoskins, the Minister of Health, wrote the following:", "“I have been passionate about ... pharmacare and breaking down barriers to health care since entering medical school 30 years ago. Since becoming Ontario’s Minister of Health, I have been determined to put pharmacare back on the national agenda.”", "“It’s undoubtedly one of the most important steps we can take to rededicate ourselves to the principle of universal access to health care....", "“Saskatchewan blazed a path forward for public health insurance in the 1950s, and the rest of our country had no choice but to take notice. This led to the formation of a royal commission, and after years of engaging the public it came back” as medicare, “our most revered national symbol.”", "Funny that our Minister of Health can say this, but when the budget came out, it went in a completely opposite direction. We had this change to the way that drug costs were going to be funded to our seniors that meant that anybody who made more than $19,300 was going to see their drug costs double. How can you reconcile the fact that when they talk about what is the right thing to do, they say, “We have to rededicate ourselves to the principle of universal access,” but then when they put out a budget, they go in the absolute opposite direction? We’re not talking about universal access; we’re talking about how anybody who makes more than $19,300 will have to help pay for those who—what is that, Speaker? What is that?", "I’m happy to report that because of the good work of all of my colleague MPPs from the NDP, we were able to help the voices of seniors be heard. We read petitions. We met with CARP and seniors. In my riding, I had the pleasure to have Dot Klein, Ken Burns, Terry McMahon and Hugh Kruzel from CARP, and John Lindsay from Friendly to Seniors. They all came out and supported, through a press conference, the launch of our petition.", "After tens of thousands of seniors wrote petitions, sent letters in, stood with the NDP MPPs and told the government that they had gotten it wrong, we have their promise that they are not going to implement the doubling of prescription drugs for people who make more than $19,300. So they’re not doing to increase the deductible to $170, like the budget says in black and white, and they’re not going to increase the copay to $7.11, like the budget says." ],

There is a provincial park, Ivanhoe Lake Provincial Park, just beside Foleyet. Hundreds of people come in the summer when the park is open.

  "text" : [ "Mr. Speaker, I think I’m going to attempt to change the tone a little bit. I appreciate the speech that was given—it was quite good—but I’m going to come at this from a bit of a different perspective. I’ve just come off a teleconference with the Attawapiskat First Nation and federal and provincial representatives of various ministries and agencies that are responding to the crisis in that community. I’m raising it in context of this budget because the budget allows us greater latitude, Speaker, as you well know, to be able to raise issues that have to do with money, and this is obviously a money issue.", "What was interesting is that the conversation that we were having with the community was actually pretty direct. Chief Bruce Shisheesh asked us to do a couple of things. One of the things that he asked was that there is an issue in his riding that needs to be dealt with, but this is not the first time that it has been raised. We’ve seen these types of attempts in the past where, unfortunately, people have attempted suicide. There have been responses, but those responses, in some cases, fell on deaf ears. Other times, there was a response, but once the cameras moved away and it had folded off the front page and fell to the floor, the community was left again to deal with it as best they can.", "One of the things that the chief is asking for in council, and to those people that were present from the community at this meeting, is that whatever we do now, we need to make sure that the Ministry of Finance provides the funding necessary so that we have the services in our communities—not just Attawapiskat; unfortunately, there are many other communities across the north that have the same issues, in the Far North specifically, when it comes to First Nations—so that we have the services in the community to be able to deal with counselling; to be able to deal with how we’re able to give young people something to do as far as proper facilities to spend time in so that they don’t lead themselves astray; to doing whatever needs to be done in order to allow kids to have healthy lives—and people of my age, because it’s people of different generations who, unfortunately, go down this route—so that they’re able to live a meaningful life and feel as if, “You know what? It’s worth carrying on.”", "So what the chief really asked for—I’m very thankful that the Minister of Health and the Minister of Children and Youth Services, both ministers of this crown, are going to Attawapiskat tomorrow. What they’re going to hear is the chief say, “I’m very pleased that you’re here. I’m very pleased. We want to work with you. We want to find solutions to this problem that are not only short-term but long-term. But, please, let’s make sure that what needs to be done carries on beyond the news cycle of today and tomorrow.” That’s the first thing that the chief has said.", "The second thing the chief said—and community members, Deputy Grand Chief Friday and others—is that whatever we do, we need to understand that these are First Nations communities. The response in a First Nations community such as Attawapiskat has to be tailored to the reality of those communities. These are Cree people; they’re Mushkegowuk. They’re not Gilles Bisson, Franco-Ontarian from Timmins, or Cindy—I don’t know what’s your—" ],

It may be different than the way we would do it, but that’s fine because whatever it is that we do, it has got to be done in some kind of way that in fact reflects who they are and that they can connect to.", "The second thing they’re saying is they’re pleased that the federal and provincial governments are responding to this crisis. They acknowledge there’s much being done in the short term to deal with this crisis, and they’re thankful for that and say so publicly at these meetings. But, they want to make sure that our response over the longer term looks at how we develop services that reflect the community’s needs, but also are sensitive to the community’s culture and language.", "The other thing that the chief asked for—I thought this was rather interesting; I think this is something that people may not think of. You know, Mushkegowuk people are a proud people. They’re like you, Mr. Speaker, in your community. You want your community to be seen in a positive light. You want the community to be seen as a place to live and a place to feel good about. He’s a little bit worried about what some people are doing on Facebook and what some people are doing even in the media: pouncing on the negative without talking a little bit about the positives and talking about what can be. So he’s asking all of us—and I include myself in that—to be mindful when we communicate around this issue, either by way of social media or by way of media, that we’re sensitive. There’s a lot of good people in that community, and they don’t want to be seen in a bad light.", "They acknowledge there’s a problem. Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, a lot of it stems back to the residential school experience. People who have been hurt and bruised and damaged as a result of those experiences—it has put them in a situation where they’re having difficulty in their lives today. They’re having children and those children are having to live within the families where people are hurt, and it’s affecting their ability to cope. But he asks, can we please make sure that whatever we do when we communicate and do these things, we do so mindful of the community.", "The other thing was—and this is something I spoke to at the meeting today, and I spoke to at the summit on health services at James Bay two weeks ago—that yes, the province and the federal government can respond to this crisis by offering some interim measures right now, but we really need to develop health policy and health services on the James Bay that is driven by First Nations themselves.", "A lot of people in this House may not know this, but guess what? Health services and social services are not a federal responsibility on-reserve; they’re provincial. We own and operate the hospitals. We fund the hospitals and health services in our communities of the James Bay as we do in other communities across Ontario. Child and youth services are mandated by provincial law. Policing is mandated by provincial law. NAPS is one of ours; it’s one of our creations as a province. In fact, I was a member of the government that was there when we created NAPS in the first place.", "But one of the things we really need to make sure we do is that as we move forward with the completion of integration of the Weeneebayko hospital now with the federal hospital of yesterday, we don’t necessarily just continue with the amalgamation of the federal-provincial hospitals from the perspective of an institution, but we look at developing health services and social services on the James Bay that affect health in a more holistic way that is really driven by the First Nations, that is sensitive to their cultural and linguistic needs, sensitive to the geography of the area and is done so in a way that reflects who they are. So, rather than having a LHIN, as we have now, we actually replace the LHIN with some sort of administrative structure that plans and delivers health services for the James Bay within the context of who they are, driven by themselves.", "We cannot continue a colonial approach to trying to fix what was a colonial problem, and that is the creation of reserves. We need to allow First Nations to design a system that works for them, and the Ministry of Finance here in Ontario has to play its part in funding those particular ministries that would allow that to happen.", "The message that I bring back from Chief Shisheesh and others is that they appreciate the response that our province and the federal government are doing, and those who are visiting the community and trying to find solutions. They’re very thankful that that is happening, but remember that this has to be a long-term engagement and one that is wrapped around who they are and who they want to be as far as the Mushkegowuk people of the James Bay." ],

I do so because I think there are three major stakeholders across this province that haven’t had the opportunity to provide their input. They would like to understand a little bit more about the misinformation about this particular initiative. In particular, I look at municipalities in small communities. But even in my city of Ottawa, the second-largest city in all of Ontario, a city that has almost one million people, we have a multi-million-dollar snowmobile industry that assists not only our rural economy in the city of Ottawa, but also the economy as a whole.", "I’d also like to point out that it’s not only municipalities and snowmobilers—snowmobiling clubs being our second stakeholder, which are largely volunteer-run by people who want to have a positive impact on recreation and the economy in their communities—but thirdly, I think there are private landowners and people who own properties that are adjacent or near these particular trails.", "One of the things I wanted to do today was bring forward an individual’s concern, who happens to wear many hats with respect to Bill 100.

A marina is very helpful in the summer for the boats, but in the winter they have gas, they have food, they have a bathroom. It’s the perfect spot to stop.

We have 80,000 kilometres of trails in the province of Ontario. Three quarters of those trails are on crown land and one quarter on private land. That has worked extremely well without Bill 100 and without easements. Everybody is getting along just fine. Snowmobilers are responsible and farmers are happy. So why do we need Bill 100?", "It seems like we have created a piece of legislation—and since it’s voluntary and you don’t have to comply with it unless you want to, it would do nothing. We have no problem, so it solves no problem. What we have here is Bill 100 to solve a problem that does nothing to solve a problem that doesn’t exist. I think if we vote yes for something that does nothing, the people of Ontario will judge us that way." ],

That’s not such a great issue any longer in my area of the province. It used to be. It used to be a pretty booming business in Niagara, but because we have such mild winters these days—we can have a snowstorm that goes until 3 o’clock in the morning, and by morning the snow is melted—it isn’t such an issue. But people who have those snowmobiles are now using them on our recreational canal lands. They’re actually using those snowmobiles and tearing up the land along the recreational canal land.", "I think what this bill is going to need at the end of the day, whether it passes—or when it passes. I guess it isn’t “whether it passes” in a majority government. Right? When it passes, it’s going to need some enforcement, and enforcement, typically, is a problem under this government. We see it under all kinds of legislation where we pass many bills, but then we don’t put in the enforcement piece or the actual people to do the enforcement.", "Now, the Minister of the Environment spoke about access to waterways in other provinces. I know that the member from Niagara Falls has a private member’s bill that’s sitting on a ledger sheet in committee, waiting to be heard, about the right of access for citizens in this province to the Great Lakes beaches and other lakes in the province. I would hope that the government would soon be bringing forward that piece of legislation, so that people in this province actually have access to their beaches and to their lakefront." ],

The only reason, frankly, that I’m aware of portage routes is because my family and I go camping every day—or every summer. It would be nice to go camping every day, except for in the winter. I’m not fond of the snow. We go to Algonquin park, where they have many beautiful trails. I encourage anybody who hasn’t been there to go there. One of our favourite places to camp is Rock Lake. We go to the unserviced sites. That’s about as roughing it as I like to get. We stay in a tent. We do the trails there. We do Booth’s Rock and Lookout Point and the Beaver Pond Trail. It’s fascinating, if you’re not a northerner and you don’t experience it and don’t live it every day, to see the wildlife, to see the moose, the bear, the beavers and all the wildlife that are around.

They need to learn how to feed themselves. Often, human food is not suitable for wildlife.", "To get back on topic, Speaker, the bill before us today enacts the Ontario Trails Act, 2015, and makes amendments to the Motorized Snow Vehicles Act, the Occupiers’ Liability Act, the Off-Road Vehicles Act, the Public Lands Act and the Trespass to Property Act. It’s supposed to be consolidating a lot of stuff. It’s confusing to many people—just what exactly it encompasses.", "The stated purpose of the bill is to provide the trails community with enhanced tools to effectively develop, operate and promote trails; remove barriers to help connect and expand trails across the province; increase trail awareness; and promote local tourism by recognizing trails of distinction. The bill also aims to address long-term procurement of trail lands and tourism promotion.", "Legislation would see Ontario Trails Week correspond with its international equivalent. As my colleague from Windsor–Tecumseh pointed out, there is some confusion around that because it says that there is a commitment to make this around Ontario Trails Week, but then it goes on to say that the minister can change it to whatever he or she sees fit. So there is a little confusion written directly into the bill.", "And it requires the trails strategy to be reviewed and maintained.", "The legislation also enables the development of a classification system to help users find trails that match their interest and ability. I think that’s important, because as someone who is from the sunny deep south of Ontario, as I think I’ve stated, I’m not too fond of the snow. Although I did grow up in London, and there were times where, for Halloween, we didn’t even put costumes on because there was already enough snow on the ground to put on a snowsuit to go trick-or-treating—it doesn’t happen frequently, but it has happened—since I moved to Windsor many decades ago, I’ve become a little spoiled by the weather there and I try to stay away from where there’s too much snow. With all due respect to my colleagues from the north, I’d like to know whether I’m heading onto a trail that would be a snowmobile trail or whether I’m heading onto a trail that’s going to take me to a nice, warm lodge where I can sit by the fire and wait for the snow to disappear.", "In the brief time that I have left, I’d like to talk about some of the trails in Windsor and Essex county. We have many beautiful trails. The one that comes to mind right off the top of my head—and I want to make sure it gets mentioned before my time runs out. We have a naturalized area in Windsor: Ojibway. There is a big-box development in the works as we speak that is currently in very close proximity to this naturalized area. They’ve already started to clear the land. It used to be the Windsor Raceway and slots. I don’t think it’s any secret to the people of Ontario what the government has done to the racing industry.", "It was really sad to see our track closed. So many horses were put down. Many trainers, veterinarians and others from that particular industry were out of work or had to move on to find work. Now we’re finding that this area that’s close to Ojibway is potentially going to end up with a Walmart. That is a threat to the wildlife in the area. We have many endangered species in the Ojibway area, and they’re at risk from this big-box development and crossing the street—the increased traffic. When the wildlife goes to cross the street from one area to another, they’re at a real risk of being killed. Again, these are many endangered species. I did write a letter to the minister in charge, asking that he intervene, and nothing came of that. Unfortunately, they’ve already started to bulldoze the lands.", "There are also the Maidstone Woods. One of the many benefits of living in the so-called banana belt is our pleasant summer days. A great way to spend a nice Sunday afternoon this summer would be to take a trip to Maidstone and visit the Maidstone Woods. The woods include a trail through the forest to Puce River, a great stop if you want to have a picnic lunch.", "Also, I just received my invitation today to go to Malden Park for Earth Day events on April 24. This was an invitation directly from the city of Windsor to attend. It was nice to see that in the invitation they mentioned that they are encouraging people to ride to Malden Park and then, once they are in the park, to bike the trails. They’re going to be launching their Gear Up and Go program from Cycle Windsor-Essex. The city of Windsor is encouraging the people who live in Windsor and Essex county to enjoy the trails that we offer.", "We have a beautiful waterfront trail that extends a great distance through Windsor. I’d encourage everybody to come down and check that out. We have the Festival Plaza where we have some incredible events that take place in the summertime.", "The beauty of Windsor and Essex county is the fact that we have very good weather. While there was a blizzard here in Toronto, it was beautiful at home. It was above zero. So people can use our trails all year round. Although you can’t come and snowmobile or you can’t really come and cross-country ski through our area, you can come and walk the paths and enjoy what Windsor and Essex has to offer.", "In the minute and a half that I have left—that really went fast; I didn’t even get through half of my notes, Speaker. I think it’s important to point out that, on the government side, they’ve been saying that on this side of the House—and I’m going to speak specifically about our caucus—we are creating some of the confusion or creating concern over this bill, when, really, all we’re doing is saying that they have not consulted properly, they haven’t got the information to the people that this would affect. People need to know that if they open up their property for people to use for trails, for whatever it may be—a hiking trail, a snowmobile trail—landowners need to know what their rights and obligations are when they decide to open up their land for use.", "The government hasn’t done a very good job of letting people know that. That’s not the responsibility of the people on this side of the House. It’s their bill; it’s their legislation, which they’re probably going to ram through because they have a majority government. It’s their obligation to make sure that people are clear on the legislation they’re putting through. Rather than saying that we are creating the confusion, and we’re getting people upset, what they need to do is take the opportunity to really get the information out there and truly consult with people. Let them know exactly what this bill means for them, for those that would use the trails, for those that would allow the trails through their property, and I think you would find that a lot of that confusion and a lot of that pushback may go away." ],

But then we have a large gap of time, and then Bill 100 comes to the floor for debate.", "In the last few months, our critic here from Leeds–Grenville, who has done a great job for tourism and sport—he puts his hand up—has brought forward concerns, and I think we’ve all had them, especially in rural Ontario where we have a lot of snowmobile trails, about the part of the bill to do with easements, and justifiably so.", "There are landowners who have had a good relationship with snowmobile clubs in my riding of Haliburton–Kawartha Lakes–Brock. I have a little more snowmobiling occur in the Haliburton section of it. But the fact is that the bill needs to clarify this very grey area and that the easements should be voluntary. There was concern about transferability with the easements if the property changes hands.", "It just created a very nervous on-the-ground feeling, to the point that some of the snowmobile trails were blocked during the wintertime. None of us want to see that because, up in Haliburton county especially, it is a large, large part of our tourism industry. Like the old saying, it’s white gold. They were very concerned that they would shut snowmobiles trails down and affect both the economic benefits we have from snowmobiling and the enjoyment that we have. Certainly, then there is a hesitation for people to come up to our riding.", "What we heard is that the government really should have consulted some more. Hopefully, there will be an amendment to relieve some of the concerns that constituents in my riding have about the easement section of the trails bill.", "I’ll leave you with that.

I know that in Toronto that’s a little more difficult, but down our way and in many other ridings, schools try to work naturalized areas into their green space around the buildings so that the kids get to learn about butterflies and bugs and birds and all kinds of things that, although you can learn about them in the classroom, you really need to experience to really understand and appreciate them.

Far too often—and I have the perfect example to reference—this government simply responds to questions in this House with bluster, insults and essentially Liberal Party spin.

But effective treatment is time-sensitive, isn’t it? Patients cannot be told, “Come back in 10 years, when you’re 65.” The time for treatment cannot be delayed, yet it is.", "In Mr. McEwen’s case, he was discharged and sent home from 12 days of outpatient care in 2010.

Regardless of age—that’s really important, I want to emphasize—the post-acute phase of stroke recovery that’s offered in Ontario has five settings.", "The first one, as you can imagine, is in the hospital: in-patient beds covered by OHIP. In-patient rehabilitation and complex continuing care beds are used to treat patients of all ages who require hospital-based post-acute stroke care. In-patient rehabilitation beds provide supports for patients who require hospital care to reverse functional decline following an injury, illness or medical intervention, including the impact of a stroke.", "After the patient is discharged, there’s a number of options available to the patient to ensure that rehabilitative services are continued.", "The first is hospital outpatient clinics. A number of hospitals offer outpatient clinics and hospital day programs for post-acute stroke patients of all ages. These ambulatory programs generally follow an interdisciplinary, team-based approach. Each clinic program has its own eligibility criteria.", "Next, the Rehabilitative Care Alliance, an advisory body established by the 14 LHINs, including representatives from hospitals, the Ontario Association of Community Care Access Centres, the Ontario Long Term Care Association and many other key stakeholders, is in the process of developing a plan for an outpatient data collection and reporting system for hospital-based outpatient rehabilitation services, which would include stroke care and speaks to the ongoing work that we are doing in the area of enhancing services for post-stroke patients.", "After the hospital outpatient clinics, or if the person isn’t well enough to go for ambulatory care, we also provide rehabilitative services in the home, the in-home care. In-home physiotherapy services are provided to patients of all ages, including post-acute stroke patients who are unable to access these services in settings outside their home.", "Some more options include the Convalescent Care Program in long-term-care homes. The Convalescent Care Program, CCP, is a short-stay program in long-term-care homes, again for persons of all ages, including post-acute stroke patients who need time to recover strength, endurance or functioning.", "Finally, there’s the option of the community physiotherapy clinic program. This last setting provides targeted physiotherapy aimed at addressing acute incidents. That includes post-stroke patients who, regardless of age, can, in community physiotherapy clinics, access rehabilitative care that’s OHIP-covered. There are currently 258 community physiotherapy clinics providing services in over 150 communities across Ontario.", "I also want to address, in addition to some of these programs, some of the work that the ministry is working on on this very important issue.", "There is a pilot taking place that is really important, in which the ministry, together with its partners, is committed to strengthening post-acute care pathways for persons who have suffered a stroke, and it supports a number of initiatives to provide stroke rehabilitation services to Ontarians. This initiative is called the Health System Funding Reform, which is a patient-centred, evidence-informed funding model that reflects local population needs and strengthens the link between high-quality care and fiscal sustainability.", "One of the key levers is the implementation of quality-based procedures. Quality-based procedures are health services with clusters of patients, again of all ages, with clinically related diagnoses, treatments and functional needs.", "Mr. Speaker, I see I’m running out of time, although I do have a lot more that I’d like to cover. But I hope that this more fulsome answer reassures the member opposite (a) of the care pathways that are already in place, and (b) that the ministry is indeed working on further steps to ensure that post-stroke recovery patients in Ontario get the care they need and deserve." ],

I rise to give notice of dissatisfaction with the answer provided to my question yesterday by the Minister of the Environment.", "In the first place, I probably shouldn’t be shocked, because the question didn’t pertain to anything that the Minister of the Environment could actually answer. The Premier only called upon him to answer it either because she couldn’t answer it herself or she couldn’t hand it off to the minister who actually could.", "The Minister of the Environment has no ability to extend an energy contract, which was the basis of the question, so he couldn’t really speak to that. The Minister of the Environment has no ability to tell the House what the milestone date for the FIT contract given to wpd in the spring of 2010 actually is. If he does, that would have been information relevant to the question yesterday. If he has it, he can gladly share it with the House, and we would appreciate that today.", "So I wondered why the minister rose to answer the question. Yes, the Environmental Review Tribunal granted a stay of construction on the project on the south shore of Prince Edward county, but the question wasn’t about the stay of construction. Though it’s worth noting that an environmental review has focused largely on the habitat of the Blanding’s turtle—as this minister knows, a species that this government has invested millions into habitats in Scarborough to protect—the failure to grant an immediate stay of construction caused a disturbance of hibernation and destruction of habitat for those same turtles in Prince Edward county. That alone could prove what the Ministry of Natural Resources’ own experts said at an ERT: that this project will cause irreversible harm to this species.", "However, that was still not the substance of the question. The stay of construction was granted and the construction has stopped for now. The substance of the question was whether or not the Minister of Energy would extend wpd’s deadline another year, or as long as necessary to get that project into the ground. Only he can do that. The IESO can just as easily use the force majeure clause to get taxpayers out of this environmentally catastrophic contract once the milestone date has passed. All this, the government knows.", "What I find remarkable in this case is the degree to which no one in government takes responsibility for anything. The Minister of Energy signs a contract for a process that then goes to the Ministry of Natural Resources, which has to issue a kill, harm and harass permit. The minister doesn’t have to sign said permit, but does even though his own in-house expert on turtles tells him this will destroy their habitat. So much for evidence-based decision-making.", "The project then goes over to the Ministry of the Environment, which runs the Environmental Review Tribunal. The ERT hears days of evidence and arguments from lawyers both for the big wind developer and the non-profit community group in Prince Edward county trying to protect their own environment. The ERT rules that the project will cause irreversible harm to the environment. It actually ruled that either project planned for the south shore would cause harm, but that’s beside the point.", "So the developers dig into their pockets and hire lawyers. Does the government join the case of the community group? No, the government joins the multinational wind developer trying to do irreversible damage to the environment. Then the Minister of the Environment has the nerve to get up and sound offended because I dared to suggest that something about this situation doesn’t smell right.", "In preparation for this debate, I asked members of the community to tell me what they would like me to ask the minister here this evening, and here’s what one member wrote back:", "“The community of Prince Edward has now experienced over 60 days of hearings for two wind energy projects before the Environmental Review Tribunal (with perhaps more to come) plus appeals at the Divisional Court and Court of Appeal.", "“All of these proceedings have reaffirmed what many community members as well as provincial and national environmental groups have known for some time; for many reasons the undeveloped south shore of Prince Edward county is the wrong site for this type and scale of wind energy projects.", "“In addition many observers have been shocked during these hearings by the Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change legal team defending the proponent’s positions—seemingly the MOECC arguing for the destruction of the local environment.", "“Two separate environmental review tribunals have now found that adjacent projects will cause serious and irreversible harm to the natural environment. In spite of these findings the current process seems unable to prevent this type of poorly located development from proceeding or resulting in years of litigation....", "“Can the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change find a method to interject some responsible management and improve credibility to this process? Can the minister not find a method to stop proposed projects that have been found to be so poorly sited?”", "To quote the seminal political question: Who benefits?" ],

The government of Ontario is not the counterparty to FIT contracts and is not in the position to discuss matters related to individual FIT contracts. I have been informed that the Ministry of Energy has entertained requests for extensions to individual project deadlines, and the minister will not consider directing the IESO to grant an extension for an individual FIT contract.", "Furthermore, the government has a strict policy of non-interference where individual FIT contracts are concerned.

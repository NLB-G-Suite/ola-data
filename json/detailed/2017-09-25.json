In a flooding event, our provincial program kicks in if there is damage caused by overland flooding. It can help make your home safe and livable after a natural disaster. This program will help hundreds of families where our disaster recovery program has been activated this year." ],

That is something I had the honour of introducing in the Legislature on September 14.", "My time will be shared with my very well-learned parliamentary assistant, the member for Davenport, who I know, as she did the last time we went through a bill, will be very much the expert on the finer details that are found within this very significant and complex bill. I want to thank her for the work that she has done on the previous bill and on this bill.", "In many ways this is unheralded work. We know, and I think my critics probably realize as well, we’re probably not going to make headlines today in this debate. The media gallery is not exactly full as we speak here today, but we don’t expect that. The fact is, though, this is really good work for all parties, all members involved.", "It requires a great deal of expertise and a great deal of skill to ensure that we bring these measures forward to ensure that the balance is there; that as we bring the measures forward, to reduce regulatory burdens for businesses—and we’ll talk more about the details in a minute, but to ensure that we’re not impacting the important areas of regulation that the public count on us to protect but, indeed, we’re taking measures that reduce unnecessary regulatory burden.", "I welcome my critics as well to the debate: the member for Kitchener–Waterloo and the member for Lambton–Kent–Middlesex. I welcome them to the debate and I look forward to their comments today. It’s still early days, and this bill will go to committee. Certainly, we welcome their ideas as these bills come forward, because there are times when you’re making these changes when there may be unintended consequences that we weren’t aware of to some of these moves, or when there may be better ways to do it. If they’ve got better ways to do it, I think we owe an obligation to listen to that. Frankly, Mr. Speaker, when I think about it, in many ways, that’s what this Legislature is all about. That’s why we’re here. That’s what our democracy is about. So I want to thank the member for Kitchener–Waterloo and the member for Lambton–Kent–Middlesex. We’re known each other for many, many years and we’ve worked on a number of things together.", "I like the member for Sarnia as well. He’s waving at me. I guess he wanted me to throw him in there too.", "I want to say something that I’m not authorized to say—I don’t need to be authorized to say everything I say. I’m more of a passionate sports fan than I am a political junkie, and I always have been. That’s really been my true passion in life, and continues to be. But over the weekend, I was really inspired, tuning into some of the NFL football games, by what I think was courage shown, and fortitude shown, by NFL players right around the league, and team officials and owners, as they came together in a collegial way, as they joined together in harmony, speaking out for freedom of expression, speaking out for democracy, frankly. I think that’s something that’s commendable. I am happy to commend it. Our Toronto Argos, I believe, joined in as well in their game. As I watched that demonstration—and whether you’re for or against their way of demonstrating, I think we all, here in this Legislature, are certainly for freedom of expression.", "So I look forward to hearing from my colleagues opposite on where they might support our initiatives and where they think we can do better. That’s part of what democracy is about. That is part of what freedom of expression is about.", "We have lost loved ones. We have lost people who have put themselves in harm’s way to fight for our democracy. When I saw those NFL players stand in unison this weekend, I’ve got to tell you, I was very proud of them. I think they deserve to be commended for that show of courage and unity. Certainly, I for one stand with them—or kneel with them, on this occasion.", "I’ll now start speaking about what I’m here to speak about, and that’s the bill—in this cradle of democracy that we’re so privileged to live in today.", "I had the privilege of beginning to work on regulatory burden reduction many, many years ago. I guess it goes back close to 10 years ago now, my first post in cabinet—and the Minister of Labour is here. He’s doing a fine job in a post that I think is often not recognized for the hard work that actually comes with that post. But I think of late, people have seen the work that the Minister of Labour is doing and recognize that it can be a very challenging post. That was my first post in cabinet.", "One day, we were having a cabinet discussion. Dalton McGuinty was our Premier at the time, and we were talking about burden reduction and the need to do more to reduce the costs of business in this province and reduce red tape. I spoke out at that cabinet meeting, and I say this by way of a bit of advice to my colleagues opposite: I hope they don’t, but if they ever do get the privilege of forming government—my critics, who are younger than I am—if they get the privilege of sitting in cabinet, you’ve got to make sure, before you speak out passionately about things, that you’re ready to take on responsibilities. Because after I spoke out passionately about reducing red tape, the Premier of the day, Dalton McGuinty, turned to me and said, “I really like what you had to say. You’re going to head up our new approach to regulatory burden reduction.” I turned to him and said, “Well, I’m the Minister of Labour.”", "No offence to the current Minister of Labour, but labour is not exactly high up on the list when it comes to ministries that businesses tend to love. In fact, labour is responsible for a lot of inspections in our workplaces, and from time to time businesses do have the odd complaint about our WSIB system and things like that. Our current Minister of Labour has done such a great job that I’m sure that those complaints are few and far between these days—but perhaps not, I say to the minister with respect; perhaps it’s still an area of concern.", "I began about a decade ago on this work, and I soon became passionate about this work. I recognized that when my time here passes, it may well be that nobody ever knows all the hours that I spent on this file, but that doesn’t matter. The fact is, I really couldn’t find a better way for our government to make our economy more competitive, to give businesses the tools that they need to succeed, to find ways to attract investment. There are lots of things we’re doing that do that, but this is a way we can do it without having to go to Treasury Board and get money and invest it.", "I wouldn’t say it’s an easy way to do it. My experience has been that when I ask business leaders—and I’ve spent a lot of time talking to business leaders about reducing regulatory burden; hours upon hours for many, many years—I’ll often get the response—and my critics will probably realize this as well: “Yes, you’ve got to reduce regulatory burden. You’re killing us with all that red tape.” I understand that. But then I’ll say, “Well, what is it, specifically, you would like us to address? Let’s get down to work and figure out a way to address it. Let’s make sure it’s not one of those items that’s protecting people’s health or protecting their welfare in the workplace or protecting the environment. Most regulations are really, really crucial, but some aren’t, or some can be done in ways that can reduce regulatory burden.” That’s the conversation that we need to continue to get down to. That’s what we look to our business leaders and stakeholders to be able to provide us with—the kind of advice we need to be able to make those decisions. And that’s actually where we win the day, because we’re acting in the public good, in the public interest, but also creating a more competitive environment.", "I’ve had the privilege, on and off, of being responsible for this file. I’d be responsible for it in one post—and I’ve had seven different posts in this government—and then I’d lose it for a while, and I’d always keep my eye on it, and then I’d get it back, and then I’d lose it for a while, and then I’d get it back again." ],

There may be some truth to that, I say to the member opposite, but at least I keep landing on my feet after, and continue the issues—and I continue to work passionately to reduce regulatory burden.", "I want to also begin by thanking the Open for Business team. When this bill originally came forward, it was similar to the previous bill that we did. It was going to reduce—and I’ll speak to a little bit of this in a moment—a number of different regulatory burdens. We’d done a lot of consulting. It was a good, ambitious bill.", "When I brought it to the Premier, the Premier said, “This is good. It probably does even more than the last bill does. We’re pleased with it. Of course, we’re going to support it. My critics may well end up supporting this as well.” This is not one of those bills that tends to get into the political limelight. But what the Premier said was, “It’s good, but we’ve got to find a way to make it stronger.”", "There are a lot of uncertainties in the economy today. You look at what’s going on south of the border, you look at the NAFTA negotiations, you look at some of the challenges worldwide: There’s lots of uncertainty.", "We’re doing really, really well right now; we know that. Our unemployment rate is at a 16-year low. We’ve created 760,000 new jobs since the global recession. We continue to lead the G7 in growth, which is a good place for our economy to be. Most economists are suggesting that we’ve been on a pretty good track for some extended period of time, and I think we’re on a good track going forward. But it is an uncertain world out there, a fast-disrupting global economy, which means that we need to pick up every opportunity that we have to drive that technological disruption here, to invest in innovation, to help our companies scale up. To do that, we need to make sure we are the best place to invest in the world.", "That’s something that we are close to doing now. Our Open for Business program has put in place word-class efforts to reduce regulatory burden—and I’ll speak to some of that—but we can never tire; we can never pull back from that. We must always be passionate, knowing that every time we come forward with a bill like this, as soon as we’re done, we’re going to find more things we can do—and that’s good. That’s back and forth, and that’s to and fro. Ideas from the opposition are welcome in this effort because, in the end, the public benefits.", "If we’re more competitive as an economy, businesses are going to invest more, we’re going to create more jobs, and we’re going to continue to lead the G7 in growth going forward. We’re going to be able to fulfill what I think ultimately is our goal, and that’s to pass on a strong and vibrant economy to the next generation. After all, I think that really is what it’s all about, as far as I’m concerned.", "We’ve had the privilege of being recognized for our efforts from time to time, which is good—maybe not in headlines, but so many of our stakeholders have recognized our efforts, including the CFIB, which I give a lot of credit to for a lot of the ideas that we’ve generated through the years.", "I talked about our Open for Business shop, a very entrepreneurial crew who, with very little budget, frankly, do some fantastic work—a lot of visioning, a lot of outreach and a lot of creative work. When the Premier asked me to step it up, I turned to them to say, “How do we step this up? Bring me a really ambitious package.” That’s what they’ve done. They’ve brought forward a package, some of which is in this legislation, others of which were announced when we indicated the intention to do this legislation—a package that is beyond a doubt the most ambitious regulatory burden reduction package that we’ve seen in this province in generations. That’s a good thing." ],

Our team won, and I thank the CFIB for their recognition of that. I thank the opposition as well, because their initiative in pushing us helped drive us to those new heights.", "I want to begin by outlining a little bit what I referred to as some of the global best practices in reducing regulatory burden. I hinted about this a little bit earlier: The best ideas in reducing regulatory burden don’t come from the minister, don’t come from the parliamentary assistant, generally don’t come—no offence—from the critics, don’t come from this Legislature, and don’t really come from the Open for Business team or my colleagues and our ministries in government. Some good ideas come from there, but the best ideas come from the business community itself, the folks on the front line who are actually the ones who are being impacted by those rules and regulations. They’re the ones who know those rules, regulations, and standards and procedures that really are unnecessary and that do get in their way of doing business in this province.", "So our Open for Business strategy has always been about reaching outside of this precinct to what’s going on outside of here, what’s going on in our businesses, to our business leaders—and initially it was our business leaders that we consulted with—our associations and our stakeholders. That’s who we turned to first.", "The first global leading initiative was an Open for Business initiative called Open for Business round tables—hugely successful. We did about a dozen or so different sectors. What we did is we brought the entire sector in, the leaders in that sector and the associations, and we sat them around a table with the minister and ministers in the government—not just the minister responsible for red tape reduction, but the ministers responsible for the regulations as well. We would brainstorm about all the different challenges that we had and we’d pick five or six initiatives that we knew we could resolve. Then, the government would commit to getting those off the table and into action within about six months.", "That process worked really well because the business community, right off the bat, saw success, action and commitment right from the very beginning. They saw the ministries and ministers that they needed to deal with on a face-to-face basis right there at the table so they didn’t have to go out and negotiate through a number of different arms and silos of government. We brought forward hundreds of changes that were really, really important to those business.", "So those round tables worked really well, but one of the things we found is that we were consistently talking to the same people—talented people, skilled people, people who knew what they were talking about, who were helpful, but they were the leaders of organizations and businesses. We really weren’t talking to the front-line workers, many of whom on a day-to-day basis face the rules and regulations and red tape that we’re trying to do what we can to improve.", "So we looked around the world—this is an idea that we didn’t think of ourselves—but this is one that my Open for Business team did come up with: By looking around the world for best practices happening in other places, we were being seen as a global leader in this area, but we weren’t so arrogant as to think that just because we’re seen as a global leader, we have all the good ideas. We recognize that there are other good things going on out there.", "One program that we saw that seemed to be working was a program called the Red Tape Challenge in Great Britain; I think that’s what they call it as well. We decided that we were going to do that here, and we developed a made-in-Ontario approach to this.", "The key with the Red Tape Challenge is that it uses technology in an innovative way and it uses our capacity online to reach out beyond the boardrooms and beyond those round tables to every single Ontarian, in particular those who are interested in a particular sector—for instance, our first venture was in the auto parts sector—so that front-line workers in that auto parts sector would be able to participate in the process online and have that online to-and-fro discussion with us. That program has proven to be a huge success, because it’s open to everyone. Everyone in the province can participate, and the participation has actually been really impressive, in particular for a new program.", "In all, there are seven industries that we have planned to tackle. The feedback has been really, really helpful. The first industry was the auto parts manufacturing sector. The second is the food processing sector. The third is financial services. The fourth is mining. The fifth is chemical manufacturing. The sixth is forestry and tourism. I’m sure when we’re done there, or maybe even before, we’ll expand our horizons because this program seems to be working really, really well.", "On the auto parts manufacturing sector, we found 41 regulatory burdens that we could address, and we’re in the process now of addressing those. Some of them aren’t easy; it’s going to take us about three years to get all of that implemented, but we’ve got 41 good areas of direction.", "The other area that we’ve moved into now is the food processing sector and financial services, where we’ve completed consultations this year. In food processing, we identified 26 areas that we could address. In financial services, we identified a dozen areas that we could address. These are tangible ways to make improvement. Not one of these particular areas is going to change life overall for these sectors, but they all help, and they all came from the sectors. They were the initiatives that were really troubling the sectors.", "The next sectors we’re going to tackle are chemical manufacturing—that has begun already and is ongoing—mining, forestry and tourism. I’m sure we’ll be able to find some good things we can do with those sectors. So I’m excited about where this new program is going, and I think that this program is a really good way to involve all Ontarians in this effort.", "Back in 2014—I want to thank the CFIB again for their leadership on this—the CFIB recommended to us that we put forward an annual report for burden reduction. A couple of years ago now, we put that report forward. What that does is hold our feet to the fire when it comes to regulatory burden reduction. It analyzes what we’ve done to reduce regulatory burden. As well, it analyzes what we’ve done—this was one of the asks of the CFIB—to reduce the amount of time that businesses have to spend fulfilling regulations, filling out paperwork and that kind of thing. We have had that report come forward now, and it has been very helpful to our efforts. So again, thank you to the CFIB for that.", "Another initiative that we embarked upon, one that I was proud to champion, was something that I developed in conjunction with Mayor John Tory. What we realized is that one thing we found businesses saying to us is, “It’s not only the regulations that the province has in isolation that we would like to see reduced or changed; often, it’s regulations or inspection systems that different governments have. Sometimes they contrast and conflict. They’re uncoordinated, and that drives us crazy as businesses.”", "Surely the city of Toronto and the province of Ontario can find better ways of helping folks apply for a restaurant licence, for instance. The current process is phenomenal. Dozens and dozens of different forms have to be filled out, different bodies have to be sought after—surely we can find a way to provide one-window approaches to those kinds of regulatory licensing, dual-government types of responsibilities. So we sat down with Mayor Tory and his departments, and my ministries did the same.", "We weren’t leaving the rest of the province out. This wasn’t a city-of-Toronto-specific initiative. I think all recognize that the city of Toronto is involved in a lot more regulations than many other municipalities, so what we could find there may apply across the province or may not, but a lot of it could be extrapolated, so we also invited AMO to sit at the table with us to participate. That’s a process that’s now well under way in identifying dozens of different ways that we can work better with the other levels of government.", "I’m looking at the clock now, and I turn to my parliamentary assistant. Does that mean that I have five and a half minutes left?" ],

They’re clapping, because I think they’d appreciate that as well.", "So I’m going to move from past to present, and just to sum up by saying that some of what I’ve talked about and our other initiatives have helped us to eliminate 80,000 regulatory burdens through the years. That’s substantial. It’s something to be proud of, but as the Premier said, we need to continue to do more, and that’s what this bill is all about.", "This bill, in all, is a collaboration of many different ministries within our government. I thank all of my colleagues who have participated for bringing forward the measures that they have. It amends more than 40 statutes in supporting our goal of making Ontario more competitive. It’s a bill that comes with a package that, as I said earlier, is one of the most ambitious regulatory burden packages that this province has ever embarked upon.", "One of the centerpieces of this package is something that I say is a method for us to stop the digging. By digging, I mean imposing more regulations. As we remove regulations, other regulations often have to come forward, for all the right reasons, but it’s really important that we build a culture in government, throughout government, that when a ministry brings forward regulations, they’re thinking about the cost to business. So there’s going to be a new stipulation that for every dollar in administrative costs that is incurred by a business from a measure, a new regulation, being brought forward by a ministry, that ministry will have to identify $1.25 in savings. It’s a bit of a barrier, a bit of a governor, for ministries to say, “Go ahead and make your changes. They’re in the public interest, I’m sure. Let’s make sure that they are. But make sure you’re keeping an eye on the administrative costs to businesses as you do that.”", "Another thing that’s in this package is the need to harmonize regulations. That’s something that we need to do across the country.", "Of course, we led the Canadian Free Trade Agreement initiative. We were the first jurisdiction in the world to put in place a mechanism nationally, and it’s in the process, still, of being put in place. The ministers will meet again in the fall to determine the progress that we’ve made on this, but it will happen. It is a mechanism that will mutually recognize regulations across the country. It’s the first time that we’re aware of anywhere in the world that such a structure has been put in place, something that our business community from coast to coast is very excited about.", "It’s more than that. We also have to harmonize regulations with jurisdictions south of the border. What that means is that when we’re putting in new regulations, it doesn’t always have to be a made-in-Ontario solution. We do have to look at best practices across the continent, and we do have to look at the balance of having our own way and the balance of harmonizing what we’re doing with other jurisdictions around the world, in North America, with the United States and across the country. It’s something we need to do.", "Another thing we need to do is consider the unique needs of small businesses whenever we’re putting in regulations, because they have unique needs. They don’t always have the staffing capability or the capacity to be able to respond to some of the demands that are being put on small businesses, so we have to put that small business lens on everything we do as a government and on every regulation we bring in place. This new package will ensure that we do that.", "We need to recognize and reward businesses that have good compliance records. Rather than have widespread enforcement mechanisms that spend time very thinly on a bunch of different businesses, let’s focus more on the bad actors and focus less on those businesses that have good track records. In my view, what that will mean is that it will help our enforcement mechanisms be even more effective.", "We have to ensure, as well, that businesses, when they’re interfacing with our government, can do so easily. Look, we’re in the modern age now. I’d like to think so anyway, and the minister responsible for the digitalization of government will 100% agree. In fact, it’s with her authorization that I can stand before you and say that part of the package is a guarantee that all businesses will now have the ability to interact with government in a digitalized way online, which will help save them time and money. I already have businesses talking about how important that is to them.", "The minister responsible for small business and I have worked very closely on further packages that target small businesses. I don’t have too much time left but I’m going to touch on a few of those and then pass it over to my parliamentary assistant.", "We’re reducing fees for small businesses at every opportunity. There are a lot of niggling little fees that small businesses have to pay for a variety of different items and things. We’re going to do everything we can to look at those fees. Where we can reduce them or even eliminate them, we will do that. We’ve already started to do that with a number of the fees.", "We’ve created a one-window small business service. Approaching government can be intimidating, in particular for a small business person. They don’t have the capacity to have a government relations person on staff. They’re just a business person who maybe has two or three or maybe a dozen or more staff members. They have to contact government themselves. There are too many ministries for them to contact, so we’re creating a one-window approach so that our small businesses will have one place to turn. When they have ideas, when they have challenges, when they have areas where they think that we need to improve in terms of regulatory burden, they’ll now have one window to be able to access that.", "The other area that I hear from small businesses, in particular growth businesses, high-tech businesses and some in health care, is that they don’t only need our support in helping them grow—and we’re there to support them through our small business initiatives and our small business centres, our mentoring programs and whatnot; what they also need sometimes is simply a contract that provides a platform for them with their new and emerging technologies to then take their technologies global.", "Our procurement process in this province has always been very stringent, as it should be. It protects our taxpayers’ interests; it’s very accountable. We need to open up that process so that small businesses can have more opportunities within what is a very lucrative area for businesses, and that’s government contracts, an important area for small businesses to be able to bring forward their innovations. That’s going to help the business of government become more innovative. It’s going to help improve things like our health care system, because we’re going to have the latest and greatest and most modern innovations in our system. But it’s also going to provide our small businesses with an opportunity to grow and be able to go global, once they have the government of Ontario as part of their business platform.", "I am going to stop there, Mr. Speaker, and turn it over now to my trusty parliamentary assistant, who will take us home over the course of the next 27 minutes." ],

I would like to thank the minister for his remarks introducing the second reading of this important piece of legislation.", "Mr. Speaker, if you would indulge me in allowing me to take this opportunity as well to thank the minister for his years of hard work and guidance on this file: Thank you, Minister, for taking on this challenge and this responsibility in ensuring that we’re reducing red tape for businesses right across Ontario, and congratulations on the Golden Scissors Award.", "The minister laid out a very clear case for why burden reduction efforts are essential to keep our economy competitive and open for business. As well, he also described in detail the context that this bill was conceived within and how it furthers the tremendous work this government has done on the file.", "I want to thank the House for this opportunity to go into more detail about the proposed Cutting Unnecessary Red Tape Act, 2017. I know from the minister, from my constituents in Davenport and from my own career in the private sector that businesses want a modern, streamlined and efficient regulatory system. Ontario’s economy is going through a period of generational renewal and modernization. Our traditional sectors are converging with transformative technologies, and we must maintain our competitive edge.", "The Business Growth Initiative is our strategy to accelerate a knowledge-based innovation economy and increase the province’s global competitiveness. This five-year, $650-million initiative is guided by the following principles:", "—creating a strong innovation-driven economy through the development and deployment of advanced technology;", "—catapulting more Ontario businesses forward through scaling up; and", "—lowering business costs through modernized regulations.", "As you can see, Mr. Speaker, cutting red tape is a core pillar of our plan. With this in mind, the Ministry of Economic Development and Growth has introduced a package of legislative amendments that are intended to reduce regulatory burdens and practices that cost businesses time and money, while protecting environmental, health and worker safety standards, while achieving cost savings for our business community.", "The ministry worked with five partner ministries and is proposing amendments to more than 40 different statutes. Highlights of the proposed Cutting Unnecessary Red Tape Act, 2017, include:", "—implementing a number of recommendations from the Business Law Advisory Council to update and reform Ontario’s corporate and commercial law statutes;", "—facilitating electronic delivery service delivery and taking steps to enable proclamation of the Not-for-Profit Corporations Act; and", "—enabling automatic electronic service delivery and issuance of pesticide licences, if prescribed requirements are met.", "I should note that the ministry consulted with a number of stakeholders in the development of this bill, and we have received a positive response that I would like to share for the record. I’m going to quote Richard Koroscil, interim president and CEO of the Ontario Chamber of Commerce. He said:", "“The Ontario Chamber of Commerce (OCC) is pleased to see the Ontario government prioritize the reduction of regulatory burdens faced by Ontario businesses. Building on the success of the Red Tape Challenge, this legislation demonstrates a commitment to the continued competitiveness and prosperity of our province. We appreciate the ongoing partnership between government and the OCC, as we continue to advocate for a reduction in red tape to spur economic growth and development across Ontario.”", "It is clear from Mr. Koroscil’s response that efforts to reduce unnecessary red tape and undue regulatory burden are critically important to the province’s business community. It is an issue that my own constituents have often brought to my attention. It is essential to remember what lies at the heart of this bill: It is about ensuring we have a competitive business environment so that companies invest here in Ontario and create and support the jobs of today and tomorrow. That is what really matters to the people of our province, Mr. Speaker. When we shed overly cumbersome or unnecessary burdens, we are opening the door for more opportunity for the businesses in our province.", "Of course, as the minister mentioned, we know that some regulations are necessary. We are undertaking streamlining and rationalizing the regulations, keeping in mind that we must also protect the environment and health standards, and enhance worker and consumer safety. We have taken a holistic approach across our ministry and the partner ministries to make sure we are safeguarding necessary regulations. Our approach has never been geared towards deregulation. This government strongly believes in the role of regulation to protect community: the public, workers, and the environment.", "It is also true that strong regulation can be good economic policy as well. For example, our agricultural products are in high demand in other parts of the world because of their unparalleled quality and our regulatory system that ensures the highest standards in food safety.", "We firmly believe that the government can reduce the cost of regulation to businesses while maintaining the strong standards that support our quality of life here in the province. To that end, this is the second bill the government has brought forward as part of its commitment to make annual legislative changes that reduce direct and indirect regulatory burden on Ontario businesses.", "You’ll remember that the first annual bill, the Burden Reduction Act, 2017, was passed in March 2017. That act amended more than 50 statutes from 11 different ministries to reduce regulatory burdens and practices that cost businesses time and money, while protecting environmental and health standards and enhancing worker safety. The amendments will provide Ontario businesses up to $31.5 million in savings per year.", "As I said, this bill had input from five partner ministries and is proposing amendments to more than 40 different statutes. I’d like to take this opportunity to highlight some of the burden reduction that will occur across our ministry and our partner ministries should the proposed Cutting Unnecessary Red Tape Act, 2017, be passed.", "Schedule 4 of the bill, if passed, would introduce a brand new act called the Reducing Regulatory Costs for Business Act, which contains the five new burden initiatives that the minister mentioned. To quickly summarize, this act, if passed, will:", "—place a requirement for government to offset new administrative costs imposed on business through a reduction in existing costs;", "—mandate a less onerous compliance framework for small businesses, where appropriate;", "—increase harmonization with other jurisdictions and encourage the adoption of international or national standards, where appropriate, when developing or reviewing regulations;", "—mandate that businesses must have an option to submit documents electronically to the government; and", "—recognize businesses that have a good compliance record.", "These five initiatives guided the design of the overall bill. They support the Business Growth Initiative by modernizing government lines of business, removing unnecessary regulatory burden, and reforming Ontario’s business laws. These are changes that will help businesses large and small to prosper in our province.", "Of course, the question of just exactly how much money will be saved by implementing the changes must be addressed. I’m happy to say the estimated cost savings were quantified for four of the five proposals above that impacted discrete sectors. It is estimated that businesses impacted by these proposals can realize between $6.3 million to $8.9 million in cost savings.", "As I mentioned, this bill is not just the product of the work done by the Ministry of Economic Development and Growth. In order to make real change, we had to coordinate with other ministries. The results, as you will see, are impressive.", "Here is a short synopsis of the changes that our partner ministries will make.", "The Ministry of the Attorney General’s proposed changes include amendments to the Charities Accounting Act that would allow charities to make social investments that help further their purpose and achieve a financial return. The amendments will allow charitable organizations to make social investments consistent with their mission by exempting these types of investments from restrictive prudent investor rules.", "Currently, the law is not clear whether charities can make social investments. The amendments in the bill before us will specifically authorize charities to make such investments. It will give charities more flexibility and another tool to use their assets more effectively. This amendment in particular will position Ontario as a leader in facilitating social investing activities. I should note, as well, that there are a number of safeguards that will be imposed to maintain the public’s trust and confidence in charities.", "As well, a number of amendments will be made to the Courts of Justice Act and the Justices of the Peace Act, including:", "—clarifying that people over the age of 64 may apply to become judges and justices of the peace;", "—designating the Superior Court of Justice to manage complaints against the Small Claims Court administrative judge, including giving the Superior Court of Justice the power to investigate complaints and, if appropriate, discipline the judge for his or her conduct; and", "—making certain tribunal costs orders under the Canadian Free Trade Agreement enforceable as court orders. The change would preserve the ability of Ontario businesses and the Ontario government to challenge trade barriers in other provinces and territories.", "The Notaries Act will be amended to remove the requirement for a non-lawyer notary public to be a Canadian citizen.", "The Juries Act will also be amended to permit electronic options for jurors to return their jury eligibility questionnaires and to receive jury summonses, and the deadline for returning a jury questionnaire will be extended from five to 30 days. The extension of time for jurors to respond to juror eligibility questionnaires was recommended by a committee composed of government and indigenous officials which was established in response to Justice Iacobucci’s independent review of the report on First Nations Representation on Ontario Juries. The committee did extensive consultation in indigenous communities before making its recommendation. The Office of the Chief Justice of the Superior Court of Justice has no concerns about this proposal.", "Other technical and housekeeping amendments will be made to modernize outdated wording in French and English, and to improve accessibility.", "From our partners at the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services there were a number of amendments. The Land Registration Reform Act will be amended to allow electronic registration of survey plans. Electronic submission and registration of plans will reduce the burden on land surveyors, saving mostly small business owners the time and the cost of converting their electronic files to hard-copy plans and delivering those plans to the land registration office.", "The Land Titles Act will be amended to allow for a single name to be used to register documents within the land registration system where that single name is permitted under the Vital Statistics Act and the Change of Name Act.", "The amendments to the Corporations Information Act and a number of other business law statutes will facilitate implementation of the new modern business registration system and ensure that related provisions are appropriately aligned, including:", "—modernizing service delivery and enable electronic access to all modern business registration system services;", "—providing the director with broadened duties and powers to support and implement more efficient and flexible service delivery under a new electronic system; and", "—making amendments to provide greater consistency across the business law statutes and enable a future business law reform agenda.", "As well, the proposed amendments would enable the future proclamation of the Not-for-Profit Corporations Act (ONCA). I would also like to thank the Ontario Nonprofit Network and other stakeholders such as the Ontario Bar Association for their hard work in bringing forward these amendments.", "The proposed amendments to the Corporations Act would enable Ontario not-for-profit corporations to benefit from some of the ONCA features prior to its proclamation, such as allowing notice of members’ meetings to be sent electronically and members’ meetings to be held electronically. These proposed amendments would increase flexibility, encourage participation in meetings, provide clarity and reduce burdens and costs for not-for-profit corporations.", "I would like to thank the Business Law Advisory Council for their recommendations to update and reform Ontario’s corporate and commercial law statutes. The proposed amendments to the Business Corporations Act would increase shareholder democracy and increase flexibility in private corporations.", "The proposed amendments to the Arthur Wishart Act (Franchise Disclosure), 2000 would increase clarity in Ontario’s franchise law, including franchiser and disclosure obligations to prospective franchisees.", "The proposed amendments to the Personal Property Security Act would reduce costs to lenders, lessors and repairers by providing greater certainty.", "The Ministry of Municipal Affairs proposed amendments to the Municipal Elections Act that would provide clarity that compliance audit committees may deliberate in private for the purpose of making decisions. This is important so they may speak freely when they review evidence and submissions. This amendment would provide more consistency across the province and may also prevent the use of stock written decisions that are prepared in advance due to the inability of compliance audit committee members to meet and speak in private.", "I should add that the issue has been raised by a number of municipalities following the release of the Ontario Ombudsman July 2016 report regarding his investigation of the city of Hamilton’s compliance audit committee. As well, the issue was raised by the Association of Municipalities of Ontario, AMO. AMO takes the position that a legislative change is required to address this issue.", "Our partners at the Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change proposed amendments to the Pesticides Act that would transition the pesticide licensing program from paper-based to online service delivery. Licences would be issued automatically online if prescribed requirements are met. This change would eliminate approximately 5,200 paper-based applications the ministry receives each year, providing a faster, more efficient way to get a licence.", "The proposed amendments to the Environmental Protection Act will allow the ministry to make certain information about pesticide licences publicly available online, supporting a transparent and open government. To respond to business needs while maintaining environmental protection, the ministry is implementing an ongoing transformational agenda, using a risk-based approach while reducing regulatory burden on businesses and enhancing program service delivery.", "For the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, the proposal is for the appointment of multiple vice-chairs to the Normal Farm Practices Protection Board. This amendment would increase the board’s capacity to manage the hearing process and shorten wait times for hearings by alleviating the burden of only having two members capable of chairing a hearing. This will shorten wait times for decisions by alleviating the burden of only having two members capable of writing decisions. This is an answer to stakeholders’ frustrations regarding the length of time it takes to bring matters before the board to a resolution.", "The unifying reason behind all of these amendments is the fact that outdated, unnecessary or unclear regulations and their compliance requirements can take businesses away from the important work that creates jobs and grows the economy, and can cost billions in time and money to complete paperwork, fees and expenses.", "The proposed legislative amendments that I just detailed are intended to improve economic efficiency and foster innovation, while continuing to provide strong social and environmental protections. The list of proposed amendments are, at their heart, about simplifying, streamlining and creating more user-friendly services that will improve public protections by making it easier for businesses to understand and comply with requirements, as well as making it easier for ministries to focus on what’s most important.", "Of course, the measures I just detailed are only some of the burden reduction activities the government is undertaking. There is a lot more that is being done in this area. As I mentioned, it is a key pillar of the Business Growth Initiative and as such has been a top priority for our ministry.", "At this point, I think it would be instructive to take a look at some of the other burden reduction efforts we have undertaken.", "We have committed to releasing an annual burden reduction report. The report profiles initiatives that are reducing burdens and making it easier for business and other stakeholders to succeed, including providing more online services, simplifying processes and modernizing regulations. The latest annual report, released on June 27, 2017, features an estimated savings of $152 million and 6.5 million hours to business since 2011. This surpasses, by more than 50%, the government’s target of saving $100 million by the end of 2017.", "As a ministry, we also conducted Open for Business round tables in 10 sectors and addressed 50 priority items, including:", "—reduction in length of the WSIB no-lost-time form, form 7, by 60%;", "—standardized food premise inspection reporting/food handler training programs;", "—speeding up water-taking permits for low-impact construction and road-building projects; and", "—streamlining the number of permits required for development of residential subdivisions.", "We are also implementing measures under Ontario’s regulatory policy to ensure new regulations are well developed and avoid imposing unnecessary costs on business. Tools and processes include:", "—regulatory impact analysis, to ensure costs and benefits of significant regulations are understood before regulations are approved;", "—mandatory review policy, to ensure outdated or redundant regulations with high impacts on businesses are regularly revisited, and amended or eliminated if necessary;", "—twice-annual effective dates, to make Ontario’s business climate more predictable by requiring new regulations affecting business to come into effect twice a year, on January 1 and July 1, so businesses can plan ahead; and", "—a regulatory registry to make business regulations more transparent by allowing 45 days for comments on new regulatory proposals. In 2016, there were approximately 400,000 visitors to the site; 232 postings, including postings on regulatory proposals and discussion papers; and 1,054 comments received from the public.", "There are also a number of initiatives that Minister Duguid mentioned. Suffice to say, this government has a strong plan to root out unnecessary red tape and build a modern, responsive regulatory system that achieves outcomes while minimizing the impact on business.", "Mr. Speaker, this bill will be an important part of our ongoing efforts to make Ontario the best and easiest place in the world to do business. Our government has already been doing a fantastic job of this, and we look forward to continuing this great work. This government continues to create jobs and create prosperity, while at the same time making sure that all Ontarians can share in that prosperity. Our highest priority is to make Ontario a place for businesses to invest and grow so that our children and our children’s children will be able to have the best chance to live long and prosper.", "This bill will help us to create the high-quality jobs that will propel this province into the future. I would like to thank the government for introducing this bill, and I would like to thank all members for their attention today as I detailed some of the many highlights of this very important bill here this afternoon. Thank you, and I look forward to further debate." ],

That’s just a few of the definitions for red tape. But this bill is going to just deal with the unnecessary red tape. So it’s quite interesting that, of course, this bill implies that there must be necessary red tape.", "I think, when reading this bill, the word that comes to my mind is “circumlocution,” in that circumlocution is “the use of many words when fewer would do, especially in a deliberate attempt to be vague or evasive.” We’ve got a roundabout ministry here. There is nothing in this bill that is required to be tabled in legislation to be done. Everything about reducing and having a more efficient bureaucracy is in the minister’s wheelhouse. This bill is an unnecessary piece of red tape.", "I do look forward to continuing the debate on this, and I do have a long list of measures for the minister to consider in his next bill that he brings—" ],

I had a short stint at labour in the last Parliament, and I’m glad to be back at economic development. I know the minister has given many years to public service. On behalf of our caucus—I know I’ve said this to you personally a couple of times—thank you for your contributions to the province and, of course, to the city and the people of Scarborough, and to Canada.", "I also want to thank the minister for sending his team over this morning at 9 o’clock for a ministerial briefing on Bill 154. It gave us enough time to prepare somewhat a one-hour lead this afternoon. We were cutting it close, but we had a very good conversation this morning with the staff from his ministry. They’re a very qualified staff, and you’ve got good people working there, Minister. So thank you for that, and thank you to them.", "I know I’ve spoken about red tape and government rules and regulations many times since I’ve been here—six years—with a lot of it coming from running, owning and operating a small business myself before coming to Queen’s Park. I’m always happy to see legislation coming forward to address red tape. I hear so often from businesses that are fed up with having to focus on dealing with government bureaucracy and compliance instead of growing their business. It’s true: I think all members, when they’re back in their communities or constituencies or talking to their small businesses—often you’ll walk in and you’ll say, “How are things going?”, and they always talk about the fight they have with government over some ministry rule or some government regulation.", "Resources and attention are diverted from seeking new opportunities, innovating products and processes, and finding efficiencies to trying to figure out cap-and-trade and the government’s various energy schemes, or tracking the proposed labour changes, or hand-holding inspectors through redundant evaluations.", "The cost of this red tape to our economy is estimated at about $14 billion. There have been a number of third-party studies that have validated that the cost to the economy is about $14 billion.", "Just to highlight the issues that I face in my riding with one of my local businesses: I left here a couple of Thursdays ago, and there was a grand opening of a business in Strathroy, in my riding. They spent, the owner told me, about a million dollars on this new facility, and he spent $500,000 on modern spraying equipment to paint kitchen cabinets. The engineer was there and the supplier of this equipment was there, and apparently they’ve sold 200 of these $500,000 units across the country, many in Ontario. He went to have his grand opening, and, of course, the inspector was there and said, “Sorry, you can’t operate this.” They needed to spend approximately $30,000 in upgrading this equipment. But the engineer was there and the supplier was there, and they have almost 100 of these across the province—as I said, 200 across Canada.", "A lot of times, from the business perspective, it feels like it depends on who the local inspector is. There needs to be, even across the province, some more—it just needs to have the same standards across the province. Speaker, this is a real and significant issue. It’s not only an impediment to businesses but a deterrent to investment and job creation.", "The Progressive Conservatives support reducing burdensome red tape, eliminating redundancies and streamlining regulations. Businesses in this province have a lot going against them because of this government and the decisions they’ve made over the last 14 years in some cases, like high energy costs. In some cases it was a chaotic regulatory environment to start with. We need to be taking real action here to help them be competitive.", "CFIB conservatively estimates that the cost of regulation in Ontario has grown from just under $13 billion to almost $15 billion from 2005 to 2014. So it’s safe to say this is not an area in which the government truly has excelled over the last 14 years. In saying that, I’m happy—I think this is about the second year in a row that there has been legislation coming forward to deal with a very small dollar amount of savings when it comes to red tape. Unfortunately, again, we have a pretty ho-hum effort from this government on reducing the regulatory burden. This time, it seems this government’s grand gesture to cut red tape only added up to between $6.3 million and $8.9 million in savings for the private sector, which, as I said, is burdened with over $14 billion in red tape costs. So it’s a drop in the bucket, to say the least. And that $6.3 million to $8.9 million, which is savings spread out over the entire Ontario private sector, doesn’t even seem to be based on hard or reliable data.", "There’s nothing in this bill, Speaker, that is going to be prompting a sigh of relief from business owners. There are some overdue changes here, some proposals that I think people would have assumed were in place already, and quite a lot here that will have no impact on the private sector whatsoever.", "That is a problem that has dogged these government red-tape bills. They’re written primarily, it seems, to cut red tape for the government. I mentioned this the last time a red-tape bill came forward. It seems to cut red tape for the government, to ease their own costs or clean up their own legislation. They’re dressed-up housekeeping bills with nice names like the Burden Reduction Act or Cutting Unnecessary Red Tape Act. This bill does more to benefit government than private individuals and businesses.", "I’m very supportive of the idea of regularly bringing forward red-tape-cutting bills, but it would be nice to see something in them that might have a real impact, a true impact, on businesses in the province. Bill 154 is, unfortunately, a pretty benign piece of legislation which mostly reads like a list of goals rather than a plan of action. They are goals that I support but which don’t have the weight to them I would have liked to have seen.", "There are, as the minister and his assistant explained, two parts to this bill. The first is the Reducing Regulatory Costs for Business Act, which consists of five new initiatives to be applied broadly. The second half is omnibus-style legislation that amends many existing acts. Today, I’m going to be focusing my comments on the Cutting Unnecessary Red Tape Act portion of the bill.", "I know there are a lot of proposed changes that affect the Ministry of the Attorney General, the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services, and OMAFRA among others, so I look forward to hearing some more in-depth analysis of those proposed changes from my colleagues as debate continues on this bill. There are some nice ideas in this bill but, frankly, they’re not concrete. It’s a lot of jargon and fluff, promises of making doing business here easier and more efficient, but not really committing to any of the initiatives they’re talking about. It’s like a list of New Year’s resolutions: They’re great objectives but they’re essentially meaningless unless there is real commitment and follow-through, and there’s no mechanism in this piece of legislation for ensuring that that follow through will be here.", "For example, in schedule 4 of the bill, we have measures around the electronic transmission of documents, allowing businesses to submit paperwork electronically instead of having to mail or hand-deliver it. This is something the government has been taking a very piecemeal approach to. We saw some specific allowances made in the last red-tape-reduction bill, for example. They’re chipping away at it. Even within this bill, there’s a specific commitment on enabling electronic service delivery and issuance of pesticide licences. But the broader related proposal in Bill 154, the government says, will make electronic document filing the default and then exceptions would be made on a case-by-case basis. Specifically, when a business is required, for any reason, to submit documents to a ministry of the government of Ontario in order to comply with the regulation, they may, at the option of the business, submit the documents electronically.", "Personally, I would have thought that would already be the norm here in Ontario, that in this day and age this wouldn’t be a measure a government would be introducing with fanfare. I think most people applying common sense would actually think the same. But even this step is not all it might appear to be because in fact this is basically just a suggestion to the ministries, and the government isn’t able to say how broadly it might actually be applied. I understand that while this legislation is being considered, the Ministry of Economic Development is working concurrently with the other ministries of government to implement this, but they can’t say how widely electronic document submission will actually be used.", "Again, it’s a nice thought, it’s a sound thought, something I think most people would take for granted as already being in place, but I hope this will in fact be broadly applied and actually become the norm for the government of Ontario. It’s a good measure, but we’ll have to wait to see whether this proposal has any substantive impact.", "Another measure that sounds good but is “aspirational,” as the Premier might say, deals with national and international standards. The idea here is that government will be encouraged to consider harmonizing new regulations with national or international standards that are already in place instead of coming up with a unique made-in-Ontario standard, which absolutely makes sense. It’s easier for our businesses to sell products to jurisdictions that have the same standards and requirements. It’s easier for businesses to build or create products if they have more purchasing options and so on. That’s what the Canadian Free Trade Agreement was about.", "We absolutely need to get rid of these types of hindrances to business. They’re often arbitrary and needless. But specifically, this bill says, “Where appropriate, recognized standards are to be adopted when developing or amending regulations.” In practice, what this actually means is that when a cabinet committee is looking at a new regulation, they will be given information about whether a proposed standard aligns with another recognized standard or if it is unique to the province of Ontario. The cabinet committee will have that information to consider when they evaluate the new regulation.", "Again, I would have thought that this is something that would be in place already. It’s frustrating to have to stand here and talk about this being be a good idea because it’s such a small step and so common sense and, on top of that, it has no teeth. In terms of harmonizing Ontario standards with other jurisdictions, this is the very bare minimum that could be done. I hope it has an impact. I hope the cabinet committees take this seriously, but once again we’re really just left to hope. There’s nothing concrete in here.", "Along the same line, this bill proposes to reward business that have demonstrated solid regulatory compliance. The exact text reads, “Every ministry of the government of Ontario that administers regulatory programs shall develop a plan to recognize businesses that demonstrate excellent compliance with regulatory requirements.” This is an idea with real potential. It would benefit both businesses and government, if businesses with an excellent compliance record were subject to fewer inspections, for instance—it would potentially mean fewer public and private resources being expended on red tape or, at the very least, that public resources could be more focused on non-compliant businesses. But the language of the bill that ministries should “recognize” businesses that demonstrate excellent compliance, is extremely vague. I understand there are too many programs and instances for the details of such recognition to be explicitly laid out, but it leaves businesses once again to just cross their fingers and hope that this will lead to something useful.", "I want to make sure I address the small business component of this bill as well. The proposal on small business compliance reads as follows:", "“4(1) The Lieutenant Governor in Council and any other prescribed entity that makes or approves a regulation governed by this act that imposes requirements on businesses shall ensure that the regulation includes, where appropriate, less onerous compliance requirements to apply to small businesses.", "“Same", "“(2) Every minister responsible for the administration of a regulation governed by this act shall ensure that when the regulation is reviewed for any reason, a determination is made as to whether the regulation imposes requirements on businesses and, where appropriate, steps are taken to amend or replace the regulation in order to establish less onerous requirements to apply to small businesses.”", "Speaker, it hardly bears repeating, but this is a good idea that depends entirely on the government’s follow-through. We all know the stats: This province has over 407,000 small businesses, and over 87% of people in Ontario are employed by small or medium-sized businesses. They are absolutely vital to our economy and our province’s success.", "These businesses simply don’t have the resources to dedicate to compliance that larger corporations have. With the high cost of doing business in Ontario, many businesses are running as lean as they possibly can with a minimum of staff, so pulling a manager or business owner away from the regular work is a major imposition.", "These businesses have different issues and different risks, and they have been particularly hard hit by this government as they struggle to bear the cost of electricity and are now bracing for a sudden minimum wage hike and the accompanying rise in CPP contributions and other costs. Speaker, they desperately need some relief.", "I think they’ll be pleased to hear that the government intends to start thinking about how regulations will impact small businesses and may perhaps consider making those regulations more reasonable for them, but this is just more wishing and hoping. These measures are not nearly enough, and there’s no guarantee they will lead to anything at all.", "As CFIB pointed out, the government has an approach to calculating the cost of red tape that they’re happy to employ when they’re reducing red tape, but we never get to see the figures on the overall cost of its rules. Responsible governance requires a consideration of costs versus benefits, and accountable governance requires that the public has some idea of how the government is spending their money. Too often, this is simply not the case here in Ontario.", "This bill proposes a small measure of increased transparency by mandating that associated costs of new regulations will be published when a proposed regulatory requirement is posted to the regulatory registry. This is another case where most people probably assumed that the economic impact of a government proposal would exist and be available when that regulation is published for public comment, but somehow this is a brand new concept for this government. If there is one thing this government needs, it’s more transparency.", "I’ve long called on the ministry to become more transparent when it comes to handing out billions of dollars in corporate grants and I’ve been on the record demanding that this Liberal government release all corporate grant recipients going back to 2004. We’re still continuing that fight, but I would urge the minister and his team to release all corporate grants in this province so people can see who got that money. Of course, one of the reasons is because we know, according to the Auditor General, that 80% of the money that was given to these corporations was done on an invitation-only basis, so bureaucrats or—bureaucrats, I hope, not politicians, were inviting companies to apply for corporate grants, and then, secondly, 96% of all that money given out to corporations went to the largest and most successful companies in Ontario. So we need transparency when it comes to corporate grants handed out by this government.", "Of course, on Thursday, thankfully, my private member’s bill calling for transparency on cap-and-trade pricing so everybody in the province can see a separate line item on their natural gas bills—I think, again, that is going to make governments of the day and future governments more accountable to the people of this province. We need more transparency and more accountability here at Queen’s Park.", "But, Speaker, this just isn’t enough. I want to see Ontario being a leader again. Our economy has changed dramatically following the loss of hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs. I’ve long said that this government has no real economic plan for our province. We’ve got soaring hydro rates and the looming spectre of increased CPP that are coming down the pipeline. We’ve got the cap-and-trade scheme. Businesses are finding a lot of disincentives to investing here in our province. The very least the government can do is to get out of the way and allow the innovation and hard work of the people of this province to actually fuel economic growth and the creation of new industries, companies, jobs, products and services.", "On a personal note, coming from southwestern Ontario like a couple of my colleagues that are around me today from Perth–Wellington and Sarnia–Lambton, we’ve seen the devastation of over 300,000 well-paying manufacturing jobs leaving the province. We need the government to get out of the way and reduce the regulatory burden and red tape even more.", "This high level of bureaucratic intervention is made worse by the financial constraints that high debt and ongoing runaway spending are imposing. With inadequate resources to enforce and administer these hundreds of thousands of regulations, people and businesses are left waiting far longer than is reasonable for paperwork and approvals.", "A case of nightmare bureaucracy I may have mentioned before: I heard from a very proactive company that was doing its best to be environmentally friendly. This manufacturer had its facility inspected by a ministry official and was told that there was good news and bad news. The good news was that there were no problems and they were impressed with the facility. The bad news was that the company would have to hire a consultant to the tune of $60,000 to confirm that. Their exact words, I’m told, were, “You just have to pay the money and wait.” Then came the bracing revelation that the waiting could go on for quite some time, because it takes the government up to three years to review the consultant’s report—a true story, Mr. Speaker, right here in Ontario.", "During all that time, companies are expected to freeze their operations so that the report remains accurate, which means no new machinery or processes are to be introduced. It’s ridiculous. What better method could be devised for stifling innovation? When the company raised this as an issue, they were told they should go ahead and make changes, but to hire a lawyer to deal with the issues this would create.", "These are precious resources for companies already pushed to the brink. Why should these companies pay the price for this government’s redundancies and backlogs? It’s another reason why I speak so often about this government needing to get its spending under control and get a handle on the provincial debt.", "Carrying a high debt load comes with many liabilities. It limits a government’s ability to respond to an economic crisis. It defers investment and creates greater vulnerability to interest rate increases, and debt-servicing costs divert funding from very important programs. The repercussions of limited public resources are felt throughout the province, and the economic impact is amplified as it hinders private sector growth.", "There is so much low-hanging fruit for this government to go after on red tape, and I can’t understand why it isn’t here. One example: The member for Leeds–Grenville introduced a private member’s bill a year ago, the Cutting Red Tape for Motor Vehicle Dealers Act, 2016. The bill would have amended the Highway Traffic Act to allow registered motor vehicle dealers to use electronic means to apply for a permit, number plates or a validation for a vehicle, to apply for a new permit for a vehicle, or to apply for a used-vehicle information package. It would have allowed the Minister of Transportation to monitor the success of the program and add more services to the list through regulation. It passed second reading debate with unanimous support, but then died with prorogation. The bill would have helped Ontario’s 1,000 new car dealers save time and money and given them the tools to provide better customer service. Reintroduced as Bill 3, this bill is still sitting on the order paper.", "I know that every member here has heard horror stories in their own ridings about red tape and the time it takes and the onerous costs it imposes, stories about entrepreneurs who are losing sleep over serious problems for their business, caused by obviously ridiculous government requirements. These are companies run by folks who love their communities, who care about their employees, who are struggling right now and are worried about their future because of this Liberal government. The provincial government has done so much in recent years to increase costs and create a chaotic regulatory environment. They need, at the very least, to have some of these hundreds of thousands of regulations peeled back. They need a stronger signal from government that their perspective is heard and actually, truly understood. This bill is not it. This is a get-well card, not a cure. We need more decisive action on the economic fundamentals, to create a competitive business environment here in Ontario.", "Speaker, when I think about this Liberal government, I like to quote former President Reagan, who said, “Government’s view of the economy could be summed up in a few short phrases: If it moves, tax it. If it keeps moving, regulate it. And if it stops moving, subsidize it.” I know that many of us, especially on this side of the House, know that quote quite well. I feel that that’s how this government here in Ontario manages the economy: They increase taxes; they’ve added billions of dollars of red tape; and, of course, we all know that they’re subsidizing a lot of businesses out there but won’t tell the people exactly which companies are getting the grants.", "In the time I have left, I want to touch on just a few interesting newspaper stories that I came across in the short time I was preparing for this one-hour debate this afternoon.", "This one is from May 4, 2016; it’s a National Post piece by Philip Cross. It’s called “When Bureaucrats Run Your Business.” It’s a great article just to highlight the intrusiveness of a bloated government:", "“The growing intrusion of the provincial government into the economy does not stop at taxes and spending. In Ontario, especially, regulation has multiplied, which acts as a tax on consumers and producers because they have to spend resources to comply, even if the burden does not always add to the government’s revenues.", "“It is difficult to convey to people who live outside of Ontario the extent of regulation after over a decade of Liberal government. Statistically, by its own count there are over 380,000 regulations on the books, twice as many as the next province. Their cost extends beyond raising the expense to business owners of every employee, or filling in forms for the bureaucracy, to fundamentally disrupting the relationship businesses have with their customers.", "“Regulations permeate everyday life in Ontario (except, apparently, when it comes to fundraising for political parties). I first began to keep note of their pervasiveness when visiting my tailor to get some alterations done. I thought it would be a simple matter to just drop off a suit. When I went to pass it to the tailor, he recoiled as if being handed something with bubonic plague, explaining that he could not touch clothes that had not been to the dry cleaners, with the tags still on them to prove their sanitary state.", "“My barber recounts that the Ontario government is threatening to force all barbers to undergo training to obtain an occupational licence as a hair stylist.” This is a second story. “Like most occupational licences, this one has nothing to do with his business and everything to do with government collecting $140 in licensing fees. The market has always protected the consumer from barbers who either can’t trim properly or lack a rapport with customers, by quickly driving them out of business.", "“I made the mistake of asking my building superintendent and a tradesman what Ontario’s stupidest regulations were. After talking my ear off for half an hour, they settled on the ‘ladder law’ that took effect last April. This requires anyone working with a ladder to take an online government course—at a $29 fee, of course. The first lesson? Be sure to face the front of the ladder. Never would have thought of that myself.", "“This is bureaucracy at its worst, a fixation on the process of complying with the letter of the regulation rather than achieving the desired result with the lowest compliance burden. My tailor would trust me not to pass him dirty clothes, and I trust him not to take them from me or anyone else; we hardly need tags to prove it. Regulating the details about firms conforming to regulations is often offensive or even insulting to the customer. This hurts the relationship that businesses build with their clients, the very heart of small retail operations.", "Regulations are another example of how government bureaucrats will never understand business. The lifeblood of business is listening, a habit of imaginative engagement with customers and suppliers. The real cost to regulations is that they disrupt this communication between business and clients and suppliers. Instead, we have businesses forced to explain what the government requires instead of what is needed to please the client. And this goes on, Mr. Speaker.", "The presumption is that people are actively trying to get around regulations to behave badly, and what white knight will save the human race from its darker side? The government, of course, staffed with people who supernaturally rise above the predatory instincts that hold sway over the great unwashed masses outside of government.", "Regulation is supposed to provide evidence-based improvements to health, safety and the environment. Instead, as trade expert Michael Hart wrote in a 2012 paper for the C.D. Howe Institute, many are based on the irrational fears that serve little purpose other than to satiate the bureaucratic hunger for information or to accommodate what British blogger John Brignell calls the “march of the zealots.”", "“Businesses must be good at listening to survive. By contrast, Ontario’s Wynne government turns a deaf ear to the growing complaints about the suffocating effect of regulation on business in the province. It seems appropriate that Ontario’s official bird is the common loon; the out-of-control proliferation of regulation in Ontario is completely loony.”", "As I said, this was written by Philip Cross, who is a senior fellow at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute. This was from May 4, 2016, in the National Post: “When Bureaucrats Run Your Business.”", "I’ve got a couple of really good examples too, one more local to me. This was an article in the London Free Press, May 11, 2016, so a while ago. It says, “Ontario Companies Challenged by Rising Energy Prices and ... Regulations.” Speaker, it goes on to say, “Ontario manufacturing ... still faces big challenges, including a growing pile of government regulations.", "“That was the consensus of a manufacturing round table held Wednesday in London and sponsored by the southwestern Ontario branch of Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters.”", "We’ve all talked to many companies who are involved with the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters association. They’ve been to Queen’s Park many times to meet with members of all parties.", "This London Free Press article goes on to say, “The Ontario manufacturing sector has largely recovered from the 2008 recession, association vice-president Ian Howcroft said.", "“During the 2008 recession the value of annual production fell to $230 billion from $300 billion ‘almost overnight,’ he said. But since then it has recovered to $290 billion annually.", "“‘We have had a dramatic turnaround. We are almost back to where we were before the recession,’ Howcroft said.", "“Ontario manufacturers employ 750,000 people directly and support another 1.3 million jobs indirectly, he said.", "“Manufacturers face a number of challenges including a shortage of skilled workers and rising electricity prices, Howcroft said. Ontario’s new cap-and-trade program to limit greenhouse gases and the proposed Ontario pension plan also could put a financial burden on manufacturers, he warned.", "“One subject that irks manufacturers is government regulation.", "“Dave Shaw, an owner of Taurus Stampings in London, said auto part firms have to conform to 1,500 government regulations.", "“The provincial government is asking business owners to take part in an online ‘red tape challenge’ to make suggestions to streamline regulations.", "“The first phase launched March 31 and deals with comments on the parts sector.", "“Shaw said he welcomed the opportunity but it took him three attempts to register on the website. When he got in, there were only five comments on the site, including his own, he said.", "“‘When a businessperson fails once or twice to get on the” government “site—they don’t have time to fool around. I suspect the government will say they have no problems with red tape because there were so few comments.’", "“Peter Durant, a retired plant manager with 3M Canada, said there were positive things the government could do such as launching a ‘patent box’ program.", "“Companies sometimes take industrial innovations developed in Canada and move them to other low-tax jurisdictions, he said.", "“‘Giving a tax break to manufacturing products in Canada would really help.’", "“The meeting also dealt with the potential impact of the upcoming” issues south of the border “to Canada’s largest trading partner.”", "This was a really interesting article. Again, as I said at the beginning of the speech, we all speak to small business owners in our ridings about the burdens of red tape and government interference all the time.", "I also want to bring forward another article that I found in the Globe and Mail, mostly because I like the title. This is from Tuesday, December 1, 2015. The title is, “A Guy Walks into a Bar and Smothers in Red Tape.” This was written, I believe, by the president and CEO of Restaurants Canada. We’ll see how this goes, Mr. Speaker.", "“René Descartes walks into a bar. The bartender says, ‘Can I get you a drink?’ Descartes says, ‘I think not,’ and disappears.", "“‘A guy walks into a bar’ is one of the most popular ways to start a joke, but the reality of provincial liquor policies in Canada is no laughing matter. Archaic laws and restrictive regulations are pushing Canada’s restaurateurs and bar owners to the limit.", "“Every day, these policies restrict product selection, hinder good service and force small business owners to buy alcohol from a monopoly that is often their competition.", "“In every other industry, including food sales and manufacturing, companies that buy in volume are entitled to discounts, relative to customers who buy small quantities. But in the convoluted world of liquor regulations, business owners are charged the same as consumers when they buy alcohol in seven provinces, regardless of the amount they buy. And in one province—Ontario—bar and restaurant owners are charged more than consumers. A customer buying a case of Labatt Blue in Ontario pays about $30”—this is in 2015 numbers—“a bar or restaurant owner would pay $45 for the same case.", "“It’s time to change this. Bar and restaurant owners have to pass their costs along to customers, so a markup on the liquor they buy is eventually paid by the people who eat and drink in their establishments. Inflated prices ultimately drive those customers away. That outcome hurts the public, hurts restaurant and bar owners and even hurts the government, since a profitable food and beverage industry is an important part of a vibrant economy.", "“It’s also an important part of a vibrant community. Restaurants and bars have long been gathering places for people of all ages, stages for local musicians and destinations for tourists. And yet, many of these gathering spots are disappearing.” I know we’re all seeing that in our ridings. “Over the past 11 years, total revenue at bars and pubs has dropped 20%, representing a loss of $548 million. Profit margins in the bar category are almost non-existent at just 3.2%”—" ],

Small businesses are left grappling with regulations that make no sense now, if they ever did. Some of these include a prohibition in New Brunswick against restaurant customers standing while they consume alcohol”—that’s new; I did not know that—“and a Prince Edward Island law that forbids swearing in a licensed establishment. It’s a part of the greater supply management issue that exists in this country, and that keeps Canadian businesses from competing at their full potential.", "“This spring, Restaurants Canada conducted a survey of licensees who represent 3,712 bar and restaurant businesses.

Do they offer a wholesale rate to businesses that buy in bulk? Do they provide a wide range of products? Do they allow liquor to be purchased through a variety of outlets, rather than a single monopoly?", "“The results are striking. Alberta leads the way with a B-plus average, thanks to that province’s broad selection of alcohol products and wholesale pricing. Newfoundland brings up the rear with an F, because of a provincial monopoly that offers poor product variety, prohibits wholesale prices, stalls on issuing licences to new businesses, and conducts routine liquor inspections with inspectors wearing flak jackets. The other provinces fall somewhere in between.", "“We aren’t asking for special privileges. We’re asking for the same kind of volume discounts that other business people receive on a standard basis, so we can pass them along to our customers. We’re asking for a wider and more interesting selection of alcohol products across the country. We’re asking for an easing of the archaic laws that smother business owners in red tape.", "“Because, in the end, does the current system treat small business owners reasonably and does it allow us to offer the best possible experience to our customers? I think not.”", "Again, Speaker, that’s not me saying that; this is the president and CEO of Restaurants Canada, who had this piece in the Globe and Mail on Tuesday, December 1, 2015, entitled, “A Guy Walks into a Bar ... and Smothers in Red Tape.”", "I know we all have examples of red tape. I’ve cited a number of them, but I would like to highlight, as well, the ways other provinces in this country are addressing the issue of red tape and how this government should be following in their example of leadership.", "For example, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business’ 2017 Red Tape Report Card of the provinces and federal government gave the Golden Scissors Award to the BC government for their continuing commitment to remove red tape. Examples of their efforts have included the creation of an annual Red Tape Reduction Day on March 2, 2016. Further efforts in British Columbia have included the repealing of 37 onerous pieces of legislation and the removal of 215 regulatory requirements. Now, that’s real change, and that’s real action on red tape. So in British Columbia, they repealed 37 pieces of legislation. I think that’s very commendable. Further, the British Columbia government also established an innovative product of a permanent button on its website allowing anyone to easily submit ideas to cut red tape.", "The Quebec government received, as well, mentions of distinction for their efforts on red tape reduction by instituting a “culture change” in government, with a recently adopted action plan on red tape, run by a permanent committee co-chaired by the Deputy Premier.", "Further, the province enacted legally binding rules to measure their annual regulatory burden and a requirement that each department and agency is mandated to produce an action plan for red tape reduction.", "In comparison, Ontario was ranked sixth in the national standings with the federal government and provinces like Saskatchewan and Nova Scotia ranked higher.", "In the report, the CFIB even highlighted an example of time-wasting paperwork for individuals in Ontario who are looking to launch a winery. The report states that there are six permits from four different agencies an individual will need to fill out every two years, at a cost of $1,260. There is another permit that will need to be submitted regarding the selling of your wine on your property, another for selling by the glass and another for serving food, which totals $1,800.", "Again, there’s obviously the financial cost, but time is also a cost. The entire process can take up to 12 weeks per permit and requires many official application forms, personal history reports, chemical-analysis fees, site plans and municipal information forms.", "Further, the process can even become more onerous if you are interested in making specialty wines, such as the requirement to have a bee-keeping licence to make milled wine or the requirement that 70% of your apples be grown in Ontario, if you are making apple-based wines.", "Other examples highlighted include the case of one Ontario winery owner who tried to obtain some craft spirits from a local distillery to sell at his restaurant, but because of regulations in place, he could not simply buy the product from the distillery, which is 10 minutes down the road. Due to the regulations that are currently in place, he had to, instead, have the product shipped to him from an LCBO warehouse, where it sat for months before it was sent to the restaurant, ironically, passing the same distillery it was shipped from.", "In the report itself, the CFIB highlights that Ontario “has not evaluated the total regulatory burden recently and has no hard cap on volume or cost of rules in the system” when it comes to red tape reduction. Additionally, the report laments that Ontario is not tracking “any measures of the overall regulatory burden.” Further, the government continues to not track “the cost of additional rules coming into the system”—hopefully this bill is going to deal with some of this—“so it is impossible to say whether the total cost of complying with rules in Ontario has gone up or down.” The CFIB report concludes by calling on the Ontario government to “be careful not to add additional burdensome rules through initiatives like the Changing Workplaces Review”—of course, we’re dealing with that now—“that could undermine its progress on burden reduction in other areas.”", "So there’s a whole host of regulatory issues in the province. I give the government, the ministry team and the minister some credit for at least recognizing there is a problem with red tape in the province. But, again, as I said in the opening, this is going to deal with between $6 million and $8 million of regulatory costs, when the total cost to the economy is $14 billion. This is truly a drop in the bucket.", "I would encourage the government to look to—actually, it was the former Liberal government of British Columbia that did such a great job in reducing the regulatory burden there. They had the Deputy Premier co-chairing the committee that reduced red tape. I think they had a target of one third of regulations that they wanted reduced. Repealing 37 onerous pieces of legislation and the removal of 215 regulatory requirements: That’s a number that I think people can understand, and if you are a small business owner in the province, you would see first-hand that you had a government on your side.", "Unfortunately, in Ontario, with $14 billion in regulatory costs, high energy costs, this minimum wage increase happening in a matter of months, this cap-and-trade system—it just never ends for businesses. I would just caution the government to deal more substantially with the red tape burden in the province.", "I look forward to more debate. We are just at the beginning. I look forward to what my colleagues on this side of the House are going to add to this debate. As the minister said, we’ll get this to committee. Hopefully, he means what he said, that he would take some advice from the opposition on this bill, to further help the small business community in the province of Ontario, because the small business community is under attack. It’s not just the Liberal government here in Ontario; we’ve got their cousins in Ottawa who are really attacking the family farm, farmers and the small business community with these tax grabs that they’re after." ],

The minister, Minister Duguid, started off his one-hour lead, sharing with the member from Davenport, with some sports analogies around “taking a knee” and comparing himself to Leonardo DiCaprio, which I also found to be fairly amusing, as did most people in the chamber, I think, to be fair. To that end, though, I’m going to intersperse one of my favourite performers and songwriters, the amazing Gord Downie, who many of you know is suffering from a terminal brain tumor. He has informed a lot of the Canadiana culture that we appreciate in this country. To that end, a quote from Wheat Kings: “No one’s interested in something you didn’t do.” When the minister compares himself to Leonardo DiCaprio, I have to say that their records are—I think we have this version of looking at the history of what we’ve actually accomplished versus what we actually have done.", "Because this is such a big piece of legislation—it’s another omnibus piece of legislation—I think it’s important to look at the context and the history as to how we got to this place in the history of this province. You certainly will remember, Speaker, because you were here, that the Red Tape Commission was a Canadian body created by the Progressive Conservative government in Ontario in 1996 to deal with the 1995 election commitment to reduce red tape, which they regard as excessive bureaucracy and regulation. I think that this is where you’ll find a little bit of a difference of opinion, because we have strong opinions, as New Democrats, around regulation, especially as it pertains to worker health and safety. But when this commission was started, the original idea was that it was for small businesses and individuals, and to promote business planning within the broader public sector. It consisted of seven Progressive Conservative members of provincial Parliament at the time, six staff members drawn from the Ontario civil service, and they did some annual reviews of all regulations administered by every ministry of the government.", "I think you could actively say that there was some damage caused, particularly around food and safety regulation during those years, by removing meat inspectors, for instance. My good friend and colleague from Windsor–Tecumseh also mentioned Walkerton. It is disturbing to hear some of the members’ say, “Well, those two fellows had drinking problems and that affected the water quality.” You have to remember: Seven people died in Walkerton, if my memory serves me right, and regardless of whether or not they were consuming alcohol, there were no checks and balances, there were no safety measures in place to ensure that quality was ensured. At the end of the day, what is more important than the health and safety of the citizens that we serve, and the quality standards that we all aim to hold true to?", "Also, this original Red Tape Commission was supposed to be a temporary body. The commission was reconstituted in 2000 as a permanent body, and it was chaired by a number of Conservatives of the day. But in December 2003, the newly elected Liberal government discontinued the commission. So we have come full circle, if you will, Mr. Speaker.", "I was also interested to hear how the minister saw the economy right now in the province of Ontario, because, as he mentioned, his respective critics—we meet with businesses all the time. We hear their complaints. We were elected, in this instance, to hold the government to account for some of the promises that they have made to reduce the regulatory burdens in this province.", "Almost every business, but particularly small businesses, who are the job creators in the province of Ontario, with almost 80% of employees in small businesses—the call to streamline and the call to address the chaos of the regulatory framework is real. I’m going to give you some examples, and I’m going to propose some solutions, as I have been asked to do.", "You have to know the environment that you’re working in. Business confidence is suppressed in the province of Ontario. According to the Ontario Chamber of Commerce’s recently released report, Ontario has a business confidence issue. Only 25% of the businesses surveyed are confident in Ontario’s economic outlook, while 64% are confident in their own organization’s outlook. That tells you that they feel like they’re doing everything that they can. They have confidence in the people that they have in their businesses. They have confidence in their ideas and in their innovation. But clearly, only 25% of the businesses are confident that the government is either a willing partner or willing to reduce some of the barriers that exist right now in Ontario.", "They say that the top threats to Ontario businesses are the increasing input costs, especially the cost of electricity. There isn’t an MPP in this Legislature who has not heard directly from businesses around the cost of electricity and the deterrent that those increased costs are to investment in Ontario. The cost of electricity is impacting the retention of employees, the hiring of employees, and the productivity within those businesses.", "Much of this goes back to the political interference in the energy ministry, and also the privatization of energy in the province of Ontario. With the broadening of the ownership, as the Premier likes to describe it, the largest transfer of wealth from the public sector to the private sector happened in this province under the Liberals’ watch. That is going to cost Ontarians hundreds of billions of dollars over the years. To date, the Auditor General, in her 2016 report, cited that we have already overspent on green energy to the tune of $37 billion, because those contracts were negotiated at such a high cost.", "So when businesses cite the high cost of electricity and the impact of high energy costs on their businesses, they look to this government directly as impacting those costs.", "I think we all agree that we cannot have Ontario seen as a place that’s risky to do business, and I think that we can do much better for the people of this province.", "We do have many advantages in this province. We have world-class educational institutions, which are also somewhat being affected by privatization. We have a somewhat stable political and legal system. We had, at one point, one of the strongest health care systems in Canada, which also has been negatively impacted by privatization. And we have a diverse workforce and preferential access to some of the world’s largest markets. Still, within that entire lexicon of the economy, businesses cite our own government as negatively impacting their ability to navigate, really, through the regulatory framework.", "As you move through this act, you actually see, through every schedule—some of it is frustrating because it’s kind of boring. If you look at one of these issues, schedule 3 repeals the Employers and Employees Act and amends the Co-operative Corporations Act. That’s it. Schedule 5, the Ministry of the Environment: It replaces the definition of “minister” and “ministry.” As you move through the acts—there are a couple of problems for us, that we have some questions for the government on.", "Then you get to places like the schedule that addresses the Local Health System Integration Act. This basically says technical French and accessibility amendments under this part—it just replaces a chart with a clearer chart. So sometimes you scratch the surface and you get a little more surface.", "I think what people would like to see when they see pieces of legislation which are looking to streamline and update and modernize—certainly, the Local Health System Integration Act. When you look at all of the services in our health care system that have been now contracted out, and you lose the accountability and the transparency and, quite honestly, the ownership of delivering those services—and my colleague was referencing a constituent in his riding, where services were not delivered. There are so many people who come into my office in Waterloo who are fighting just to see a level of care from our local LHIN—and to their credit, the LHIN came and met with me, because I’ve been documenting and working with the liaison officers on a lot of this, and it is probably the most complex bureaucracy that this government has ever owned, or broadened the ownership of.", "When you talk to the LHIN, there are good people who work there, obviously. When they’ve contracted out, though, to those third-party contractors, the care partners, if you will—and I asked them, “Why can you not ensure that those third-party contractors are actually delivering the services that you’ve contracted them to do?” They said that sometimes they have a carrot and sometimes they have a stick, but they have no true ownership over the quality of the services.", "An elderly lady was supposed to receive 90 hours a month of PSW care. The level of care that she is getting directly impacts the quality of her life. The LHIN could not make sure that CarePartners, which is making profit by doing this work, were doing the work that they were contracted to do. So when you have these agencies that are in the middle—and their goal is to make money, because they are businesses. The Auditor General, to her credit, also found that bureaucracy and administration and a profit agenda were eating away at the health care budget.", "I think my point in addressing the Local Health System Integration Act is that you can tinker around the edges around the health care system but there are substantive changes that need to happen.", "Just to sort of recap, though, around Bill 154: There is potential here to recognize and be respectful of the voices of small businesses who have come forward and said, “You are making life too difficult. These regulations do not make sense.” To be truly consultative in that regard is to be respectful of those voices and to see the changes reflected in the legislation. To date, we have not seen this.", "I think my colleague mentioned that 37 onerous pieces of legislation are dealt with here.", "I think that the context is also important. For some reason, this government has decided to wake up and say, “Okay, do you know what? After 14 years, we’re going to look at the red tape. We’re going to look at these regulations, and we’re going to go through the motions and try to determine what can make a difference.” But this cannot be done when you amend—it’s actually 40 different pieces of legislation in a single omnibus bill.", "The last time the Liberal government presented a bill like this, it was the Burden Reduction Act, which tried to privatize Ontario Place lands. There are still many outstanding questions about that piece of legislation. After a move like that, and with the government willing to profit off of shared public goods, it’s reasonable to be wary of pieces of legislation as large as this.", "It begs the question: Why did it take so long to table these amendments?", "Much of the bill talks about allowing electronic delivery of services. It’s 2017. If you tour your local hospital and you ask them how the eHealth experiment is going, they will tell you, quite honestly, that there are serious gaps after $8 billion. When eHealth was first started—I believe this actually caused the resignation of a minister at the time. The mismanagement of the electronic files within our health care system is truly embarrassing. That you can go to a doctor and those files cannot be shared, that the privacy agreements have not been worked out, that the computer systems are incompatible, and yet many of the amendments contained within Bill 154 have to deal with allowing electronic delivery of services—my point is that it’s nothing, really, to brag about.", "Many of these regulatory reforms should have been done long ago. We need a government that is responsive to our changing society and economy.", "We have some genuine questions, and I hope that the parliamentary assistant can address some of these. Will these amendments reduce the cost of doing business for Ontario businesses while maintaining the public interest? That’s the tension point, I think, around regulations in some instances. Are these regulatory changes enough? Do they go far enough? Is there room to improve? Is there room to take it one step further?", "As I’ve already mentioned, the cost of doing business for Ontario continues to rise. Since 2006, as I mentioned, electricity is a major driver. Off-peak electricity prices have increased by 150%, and according to the Ontario Chamber of Commerce’s most recent annual report, this still is a major factor.", "So we see these changes and some of them, obviously, we have concerns about. But in many respects, it’s a bit of a missed opportunity to take one step further.", "I think this is the tension that we bring to this debate—that we need to find the balance between regulations that are cumbersome and frustrating and deter investment and the regulations that are necessary.", "We also have the very real issue in this province of some regulations, particularly around health and safety, not being met.", "I would like to just give a quick shout-out to Toronto Star journalists Sara Mojtehedzadeh and Brendan Kennedy, who did the exposé called “Undercover in Temp Nation.” If we’re going to be talking about how regulatory burdens are monitored in the province of Ontario, if they’re upheld, we have to talk about enforcement. This particular story stuck with me because it incorporates many of the amendments that are contained within Bill 154.", "I’ll just remind the Legislature about what “Undercover in Temp Nation” was about:", "“Amina Diaby died last year in an accident inside one of the GTA’s largest industrial bakeries where, the company says, worker safety is its highest concern.” This was a 23-year-old woman. She “was one of thousands of Ontarians who have turned to temporary employment agencies to find jobs that often come with low pay and little training for sometimes dangerous work.”", "I raised the food processing because this was part of the consultation process that the minister had raised. He said, “We have looked at the food-processing industry and we’ve looked at those regulations.” He specifically mentioned good compliance records. Well, for this company, I’ll just say: On her first day—it was at Fiera Foods, which is an industrial bakery—she said it was reeking “of yeast and is alive with the constant drone of machinery” and that they were “forming and packing raw, circular pastry.” It’s important because this company does not have a good safety record. The journalist who came into the factory described that pace of the work as “crushing.” This company “has also received some $4.7 million in government loans and grants to expand capacity and create good jobs. The company says all employees are given ‘in-depth training’ and that Fiera has invested half a million dollars in health-and-safety initiatives over the past ... years.”", "Well, what we learned when this journalist went undercover is that this is completely untrue. In total, this particular temp worker got five minutes of training to work on major industrial equipment. She’s “paid in cash with no deductions or pay stubs.” She picks up her paycheque “from a payday lender, a 35-minute bus ride from the factory.”", "It’s important to state that “Fiera has been slapped with 191 orders for health and safety violations over the past two decades, for everything from lack of proper guarding on machines to unsafely stored gas cylinders.”", "At least a dozen of the women who were just working on the one line with this one journalist were hired through temp agencies: “Temp agency workers are changing the face of labour in Ontario.”", "So if you want to talk about where we need stronger regulations, if you want to talk about where we need enforced regulations, it would be in a company like this, a company that received government money—$4.7 million is not a small amount of money.", "She goes on to say:", "“In workplaces around the province, the use of temp agencies limits companies’ liability for accidents on the job, reduces their responsibility for employees’ rights, and cuts costs....", "“In August, charges were laid against Fiera Foods under the Occupational Health and Safety Act for the 2016 death of” the temp agency worker I mentioned.", "But this is a huge loophole. This is where you would need a regulatory sanction to ensure that workers are safe, to ensure that a third-party payday lender doesn’t pay workers in cash.", "I have to say, this piece is not just about this one company. The author writes, “Fiera is far from alone in its reliance on agencies. Over the past decade, the number of temp agency offices opening across Ontario has increased by 20%, with some 1,700 operating in the GTA alone...”", "It’s important for this House to know that temp agencies have increased 20% in Ontario over the past decade. So this is okay? Is this the kind of economy that this government wants to create?", "When I go through a piece of legislation like Bill 154, I think it’s important for me, as a member of provincial Parliament, to learn and to be educated about the reality of workers in the province of Ontario and to determine the role of regulations and legislation on those workers and those working conditions.", "But I think it’s important for the House to learn that temp agencies like this—the 20% increase—“make their money by placing workers at companies at an agreed-upon rate, billing the client for temps’ wages, plus a markup for themselves....", "“Temp agency employees are some of the most ‘vulnerable and precariously employed of all workers’....", "“Temps can be terminated at a moment’s notice.... Companies who use them are liable along with their temp agency for unpaid wages, including overtime and vacation pay, but not for most other workplace rights.”", "So if you want to talk about improving the world of work for the citizens of this province, this is a major gap in that.", "She goes on to talk about some of the working conditions. I think that people should know that, as it relates to the WSIB, “While temp agencies are traditionally associated with casual office work, stats from the WSIB”—she had to FOI this information—“show the majority of temps are now being placed in other sectors, including non-clerical, construction, restaurant and driving jobs.", "“The Star also asked the WSIB for injury data filed by non-clerical temp agencies—those operating in sectors like manufacturing, warehouse and health care—and comparable workplaces. The statistics show non-clerical temps were more than twice as likely to get hurt on the job in 2016” as non-temps.", "Even when they get hurt, though, even when these people, who are vulnerable, who are precariously employed, get hurt in the workplace, they don’t file compensation claims because they are afraid of losing their jobs.", "I raise this as an example, with this particular company and the deaths now of three workers at this company—this company that has received government money—to point to the fact that there are regulations that are needed to be enforced, that are needed to be monitored. I think that’s an important piece to bring to this debate.", "There are good ideas that are out there. In our last platform, we had the job creation tax credit, which gave a tax credit amount to a small business when they hired somebody. One of the big issues in the province of Ontario is youth actually getting in the door, having that experience. We wanted to partner with employers across this province by saying, “If you’re going to hire someone, we’re going to reward you with a tax credit.” That idea was received very well by small and medium-sized employers across Ontario. We also proposed a reduction in the small business tax.", "You have schedule 4, which will be really interesting. Schedule 4, just for those who are interested, is the Reducing Regulatory Costs for Business Act. Obviously, this is one of the more substantial parts of the bill.", "One area of concern is that this act requires that ministries, when appropriate, use less onerous regulatory requirements for small businesses and adopt nationally/internationally recognized standards when developing or amending legislation.", "These two things, just as an FYI, are sometimes incompatible. Many small businesses do not have the capacity to meet international standards because they are not international companies. They are Ontario companies providing services in the province only.", "I have a direct example to highlight this piece. This summer, I had the opportunity to meet with a number of IT consultants who were concerned about losing their contracts with the provincial government because of an update to international standards. I would like to get their story on the record, because this is a disconnect with this government, a tangible disconnect between the reality that small business owners face and their interaction with this government.", "On May 25, 2017, the Ontario government proposed changes to the vendor of record—the VOR—qualifications for I&IT services. You’ll remember that these changes came about as a response to the Auditor General’s 2016 report, chapter 3, section 3.13. The AG had recommended several changes to Supply Chain Ontario and their procurement practices. The list of vendors of record in the IT service category is set to decrease. This is important: It’s set to decrease from 316 vendors to 10. According to Minister MacCharles, the drastic reduction of vendors is a result of how her senior advisers interpreted the recommendations in the AG’s report.", "New qualification criteria are going to be quite challenging for small and medium-sized enterprises to meet. Just to give you a benchmark, bidders must generate revenue of at least $25 million. Bidders must provide three reference clients where they provided a minimum of 250 on-demand IT resources each within a 12-month period. Reference contracts must be for a duration greater than 12 months.", "What essentially is happening here is that the government consulted with 10 of the largest IT providers to the government of Ontario and determined that all of that work was going to then go to those 10 vendors, who are then probably going to subcontract out to the other 316 vendors.", "That’s not instilling confidence in a relationship with the business community from the government’s side of the House. This is generally seen as a huge betrayal of the work that has actually happened here.", "When I met with the group in the summer, they explained their genuine concerns to me. At the beginning of my talk, I spoke about the government’s effort to ensure best practices when it came to our regulatory environment. This is an example of a lack of consultation with businesses. In this case, it was not done, and this change cannot be seen as a demonstration of best practices. Indeed, one of the core principles of procurement—supplier access—was completely ignored in this case.", "Supplier access is supposed to guarantee that suppliers are treated fairly and equally, and have open access to compete for government businesses. In this case and with the international standards, suppliers were unfairly disadvantaged to their size. So you have a government, once again, picking winners and losers and, in this instance, favouring larger IT providers, who in turn are probably going to subcontract out to the smaller providers. That doesn’t address the core concerns of the Auditor General.", "I did write to the minister about this and I raised these concerns. Quite honestly, New Democrats have a huge concern of 316 IT businesses going out of business. I asked her to review the renewal program and the process and consult properly with small and medium-sized IT businesses before proceeding further. I did, of course, mention that, “In the report, both your ministry and the Treasury Board Secretariat agreed with the AG’s recommendations to make the procurement process more competitive, efficient and effective. In reality,” the Minister of Government and Consumer Services’ “proposed solution limits the number of eligible VORs, making the process less effective and less competitive.”", "You have a very large piece of legislation, an omnibus piece of legislation, with the stated goal from the minister and the parliamentary assistant saying, “We want to work with business, we want to consult with them, we want to honour that consultation,” and then you have action—you have action that actually is going to hurt small businesses.", "I made it a point of saying, “While I agree with the AG that in order to maximize government savings, more IT services should be provided by in-house” workers, “I also believe that the solution to problems in the IT procurement sector are not found in the exclusion of small and medium-sized IT companies from the bid process.”", "I go on to say, “It is astonishing that” this is the government’s response to the AG report “by effectively firing over 300 small and medium-sized IT businesses by establishing a VOR criteria that shut out all but the ... largest IT firms.” So much for supporting small businesses in the province of Ontario.", "I did receive a response saying—not much, actually. She says, “The draft model was informed by a number of factors” including the AG, “as well as key findings from extensive consultation and research into the public and private sector best practices for the provision of IT services.”", "When this government starts talking about best practices and essentially public-private partnerships, we lose faith almost immediately. You’ll remember that the Auditor General found that public-private infrastructure projects in the province of Ontario—that we had effectively paid $8 billion more in those contracts. Under the guise of risk transfer, this government decided to spend up to 28% more than they actually needed to on those infrastructure projects, which, I may remind you, reduces the investment that you have for infrastructure on a go-forward position, compromises the confidence that Ontarians have in our infrastructure projects and, to add insult to injury, the last three budgets that this government has tabled in this House promised infrastructure investments, and every single year, this government underspent by almost $3 billion. All this was in the context of, “We need to sell off Hydro One to fund infrastructure.”", "So you will excuse us, respectfully, for having serious confidence issues in a government that says they want to reduce red tape, address regulatory burdens and streamline the process, but then at the same time turns around and tangibly, with action, reduces the ability for small and medium-sized businesses to bid on work that actually happens here in the province of Ontario. We have some concerns, certainly, about that disconnect.", "There are some amendments to schedule 6, similar amendments to various corporate acts, that were a little concerning to us. This actually goes to the point around this particular schedule, which makes amendments of an administrative nature to the following acts: the Business Corporations Act, the Corporations Information Act, the Extra-Provincial Corporations Act and the Limited Partnerships Act. Within this schedule, there is a worrying amendment:", "“The minister or a person designated by the minister receives the power to enter into agreements authorizing a person or entity to provide business filing services on behalf of the crown, the government, the minister, the director or registrar, as applicable, or other government official.”", "This allows the minister, or an individual designated by the minister, to sign off on business deals that the government is making. This is a genuine question: Who would these individuals be? Who are these designates who can sign off on these agreements? At first glance, this appears to be setting the stage to streamline the outsourcing of more government services." ],

  "text" : [ "I know: Say it ain’t so.", "It raises concerns, because this government has a terrible track record, a shameful track record, on the outsourcing of government services, from Ontario Works to the contracting out of lab services in our hospitals; the privatization of our energy sector; the contracting out of services for our most vulnerable disabled adults in the province of Ontario to corporate caregivers; the embracing of the corporatization of child care and early learning, which is actually traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange in the province of Ontario.", "This is definitely a concern. I have heard time and time again from constituents in Kitchener–Waterloo that privatized public services do not meet their standards. The people in this province are not satisfied with the level of services when they are privatized, whether it’s the long list of user fees at the Serco DriveTest centres or the sell-off of Hydro One. The constituents in this province—in my riding, in particular—are frustrated that the government’s services are no longer being provided by the government, that there is that lack of accountability, of direct ownership of those services.", "I get complaints in my constituency office quite frequently regarding the poor-quality services at some of these agencies. Constituents have come to my office to vent their frustrations, and they feel frustrated because they come to the government and the government says, “No, I’ve contracted that out. That’s that other agency’s job.” But the responsibility still falls to this government.", "In many respects, especially for seniors—I think that they’re very vocal in this regard—they see that this government has abdicated their responsibility, particularly on health care, to other arm’s-length agencies, with the goal of saying, “Oh, I can’t directly address that, because that is that agency’s responsibility.” What we’ve seen with the third-party deliverers of personal support workers is that there’s a lack of direction; there’s a lack of accountability; there’s a lack of ownership in that regard, and that is not going to be fixed by absorbing the CCACs into the LHINs and creating sub-LHINs. That will only be fixed when a new government is elected and says to the people of this province, “We are going to ensure that you do get those 30 hours of personal support worker time every week, because we are directly responsible for it. We’re not going to abdicate our responsibility to the most vulnerable people in the province of Ontario. We’re not going to let a company gather profit over the services that we’ve contracted them to do. We’re going to remove the profit agenda from the health care file, so that we can actually have the funding to ensure that people don’t”—like the poor woman in my riding who had to stay in a bed for 17 hours because no personal support worker came to address her. It’s those kinds of privatization stories that concern me.", "And language matters; I say it often in this House. When I have constituents who can’t afford to take a driver’s test so that they can drive to and from work or drop their kids off at school or daycare, that is a problem. So when we have legislation that appears to open the door to more private business involvement and government, I justifiably get concerned.", "The sell-off of Hydro One is a perfect example of how the privatization of government services does not provide the benefits to the people of this province. As I said, it is the largest transfer of wealth from the public sector to the private sector in the history of this province, although I must say, once we fully analyse the energy file in Ontario and we reflect back on some of the decisions this government made, I’m sure we’re going to see larger numbers, especially with this new scheme of reducing hydro by a so-called 25% reduction.", "I will get to schedule 9, the Arthur Wishart Act. The history on this, because context does matter, is that this piece of legislation was originally put forward by MPP Tony Martin back in 2000. The bill was designed to set new ground rules for the often tense relationships between franchise chains and the entrepreneurs who invest in their outlets. This was a new learning opportunity for me, I must tell you, but the NDP is always proud to stand on the side of franchise owners and ensure that small business owners have all the tools that they need to succeed. I still have some questions about these amendments and how they will benefit small business owners, and I hope the minister will be able to clarify that as soon as possible. But there does appear to be an amendment, under the guise of cutting red tape, which seems to be giving more protections to the large franchise owners, creating a power imbalance and definitely a lack of transparency with the smaller franchises.", "When this originally happened in 2000—this article is actually called “Working Life: The Struggle for Franchise Law Ends in Compromise.” This was the last time that the franchise legislation was attempted to be revised in this House—and some people were here.", "This is from March 30, 2017, and says, “Ontario legislation comes into force this fall that sets new ground rules for the often tense relations between franchise chains and the entrepreneurs who invest in their outlets.", "“The law, approved last month by the province’s Legislature, turned out to be weaker than many franchisee advocates would have liked.", "“But it will still have a significant impact. More than one third of the estimated 1,300 Canadian franchisors are based in Ontario....", "“Other provinces—notably British Columbia—are known to be waiting for Ontario’s law and will probably enact similar”—now they’ve made a stronger piece of legislation to protect soon-to-be franchise owners.", "“The law, which was passed after a last-minute deal had been forged in committee, brings to a close a 29-year-old effort to regulate the sector.” It shouldn’t take 29 years to bring a regulation in to create some clarity for someone who wants to buy a franchise.", "“It sets basic rules for franchisor behaviour.", "“It forces those who sells those who sell franchises in Ontario to disclose basic information to new franchisees at least two weeks before the agreement is signed....", "“It prohibits franchisors from punishing members of their systems who participate in franchisee associations.", "“It imposes on both parties ‘a duty of fair dealing’....”", "But at the time, even back in 2000, Mr. Speaker, “as some franchise lawyers and industry insiders have pointed out, these basic requirements address only the sector’s bottom-feeders—those who” were in this sort of arena, this sector, who were actually disrespectful to the people who were buying franchises.", "In committee, NDP MPP Tony Martin” at the time “had pressed hard for legislation that would also regulate numerous details of the franchise relationship, such as territorial encroachment, renewals and dispute resolution. But government members” at the time “believed such an approach would unnecessarily intrude on business contracts, namely franchise agreements.”", "It’s interesting that they had this opportunity to regulate these franchise agreements in order to make the system more fair, but that’s when the Conservatives were in power, and they chose not to truly regulate this field. They chose to inform, not regulate.", "We have an interesting history here in the province of Ontario on addressing regulations and regulatory burdens. You have areas like safety, where the regulations should be strong; they should be enforced. Workers should be protected, as in the example that I gave to you with regard to Fiera, this company in the GTA.", "You have opportunities where you have legislation that you can make stronger, clearer and more transparent for businesses in the province of Ontario. When there is clarity, most businesses would say, “Okay, at least I know the rules of engagement.”", "When you look at what the Ontario Chamber of Commerce has said around trying to connect the priorities and the content of this bill, and to bring the voices of small businesses into the debate, and the stresses they feel under the current government, this bill does fall short. It does not address the red tape.", "We should define what that is. “Red tape” is those regulations that clearly do not make sense. The member from Timiskaming–Cochrane referenced that: Why can a farmer sell his produce in one market down the street, and then not in another one not that far away, if it’s considered safe to do so?", "In the 2017 pre-budget consultations, the Ontario Chamber of Commerce had identified four priorities. They said they wanted to demonstrate fiscal prudence and sound budget management; they wanted to address the infrastructure deficit; and they wanted to foster conditions for increased business competitiveness.", "The most common and acute concern of the small business community in Ontario are those rising input costs. When you look at this piece of legislation, as my colleague had said, there’s about $6 million to $8 million in savings through these amendments. In a budget the size of Ontario’s, it really is a very small amount. I think the business community, and genuinely so, is so desperate for some signal from this government that they’re willing to come to the table, that they are embracing the consultation process. But, really, in the vast scene of the economy of the province of Ontario, $6 million to $8 million is not a lot of money.", "I think that’s a missed opportunity. Even when this piece of legislation gets to the committee—we have seen this government not be very receptive to some of the ideas that we have brought forward. Many of these people, many of these companies and these businesses, have been coming to this government for a long time. Having gone through the finance committee process many times now—I’d look at a company, or an organization like Ontario Bioscience Innovation Organization, where they’re using the same language as the government is right now. I share in that language, but the action piece is very different than the stated goals, and I’ve already given two examples.", "OBIO says, “The global drive to build knowledge economies has probably never been stronger and regional governments are designing ever more programs and policies to compete for talent, investment and the economic and social benefits that come with success.”", "Also, “two major roles for tax policy in alleviating part of this challenge,” like “attracting investment into Canada’s health science companies.”", "One of the reasons that I’m so passionate about bringing the voices of OBIO to this Legislature is that these are companies who will also improve the health care system. These are companies where they have received some start-up research money. They have developed amazing ideas. I know that the stand-in Speaker right now has attended some of these meetings. These are good companies. Their goal is to improve the health care system. We’ve made some initial research funding available to them, although that process is still very complicated. But then they can’t even get into our own hospitals, right? So we’ve walked along with them, encouraged them to become good companies, encouraged them to be innovative and efficient, and we’ve used the same language as them, but they can’t get into the hospitals just down the street on University Avenue.", "They have some recommendations. This is not the first time that the government members will have heard these recommendations around regulatory burdens. OBIO has been coming to this Legislature consistently for five years.", "One of their recommendations is to “develop and adopt best practice guidelines for IP and government funding, based on standard market terms and global investment practices.”", "They say action is required. There remain challenges related to IP policies and government funding programs that currently limit or impede the flow of capital. Best practices guidelines on how to improve the flow of capital to IP and through granting programs are required. Five years they’ve been here asking for some of these things.", "Recommendation 2: “Create innovation procurement demonstration projects at Ontario institutions to showcase how innovative technologies from local companies can be acquired through the existing BPS guidelines.”", "The action that is required is to develop demonstration projects for how hospitals can use the existing broader public service guidelines for procurement in Ontario to successfully achieve a value-based, versus solely cost-based, assessment and acquisition of novel health technologies from local companies.", "Essentially, these companies want to strengthen the local economy. They are hiring. They struggle to scale up in this province, particularly around manufacturing, and as I indicated, the cost of electricity for some is an issue. But mostly it is regulatory burden, and it stands in the way of improving our health care system. It stands in the way of growing the local economy.", "The government can use the same language and say that we all want the same thing, but they had an opportunity to reduce the regulatory burden of the health sector, particularly around innovative technology, and they did not.", "The third one, and I’ll leave it at this, is to “establish a roster of ‘early adopter/innovation’ health service providers in Ontario to accelerate the assessment, refinement, and adoption of novel health technologies from local companies.”", "They are basically begging the government to look at their products, which the government has in many instances invested in through research grants, and apply them, test them and put them in the market. The action required is to designate an early adopter/innovation hospitals or health service providers in Ontario that would be recognized as institutions that are open to engaging with industry to test, co-develop or adopt novel technologies that will improve health care delivery to Ontarians. These designated hospitals would have different criteria for funding to ensure that they are not penalized as early adopters.", "They’re basically asking the government not to hurt them, not to hold a grudge against them and not to, as it says, penalize them for being innovative, for trying to grow in the health science sector, to apply that knowledge outside of academic institutions, to transfer that knowledge into the field and to benefit, ultimately, the good people of this province.", "I always use Class 1 as my example. Hospital-acquired infections have a huge impact on our health care budget; at last count, it was $4 billion in costs accrued to hospital-acquired infections. Class 1 is a company in Cambridge. I brought our leader to tour it, and the member from Cambridge knows it well. They have UV technology that reduces germs, which actually keeps people healthy.", "You shouldn’t go into a hospital and get more sick. You shouldn’t go into a hospital and not come out of that hospital if you are able to be cured. But obviously hospital-acquired infections are an emerging issue. Why would the government not incentivize the application of that technology to keep people healthy but also to invest in our companies that are right here in Ontario?", "By the way, that company is doing very well in other jurisdictions like the United States and Europe because they recognize that that’s a good investment. It’s a preventive piece of technology which keeps people healthy—and saves money and creates jobs. It really isn’t rocket science. But the health science sector is particularly burdened by onerous regulations that prevent them from being successful, and that, of course, is not addressed in Bill 154.", "I feel genuinely bad for this organization, because they’ve come here five years. Everyone always quotes them; they applaud them; they laud compliments on them. Yet you have a piece of legislation here which actually could help them—and maybe that will be possible once we get it to the committee.", "This piece of legislation is going to pass—there’s a majority government here—regardless of our concerns. That’s always the thing, right? The government likes to point out, “Well, you didn’t vote for that piece of legislation” when they have omnibus pieces of legislation. Even if 90% of it is good and there’s 10% that isn’t, that prevents us from supporting it, like some of the last budgets where there was a cut-off for the children who have autism, or there was the seniors’ drugs issue that came up in the budget before that. So there’s always something, and you do it on purpose." ],

They want to know the rules of engagement. They want to be able to navigate the regulations that are necessary, and they want to be able to deal with, in a very streamlined way, the regulations that they see are not.", "We may not always agree on what is necessary and what is not.

You can call it red tape; you can call it a regulatory burden, what have you.", "But the example that I’ve spent a considerable amount of time on today, “Undercover in Temp Nation,” is a serious issue.

This bill ensures that we’ll bring regulations into line with national or international standards so that it is easier for Ontario companies to sell to the world.

As I was sitting here thinking about what I was going to say, I remembered that 10 years ago almost now, one of the first people I met down here, who had a reception or a meeting, a lobby day, whatever you want to call it, was a gentleman—I don’t remember his name now—from the logging industry. They ran a mill up in the north. Hopefully, it’s still open; I don’t know now. That was my first exposure to red tape, and this isn’t all Ontario government. I think at the time he said that he had five different reports that he had to do. He had a young man or woman who did nothing but fill out reports. There was a provincial report, then there was a stumpage report, then there was a federal report, and then the municipality had to have one. He said, “I wish they all had the same lines so I could fill them in. But everybody’s is just a little different,” probably to justify their job, I suppose, or why they were doing it.", "That was my first experience when I came down here. I thought: How the heck could anybody run a business like that? He said, “I’d like to have those guys working in the mill or in the yard, but I have these people running around. It can’t even be the same guy because sometimes they come on the same day.” That was a good example of red tape when I first came here.", "My time is almost up, I see. But I did want to speak about how I do commend the government and they are finally recognizing—I think I ran three elections on reducing red tape. They’re on the road to Damascus. They’ve finally awoken and, hey, there’s always hope for this government. Maybe yet they’ll get rid of a lot of these red tape reductions.", "I do thank the members for their comments and look forward to the rest of the debate." ],

I must say, listening to our government lead-off with the Minister of Economic Development and Growth, that I think that we can all see the tremendous success that he, personally, as a minister, has had in encouraging business to invest here in Ontario. The type of energy he has put in that portfolio has been absolutely remarkable, so we are enjoying a very strong economy here in Ontario. There’s no question that we want to make sure that everyone has the opportunity to participate in this growth that we’re seeing in our productivity and so on.", "One of the ways that we want to do it is to ensure that we reduce outdated unnecessary regulations in order to help businesses, so that they can focus on their role in growing our economy. Now, of course, we do need to do this extremely carefully. The members of the third party have alluded to when perhaps there is not sufficient regulation in some particular businesses. I’m very conscious of that need to look at regulation extremely carefully, because one has to ask oneself: Why was the regulation put there in the first place? Was there perhaps a health and safety issue?", "I first remember meeting the member from Oxford in his role in the previous government, when he was tasked with looking at reducing red tape for the Harris government. I must say that in that particular time, there was some slashing of regulation that resulted in harm.", "In fact, as the medical officer of health for York region, I remember always receiving the reports of water testing in my jurisdiction to make sure that, in fact, water was safe to drink. In slashing a number of those regulations, of course, this was a contributory factor. When medical officers of health no longer received results from water testing, we had the Walkerton tragedy, and people unfortunately passed away. We do need to look very, very carefully, so that when we do reduce red tape or regulatory burdens on business, we also look across the spectrum and ensure that, in fact, health and safety is absolutely paramount.", "Our government is particularly looking, in collaboration with a number of ministries, at how we can amend a number of statutes. This bill in particular, if passed, will amend more than 40 statutes and further support our goal of making Ontario the easiest place in North America to do business. In working with the Ministry of the Attorney General, the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services, the Ministry of Municipal Affairs, the Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change and the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, we’re going to make a real difference in the lives of those business owners that are currently facing the burden of unnecessary regulation. This is the type of activity that our government is very much involved in.", "This bill pertains particularly to business, but I must say that in my own ministry, we’re looking at a number of measures to reduce red tape for those on social assistance and those with developmental disabilities.

It’s certainly not a bill about deregulation; it’s a bill that continues to stress the importance of environmental and labour regulation, but ensures that we are actually monitoring compliance adequately and that we are modernizing our standards. It’s also a bill that is not about privatization of governmental services, and it’s very important that we pay attention to that.", "It is good public policy, good law reform, to indeed regularly assess whether our regulatory system is efficient.

To my mind, they are indeed really important as a way of framing what good regulations should look like.", "The first commitment of the government is to ensure that for every additional dollar that is asked of a particular sector, $1.25 would be reduced throughout the government. That’s a way in which to calculate the cost of compliance and ensure that there is some reduction for all businesses. It’s across government, so it does not imply, for example, that if the environmental regulations are improved, the safety does not need to come from the environmental regulations but may come from across the government—a decrease in the cost of compliance.", "The second principle that I want to speak to—which, in my mind, is particularly important—is harmonization with other jurisdictions.", "Si un standard existe quelque part, pourquoi ne pas l’adopter aussi en Ontario?", "Indeed, one of the complaints that I think has been raised in this House and elsewhere is when businesses are faced with a multiplicity of standards that are all aimed in the same direction but just ask for different forms or slightly different issues or compliance records.", "I think the commitment here is that if there is a good standard that already exists, the commitment is that the standard should be applied. Now, it does leave the discretion of the government to, for example, opt out of a standard if indeed it is not sufficient, because we know that doing good regulations is actually an iterative process and needs to continue to be online.", "I’ll just speak very briefly to the third, fourth and fifth principles. The fifth one is to submit electronically; there’s nothing too worrisome about that.", "The third principle, though, is to look at all regulations through the lens of small businesses. I think to add this process of evaluating what does it look like for a small business to receive this regulation will improve, generally, the way in which we do regulations.", "Finally, the fourth principle is to have a method of compliance that is risk-based, that is, reward businesses that actually maintain good compliance records so that the enforcement dollars that we have are spent at the right place. In principle, I think, we should avoid then having enforcement dollars that are not there when the safety of workers is jeopardized.", "In my view, we’ll have to continue to debate this piece of legislation, and I’m happy to join the debate." ],

On Friday night, I attended the Threads of Life conference at the Kempenfelt Centre on his behalf. The Threads of Life community—and I’m telling this particularly for my colleague from Kitchener–Waterloo—is for families who have lost someone, a family member, a friend through an industrial accident.", "I did not know until I was there that my neighbour’s child, when he was 21, was working on construction. He was up very high on a roof. He did have his harness on. He had been up before lunch with the harness on and was hooked on. He went up after his lunch, got up on the roof, and his drill was about five feet that way and the hook was six feet that way, so he stepped over to pick up the drill. Someone had covered an area of the roof that had nothing underneath it, and he fell through and was killed. He certainly knew safety rules but unfortunately, he made a bad decision.", "It’s very sad, but it’s a wonderful group. They have a time of reflection, they support each other and they do this every year. Unfortunately, for most of the families that were there, most of the people who have been lost through accidents were young people between the ages of 18 and 24, which is really quite sad and unnecessary. So I just thought I’d say thank you to the minister for allowing me to attend that.", "Talking about Bill 154, there’s a way that this works with Ontario’s economic strategy. The Business Growth Initiative is the government’s strategy to increase the province’s global competitiveness. The three pillars of the Business Growth Initiative are creating a strong, innovative-driven economy; catapulting more Ontario businesses forward through scaling up; and lowering business costs through modernized regulation. I have been at several places in Barrie where we have contributed towards innovative-driven businesses and also towards scaling up so that they can compete at a higher level than just locally or in Ontario. They are now competing globally.", "Reducing red tape is one of the pillars of Ontario’s global competitiveness strategy. I know Minister Duguid has worked very hard with other ministers to do that—many thanks to Minister Duguid. He’s done a wonderful job, and we’re going to be losing a wonderful MPP and minister.", "The annual burden reduction bill helps foster an innovative and dynamic business environment by removing unintended regulatory burdens, by modernizing government lines of business and making complementary housekeeping amendments to reduce the uncertainty caused by outdated and obsolete legislative requirements.", "A smarter regulatory system will enable Ontario to lower the cost of compliance for business and help build a competitive business environment, supportive of investment and exports. By ensuring our acts are up to date and relevant, the government is creating the right climate for businesses to create jobs and to grow the economy." ],

  "text" : [ "Thank you to my colleagues who have spoken on this bill so far, from all sides of the House.", "I believe everybody in this House believes in a free market economy—and we’ve got a very successful economy as a result of that in North America. The role of government, obviously, is to regulate within that market. I think we’ve got a multi-dimensional responsibility, as a Legislature, to ensure that businesses are attracted to Ontario; that businesses create jobs in Ontario; and, when they create those jobs, that people work in a safe manner. It’s said over and over again, and I don’t think it can be said enough, that it’s our job and my job in particular, as the Minister of Labour, to make sure that everybody comes home safely at the end of the day.", "It’s great to be able to stand here and tell people that Ontario is one of the safest places in the world you could possibly work. We should be proud of what our regulations have done. We’ve been able to cut the number of incidents in half since 2003. That should make us proud, but it shouldn’t for a second make us satisfied. We shouldn’t rest on our laurels. We know that there’s more to do.", "Certainly, there are a number of regulatory frameworks that impact upon small business and large business in the province of Ontario. Most of the time, and for the best of reasons, those regulations are put in place to deal with issues of the day that may interact with society in a negative way, but what often happens is, technologies change; times change. Probably the best example, I think, used to be in the city of Etobicoke: You weren’t allowed to put more than an inch and a half of bathwater in your bath. At some point, that probably made sense, Speaker. I’m not sure it would make sense anymore. That’s the type of thing.", "When we start to look at things that we put in place for certain conditions that existed in the past, we have to ask ourselves, as a government—as we introduce new regulations to keep pace with that technology, I think we need to have an eye to the past and ask ourselves the question: Are the regulations that we’ve put in place for the best of reasons in the past still relevant today? Sometimes we find that they aren’t.", "We often find that you get people in business who could be doing profitable things, who could be earning more money for the company so they could pay their employees more money—they often find themselves going through the motions of dealing with regulations that simply have lost their meaning in the past.", "So there’s room, I think, for good regulations, and there’s room for new regulations.", "The member from Niagara Falls pointed to a circumstance that was in the Toronto Star recently. We would look at an issue like that and say, as a government, is there something we need to do to make that situation better?", "We also, at the same time, need to make sure we’re taking a sensible approach and that the regulations that have been put in place in the past are those that are still meaningful and are still changing lives today. Sometimes they aren’t.", "Previous bills, when it came to burden reduction, focused on cutting old red tape, getting rid of the regulations that simply had lost their meaning. What we’re doing in this regard, though, is interesting and unique, and that’s ensuring that when we apply a filter to the new regulations—what we’re going to do is ensure that they’re modern, they make sense, they’re efficient, they’re effective and they’re done in the most efficient way when it comes to the ability of our companies to be able to deal with them.", "We know that our government needs to build this province up. We need to deliver on one of our top priorities: We need to grow the economy. We need to create those long-term jobs that we all want in each of our own communities. So if we can get rid of the outdated regulations while keeping the more meaningful ones, we know then that we’ve got regulations in place that are pivotal to helping business and to keeping people protected in whatever way they need to be protected.", "But at the same time, the economy is growing. I don’t think the two should in any way be mutually exclusive. You can have a strong economy, Speaker, and you can have sensible regulations. That is exactly what I think is contained in this bill, and I hope all members will find a way to support it." ],

I find myself agreeing with a great deal of them. Quite frankly, I think it’s high time that we had conversations such as this here in the Legislature. It’s exciting for me to see the government taking action on this important issue.", "I think we all have to acknowledge the important place that regulations do play in protecting the vulnerable in our society, and protecting the health and well-being of constituents and residents of Ontario, but we have to recognize the burden that onerous red tape can be on small businesses and on innovation and creativity within our entrepreneurial free market.", "At the same time, I think that this is a good step forward in reducing that type of red tape. Bill 154, the Cutting Unnecessary Red Tape Act, hopefully will be a step in the right direction to begin to address some of this burden. I worked, in a previous life, as a legislative assistant for a member of the Standing Joint Committee on the Scrutiny of Regulations for the federal Parliament in Ottawa. At that time, I did have the opportunity to do quite a bit of scrutinizing of regulations myself. Seeing some of the damage that overregulation can cause and the burden that can have on businesses—and also some of the necessary regulations that are needed to ensure the safety and well-being of constituents—had a huge impact on me.", "I appreciate being able to hear the Minister of Labour’s contributions to this important subject today, and I look forward to hearing the rest of the debate on this legislation this afternoon." ],

With him coming from the auto industry and me coming from the steel industry, we both know how devastating safety and health can be on families when things aren’t done properly.", "On the other hand, Speaker, I have to be a little bit of a devil’s advocate here. Many times, over the years, I’ve witnessed that regulations are fine, but they’re never enforced. I’ll give you an example: the MOE, on landfills. They might go in there and inspect one truck out of 500 in a week, where it’s supposed to be non-hazardous and maybe hazardous stuff slips through. They have cut back. As the landfill continues to get older, they cut back on the visits; they cut back on the scrutiny. This is what has gone on throughout this province.", "The regulations throughout this province: They’re there, but they’re never enforced. We don’t have enough inspectors, we don’t follow through and the fines are minuscule, to say the least. Companies that do serious polluting—we saw what happened in Niagara the other week. The Americans dumped in there. I’ve seen things in Hamilton Bay. The member from St. Catharines has seen things over the years; it’s outrageous, the things that have gone on. They get a little slap on the hand and then, two years later, they’re back at it. Until we can support the regulations with proper inspections, enforcement and proper fines, I’m not going to be over the moon about this." ],

The mantra of the extreme right-wing is that all regulations are bad and that somehow if we deregulate and remove all regulations, the economy will thrive. More moderate people will say that is not the case. There is sometimes a need for regulation, sometimes there is not, so we have to carefully analyze each and every time, as we have with this particular bill, to determine whether the regulation is necessary.", "This bill deals not only with regulations from the past but also any that may be promulgated in the future, putting it through a lens that really says, “Is it necessary and can it be applied in a practical manner?”", "The member for Hamilton East–Stoney Creek made appropriate reference to the fact that if you have a regulatory regime, you must be prepared to enforce it. That is why the government has added—particularly in the Ministry of Labour, since the minister was up—a significant number of new individuals who are there to help enforce the regulations that are there to protect the health and safety of workers and others in the province.", "Each government endeavours to do this. I think to be fair to each government, they endeavour to look at the regulations to determine which ones today do not apply; they may have applied 25 or 30 years ago but not today. You always want to determine, when you are bringing in a new regulation—because regulations flow from legislation—whether it is going to achieve what you want or whether it’s going to be too much of an impediment. That’s why the consultation that takes place on an ongoing basis with those on the other end of the regulation is essential, and that is what this bill endeavours to do and why I will be supporting it.", "I commend my colleagues for their speeches." ],

As I said earlier, a definition of red tape is rules and regulations that are unnecessary and prevent things from being done quickly and easily. There’s a whole host of other definitions, but they are different words; they mean different things.", "I’m going to give a few more examples of red tape that the minister was seeking earlier today. I’m glad to see that the Minister of Labour is here because some of them apply to labour. Catherine Wood, the owner of Mahogany spa, earlier this year submitted her defence to a complaint. The Ministry of Labour lost her argument, and they admitted they lost it, but by the time they had lost it and recognized it, her time for appeal had expired. She therefore had to go through an expensive OLRB hearing because the Ministry of Labour lost her presentation.", "I’ll give you another example, of a metal stamping firm in Smiths Falls. One Ministry of Labour inspector came in and demanded that the fabrication machine was dangerous and had to be relocated, at a cost of $25,000. Gord, the owner, spent the $25,000 and moved the machine. Everything was okay. Four months later, another Ministry of Labour inspector came in and said, “That is a terrible installation. It has to be moved.” They moved it back, at a cost of another $25,000 to its original location. Speaker, Gord should have just spent the $50,000 fine and he would have achieved the same thing, and safety was still in place.

The minister spoke earlier, talking about unintended consequences of some legislation and what those may be, so I’m going to remind the people of Ontario who are listening and those in the Legislature today of some unnecessary and unintended consequences of things like the Green Energy Act that the Liberal government imposed on the people of Ontario. There were lots of unintended consequences there: 300% to 400% increased energy rates that were unintended consequences.", "The unintended consequences of the Hydro One sale, which 85% of the people of Ontario have said they didn’t want to happen; two gas plants that were never built; the unintended consequences of increasing hydro bills that are putting people in really challenging situations; and then when you add that onto the red tape burden that this government has added and the increased fees that will result, particularly with the minimum wage increase that’s going to happen over 18 months, a 32% increase—I wonder about the unintended consequences there.", "A couple of the people from the Liberal Party, when they’ve spoken, have said that they’re the protectors of small business, that they’ve done so much for small business. I wonder if the small business owners I’ve spoken to would like to have a chat with them about those things I just brought up.", "The Minister of Economic Development was proud of getting the Golden Scissors Award. I wonder if there was ever a chance that he might have thought of shredding or clipping a whole bunch of the red tape involved with things like the backroom Quebec hydro deal, which we found out about through a secret source. They said, “Oh, we’re not really going to do that,” but why did we have this discussion with Quebec if we were never intending to go down there? I wonder if anyone in this House wonders if there are any unintended consequences that the province of Ontario might suffer if they go through with that?", "I wonder if maybe with the Golden Scissors Award they could have shredded—like they have with some other documents that we’ve heard about in this House, Mr. Speaker—or cut up those contracts for the green energy contracts, for which I believe about $133 billion will be the net cost to the people of Ontario. We’ve now been told that a number of those contracts could have been shredded or cut up with scissors with no consequence or penalty to the people of Ontario, and that might have truly brought our rates down.", "The government likes to talk about the 25% relief they’ve given with hydro rates, but they never really tell you about the 300% to 400% that they’ve gone up. At the end of the day, there’s red tape that has added to those costs that are significantly impacting our businesses, and I just want to get a few of those on record.", "The chief government whip, I believe, was talking about health and safety and regulations, so I just want to clarify before I really begin my remarks, Mr. Speaker. There is not one person, I don’t believe—on any side of this House, you would hope—who doesn’t believe you need regulation for the health and safety of the people of Ontario. I’ll definitely stand on record today stating that absolutely we need health and safety regulations.

There was a whole bunch of red tape issues in there that could have been solved overnight so that he could actually have his wheelchair and his livelihood. He’s a professor at Fanshawe College, but every day that he had to live without understanding whether he was going to get an inspection, he might have actually been left at home and not able to do his job.

That’s a red tape thing that could have been cleaned up.", "The Health Care Connect program: The way it works right now, you cannot get on Health Care Connect until you actually lose your physician. If you know your physician is going to retire, for example, you can’t apply to Health Care Connect to get on that list so that you can be in the queue and keep the continuum of your health care going until your doctor leaves.

They’re going kick it down the road longer.", "The mining sector, again, I believe, in this House in question period: We went from right in the top five to—now we’re 16th in the world in mining. We have the Ring of Fire, which, again, we’ve heard about. I’ve heard about it since my six years here. I don’t think there’s been one shovel put in the ground yet.", "You talk about probably utilizing red tape in their defence; that’s what they’re using to hold things back and not move forward. They keep talking at budget time every year: “We’re the proponents of the Ring of Fire. We’re going to put another $1 billion,” but I don’t think any money has been spent, and I think at times they hide behind things like red tape to slow those processes down.", "That’s probably because they run a deficit every year. They said, “We’re going to give you $1 billion,” but when they actually go and look in the bank account, that $1 billion is not there, as we all know, so we use a little glitch of red tape to hold things back, and another year of delay.", "The farming, the agricultural sector, as well as many others, and those from my riding, including a long, arduous red tape story that followed a tenacious quarry proponent, Ted Hayes: Ted is a guy who already has businesses. He’s got developments. He’s a guy who has been fabulous for our community. He provides lots of employment. He’s built seniors’ housing and he’s built a number of things and provided employment for lot of people. He’s been trying to get a quarry. The ironic thing is that there’s a quarry right next door that’s been operating for years, so all there is is a line on somebody’s map. He’s been trying now, I believe, for nine years to actually get his quarry through, and he keeps getting red tape and burdens put in front of him. He has to go and find another study. He has to get another test. Mr. Speaker, we have to find ways to work with people like Ted Hayes, who are actually the drivers of our province: small businesses that believe in their community, that want to make life better.", "That certainly opens it up for those young people in front of you, our pages. It’s their generation that we should be working towards, not finding ways to say, “No, no, no, and more no,” before a business owner even has a chance.", "Let’s be clear: This government has taken Ontario from an attractive place to invest to one of the highest-cost jurisdictions in North America to do business. The Ministry of Finance’s own economic accounts indicate a significant decline in the business investment in our great province. The skyrocketing hydro rates, higher taxes, soaring provincial debt and burdensome red tape under this government alone—the Liberal government—has resulted in a loss of more than 350,000 good-paying manufacturing jobs.", "More recently, it has resulted in the closure of a couple that I can reference: Enviroshake in Chatham, 50 jobs; and the closure of Peterborough’s General Electric plant, 300 jobs. And since the rollout of the new cap-and-trade cash grab and labour reforms, there is even more discontent and less confidence that Ontario business will rebound. A lot of people are very nervous out in our communities across the province, wondering whether they are going to be here. What does that do to our great province?", "A document obtained from the Ministry of Finance under freedom of information earlier this year indicated, “There are fewer jobs today relative to the population than before the recession.”", "The Ontario Economic Report 2017 from the Ontario Chamber of Commerce: The report revealed that only 24% of businesses have confidence in the province’s economy—not a great stat. They’ll come out with all kinds of things that they’re saying, but at the end of the day, 24% is not a great barometer of confidence in our province. Since Ms. Wynne and her caucus colleagues moved into the Premier’s office in 2013, business confidence in the provincial economy has been cut in half—50%. So we have 24% of the people who are confident; we have 50% who have lost confidence. Those are not the numbers that I think we should be looking at, Mr. Speaker, and being proud.", "Let’s not forget the recently released Fraser Institute report on labour markets in Canada and the United States that placed Ontario 44th out of 60 jurisdictions in an evaluation which considered unemployment, productivity and job creation.", "All this is hard proof that the Wynne government policies are having a serious negative impact on our economic prospects. We want to create the right environment for job creation and investment to support hard-working Ontarians, and provide a future for our youth. We recognize a new direction is needed to rectify the fiscal and economic mess the Wynne Liberals have created in Ontario. So we welcome Bill 154 as a step in that direction, and support its intent to set annual burden reduction targets across all ministries." ],

It’s not really a great thing when you start the fire and come in and pour a glass of water and say, “I am the saviour.” At the end of the day, we need to make sure we’re doing the right thing.

That’s going, again, in the wrong direction. It’s kind of like the debt and the deficit, Mr. Speaker. They’re going in the wrong direction. I’ve heard it every year: “We’re in great shape. We’re wonderful. We’re one of the leaders,” and yet our debt and our deficits keep continuing to go up. That’s not good news for our next generation.", "This is why it’s important to focus on streamlining compliance for smaller businesses, ensuring that any new or amended regulations do not create any undue burdens—any unintended consequences, as I’ve referenced before, such as the Green Energy Act and the escalating hydro rates and the number of people unemployed under this government’s tenure—and that a positive, safe and healthy work environment is truly maintained. Adopting international or national standards, where they see fit, are okay, but let’s make sure that they work.", "I want to speak a little about OBIO. We have technology right here in our backyard in Ontario, developed here, and yet because of technical glitches—and I would say that that falls within unnecessary red tape—those businesses cannot sell in Ontario, so they sell in other jurisdictions, they sell in other provinces, they sell across the world. But we have not figured out how to get our house in order so they can buy made-in-Ontario products and services that can benefit the people of Ontario. We find ways to put in more regulations; we find ways to put new rules in that actually stifle the creativity and the ability for our own producers to sell in our own great province of Ontario.", "It seems at times that we should be rewarding the good actors, the people who are doing things well. We should be going to them and saying, “You’re doing well. How do we learn from you? How do we improve?” Let’s use those centres of excellence and make our regulations more generic for them, as opposed to what we seem to do under the Liberals. They find a flaw and, instead of going after the person who is actually offending, they go after the whole industry—or the whole province, in some cases—and add yet another regulatory burden to them. As opposed to saying to the person, “You’re not in compliance. You’re not doing this appropriately. You’re not keeping people safe, so we’re going to figure out how to make you do it,” they’re whitewashing across, instead of going after the offenders. I have seen that in so many examples in my six years here. They just want to whitewash and pretend they’re the saviours of everyone, as opposed to going after the people who are truly offending.", "Providing businesses with opportunities to submit any required documentation electronically to avoid costly and time-consuming paper submissions: Here I speak about my colleague and good friend from Leeds–Grenville, Steve Clark. His Bill 3 aimed to allow auto dealers to register the vehicles they sell through an online portal. Sadly, the Liberal government left Ontario car dealers out of their red-tape reduction bill. They know about it; it’s been put in front of them. It has nothing to do with partisanship. All of us have vehicles in our ridings, Mr. Speaker. Why would they not choose to address this? Why would they not at least allow it to be discussed?", "The estimated cost saving for businesses affected by these amendments alone is between $6.3 million and $7.9 million, once the proposed amendments are implemented. But I believe the actual cost to the economy, as shared by the member from Lambton–Kent–Middlesex, is actually just under $15 billion. So there’s supposed to be—and I don’t need the headline—$6.3 million saved. Again, they don’t tell you that because of their red-tape initiatives and them not addressing it, there’s a $15-billion hit to our economy.", "For those who missed me mentioning it before, I’ll repeat: Ontario currently has over 380,000 rules and regulations, so burden reduction is desperately needed. We’re not going to argue with that at all. We applaud them, in fact.

It’s a great, great spot.", "Ted started a business many years ago and eventually expanded into multiple industries, from building retirement homes to developing land to house the LCBO in Lion’s Head and eventually developing a quarry, and EPH tools, and he also farms. He’s involved significantly in our community and wants to continue. He wants to have a place where his kids and grandkids and friends and family and new people can come to our area and enjoy our little piece of paradise.", "He’s been trying to develop this quarry for 10 years, but because of red tape and many, many vague regulations, he can’t get there. He’s one of many who have fallen victim to the same regulatory burden.

No one is arguing that there shouldn’t be a duty to consult. What we’re saying is that it should be absolutely black and white, crystal clear, unambiguous—what does it mean to consult?—so that he or any proponent who goes in knows what they have to do if they want to get that licence. It needs to be addressed. Again, this government has known about this. I have addressed it many times and they have refused to do it.", "At the end of the day—I’m running out of time.

He relies on this. He’s actually confined to a wheelchair. He’s a phenomenal young man. He has endured every hardship there is and yet he stays positive; he stays strong. He’s got his education. He is a great proponent out there, a great contributing member of our community and our society. And yet, because of administrative bureaucracies and red tape, it’s 18 months just to get an inspection. Every day, he lived in fear of being confined to his apartment because he didn’t have his wheelchair in a workable condition. That’s absolutely unacceptable.", "In 2009, this program had a backlog of 3,200 clients and a 16-week delay. In 2015, I raised concerns after hearing that the ADP was going through a 50-week delay and challenged the ministry to address it and wipe out that backlog. I’m glad to say that we actually had some success in that area. But again, they knew about it. They had all the time in the world. They had 10 years, at least, under their tenure of that program and could have done that.", "Health Care Connect is one. Again, I hear all the time from people that it’s frustrating to know that someone has to actually fire their doctor to get on a list to get a new doctor, without any thought process that this is actually going to work for them.", "At the end of the day, I applaud the government for stepping forward, but it can’t just be hollow words and headlines. We want to see action. We want to see them actually address things so that we have less red tape, lower costs and the ability for business and all people, especially our young people, to know that we have hope and that we have opportunity going forward.

He became alarmed after two of the candidates running for the new United Conservative Party jumped on the red tape bandwagon. Brian Jean wanted to reduce what he termed “job-killing government red tape” by 33%, plus add a one-for-one clause—that for every new regulation, an old one would have to go. Meanwhile, Doug Schweitzer campaigned on getting rid of two existing regulations for every new one that was created. Mr. Parker called them on it and reminded them of that horrific apartment tower fire in England in June. You know the one, Speaker: 80 people died at the Grenfell Tower in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. Only a few months before that deadly blaze, Conservative politicians in the United Kingdom used that same language to attack regulations which they saw as obstacles to businesses being able to maximize their profits. Like here, the government announced a red tape challenge. This required civil servants to abolish two regulations for every new one introduced. Few people would like to be reminded of this, but British cabinet ministers were boasting a few months before that fire about how they had slashed fire regulations. How did they do that? Well, for one thing, where there used to be a six-hour fire safety inspection, the Conservatives cut it down to 45 minutes.", "So the public was demanding answers, wanting to know if those red tape cuts and regulations led in any way to that fire in June and, if so, how they contributed to the number of dead. In the court of public opinion, tenants, industry leaders and fire safety experts all said there was a failure of government oversight at that tower.", "You see, back in 2005, the government of the day changed the laws, and building owners were allowed to self-police their own fire safety standards. It used to be done by government inspectors.", "Interest focused on the type of cladding used in that tower. In other countries, it was banned because of the fire risk. It was well known to be a fire risk in many other countries, but because it was much cheaper than the good stuff, industry leaders fought, and were successful in their quest, to use it in Britain.", "The author of this article in the Edmonton Journal, Mike Parker, says that two of the Alberta candidates that were running at the time for the party leadership may see red tape as a bad thing for profit, but in fact, it’s better seen as vitally important regulation to save lives.", "Speaker, I don’t know if you are aware of this or not, but supposedly, in Alberta, they have the least health and safety regulations in all of Canada.", "All of the candidates in that race, including Jason Kenney, according to Mr. Parker, have been saying they’ll be slashing public sector jobs.", "So the leader of Alberta’s unionized health care professionals asks, if there’s a Grenfell Tower-like fire in the province, “Will our medical services be able to cope? As patients are rushed to hospitals, will overburdened emergency departments be able to cope? As Albertans grieve after the tragedy, will there be enough mental-health and social workers to care for them?” He fears not.", "This article ended with a quote by the British singer and activist Billy Bragg, with a photo of the burned-out tower in the background. He posted: “The next time you hear someone complaining about health and safety, or whinging about too much red tape, or demanding that for every new regulation introduced, three are removed; when you hear someone say that it just costs too much to install sprinklers or fire doors or use fire-resistant materials, that profits are more important than safety; when firefighters, police and medical staff suffer cuts; when you are told that we can have low taxes and good public services—think of this image.” Think of that image of the Grenfell Tower. “And pray for the people of Grenfell Tower.”", "Speaker, it’s a sobering reminder of what could be at stake here if we cut the red tape around health and safety regulations in the province of Ontario.", "At the end of March last year, the Liberal government launched what was termed a “crowd-sourced program to modernize regulations.” The public was asked “to help identify and improve regulations that are unclear, outdated, redundant or unnecessarily costly.”", "Minister Duguid and the Premier went to a plastics plant in Markham to launch this so-called Red Tape Challenge. They asked the public “to pinpoint problems such as forms that are too complex” or contain technical information that is too hard to understand.", "The plan, as announced, is “to help identify and eliminate regulatory duplication, lessen compliance burdens, shorten response times and make it easier for businesses and citizens to interact with government.”", "The government release said that the Red Tape Challenge program is modelled on one from the United Kingdom. Mind you, Speaker, this release is dated March 29, 2016. The Grenfell Tower fire in west London was in June of this year. So no one knew, when the program was launched, what impact the UK red tape challenge may have had—I repeat, may have had—on that deadly fire. I’m not pointing fingers; I’m merely repeating what has been published on the circumstances.", "I’m almost wrapping up, Speaker, because I’m cognizant of the time.", "In fact, at that time when this program was launched in Ontario, the Liberals said the red tape challenge in the UK had achieved substantial results, saving businesses about $1.5 billion a year when 3,000 regulations were changed.", "Again, I’m not pointing fingers, but there are those in this province who, rightly or wrongly, blame a former Conservative government for cuts in the civil service—fewer health and safety inspectors, for example, which, they say, led in an indirect way to dire consequences with the testing of our drinking water. There were other circumstances at play, but we all remember Walkerton.", "When it comes to reducing red tape—making forms easier to understand, having fewer forms—let’s take a look at the Ontario disaster recovery assistance program the next time I have a chance to stand in this House and speak to the cutting-red-tape bill.", "Thank you for your time this afternoon." ],

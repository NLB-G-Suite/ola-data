  "text" : [ "Thank you, Speaker, and good morning. As always, I appreciate the opportunity to speak about important issues that affect my riding, and affordable housing and access to housing affect my riding a great deal.", "Today, we are debating Bill 7, the Promoting Affordable Housing Act. It’s always got such a great Liberal title; from my experience, any time the government tries to draw this much attention to the title of the bill, it’s usually because there are important details that they would like us to overlook or, as I’ve discovered, things that have been omitted. Like so many Liberal bills, Bill 7 looks okay on the surface, but many of the details are left to regulation, outside the Legislature’s control. Whether Bill 7 turns out to be a good thing or a bad thing will depend on these regulations.", "As I’ve said in this chamber many times before, the devil is always in the details, and with this government, we need to be especially vigilant when it comes to those details. That is the concern with this bill. The government has introduced the legislation but has said, “Don’t worry about the rest; we’ve got it from here.” I still wish that we could trust the government to handle it, but sadly their track record is not exactly the best when it comes to putting the interests of Ontarians above their own.", "We are concerned by what has been left to regulations. This includes the details on inclusionary zoning, which my colleagues and former members in the NDP have fought so hard for for so many years. For example, there is no requirement or guideline suggesting that the provision of affordable housing should be permanent. The lack of such guidelines has become a problem in Ontario as multi-decade agreements expire and affordable housing is inevitably put at risk. It’s nice to see that the government is finally listening to the NDP’s long-standing call for inclusionary zoning, but glazing over details such as this is a dangerous and irresponsible approach.", "Rent protection, Speaker, is also missing from this bill. For example, the bill does not end the current system of two-tiered tenant rights, which exempts residences that were first occupied on or after November 1991 from rent increase guidelines. This is not fair. All tenants should have the same rights, regardless of how old their building is, and all tenants should be protected from significant or prohibitive rent increases that could force them out of their homes.", "This bill also allows municipalities to give cheques to people in need of housing instead of actual housing to people in need of housing. Speaker, this flexibility can be good for tenants in some contexts, but there are risks associated with it as well. By providing cheques instead of guaranteed housing, there are no assurances that the amount provided will be enough to keep a roof over the recipient’s head.", "There are also concerns that the money would simply flow into the pockets of landlords through rent increases.", "These are serious concerns, Speaker, and they can mean the difference between an increase or a decrease in the availability of affordable housing in our communities. These are not new ideas, they are not new concerns, and they are not the first time the NDP has said them.", "Sadly, this is not the first time this Liberal government has overlooked these concerns. They made promises about real rent control prior to the 2003 election and have been breaking this promise for over 13 years. Now they are continuing to break promises with Bill 7. It all comes back to the same concerns. Bill 7 looks okay on the surface, but there are so many details overlooked and so many decisions left to regulations and away from public scrutiny.", "The government has also made a number of assumptions with this bill. It seems the government has assumed that with this bill, the market alone can provide affordable housing for Ontarians. It assumes that by clearing away a few regulations and changing some bylaws, the private sector will magically start building lots of affordable housing. It sounds great, and in a perfect world, that would be the case and we could rely on that being the case. But this isn’t a perfect world, and this isn’t a small concern. This means rolling the dice on ensuring that families across Ontario can afford a home to live in. That is not something to roll the dice on.", "The NDP does want the removal of regulatory barriers to affordable housing, but the market alone will not solve the affordable housing issue. The federal and provincial governments will need to step up with more funding to get affordable housing built.", "Unfortunately, Ontarians are still suffering the effects of federal Liberal cuts to housing in the 1990s and provincial downloads by the PCs. This is not just a product of the past or a problem of the past. Provincial funding for housing and homelessness prevention has been cut even further in recent years, including a $20-million cut to the housing ministry’s budget this year.", "Speaker, as you can see, there are a number of issues with this bill. We are pleased to see the government finally listening to the call for change, but there are areas where it falls short and there are areas where we simply don’t know where it falls, because the government has left so much up to regulation.", "The important thing to note here is that these decisions have a real impact on communities across Ontario. By glazing over some of these concerns, the government could be hurting families in need of affordable housing.", "This problem is prevalent in so many communities, including my own. The current wait-list for rent-geared-to-income housing in Durham region—so, not just in my riding but in the Durham region—stands at around 5,700 households. That’s a lot of people. The housing services division in Durham region does excellent work in our community, but as this government knows, they’re simply not provided the support they need to achieve their goals.", "In 2014, the region of Durham approved an ambitious 10-year housing and homelessness strategy called At Home in Durham. The strategy focuses on four key goals: end homelessness in Durham, secure affordable rent for everyone, provide greater housing choice, and ensure strong and vibrant neighbourhoods. As I said, these are ambitious goals, and I am very proud that our region is fighting them head-on. They have seen some success already. In Durham, 2015 saw a 7% decrease in the usage of emergency shelters from the year before.", "But they’ve also recognized the challenges they face as well. At the time of the study, the average market rent in Durham was $1,021. Assuming that we follow the rule that no family should have to spend more than 30% of their income on rent, then you would need a minimum income of $40,000—well, almost $41,000—to afford that rate. Unfortunately, one in five households in Durham earns less than that amount.", "To quote directly from the report, “At Home in Durham recognizes that affordable housing is vital to strong and vibrant communities, and commits to working in partnership with the non-profit and private housing sectors to increase affordable housing options for low- and moderate-income households. It also recognizes the need for increased rental assistance for low-income households who struggle with more severe affordability needs.", "“People with low to moderate income face increasing challenges in finding affordable rental housing in Durham. Although the region’s social housing portfolio ensures a level of affordability for some of the most vulnerable people in our community—including seniors, people with disabilities and families in crisis—only about 300 subsidized units become available annually. In order to address the affordability needs of all renters in Durham with low to moderate income, the community needs a greater range of affordable rental housing options.”", "Speaker, you can see that ultimately the region will require real support from the province to ensure that these important goals are achieved. We must remember the problem does not simply end there. As I have discussed during past opportunities to speak in this chamber, affordable housing is about more than rent or a mortgage; it’s about the expenses necessary to keep it running, to keep it warm, to keep the lights on and to keep food on the table. People need costs, such as their hydro, to be stable and fair so that they can budget what little they might have to keep up with the cost of living underneath a roof.", "In Durham, the average wait time for housing is nearly four years for non-senior singles and couples; seniors wait just over four years. So while we appreciate what the government has put forward on paper with this bill, we need to see action behind it. We need to see the details that will truly decide the effectiveness of this bill and we need to see the resources that will be necessary to make real change happen.", "Investments in affordable housing can make a real difference in people’s lives and the ripple effects can be massive, so I ask that this government take the time to speak with the experts and community groups that understand the challenges our province faces. Listen to their suggestions. Make real investments in affordable housing in Ontario.", "Everyone in Ontario deserves to live with a stable and secure roof over their head and to be able to put food on the table." ],

I heard concerns over how increasingly difficult it is to put a roof above one family, especially in a very competitive market, such as Toronto.", "This bill, if passed, would enable or, where prescribed, require municipalities to pass zoning bylaws for inclusionary zoning which must include the number of affordable housing units to be provided; the period of time that an affordable housing unit must be maintained as affordable; requirements and standards that an affordable housing unit must meet; measures and incentives that may be provided to support inclusionary zoning; the price at which the affordable housing unit may be sold; the rent at which they may be leased; and any matter specified in the regulation by the minister.", "To me, this bill is making a very comprehensive attempt to make sure that affordable housing is available in our great province. We all know this is very, very important. I look forward to the support from across the floor. Let’s get to committee, where we can make real changes in the process." ],

That is what’s driving the pressure throughout my riding and across Ontario in terms of the inability to pay for ever-rising energy costs.", "You’re going to hear more about it today, because it’s not just about a single parent, it’s not just about the senior on fixed income; it’s about affordable energy for community living group homes. The list continues to go on and on, and the manner in which this government particularly is ignoring affordable energy is a slap in terms of—it proves them to be disingenuous when we actually stand up in this House and talk about affordable housing, because we have many concerns.", "If they actually took time to consult, they would find out that energy is a huge issue when it comes to affordable housing.

I always enjoy being in the House when the member from Oshawa brings her views, because she certainly does her homework from her area, that’s for sure. She always brings a perspective of what is important to her and her constituency, something I admire and that I try to do myself from a northern perspective.", "Some of the points that she did bring across are the affordable options that are lacking in this particular bill and the fact that the regional strategies that were there, that were developed in her area—there was an opportunity here for engagement from the government. The wait time for individuals to get into a home hasn’t been addressed and, actually, the lack of details within the content of this bill—again, highlighting a nice title within this bill. However, leaving things to regulation isn’t always the message or isn’t what individuals are wanting to see—and the fact that individuals across this province are really challenged with the energy crisis that we’re in. Those are some of the things she brought forward.", "Now, she did also bring forward the idea that the details are going to be within the discussions, and that’s something that we are quite worried about. If you bring out a title and you leave the discussions or the details to later on, it really doesn’t address the issues that people are looking for and wanting to see within the content of the bill. The fact that there was a huge opportunity here for this government to actually reach out and develop those partnerships and look at the individuals who are there in those regions, who have the skills, who have the knowledge to provide that information and feedback to the government: That’s something this government didn’t reach out and do. This won’t get done unless there are actual funding dollars from both levels of government, federally and provincially, if we’re going to have a real strategy developed that will assist all Ontarians." ],

I speak as a member—much like my colleague across the way from Algoma–Manitoulin—as a northerner who recognizes how important affordable housing is and how we need to modernize the social housing system.", "Bill 7 will introduce legislative amendments to a number of acts: the Planning Act, the Development Charges Act, the Housing Services Act and the Residential Tenancies Act. Most notably, if passed, Bill 7 would help to increase the supply of affordable housing and modernize social housing by enabling municipalities to require the inclusion of affordable housing units in residential developments through inclusionary zoning, which I will speak about a little bit further. It will exempt secondary suites and new homes from development charges—that would be under the Development Charges Act. It would provide local service managers with more flexibility in administering and delivering social housing in their communities as well as—I think this is a pretty important part of the legislation—prevent unnecessary evictions from social housing, and modernize the enforcement of property standards and rental housing.", "The member for Oshawa referenced the need for consultations. We had extremely extensive consultations leading up to the introduction of this legislation. We heard about the need to foster diverse, inclusive communities. To help reach this goal, we have provided a range of planning, financial and other tools through this particular legislation to help municipalities create more affordable housing.", "One of the tools we’re proposing is called inclusionary zoning. If passed, Bill 7 will allow municipalities the choice of establishing inclusionary zoning policies. Inclusionary zoning would allow municipalities to require private sector developers to include affordable housing units in their residential development proposals. That would not just enable but certainly motivate the private sector to play a much larger role in providing affordable housing.", "We recognize how important this legislation is; it’s a real priority of our government. We’re very pleased to bring forward this legislation, and certainly hope we get support from all members of the House.", "If I may, I will pass on the rest of the time to the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration." ],

  "text" : [ "Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I’m pleased to rise and speak to Bill 7, the Promoting Affordable Housing Act. I think that the issue of affordable housing is important to all of our ridings, to all the people that we represent. Urban realities may differ from rural realities or northern realities but, at the core of that, having the possibility to have housing that is affordable is crucial for many Ontarians.", "Just to give some background on this legislation: According to the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp., 13.4% of Ontarians were in core need of housing in 2011. Nearly 72% of the households in core need were captured solely because they were spending more than 30% of their pre-tax income on housing, so that’s how they were captured. Many were waiting for rent-geared-to-income housing, and there had been an increase in that. The average monthly rent for a two-bedroom was not affordable to households in the lowest 50% of the renter income distribution. In other words, many Ontarians, as we said, find it difficult to secure stable and affordable housing.", "In order to address these issues, the government brought forward the updated Long-Term Affordable Housing Strategy. I think it indicates a vision that is important to everyone: that every person have an affordable, suitable and adequate home to provide the foundation to secure employment, raise a family and build a strong community. This is what we want to ensure.", "In the time that I have left, I wanted to address the concern that was raised about the portable housing framework contemplated by this legislation and the fact that it could result in an increase in rent. I wanted to point out that this legislation, if passed, aims to create more flexibility within our social housing system. That’s really important so that Ontarians can have the opportunity to choose the right housing for themselves. The portable housing benefit framework is not an entitlement program and will not be mandated. It just provides an additional tool for service managers in the delivery of targeted housing assistance, and, as such, the impact on rent is expected to be limited.", "The Ontario housing allowance working group, a coalition of industry and community organizations, noted in a report that they did in 2008 that existing rent supplement programs in Canada had little impact on rent levels. So the benefit framework would enable more housing choices for tenants, it would move with the person, and I think it would give people the option of being closer to family, social support networks, schools and employment opportunities. That’s what’s really important to people." ],

In fact, I spoke to this piece of legislation and then I had a breakfast meeting not too long after that where I spoke to about 40 developers inside the city of Ottawa. One of the major concerns I think that they have is that the government has policies that are spiralling out of control. That doesn’t just mean in the development industry; it doesn’t just mean inclusionary housing. It relates to taxes, red tape, regulatory burdens, increasing development charges on developers on new homes and rentals and, of course, the hydro rates that have spiralled out of control, that have soared in recent years. I think that makes life more expensive for all Ontarians. I think when the government continues to bring pieces of legislation to this House that make it more complex for affordable housing in the province, that’s what we continue to see.", "We’ve said that we would support this legislation depending on amendments. We’ll see where that goes as we debate it here today. But the previous version of the affordable housing strategy promised an annual report that included performance indicators that has yet to be released. The only real measure that we’ve got is that every year there’s a wait-list for affordable housing and it hits new record highs every year.", "I think the government, if they want to be serious about this, would be far more collaborative with our municipalities but also with the development community, who I think would tell them that the regulatory burden, the high cost of hydro and the high cost of development charges are making it more difficult to attain that affordable housing.", "I’d be remiss not to point out that I had a wonderful visit in Greely last week at Albion Woods, where they are trying to do that attainable housing. That’s what this government needs to learn a bit more about." ],

It’s a great step and we’ve fought for that for a long time, but there needs to be, hand in hand with this strategy, a government initiative to commit to invest in building affordable housing. That investment is essential. The housing market alone will not allow for affordable housing to be built. There needs to be a concerted effort on the part of the government to invest in that and build that.", "Many people talked about the importance of housing. It’s essential to be able to have a roof over your head, to have that place where you’re safe and secure. It’s fundamental. Many of the problems we see in society, whether it’s precarious employment, whether we look at the gap between the rich and the poor, the growing income inequality—many of these issues can be addressed if we have access to affordable housing. One of the biggest costs in someone’s life is their housing, their rent. If we can find a way to ensure that at least that element, the element of housing, is more affordable, then so many other areas that we need to address and so many other areas that are so important for us to address can be tackled.", "That’s why we need to, again, highlight how important it is for this government not to only move forward with this legislation but to ensure that we have a concerted effort to build affordable housing in this province." ],

I want to go through the list because I think it’s important for people who are watching and people who may read through Hansard to know what the track record of this government is when it comes to affordability.", "Average tuition in Ontario for families earning less than $50,000 is free. We’ve increased the child benefit to a maximum of $1,356 per child, implemented by this government; 100,000 new child care spaces created within the next five years. We put in full-day kindergarten, which saves, on average, a family in Ontario $6,500; and the Healthy Smiles initiative, which brings 70,000 more young people into a dental care program. We invested over $900 million in four years to support people who rent by retrofitting social housing apartments and providing grants and rebates. We’ve put in a vaccine for shingles for seniors. We’ve put in a minimum wage program that pretty much doubled since we’ve been in power, and of course the 8% rebate on energy cost here in Ontario that we recently announced.", "Of all those initiatives, the Conservatives have supported one: the 8%.

Because so far, everything they’ve promised, they don’t do.", "The thing I really want to talk about for just a moment is some of the challenges in this bill. I support the principle of this bill. I think everyone in this House would support creating more affordable housing for the people of the province. But one of the things that’s in the bill is that when developers have inclusionary zoning put on their property, it doesn’t allow them to pay cash in lieu of creating the units in that exact development. So if you’re building three houses in a row and it’s in an area of inclusionary zoning, one of those houses would have to be built as an affordable unit. Somebody would then have to have a system in place to look after that, if it was part of a public housing regime, to make sure that everything was followed up over the next 20 years over these three houses.", "I think what they need to do is to make sure, if it’s in the best interest of building affordable housing, to take cash in lieu in a development so that it can be moved, in combination with other units in another area, to build in an area where we can manage the affordable housing that’s being built, as opposed to being scattered all over the city because they had to have one in each part. So that’s one of the things.", "The other thing that’s rather interesting: If it’s in a condominium, how do you deal with the condominium fees for the people who can’t afford to pay the price of the condominium fees? That would be part of the affordability, Mr. Speaker.", "So I think that there are things that need to be looked at, and I thank you very much for a few moments to talk about them." ],

  "text" : [ "I’m pleased to be in the House again this morning to speak to Bill 7, the Promoting Affordable Housing Act. In my view, the bill before us today tinkers with affordable housing, but it really doesn’t deliver any productive changes that would help to reduce wait times or improve efficiencies. In fact, it makes things worse and some housing even more unaffordable, which is, I take it, counterintuitive to what the actual title of the bill is.", "First of all, as I mentioned in my comments last week, the number of people waiting for affordable housing has increased immensely. The wait time in my riding of Haliburton–Kawartha Lakes–Brock alone is well over five years for some types of affordable housing, mostly seniors. The average wait time for seniors across the province has almost doubled on this government’s watch from 2.5 years to 4.4 years. In other words, the wait times have doubled after 13 years of Liberal government. They had 13 years to fix the wait-list backlog, but instead the backlog has doubled and there are now 171,000 families waiting for housing. It’s the highest number we’ve ever seen in this province. I actually think the 171,000 is probably a low number; I think there are far more families waiting for affordable housing in the province. It’s mainly due to their increasing hydro bills, but I’ll touch upon that point later.", "In the previous version—we’ve had several versions of the government’s affordable housing strategy—they promised us annual reports along with performance indicators, but they’re nowhere to be found. My colleague from York–Simcoe mentioned that yesterday. There are reports that languish on ministers’ desks and they’re not looked at. Where’s the accountability for that?", "The government had also apparently consulted with stakeholders before this bill. Now we find out that these consultations took place after they introduced the legislation. It’s a very big trend in the Liberal government. They bring out a bill and then they go to the stakeholders and ask. We saw a lot of those situations occur, bringing in legislation and then, “Let’s hurry up and fix it.” It may even delay legislation, because they didn’t get it right the first time, because they didn’t have the consultations. We’re seeing that with a few bills in front of us, asking for longer time before they do clause-by-clause, which means they tidy up the bill for the amendments they should have had. So it’s a trend that this government has of disrespecting stakeholders such as, in this case, our municipalities and plowing forward with the changes that it wants, that the government wants to make, rather than listening to Ontarians.", "Mr. Speaker, I’ve spoken many times that my riding is largely rural, has a number of municipalities, and they’ll be negatively affected by many of the changes proposed in Bill 7. For example, many municipalities do not have a municipal property standards bylaw, which means they’ll be facing additional costs as a result of this bill. That doesn’t make municipalities happy, that they weren’t consulted and now they’re going to pay more for this bill. Instead of working collaboratively with municipalities on what can be done that isn’t so costly to them, this government didn’t ask municipalities.", "Another example: This bill downloads the cost of inspecting and enforcing maintenance standards under the Residential Tenancies Act to municipalities, where it was previously the responsibility of the minister. So you have our cash-strapped municipalities asked to take on even more responsibilities while this government washes its hands of it. They even included a clause which allows the government to make inclusionary zoning mandatory for prescribed municipalities despite their claims that they won’t force it on anyone.", "The member from Oxford has followed this bill along, and he has made good comments. He just finished speaking about some amendments he’d like to see. But, again, if they had spoken with municipalities and the member from Oxford before they brought this legislation in—I mean, he is the critic for municipal affairs and housing—maybe they would have corrected this and it wouldn’t be so upsetting to municipalities.", "The bill also requires that municipalities conduct the enumeration of homeless people. I again express my appreciation to those doing the enumeration work in Kawartha Lakes–Haliburton. They share the social services delivery model between those two large municipalities, which is close to 100,000 people put together. I know they worked hard throughout the summer on that. They had many open houses and public consultations.", "But we know that when the federal government recently enumerated homeless people in a number of designated municipalities, it actually provided a million dollars of funding per municipality. Here in Ontario, the Wynne government has only announced $2.5 million for the entire province. You can add to that the unnecessary red tape and regulations that ignore common sense solutions that would lower affordable housing costs: for example, the requirement under the Housing Services Act for housing providers to purchase natural gas and insurance through the Housing Services Corp.", "The member from Oxford did a fantastic job of highlighting the wasteful crown organization charges that inflated the rates for natural gas, which gouge housing providers. A couple of examples I’m going to throw in here: If they didn’t have to purchase through the HSC, the Housing Services Corp., which it is mandated to, the city of Toronto would have saved $6.3 million on natural gas in a single year. In the city of Hamilton, an additional $1.1 million was spent on natural gas in one year, and in Peel region, an additional $182,000 in one year.", "There are a ton of examples where the government is forcing municipalities to purchase through HSC and it’s actually costing them more on the affordable housing front. The member from Oxford did a great job of highlighting this. The government still hasn’t taken action to free municipalities up from purchasing the products from the Housing Services Corp.", "The government should be tidying these details up before they try to bring in a bill that says “affordable housing” but really tinkers around the edges of providing affordable housing. The government should have done that. It would embrace a reasonable market solution and it would have reduced the cost for municipalities, as I’ve said. But “wasteful status quo” is this government’s mantra, so the wasteful status quo it is. Instead of fixing the problem, which the member from Oxford highlighted and which municipalities would have welcomed, they choose to do nothing.", "The bigger problem, I think, with this government’s approach on the issue is they seem to be oblivious that all their other policy decisions have contributed to the issues that have been plaguing affordable housing in Ontario. Of course, we have the government’s unwanted and inefficient experimentation with wind turbines and its decision to cancel the infamous gas plants, both of which have had to be absorbed by all Ontarians. We’re talking billions and billions of dollars that all Ontarians are paying for, which has actually made life more unaffordable in the province of Ontario.", "Nothing has contributed more to the increasing unaffordability of housing than the skyrocketing costs of hydro for individuals. It has been the tipping point of more and more people in poverty in this province than anything else that I have ever seen. There’s no way they can actually afford housing. They can’t afford to pay their hydro bills, Mr. Speaker. We see this across the province. The government is kind of starting to listen to the fact that the hydro rates are impoverishing people at record rates, but they’re really just giving you 8% off your hydro rate and they think that is to be celebrated: “Well, they increased the bills by over 400%, but we’ll give you 8% and all’s good.”", "Well, it isn’t good, Mr. Speaker, because the cost of hydro is still going to increase. They’re selling Hydro One. That’s going to increase the cost of hydro. We’ve heard from many, many professionals in the business that that’s going to increase the cost of hydro.", "But you really don’t have to go any further in your communities than to phone the food banks. How are things? It’s up pretty much 30% everywhere, the use of food banks. Why is it up? Because they can’t afford to pay their hydro bills and they can’t afford to eat. I have Fuel for Warmth, which is basically a fuel bank instead of a food bank, in my riding, in Haliburton, created by many churches who just want to help people. They see an unprecedented demand for assistance.", "I see people in parades. I’m in parades, and the working moms actually pull me over and say, “Please, help me with my hydro bill. I can’t pay my bills and feed my children, and I’m the one out there working.”", "Mr. Speaker, that is a huge telltale sign of what’s going on in the province of Ontario, and the affordable housing act is really just a housekeeping measure." ],

It’s not just at the forefront of people’s minds; they’re trying to feed their children. Money does not grow on trees. It does not come out of thin air.

I would much rather have this government come forward with a collaborative approach, rather than just the same old same old. “We’re going to get money from the federal government. We’re going to match it. We’re going to dump it over to municipalities. We’re not going to necessarily consult them. If they use the units, great. If they don’t, they don’t.”", "I think we have to do better. Rather than having a piece of legislation like this, I think we need to have something—and I mentioned this to our critic this morning—like a select committee, where we have all the stakeholders with us, we have all three parties and we sit down and look at very concrete ways to grow the housing stock, to get that waiting list down.", "The member, in her speech this morning, talked about the issue with municipalities. Many of them don’t have property standards bylaws. Many of them don’t have the financial resources to hire additional staff to deal with the rules and the procedures in this bill. This is something that I think this government has to get its head around. Rather than talking about what happened 20 years ago, let’s talk about what’s happened over the last 12 or 13 years. We’ve got a serious crisis in this province and we need to work together. We can’t continue to play partisan politics.", "Personally, I think the select committee is the only way to do this. I would hope that some of the government members would listen to Mr. Hardeman’s recommendations when it comes to committee. I think we’d be a lot better off." ],

I ask that this government really, really consider what they’re doing to hydro rates, because affordable housing—what we’re talking about today—is extremely important, but when you have affordable housing and people can’t pay their hydro rates, then that is a problem. The money they have, the income they derive, is going to be spent on trying to stay in their homes with a hydro bill that’s exorbitant, and other things are going to suffer.", "I have to tell you, seniors are one of the concerns I have for affordable housing. All my seniors in the London–Fanshawe area say that they want to stay in the area, they want to stay close to their supports, to their families, to the local businesses they’ve developed a relationship with and to their MPP so they can have access to that office. There isn’t a lot of affordable housing in the London–Fanshawe area. It’s just a known fact.", "When we talk about seniors, they are the ones who are being hit extremely hard because they’re on fixed incomes. Having hydro rates that are unaffordable means they’re going to cut other things. This is really a reality of what they’re facing. They are going to cut their drugs. They’re not going to be able to afford things like hearing aids. They compromise on their food bill. This is another thing that this government needs to address.", "This bill is weak in areas. A lot of it is left to regulation. A lot of it is dependent on developers to meet the needs of affordable housing. I think this bill can be strengthened so that it actually makes a difference and gives people affordable housing in Ontario." ],

What she mentioned about regionally working together, I think Durham region does what they can to work together to address these problems. The government members have said that they’re giving municipalities tools to deal with this when we’re actually uncovering the fact that municipalities are going to have more costs. These are more rules and more downloading to the municipalities to deliver this.", "The member from Leeds–Grenville articulated that very well. Where was the consultation with municipalities before they brought the bill in? The municipalities are creatures of the province. We need to work collaboratively with them so that they do have the right tools. Everybody wants to have more affordable housing.", "The big thing we see here, besides the wasteful status quo by this government, is the fact that—I’d like a bill that says “affordable hydro act,” so that we can actually deal with the fact that we’ve got these skyrocketing hydro rates that are putting more people in poverty. More people are going to be on the affordable housing list. We’ve seen that double under this government’s watch. You’re going to see more and more of that because people have used their savings. I have seniors who don’t even go and get prescriptions filled, or they don’t go and get that assistive device. They just can’t afford that extra cost because they have to pay their hydro bill.", "I’ve spoken in this Legislature about load limiters. Are we in a third-world country? The fact is that I have many people on load limiters so they’re restricted on the amount of hydro they can use in a day. I’m sorry if they’re going to have to freeze at nighttime, but this government doesn’t care." ],

  "text" : [ "I am honoured to join in the debate on Bill 7. Many people have talked about this, and I’ll just highlight it again: It’s absolutely important for us to build more affordable housing in this province. The interesting thing about affordable housing is the intersection between affordable housing and many other areas that are important for us to tackle, and I want to draw the connection.", "If we look at affordability, more and more people are finding it difficult—life is more difficult, and in terms of affordability with respect to bills and costs, it becomes harder and harder for people to make ends meet. It’s difficult right now. One of the biggest costs in most people’s lives is their housing costs, the rent, their mortgage or their purchase of a place to live. Affordability, in general, is linked with affordable housing, but there are also other factors.", "If you look at the social determinants of health, having a healthy, clean and safe place to live has a direct and strong impact on your health. So having a clear investment by the government into social housing, into good, clean, safe housing, will actually also impact the health of the community.", "If we want our society to look forward to a better future for the next generation, if we want to ensure that families are able to provide opportunities for the next generation, if we want the next generation to succeed, again, affordable housing is directly linked to that. To have a home as your home base to be able to grow and succeed in life is also very important. There are so many factors. Affordable housing impacts families, impacts this province and impacts the people of this province in many ways, and since it’s so important, we need to put a lot of emphasis on how we tackle this problem.", "Now, the bill includes a number of areas that are important, and we support that—for example, inclusionary zoning. But there are a lot of ways this bill could go a lot further, and there are a lot of components of this bill which are unclear or they leave much to regulation. They don’t allow this Legislative Assembly to debate the nuances of the bill or the specifics of the bill because so much is left to regulation, and I want to touch on a number of areas.", "If we want to really look at affordability when it comes to housing, one key aspect of affordability is rent, and nowhere in this bill does it address rent control. Rent control is something we see the impact of. If you have rent control, rent is affordable. We have examples. We have other provinces, other jurisdictions where there is rent control and where it’s far more affordable to be able to rent a unit, rent an apartment. The Liberals have actually promised to include rent control, to bring back rent control that was taken away by the Conservative government. The Liberals promised to do that, and that was a great promise. That’s an important thing to address because we need rent control. However, for the past 13 years—13 years, Mr. Speaker—this government has broken that promise. They promised it. Mr. McGuinty, when he was Premier, made it very clear, but that promise was broken year after year after year. I’d like to know, actually—and hopefully in the response—does this government still believe in rent control? Do they still have a commitment to this promise they made before, or have they abandoned it? Because if they’ve abandoned it, then we can say that they’ve made a promise and now they’ve abandoned it and it’s no longer a commitment they have. But we’re left with this assumption that the government said, “We’re going to do it.” They haven’t done it. This bill was a great opportunity to address rent control, but, again, they’ve broken that promise and they’ve not committed to bringing that back.", "If you look at housing in this province and look at it from the bigger picture, there was a massive download of responsibilities onto municipalities by the Conservative government in 1999. Part of that was to download housing onto municipalities. We all know that downloading the various services that have been downloaded onto municipalities was a bad decision. Why? Because municipalities have limited means. They only have essentially one main resource or one source of revenue, which is property tax. Besides that, they have no other source of revenue. To put all these essential, important services on a level of government that has limited resources really doesn’t make a lot of sense.", "This government acknowledges that, acknowledges that that wasn’t a good idea. In fact, a government report in 2010, the Long-Term Affordable Housing Strategy, made it clear that the downloading of social housing onto municipalities was short-sighted by the Harris government. That was a short-sighted decision. So if the government acknowledges that it was a short-sighted decision, you would assume that the government would then say, “Okay, we need to now upload that responsibility.” But, Mr. Speaker, as you know and I know, they have not done that. They’ve not uploaded that responsibility. They continue to maintain the status quo, which is to have a level of government with limited resources continue to be responsible for such an important matter as social housing.", "In fact, if we look at this government’s track record when it comes to housing, they continually cut when it comes to important elements of housing. In 2012, when the government eliminated the community start-up and maintenance fund, they rolled it over to a new fund but they provided less funding than before to address homelessness and to address issues of housing. Then in 2013, the Wynne government cancelled the Toronto Pooling Compensation. So they’ve reduced funding to essential things like housing. This is a fact. This is what this government has done. It’s not surprising, but these are the realities.", "Given that we have a limited pool of affordable housing units—it’s a reality; there is a limited pool—the government needs to commit to building more. They need to actually commit to the dollars, the funding, to make sure we build more housing units in general so that people can afford housing. But in the meantime, we have another reality: Many people resort to basement apartments. They resort to second units in homes as an option for affordable housing. The government has taken some steps—and I give the government some credit on this—in moving toward making it easier to have second units in homes.", "The NDP, when we were in power, made sure that that second unit policy was a right so that people could immediately be able to have a second unit in their homes. That is so important. Particularly when we have limited options for housing, we need it to be very clear that in the current climate, with the current serious crisis with respect to affordable housing, we need to ensure that, at a minimum, people have a right to build a second unit and that people have access to that as a potential for affordable housing. When second units are registered, when they are regulated, they’re safer, there are better conditions and they can ensure that there is at least that option for people when it comes to affordable housing.", "Just to touch on some of the strategies that we can employ, inclusionary zoning, which would allow for affordable housing to be factored in to a developer’s plan, is a good start, but we need to set some clear guidelines with respect to those units. We need to also look toward supporting not-for-profit co-operative housing as an option for affordable housing and we need to set some real targets. This government has not set any clear targets about how many housing units this government is prepared to build or when they’re going to build them by. We need to know very clearly; this province needs to have a direction with respect to when they can expect to see more housing units built.", "In terms of the direction this government needs to go, instead of continuing to break this promise, the government needs to implement rent control and implement it immediately, so that we can move towards more affordable housing with respect to rental units.", "This government needs to take this opportunity to break from the past and actually commit to uploading the responsibilities of social housing back on to the province. The province has income tax revenue, the province has sales tax revenue, the province has more resources and more revenue, and it should be the responsibility of the province to commit to building and dealing with social housing. This is something the government can do.", "In general, we need a significant shift, not an incremental step. We need a significant step to ensure that housing is affordable and we need to do that immediately. It’s not the time to take incremental or minor steps. We need a bold vision and a bold step towards creating affordable housing in this province." ],

You may not know this, Speaker, but our hospice in Windsor and Essex county was the first in Ontario. We’ve had one since 1979. It’s the largest in Canada. In fact, it was the first community-based palliative hospice village in North America. Some 600 volunteers help to provide support in areas from pre-diagnosis to bereavement counselling.", "Our hospice couldn’t provide the services needed in our area without private fundraising. More than 2,000 local families found comfort through the services offered by our hospice last year. The demand in our area is so great that we opened a 10-bed satellite hospice facility in Leamington earlier this year.", "The fundraiser was put on by the local Knights of Columbus. It was hosted by the Knights from St. Peter’s Maronite church. The various K of C councils have been putting on these annual events for the past 19 years. It all started with an idea a friend of mine had. He convinced his brother Knights to get on board. Mike Agius is still actively involved and is the K of C liaison to the hospice.", "The Knights raised about $15,000 on Saturday night. That brings their total for the hospice to more than $180,000 in the past 19 years. The Knights do so much good in our community, and the hospice is just one of the many charities they support.", "From Queen’s Park to Mike Agius and the Knights of Columbus, thank you and keep up the good work." ],

The OTF relies on grant review teams that are comprised of local volunteers who meet with organizations applying for grants to ensure that an application meets a community’s needs.", "Unfortunately, the government has allowed an increasing number of vacancies to accumulate on the two grant review teams that serve my riding, and I understand many of the grant review teams across Ontario have multiple vacancies. As a result, the OTF is proposing to decrease the number of grant review teams from the current 16 to five much larger teams.", "If the Ontario Trillium Foundation proceeds with the proposed changes, there will be less local voices and less local knowledge provided when approving grants for a local initiative. That’s not what communities need.", "The councils in Dufferin county, the town of Mono, the town of Shelburne and the township of Mulmur in my riding are all raising the same concerns. Both Shelburne and Mulmur have passed resolutions stating that they are “opposed to the proposed changes of the makeup and quantity of the grant review teams that the Trillium board is pursuing.” They are “calling on the board to improve the process for filling vacancies to ensure local representation.” I agree. The minister needs to focus on filling the many vacancies that exist to ensure grant applications are being reviewed appropriately and in a timely manner, instead of increasing the number of regional teams." ],

If passed, this bill would ensure that all Canadians with a serious illness who are covered by any province’s public health benefit, who choose to move to Ontario to spend their final moments with their loved ones, get the home and community care that they need, when they need it, without facing financial hardship.

Over the years the Hispanic and Latino Canadian community has added much richness to Ontario’s cultural fabric, with many luminaries in arts, culture, medicine and humanitarian initiatives.", "In sports, we have Raphael Torres, a National Hockey League and Team Canada hockey player born and raised right here in Toronto, as well as Miguel Cañizalez, an El Salvadorian soccer player raised in Toronto, who made several appearances on the Canadian national team.", "In the musical field, we have Carlos del Junco, a Cuban Canadian harmonica musician, and José Miguel Contreras, vocalist of By Divine Right, a Toronto-based rock band.", "Speaker, it is extremely important to remember that Hispanic contributions are also present within the different levels of government, which we all know play a direct role in the influence of our day-to-day lives. The Honourable Sergio Marchi, former MP for York West, former Minister of Citizenship and Immigration and Canadian ambassador, although his family was of Italian background, was born in Argentina and moved to Canada in his early years. Also, as the Toronto city councillor for Ward 17, Davenport, we have Cesar Palacio, who was born in Ecuador.", "Ontario’s Hispanic and Latin American community began developing as early as 1914. The first significant surge in immigration came during the 1970s, which was a time of great socio-economic and political turbulence in several Spanish-speaking countries. In the 1980s, armed conflict prompted a further influx of immigrants. Most recently, since the 1990s, immigration from the Spanish-speaking world has been characterized as a “professional wave” of individuals travelling to Canada to study and work.", "Ontario’s Hispanic and Latin American community hails from the many Spanish-speaking countries, including Spain, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, El Salvador and Peru, just to name a few. While these newcomers come to our province from a number of nations, each with its own distinct culture, Spanish speakers developed a shared community and gathered in certain hubs around our province and our country, such as Toronto’s Kensington Market. Between 1996 and 2001, the number of Hispanic peoples in Canada increased by 32%, Mr. Speaker, while the overall population grew by only 4%.", "Spanish is Canada’s most-spoken language after English and French and has been the fastest-growing foreign language spoken by Canadians since 2001. Spanish is a very important international language, and it is increasingly useful to speak and understand the language in many parts of the world.", "The fact that Spanish is one of the most-spoken languages in Ontario, outside of English and French, is good news for our province. The Toronto Hispanic Chamber of Commerce approximates that the economic impact of Latin American businesses only in the Toronto-area economy is between $49 million and $74 million annually. It’s hard to argue with the fact that the influence of this population on our province is very significant. We are fortunate indeed to be one of the primary destinations in Canada for Hispanic and Latin American immigrants.", "In my riding of York South–Weston, I am honoured to represent a growing and vibrant Hispanic and Latin American community that is contributing to our province’s prosperity and growth. Some of the businesses in my riding include Las Americas Restaurant, Rancho Latino restaurant, Julio Quality Meats, El Tipico Ecuatoriano and Café Las Americas.", "I am also fortunate to have York Hispanic Centre located in the heart of my riding. The centre provides essential services to the Hispanic Canadian community to help them become established in our province. Some of the programs and services that are provided include settlement services for newcomers and educational workshops.", "Remarks in Spanish.", "I encourage all members of the House to join me in extending best wishes to the Hispanic and Latin American community as they participate in this month’s celebrations. Thank you. Muchas gracias." ],

One of the most important duties we have as legislators is to ensure the safety and security of our province’s children and youth. Our children and youth are the future, and it is paramount we protect each and every child and allow them to reach their full potential.", "It’s imperative we raise awareness about child abuse, and that starts with raising awareness about the signs and various forms of abuse. Whether it is neglect or physical, emotional or sexual abuse, if you notice any signs of abuse, speak up and share your concerns with your local children’s aid society. It can make a world of difference in a child’s life.", "Each year, our province’s children’s aid societies receive over 160,000 calls from individuals concerned about the safety of a child. While I’m happy to see that individuals are making that important call to protect our province’s children, there is still a lot of work that needs to be done to improve the child protection system.", "In last year’s annual report from the Auditor General, she noted that there is a lack of oversight by the ministry in ensuring our child protection system is providing the best care to our province’s children and youth in care. Another significant finding by the auditor is the fact that the ministry is not ensuring that children’s aid societies are implementing recommendations arising from investigations into the deaths of children involved with societies.", "Two of the most significant inquests in recent years were the inquests into the deaths of Katelynn Sampson and Jeffrey Baldwin. Both inquests resulted in a total of 276 recommendations to improve our child protection system in Ontario—276. Clearly, much more work needs to be done.", "I want to finish off by reminding the minister about the ongoing labour dispute at the Peel Children’s Aid Society. I am concerned that the strike at Peel Children’s Aid Society is impacting services provided by Peel CAS. I call on the minister to ensure that services are not being impacted during this labour dispute so that children in Peel remain safe and get the services they need." ],

It provides residents and visitors alike with the opportunity to celebrate, enjoy and experience the rich heritage of Ontario’s Hispanic culture and to acknowledge the many significant contributions that Hispanic Canadians have made.", "The Hispanic community is committed to preserving its rich cultural heritage and its important contributions to the social, cultural and economic fabric here in Canada, as well as in Ontario. The Hispanic community is culturally cohesive, and yet there are 21 Hispanic-speaking Latin American countries, and each adds so much to the cultural richness of our province.", "This celebration of Hispanic Heritage Month in Ontario gives us an opportunity to pay tribute to new cultural traditions as well as the merging and adapting of fresh experiences with Canadian mainstream traditions. My riding of Whitby–Oshawa is home to many residents from the Hispanic community, and I am proud to celebrate with them their rich heritage and culture.", "In this Legislature—we pride ourselves on being tight-knit communities, where people of all cultures are welcome, respected and are able to live in harmony with each other.

Many of these devastating situations might have been prevented if community members were more aware of their duty to report abuse and neglect. However, it must also be recognized that this government is not living up to its role to prevent the abuse and neglect of children on many accounts.", "While abuse and neglect can occur in the home, children and youth across our province are also being deprived of their opportunities to thrive because this government fails to live up to its promises and acknowledge its shortcomings across so many government systems. We continue to hold youth in solitary confinement, even after the Auditor General and the Provincial Advocate for Children and Youth called for an end to this practice. Wait times for mental health services are out of control. Children do not have adequate access to programs, which is leading to tragedies, especially in indigenous communities.", "Yes, it is important to report suspicion of abuse and neglect to child welfare services, but we have a child welfare system that was facing a three-year funding freeze as of the beginning of this year. It is an overburdened system, and it means that children do not get enough support from their caseworkers. It also means that child protection workers have to make life-changing decisions for families with less time and resources.", "This government failed to pass the youth Right to Care Act, which would extend services to children in care across the province from age 16 to 18. How many of us would expect our children to thrive without supports at the age of 16?", "The child must be at the centre of decision-making and their voice must be included.

They run successful businesses; teach our next generation of leaders; innovate in the arts and sciences; and if you’re Raffi Torres, you play hockey, too.", "While there have been Hispanics and Latinos in Canada as far back as the early 1900s, the first major wave of Hispanic and Latin American immigration to Canada occurred in the 1960s and 1970s. The waves of immigration during that period formed the very foundations for Hispanic and Latino communities in Canada, including in my hometown of London, Ontario, and made the Spanish language one of the top 10 mother tongues in Ontario. Their stories and lived experience in the diaspora also illustrate the ways that transnational identities can be formed, as events unfolding in their homelands continue to affect them here in a new home country.", "Hispanic-Latino heritage month is a time for all people to come together and learn about this rich history because there is such diversity within the Hispanic-Latino community itself. These remarkable Ontarians belong to a broad group that encompasses more than 23 different nationalities. While there are shared linguistic and cultural characteristics, this is not a uniform community, but rather one with multiple identities and experiences that is shaped by each country’s history.", "Ontario acknowledges these vital identities and their many contributions while eagerly joining the celebration of Hispanic and Latino culture and people. With more than 400,000 Ontarians of Hispanic and Latino descent in our province, we know that it is our diversity that strengthens us collectively as a province.", "I look forward to continuing to work with the Hispanic-Latino community on our shared journey towards building a better Ontario—encouraging all members here today to bring these important celebrations back to their ridings and their communities." ],

I rise today with the hope that for once this chamber can be home to wholesome and full debate—to put aside the partisan aspects and do the right thing for the province of Ontario, to look at this crisis in energy that we have. This is a real problem that is hurting families across Ontario.", "Mr. Speaker, we have the chance to do that here today by passing this motion which calls on the Liberal government to take immediate action to stop further rate increases that are simply skyrocketing. Ontario is in an energy crisis—there is no doubt about that. Any one of us members who took the time to step out of this chamber and have a conversation with Ontario families can appreciate that this is a real challenge.", "We heard many stories this morning in question period, and I can tell you that I have travelled to every corner, every community of this province and I’ve seen the effects of this crisis firsthand. I’ve sat in kitchens with families who can’t afford to put food on their table. I’ve met with seniors who couldn’t afford to turn on the air conditioning in the summer months. I’ve driven past businesses that were forced to shutter their windows and doors and move to Michigan, Pennsylvania, Quebec and Manitoba because of skyrocketing electricity prices here in Ontario.", "It is unbelievable that since 2009, Ontario ratepayers have paid almost $6 billion to cover the cost of selling electricity to the customers outside of this province." ],

Whether it’s a small town, large urban area, northern Ontario, southern Ontario, it is affecting our entire province. Families are hurting. Businesses are hurting.", "This summer I was up in Thunder Bay. I met with the owners of Odena Foods, who struggle every month to pay the hydro bill. Odena Foods—and this is in Kakabeka Falls; it’s actually close to Thunder Bay—pay $13,000 for their hydro bill. They’re worried if they can stay in business. It’s not right.", "Hospitals and long-term-care homes across the province have seen as much as a 40% spike in their electricity bills in the last year. I can you tell that a hospital in my own riding has said that the government’s increase in funding—their very minimal increase—doesn’t even cover the hydro increase, let alone collective agreements. Everyone is hurting.", "In Mississauga, an arena was forced to raise the price of their minor hockey program because of skyrocketing electricity prices. It’s affecting kids wanting to play hockey. There’s no aspect of Ontario that this government blunder isn’t hurting. This is happening in every single community: in PC ridings, in NDP ridings, in Liberal ridings. The effect of high hydro rates is felt at businesses, hockey rinks, hospitals and long-term-care facilities. Unfortunately, there is no part of Ontario—no families, no seniors, no businesses—that is left untouched by the incompetence of this government.", "We heard many stories today in question period of how it has affected every single riding—stories we hear in our constituency offices or out in community halls. Plain and simple, the people of Ontario are finding life harder and more unaffordable under this Liberal government.", "It’s very, very clear that something needs to be done to challenge this crisis, to alter the path that Ontario is on. Today’s bill sets the starting point for that. It’s why I said at the beginning that rather than double down on a mistake, rather than refuse to acknowledge the structural problems that this government has created, I hope that MPPs, whether they’re on the government side or in the third party, who are hearing concerns at home about hydro bills will not do what may be in their talking points—whether it’s the Liberals or the NDP—but what’s in the best interests of their constituents.", "I realize that the Premier has finally acknowledged that maybe there is a crisis in hydro bills, but the Premier only acknowledged this not because there were thousands of emails to her office and not because Liberal MPPs were hearing it in their ridings; the Premier only acknowledged it when it started to affect the partisan self-interest of the Liberal Party. It wasn’t the thousands of emails; it was the fact that it affected the Liberal Party in the Scarborough–Rouge River by-election. It wasn’t because you saw headlines in every paper about skyrocketing electricity prices. It wasn’t because the Premier got booed at the International Plowing Match. It was because it affected the Liberal Party when we saw a riding that was historically one of the safest Liberal ridings in the city of Toronto reject this government and reject this government’s hydro policies. That’s why we finally hear the Premier saying that maybe there’s a problem.", "What we don’t want are short-term solutions. What we don’t want is to see the government’s response to the hydro crisis be that they’re going to pay high-priced consultants $12 million and spend more millions on self-congratulatory radio ads. What we don’t want is to see this government continue to pay the Hydro CEO $4 million—completely out of whack with Ontario’s compensation. The hydro CEO in Quebec gets $400,000. It’s symbolic of how this government is completely out of touch with what a taxpayer dollar means.", "I asked the Premier in this Legislature: How can you reconcile the fact that you give the new CEO a $4-million paycheque, and in Quebec it’s $400,000—where, by the way, they have more affordable hydro rates? The only response I got is, “That’s what they pay in corporate America.” That’s not what they pay in Ontario.", "For years, the Liberals would complain, “You prorogued the Legislature; that’s horrible.” The Liberals prorogued the Legislature supposedly to bring in something significant on hydro. All we got was a band-aid, short-term solution.", "The government, with the speech from the throne—I thought that maybe there would be some structural change. All we got was a PST rebate. They got rid of the clean energy benefit, which was actually more relief than the PST rebate. It’s a shell game.", "Everyone’s hydro bills are going to continue to go up. For families, seniors and businesses, the bills are going to continue to go up, and the government is doing nothing. We don’t need games. We don’t need tricks. We need actual relief. It is hurting Ontario. Band-aid solutions don’t cut it for families who have seen their hydro bills—and this is for the average family—go up $1,000 on the watch of this government. How can a family afford that? No wonder everywhere we go in the province of Ontario, people tell us that life is harder under the Liberal government, that life is becoming more and more unaffordable.", "If the Wynne Liberals don’t get it, they will vote against our motion. If they do appreciate that there is a crisis in hydro today, they will do the right thing and support our motion. They would pass the PC motion and immediately stop the reckless fire sale of Hydro One. They would pass the PC motion and stop signing energy contracts for power Ontario does not need. And finally, they would restore municipal planning powers over energy projects that were stripped away by the Liberals and the NDP.", "But, Mr. Speaker, I don’t think they’re going to do the right thing today. They want to double down on a mistake. They don’t want to actually admit that they are wrong. They don’t want to admit that they are taking Ontario down the wrong path. I don’t think the Wynne Liberals will be able to put their partisan blinders aside, even just for this afternoon. I don’t think the Liberals will pass this motion, because they are that out of touch about the pain that families in Ontario are in, and because they don’t actually think we have a hydro crisis. In order to do so, the Liberals would have to admit they are wrong, something they are incapable of doing. They would have to admit they created this hydro crisis. They would have to admit it was their policies that drove countless Ontario families into energy poverty.", "But I will hold out hope. I will hope they will take the action the people of Ontario want. I will hope that they will do the right thing. This afternoon is an opportunity to do just that." ],

Speaker, this is an extraordinary motion, extraordinary in that not only is the motion wrong in diagnosing what’s driving up hydro prices in Ontario, but it completely ignores the history of the last, I’d say, about 25 or 30 years here in this province.", "We have to ask, Speaker: Who started the privatization of the hydro system in Ontario? I don’t know. Look around. I would say it was the Conservative government that actually started the privatization and broke up the old Ontario Hydro. They were the ones who leased the Bruce nuclear power plant to private interests, introducing half a billion dollars a year in profit that we have to pay in our hydro bills. It was the Conservatives who took the debt off the nuclear facilities and put it into stranded debt, which got added to our hydro bills.", "Who did that, Speaker? Which party broke up the system, privatized, set things up for the privatization of the whole system, attempted to privatize Hydro One, and then has consistently been an outfit that has supported privatization in this province?", "I’d say there’s one party here and, frankly, I say to the government, you followed their lead. You carried through on their plans. So to say that we have a privatization or a hydro expense problem in this province and ignore the fact that it was the Conservative Party that started the privatization, that actually set up the structure and framework within which hydro prices have grown out of control, is, let’s say, a strangeness of historic proportions.", "Hydro rates are going out of control because of privatization. Let’s not leave that for a moment. We are paying somewhere between three quarters of a billion and $1 billion a year in profit to private power companies that weren’t part of our bills before Mike Harris was elected. That big chunk of our hydro costs comes straight from the party bringing forward this motion today.", "The other thing about this, Speaker—and I’ve been raising this in question period: When we sign on to private power contracts, our manoeuvring room disappears because those companies can sue the province for lost profits if we should recognize that we have too much power. In the past, if we decided we didn’t need some power generation facility and we owned it, we could throttle it back and we could shut it down, and we would do that at the cost of whatever we’d invested to that point. But, no, under the Conservative and Liberal system, we’re stuck with paying for the profits for decades. That has made it extraordinarily difficult for this province to actually change its mix of power generation. It has put us on the hook, in the case of the gas plants scandal, for $1 billion; in the case of Windstream, for an amount yet to be determined.", "When the Conservatives go after green power, it’s something that is both consistent with the way they see the world but it is also consistent with what they’re selling to their base. They say that green power is the cause of high hydro rates. Not true. If you look at the global adjustment, which many will take a look at, 65% of the global adjustment subsidies go to gas-fired power plants and to nukes. A big chunk of the rest goes to a wide miscellany of expenses. A small part goes to green power. So if you’re concerned about subsidies and money coming out of people’s hydro bills to subsidize unaffordable power, look at nuclear and look at gas. Understand that at the centre of the problem, the centre of the overproduction: the surplus baseload here in Ontario.", "The Liberals have their own reason for agreeing with the Conservatives. They have, let’s say, presided over this huge rise in hydro prices, and they know it’s indefensible but they try to defend it by saying, “It’s in a good cause. We shut down coal. We’ve got clean air.” It serves them to use green power as a shield that the Conservatives can batter and batter and batter. But it’s dangerous because if you’re actually going to do something about climate change and it’s threatening your riding, Speaker—if you have farmers in your riding who are going to have to deal with drought in years to come, they’re going to worry about this. If you’re in a riding that is an area that’s going to be hit by tornadoes and more extreme weather in the years to come, you’re going to be worried about this.", "Blaming green power for high and rising hydro prices closes the door on taking the effective action that’s needed to deal with climate change. For the Liberals to sacrifice green power so they can justify their gross mismanagement and ongoing privatization of the system satisfies both those parties, but it is not an accurate characterization of what’s going on in Ontario.", "Speaker, there’s no doubt in my mind that the sale of Hydro One has got to stop. But I know that when this first came forward, the Conservatives were very confused about what to do. They were the ones who first proposed selling it off, under Ernie Eves. Let’s face facts. Who set that ball in motion? Who actually changed the laws under Ernie Eves to make it easier to sell off Hydro One? It was the Conservative Party." ],

Let’s face facts.", "When we look at the big risks to our hydro bills in the years to come, we’re engaged in refurbishments that, in the history of this province, have come in at double or triple the original budget—double or triple. So right now, you’re talking about power from Darlington at 8 cents a kilowatt hour that comes in at 16 or 24 cents a kilowatt hour. That will be devastating for Ontario.", "I’ve never heard the Conservatives say, “We want to see the business case for taking this risky decision.” The Liberals have not put together a business case for this risky decision. Their business case is to compare it to gas, not to conservation, not to demand management, not to imports from Quebec. They are focused on one thing, as is the opposition.", "In the end, they’re far more focused on making sure those sectors are happy than making sure that the price of electricity in Ontario is something that’s affordable and is set at a level that will allow us to prosper, to grow economically.", "If you bring forward a motion and you ignore your history as the privatizer-in-chief and a cheerleader for privatization, you don’t have credibility on this file. You do not have credibility on this file, and they do not have credibility on this file.", "Speaker, I’ve heard the Conservatives say, “Well, you know, we have these high prices. You phase out coal and green power comes in, and you’ve got very, very high prices.” But I have to say—and this is a credit to all three parties—that all three parties in this chamber supported the shutting down of coal. So the question I’d ask, which is not addressed in this motion, is if the Conservatives were going to shut down coal, what were they going to replace it with? I’ll tell you this right now: not conservation, because they’ve never been fans—I don’t hear that language from them—and not community-based power.", "When we were debating the Green Energy Act, I tried to change that act so that we’d have investment in rural communities across Ontario, so they could develop that green power. Why? Because in Germany and Denmark, they’ve used community-based green power companies—co-operatives—to develop the bulk of that power, which is why it has community support. You need that. The local community has to see the dollars flowing in. They have to see that financial benefit. That’s why, in parts of Denmark and Germany, rural communities fight each other to see who gets the wind and solar contracts, because they know it means money and jobs in their communities.", "But the Conservatives wouldn’t support that in committee. When we tried to amend the bill, we did not get a vote in favour of that, in support of community-based and, in reality, rural- and northern-based corporations, co-operatives, non-profits that could have developed that power.", "So to come forward and say that we’ve got a huge problem with pricing, and to have not supported community-based power when they had the opportunity; to have pushed forward a privatization agenda that set the stage for the Liberals; and, really, to ignore where the bulk of the subsidy dollars are going in Ontario, makes no sense at all.", "We have a huge problem—the Leader of the Opposition mentioned this in his speech—where we have surplus baseload generation. We have too much baseload, Speaker, too much. That’s why we’re exporting billions of dollars of power every year at prices far below what it costs us to produce it. Yet when they were asked, in the Scarborough–Rouge River by-election, if they supported the closure of Pickering—which is a big part of that surplus baseload—they said no. Have they done an analysis to determine whether that’s good for Ontario or bad for Ontario? I don’t think so. It was really totally automatic, reflexive: “Yes, we support it going ahead.” For a party of business to not actually look at business studies, business cases and business analysis makes no sense.", "This motion is not consistent with the principles that I’ve heard expressed by the Conservative Party. It’s not a motion that recognizes the reality in this province. In many ways, I think it’s very helpful to the government, because it continues their story that we have higher prices because we have green power, and thus speaking to a big chunk of the population who see the necessity of that.", "It is a bad motion. It’s unfortunate, because there are some elements that are useful. But it’s a bad motion. It deserves to be defeated." ],

Speaker, not surprisingly, the government will not support today’s opposition day motion. The government’s reason for not supporting the motion is actually pretty easy to comprehend: All of the assertions made in the motion are demonstrably wrong. It’s no surprise, then, that all of the conclusions drawn from wrong assertions are also wrong.", "Let’s take the motion from the top. It begins by asserting that electricity rates in Ontario are Canada’s highest. That’s wrong; Nova Scotia’s power rates are the country’s highest. Now, the PC Party has normally—wrongly—asserted that Ontario’s power prices were North America’s highest. But the last time the PC Party brought up a shaky opposition day motion, the government pointed to New England power prices. Those power prices, in places like New Hampshire, Maine, Vermont, Massachusetts and New York, are North America’s highest. New England electricity prices are roughly double—double—those of Ontario. In a similar vein, California’s power prices are much higher than Ontario’s. And those of the states in the Great Lakes basin are also generally higher, except where those states are heavily dependent on burning coal to generate electricity.", "Coal-burning jurisdictions tend to have a cheaper power price than Ontario, but there’s a catch: In December 2015, both the United States and Canada joined virtually every other country on earth with an organized government in signing the Paris climate change accord. Both the United States and Canada signed it. However, unlike Canada so far, the United States has ratified it. That means that for those jurisdictions in the United States that currently burn coal, they’ve got to turn it off—they’ve got to turn it all off—and they’ve got to turn it all off quickly. What direction do you think American power prices will take in the years to come?", "So let’s talk, then, about what factors actually drive electricity prices, once we take my friendly colleague’s rhetoric and just shove it aside. Let’s just talk about what are those actual factors that drive electricity prices. There are actually only four principle factors:", "Number one, interest rates and inflation: Interest rates and inflation are very close to zero.", "Number two, the cost of fuel: If you’re in a jurisdiction that burns a lot of fossil fuels, your cost of fuel is going to be very, very high. If you’re in Ontario, where nearly all of your power comes from uranium—which, per block of power generated, costs nearly nothing—from hydroelectric dams, from wind or from solar, your fuel cost is zero. The only thing that Ontario consumes as fuel that generates electricity is during peak power periods, when Ontario generates electricity by burning natural gas. And by the way, that natural gas that gets burned is exactly the same natural gas that you burn in your furnace at home. It comes from the same source, via the same pipelines.", "The next factor that drives the cost of electricity is the cost of people. Once again, there are not that many people who make our electricity system go, and the cost of people is generally about the same regardless of the jurisdiction in which power is generated.", "That leaves you with factor number four, and that’s the differentiator. Factor number four is capital expenses. When it comes to capital expenses, you’re either building and renewing or you aren’t. If you aren’t, you’re not spending any money, and I’m going to come to that in a minute, because not spending any money is one of the pillars of PC Party energy policy.", "If you are spending money, if you’re renewing your system, if you’re building new generation, as Ontario is, if you’re refurbishing your nuclear reactors, if you’re broadening your generation base, then you’re spending a lot of money. How much money did Ontario spend? Ontario has spent, in the last 12 years, some $35 billion modernizing and renewing our system; and that would include some $13 billion to renew and enhance our transmission system. All of that money goes to the rate base.", "So, in the last 12 years Ontario has cut out coal. We no longer burn coal—none at all, and haven’t for two years. Ontario has begun refurbishing our world-class, envy-of-the-planet Candu reactors. We’ve rebuilt generation and transmission, diversified our electricity supply and invested in a modern system. Those are the things you’re either doing or not doing. If you’re not doing them, you’re not spending any money, but if you are, you’re going to be spending money in the tens of billions of dollars.", "By contrast, in our neighbouring states in the Great Lakes basin they have been much slower to move away from coal, which means instead of doing it in an economical, deliberate and planned sense, as Ontario did, they’re going to have to rush to do it and it’s going to cost them money. Not only are they going to be paying for it in tomorrow’s dollars, but they’re going to be spending a lot more money than Ontario spent and to do a lot less.", "In our neighbouring jurisdiction states, they have not renewed their wires. They have no comprehensive plan to refurbish their nuclear reactors.", "Our nuclear reactors, all built around a very standard 800-megawatt Candu design, are all of a similar make and model; and that meant that over at Darlington they’ve been able to build a mock-up of what a Canadian Candu reactor is. That means that every contractor going in to refurbish our Canadian Candu reactors is able to practise on a mock-up that is accurate to within a fraction of a millimetre. So if they need to use a tool, before they get to go in and use it on an actual reactor they get to practise it on the mock-up. That means that our contractors will be ready. It means that they’re not going to get surprised by finding that a cart can’t, for example, negotiate a tight corner. It means that when they get in to do the work on the reactor during the refurbishment, while it’s live, they’re going to know what they’re doing because they’ve practised it before.", "Now, of the eight reactors at Bruce and the four reactors at Darlington, two reactors at Bruce have been refurbished. This means that Ontario has done a lot of that learning and that a lot of that learning is reflected in the sophistication of the simulator and the mock-up at Darlington, where the work is going on now. The first Darlington reactor has been shut down.", "The motion also asks us about the additional generation capacity that Ontario has built. But it takes extra generation capacity to be able to shut down one and, in the later stages of our refurbishment plan, two 800-megawatt nuclear reactors. It means we’ve got to have generating capacity available to fill in that gap—and we do. That’s part of the reason Ontario will continue to operate the Pickering nuclear station until about the middle of the next decade. Operating that station gives Ontario predictable, economical, safe electricity during the period when six reactors at Bruce and four reactors at Darlington are being refurbished. That’s taken a lot of planning.", "Again looking at our American partners, they’ve saddled their electrical utilities and ratepayers with onerous amounts of debt. Ontario’s transmitter and its principal generator have clean balance sheets.", "By contrast with Ontario, in the United States, their rates have been kept artificially low. Ours have reflected the amount of money that Ontario has put in and invested in refurbishing, modernizing and upgrading our electricity system. What this means, to contrast Ontario with the states that border us, is that Ontario has bought tomorrow’s power system, it has paid for it with yesterday’s money and it has financed it over its anticipated lifetime at interest rates of very close to 0%.", "Let’s contrast that. What it means in other jurisdictions in North America, including some Canadian provinces, is that they have to catch up. They’ve got to buy today’s power system, they’ve got to pay for it with tomorrow’s money and they’ve got to finance it over its estimated lifetime with interest rates that have nowhere to go but up. Would you rather be there or would you rather be in Ontario?", "The opposition motion says that Ontario needs to stop selling electricity at a loss. It is wrong. In 2015, Ontario earned nearly a quarter of a billion dollars from the sale of electricity to neighbouring provinces and states—including, by the way, Quebec. Let’s quote you some exact figures. According to the Independent Electricity System Operator, in 2015 Ontario exported 22.6 terawatt hours of electricity. Ontario imported 5.8 terawatt hours of electricity. The benefit to Ontario taxpayers from electricity exports for 2015 was approximately $228 million—a surplus.", "As well, Ontario has earned a surplus of between a quarter and a third of a billion dollars from the net sales of electricity every year for the last six years.", "When the party that has proposed this motion was in power, was Ontario importing or exporting? Ontario wasn’t exporting; we were importing. We were buying power." ],

Those are connection points where the US states and the Canadian provinces, principally Manitoba and Quebec, exchange power with Ontario. Sometimes they sell us power; sometimes we sell them power. A lot of it depends on what season it is, what the weather is like, and does anybody have any power lines down or any generating stations down? Over at the headquarters of the Independent Electricity System Operator, they sit down and meet first thing in the morning, and the first thing they do is they look at the weather and they call up their neighbouring jurisdictions and say, “What have you got online? What problems do you have? What needs do you have?” They’ll plan that on a daily basis overall, and they often have to cope with it hour by hour, minute by minute. And the thing about electricity is that it’s consumed in the instant that it’s generated.", "The motion wrongly asserts that capital expenses and legislation undertaken in the last 13 years have created a problem. In fact, it has been Ontario’s investment in its power production sector that has solved a problem, and done so ahead of other jurisdictions.", "I’d like to talk to you a little bit about what was happening when the PC Party was last in power. They recently have been crowing about the fact that they were selling power at 4.3 cents per kilowatt hour. Taken in isolation, this claim is accurate. However, to put it in perspective, you have to ask yourself: If you were selling power at 4.3 cents per kilowatt hour, what were you buying it at? The fact of the matter is that they were buying at rates of between $1 and $2 per kilowatt hours in many cases. The news that we have to communicate to them is that if you’re selling power at a loss, you can’t make it up on volume. Ontario took decades-old legislation and brought it into the 21st century. Ontario’s changes improved how we plan for the future.", "Among the things that the motion here criticizes Ontario for are the following:", "Ontario’s legislation in the last 13 years has enabled clean power.", "It has allowed local distribution companies to be able to consolidate. One good example is the consolidation of, I think, seven different local distribution companies, including my own local distribution company in Mississauga, Enersource, into a company that at the moment doesn’t have a name, but when it comes into being will be the second-largest energy transmitter in Ontario. The largest, by the way, is Hydro One. Hydro One has 24% of the local distribution market, and, by the way, Hydro One has about 1.1 million customers. The next largest will be that newly amalgamated company, including all those seven or eight local distribution companies. It will have just under a million customers, somewhere in the neighbourhood of 890,000 to 900,000. The third-largest local distribution company is Toronto Hydro. Toronto Hydro has about 880,000 customers. That takes up something just shy of 80% of the marketplace, and 60 other local distribution companies compete for just more than 20% of the remaining market.", "Another thing that legislation introduced by our government has done is that it has enabled families with modest incomes to benefit directly from electricity supports. This didn’t happen on the watch of the PC Party when in government.", "Our government has also put in place North America’s only comprehensive plan to refurbish our nuclear reactors, which are the envy of the free world in terms of how well they perform, how long they perform, how amenable they are to refurbishment and how economically they generate clean, predictable power.", "Legislation brought on on this government’s watch has also brought in conservation measures and incentives, something the PC Party never did.", "It has diversified Ontario’s power supply, something the PC Party only did insofar as they cranked up coal production. Legislation brought in by our government has enabled more consumers to heat their homes with natural gas instead of more expensive electricity or less reliable propane.", "Our government has brought in legislation to enable smart meters that now provide an incentive for Ontario homes and businesses to shift power use from peak hours to evenings or weekends.", "As well, our government has brought in legislation to enhance consumer protection, to improve cyber security and, very importantly, to address climate change. Right now, Ontario’s power supply is more than 90% greenhouse-gas-free. If we’re looking at our assets that don’t include the peak power, dispatchable—which means you turn them on when you need them and turn them off when you don’t—natural gas plants, Ontario’s power production is more than 99% greenhouse-gas-free.", "The list is actually a great deal longer, but I would run out of time if I kept enumerating the list of legislative changes that this PC motion criticizes the province of Ontario for having done.", "Here’s the kicker, Speaker: The PC Party voted against every single one of those measures—every one of them. Everything that benefits Ontario businesses, Ontario families, Ontario homes, the PC Party opposed.", "The motion wrongly says that improving electricity supply and distribution, to use its own words, makes life harder. Well, how hard was life under the last PC government when blackouts and brownouts were actually the order of the day? They were common.", "Here where I’m standing, in the centre of the greater Toronto area, there were, on the last day of the last PC government, an average of more than 50 smog days every year. In the last four years, including this past year, which was the hottest summer on record, there were no smog days—none. That’s not to say that, in the greater Toronto area, we don’t generate greenhouse gases, but what we don’t do in the greater Toronto area anymore is, we don’t burn coal.", "Now the sectors to worry about, as far as greenhouse gas production, are industrial, commercial and institutional, and transportation. Those are the sectors that need to shake out the greenhouse gas emissions.", "Here’s something else that the PC Party did to make life harder for Ontarians during their eight-year watch on government, as they moved toward an attempt to privatize what is now Ontario Power Generation and Hydro One, which were then lumped together and called Ontario Hydro. In a move to privatize them, they chose to take the debt that represents the capital expenses involved in everything that was built post-World War II—right through our nuclear reactors during the big building boom in the 1960s and 1970s—take all of that debt, $21.5 billion, and transfer it from those two organizations to the taxpayer in the form of the stranded debt charge that, for many years, was on your electricity bills.", "Our government addressed that stranded debt charge in a good old-fashioned, common-sense way: We paid the debt. It’s done. It’s finished. Ontario has paid the stranded debt.", "PC power policies had Ontario headed into the cold and dark by 2003, but Ontario’s solutions since 2003 have set up Ontario with a more secure, more reliable power supply. On the watch of our government, Ontario has become an annual net power exporter, and it will be more so once the United States must turn off its coal and when the United States reactors reach the end of their useful lives.", "Along the way, those policies have attracted more direct foreign investment. They’ve driven more jobs than any other place in North America. No place else in North America has benefited from direct foreign investment the way Ontario has, and that means, for Ontario families, more jobs, better jobs and jobs with a future as a career.", "It means that Ontario has taken action to slow further rate increases. This sets up what are—something that I’ve spoken about in the House before—the four principles of Conservative energy policy: (1) As I mentioned before, do nothing. Take your assets and run them into the ground; (2) Burn coal. It’s the ultimate quick and dirty electricity fuel; (3) Buy expensive power from the coal-burning Ohio Valley. That’s exactly what they did on their watch. If you want to know what people will do in the future, just look at what they’ve done in the past. Most importantly, the fourth pillar of Conservative energy policy is that when all else fails—and under the Conservatives, all else always fails—blame it on the Liberals.", "Speaker, this motion asks Ontario to stop looking into the future and to stop expanding its power grid. I would ask my colleagues in opposition to explain to me, as we all wait for the entry into our market of the electric car, how will we recharge our electric cars. Will we take cars that, at the moment, run on greenhouse-gas-producing gasoline and oil, and will those vehicles have to be recharged by burning coal, which is what the PC Party did?", "How would the party opposite power electrified transit? We’re all in favour of electrifying our public transit and putting in more light rail transit. I’ve heard a Conservative-leaning former mayor of Toronto use a slogan that sounded something like “Subways, subways, subways,” but those subways run on electricity, not on diesel engines.", "How would we convert from other polluting sources? How would we maintain a growing economy if we can’t continue to grow our electricity supply?", "This motion asks the government to give municipalities the power not to generate electricity and the power not to allow transmission of electricity through their borders. How might this party have dealt with highway-building in the 1960s and 1970s? Actually, they did deal with highway-building in the 1960s and 1970s, but did they allow municipalities to take Highway 401 and have it meander around every community that might not have wanted to have a highway through it? Those communities now have seen the growth that connection to a modern transportation grid brings to their communities and brings to their families, and the industry that it attracts to their communities as well. That’s the reason that power planning in Ontario will always look to the future to bring the best for the entire province of Ontario. But it’s also the reason why local wishes have to be taken into account whenever power projects go forward.", "Speaker, since 2003, Ontario has, as I mentioned earlier, invested $35 billion in the electricity system—$35 billion. It’s rebuilt 16,000 megawatts of cleaner power.", "Anyone who has travelled in Europe or the United States can see entire fields of windmills. One of the places that has moved most aggressively into wind power is very Republican Texas. West Texas is full of wind farms. If one flies over the American Midwest, near the southern part of Illinois, and if it’s a clear day and you can look out, the number of windmills number into the hundreds. All of these jurisdictions, as they move to doing what Ontario has already successfully done in the last 12 or 13 years, are going to have to buy products and buy services from Ontario firms employing Ontario workers, paying wages to knowledge-intensive, high-wage workers, and they’re going to do it with an industry developed on the watch of this government that has gone from zero to 50,000 jobs within the last decade.", "Ontario’s solar power contains more production capacity than any other in Canada and is one of North America’s highest.", "I’d like to just close with a few facts on some of the trade that Ontario does with the province of Quebec in electricity agreements. In September 2014, Ontario and Quebec established an energy working group which would, and did, explore working on key energy issues and also opportunities to enhance electricity trade between the two provinces.", "Since that began, one of the key benefits to both provinces has been that at the time that Quebec most needs electricity—which, in contrast to Ontario, is the middle of the winter—Quebec can buy from Ontario 500 megawatts of power-production capacity in the middle of the winter. Similarly, when Ontario has its peak power needs—which for us in Ontario is the middle of the summer—Ontario can similarly buy from Quebec 500 megawatts of what would be surplus power generation capacity from Quebec.", "What this means is that neither Ontario nor Quebec needed to build excess generation capacity but could take the generation capacity that each province had planned and built over the span of the last decades and share their surplus—for Quebec, a surplus in the summer; for Ontario, a surplus in the winter—with each other. Good neighbours do that. That’s been part of the rationale that Ontario has chosen in how and why it’s worked to build Ontario’s energy future based on a diversified and balanced power supply.", "I could go on for a great deal longer, but I think, in summation, these are some of the many, many reasons that, with the greatest of respect to my friends opposite, the government is going to vote down this particular opposition day motion." ],

It was interesting to listen to the member from Mississauga–Streetsville tell a story that would lead one to believe that Ontario has never been better and that the citizens of this province have never been happier with their electricity system. But I don’t think that paints an accurate picture of what we’re hearing out there on the ground every day and, I assure you, the members on the other side are hearing as well.", "It is not a happy place out there, and they are not accepting the story that they’re getting from the Liberals.", "Their talking points have changed. First of all, there was no crisis in electricity. It was a cup of coffee; the increases amounted to nothing. And now, when they know they’ve got a problem—because Raymond Cho delivered them a problem in Scarborough–Rouge River. Here’s their narrative now: “Oh, we’ve done the heavy lifting here in Ontario under the Liberal government, but those other jurisdictions are going to have to deal with that now, and then everybody is going to flock to Ontario for cheap power.” Have you ever heard a bigger load of horsefeathers, as Peter Kormos would have said in the old days—that people are going to flock to Ontario?", "I’ve been talking to some of those people who are thinking of flocking out of Ontario: the manufacturers, people who we met with today, the Association of Major Power Consumers, who have their backs against a wall because in this climate here in Ontario, they have now reached a point where there is no more wiggle room. The cost of power has reached a point where these manufacturers, these heavy consumers of power, have no more wiggle room. They’re now looking at the possibility of having to move their operations elsewhere, to another jurisdiction, possibly the United States. All you’ve got to do is look at the auto industry and see how the auto companies are making investments in America today: building new plants, putting new production into America while we’re stagnating here in Canada.", "I wanted to get to the motion. This motion is all about the price of power and how we got there. I want to make sure that it’s very clear. My friend from the NDP the member for Toronto–Danforth talked about how he thinks that renewable power has nothing to do with the excessive price that we’re paying. The Auditor General—who I trust more than any member in this House, including myself—has said that renewable power has cost $9.2 billion more than it should have cost. So whether or not you believe in the principle of renewable power and green power—the member implied that we are opposed to green power. We’re opposed to the price that was paid for green power: $9.2 billion.", "How did we get to that $9.2 billion? The empowerment to get there, the legislative authority to get there, came from the Green Energy Act. It’s the Green Energy Act, I say to my friend, that is the big problem. He says that most of it is nuclear and gas. Well, nuclear provides 60% of the power in this province. It is the safest and most reliable baseload, and it’s the one we’ve got, and we absolutely need to ensure that it continues. But if you look at the cost versus the megawatts produced—or terawatts, if you want to go all the way up to the top—the problem is the price we paid under those contracts.", "What gave the legislative authority to sign those contracts? The Green Energy Act, which was wholeheartedly supported by the NDP when George Smitherman and the Liberals introduced it in 2008 and it passed in this House in 2009. That is categorically the single biggest component of the cost of your bill—and the global adjustment, which is essentially the difference between the wholesale price of electricity and the price we’re forced to pay because of the contracts we’re obligated to honour.", "I only have a little bit of time—in fact, I’m running out—because I have other speakers to speak as well. But let’s be clear: It is the coming together of the NDP and the Liberals for the Green Energy Act that is the number one reason we have out-of-control electricity rates today." ],

That was the poison pill that was in the Green Energy Act.", "We need green energy. We don’t need dirty coal.

It’s worded in such a way as to try and convince those who don’t know any better that the Conservatives are the true defenders of public power. Give me a break.

It’s almost laughable when they stand up and say that their hands are clean when it comes to this mess. I’ve been here for the last five years, and it seems to me that it’s the third party that has supported the Liberal government on many of their energy policies that are damaging the province of Ontario. Without fail, we have a member of the third party get up every day and try, to varying degrees of sick humour, to pretend like hydro prices have been going up since 2003, but anybody who can read a graph knows that energy prices in Ontario didn’t start rising in 2003; they started rising on the steep, steep climb that they’re on after 2010 as a result of the Green Energy Act, which was supported by the members of the third party, the NDP.", "I don’t know who they thought that those green energy projects were going to when they say that they don’t support the Green Energy Act. Obviously, they were going to private companies—wind and solar contracts that are causing the energy prices to rise at the alarming rate that they’re rising here in Ontario.", "So they’re not fooling us here in the official opposition when they say that it’s our fault, of all parties, when we are seeing that the price of electricity has started to rise since 2010.", "We have all kinds of evidence, from parliamentary officers, from industry and from independent third-party observers like the C.D.

I remember it like it was yesterday. It was five years ago next month when I introduced the Local Municipality Democracy Act as my private member’s bill.

This was back in the glory days when we actually had the ability in this House to vote down the government’s damaging policies.", "In the first week that the Legislature was sitting, there was my colleague from Algoma–Manitoulin in the third party who brought forward the bill to take the HST off hydro bills. We here in the official opposition supported that at the time.", "We thought that the next week, when we brought back something that the NDP supported during the election campaign in 2011, like restoring municipal decision-making, they would join us and they would put it in the face of the government that they were taking away authority from local municipalities, but they didn’t have the stomach for it. They couldn’t do it and, again, they supported this government. They didn’t support giving local municipalities back their decision-making.", "Ontario consumers have never been more at the whim of the Liberal pals in the energy sector than they are right now. To put the blame for that anywhere but on this government is simply wrong, and the NDP have allowed it to happen." ],

Seulement les compagnies privées y avaient droit, ce qui a fait qu’on a continué ce que les conservateurs avaient mis en place.", "Il faut se remettre—un petit peu d’histoire, ça fait toujours du bien, hein?—au début des années 1900. Pendant à peu près 100 ans, l’électricité en Ontario était vendue au coût. On se souvient tous d’Adam Beck, qui avait dit que l’électricité devrait être un bien public. Pendant 100 ans, on a fait ça. Il y a eu des guerres; il y a eu une grosse dépression après la Deuxième Guerre mondiale. On a construit des hôpitaux; on a construit des routes; on a construit des universités, des écoles et tout ça.

Ça a été acheté par une compagnie privée. Les éoliennes et les panneaux solaires auraient pu nous appartenir, comme on le fait dans les autres pays en Europe de l’Ouest. Non, du tout : ça appartient à des compagnies privées.", "Je vois que ma collègue me dit de me taire. Donc, ce qui a été mis de l’avant par les conservateurs, c’est des semi-vérités.

My PC colleagues have done an excellent job in raising those issues this afternoon. As the critic for economic development and growth, I would like to focus my remarks on the impact that poor Liberal energy policy has on small and medium-sized businesses across Ontario.", "While this government continues to hand out corporate grants to large, multinational companies to make up for the high cost of doing business in Ontario, small and medium-sized businesses receive almost no support and often feel this government is their biggest obstacle to their success.", "Small manufacturers in this province have representatives from Kentucky, Indiana, Michigan, New York and other states banging down their door, asking them to move their operation south of the border. They would love to have these jobs in their state, and they can offer these companies an energy rate that is a fraction of the cost here in the province of Ontario, along with a lot of other incentives. That’s a big deal for companies who pay almost as much for energy as they do for labour. But despite all the economic reasons to make that move, these companies are fighting to stay here, and doing that means fighting this Liberal government.", "A large group of them are taking a stand, calling themselves the Coalition of Concerned Manufacturers. They’ve been crystal clear: They don’t worry about their competition anymore. They fear this Liberal government.", "These aren’t low-wage, precarious jobs we’re talking about. Our manufacturers employ engineers, chemists, MBAs, physicists, technicians and many other highly skilled professionals. These are good jobs that poor energy policy is driving out of the province.", "Speaker, I can’t emphasize enough how dire the situation is for the businesses in this province. Companies that employ 50 or 100 people can be the lifeblood of communities. Many of these companies have already formulated an exit strategy from Ontario. They don’t want to leave, but it has gotten to the point that they need to be prepared.", "Already, many of these companies that have branches elsewhere have a mandate of no growth in Ontario because of the high and rising cost of hydro, along with the Liberals’ cash grab cap-and-trade scheme.", "Time is running out for the government to turn things around. I spoke with a representative from one firm yesterday who has done everything he can to keep his CEO from pulling the plug on their southwestern Ontario plant, which employs over a hundred people. He knows what a blow that would be to the small community they’re in. He knows how many families would be hurt. But he also knows that the company won’t make it another 18 months if nothing changes.", "Our party can talk about what we would do differently if we were in government, but we also know we need to fight today for better policy from this Liberal government, because the livelihoods of thousands of people are on the line here, and in many cases, 18 more months of destructive Liberal energy policies will tip the scale.", "Speaker, I’m proud that our leader, our energy critic and our party have brought forward this motion to stand up for families and businesses alike. I hope every member of this House will give serious and thoughtful consideration to the solutions we have brought forward today." ],

They stood up and said, “Let auto die. Let the auto industry die.” For the member from Renfrew–Nipissing–Pembroke to stand in his place and talk about how the Liberal government is chasing auto jobs out of this country and how now the Conservatives have a problem with that—Speaker, I would use a word, but it would be very unparliamentary. We’ll call it horse hockey. How about that? Not a single person in the auto industry believes the Conservatives are suddenly champions of the auto industry.", "The same member stood up and talked about how the Liberal talking points have changed. The Liberal talking points haven’t changed. They still stand here and defend the sell-off of our public hydro system. They still stand in their place and talk about how the sell-off is not affecting the price of hydro in this province. Again, there is not a single person in this province who believes that privatizing our public hydro asset is not affecting the bill they receive every single month. The people in my riding know; they’ve sent me hundreds of hydro bills to share with the Premier and the Minister of Energy, which I have, to show the skyrocketing cost of hydro because of their decision to sell off Hydro One—which was the same decision that the Conservative Party started when they were in government.", "I know the member from Niagara Falls wants to have his say, and I’m sure that he will wrap it up nicely for our side. Blaming green energy, which is what the Liberals and the Conservatives are both doing, is not doing anyone a favour. For the Conservatives to stand up and blame the NDP, the only party that has consistently opposed the sell-off of public hydro, is, frankly, ridiculous." ],

I sat there as the mayor of Winnipeg, consolidating our hydro utility with the province, reading reports on the insanity of the Harris government here. What were they doing? Because we couldn’t figure it out on the other side of the border—when Premier Doer and I were putting together our hydro consolidation. They were investing in Ontario one quarter per capita the amount of money in transportation and any energy infrastructure. Under the Harris government, there were years when there was barely $1 billion spent on roads and energy. Forty years of massive disinvestment, and the transmission lines required 80% replacement—$8 billion were left that we had to invest in transmission to keep the system from doing that.", "The second big cause was that the nuclear plants in the late 1990s were determined by the regulator to be at unacceptable operating levels and not operating safely. So what’s the other big cost? Tens of billions of dollars having to be invested, since we got elected, in nuclear infrastructure because they just left their kids the bills.", "And the third big cost was the stranded assets that the member from Windsor–Tecumseh pointed out: $28 billion when you devalue, through privatization, your own asset and create a real debt out of that. That is 90% of the problem. It was not green energy; the NDP is quite correct in that assumption.", "And then the member for Lambton–Kent–Middlesex: Well, I have some news for you. Yes, it’s cheaper in Michigan and Ohio. Why? Because they’re running on coal. We all know that’s the hidden agenda. They love cheap coal over there. It’s interesting today, isn’t it? What do they point to as the great success story on energy rates that everyone is going to run to? All of the industries are running to Ohio and Michigan because they have coal-fired plants. Literally, your economic critic said, “That’s the way to go. Ontario should be just like Indiana and Ohio and Michigan.”", "Well, I’ve got some news for you: What is happening with Governor Snyder, the good Republican governor of Michigan? He’s closing nine coal plants. So strap your seats on in the official opposition and watch what happens now. Watch what happens now as they try to close their coal plants. What’s the other thing that’s happening? What’s happening is the cost now is that they don’t have any infrastructure in place in the US to replace it. When Hillary Clinton is elected president, the power plan is back on, and they’ve got to close nine coal plants. You’re going to be very glad that you live on this side of the border, because border carbon adjustments are going to come. All of the New England states, including Pennsylvania, have a cap-and-trade system. They’re not going to sit around while Ohio and Michigan—and by the way, those are all right-to-work states. They have completely destroyed their labour; they are low-wage environments. You think that’s the model?", "And the other thing: For a party that considers itself economically and fiscally competent, can you explain to me why California, Quebec and Ontario are leading in direct foreign investment? Why is Nova corporation making unprecedented investments in Sarnia while Goldcorp has been in meetings with ministers about massive reinvestments in their mine? Why is Glencore now doing that? Why do they have proposals under our climate change legislation that could literally cut their energy costs in half in a mine because of implementing new ventilation electric vehicles? Can I tell you that all nine major emitting industries, our largest industries, are supporting cap-and-trade and are all lined up outside of Minister Thibeault’s, Minister Gravelle’s and my office, working on massive investments to revitalize our infrastructure?", "Number one in direct foreign investment—where’s Ohio in direct foreign investment, this economic miracle, this Republican Tea Party hack hole? Where are they? They’re back of the bus: low wages, low economies, anemic economic performance, and they’re not even in the top 20 in direct foreign investment.", "These guys are really quite something to watch over there." ],

But it’s not just them. You hear it from non-government organizations. You hear from churches, from curling clubs, about the impact of these increased costs in hydro. They can hardly keep their doors open, if they can, and they can’t provide the services they used to to the communities.", "John Teljeur from the riding—I want to thank him for tabling a petition with me.

Just last week, in myKawartha.com, you had the death of Kenny Taylor of the Curve Lake First Nation, who was “badly burned and later died in hospital of his injuries after an explosion inside a shed that he used to store a generator.” He’d had to use the generator since July. It had been running around the clock because his hydro was disconnected.

Well, a lot of people’s hydro bills have gone up 400%, so thank you for the little 8%. Then he says, “Oh, don’t forget the OESP.” It takes six to eight weeks to get maybe a $45 credit on your hydro bill, but then it takes one to two months for it to appear—and that’s if you qualify.", "I have a constituent who applied right away.

And every time that I or my colleagues brought forward thoughtful motions and private members’ bills, not only did the third party vote against them, but the Liberal government did as well, turning an absolute deaf ear and blind eye to the real issues. We have said from the onset that this was going to be an economic crisis.", "One thing this Liberal government has been successful in doing is that we have found a common thread that binds rural Ontario together with urban Ontario.

But I want to share with everyone in the House, in my final minutes here, some empathetic feelings and sincere thoughts that go out to pillars of our communities. I’m talking about the Canadian Legion in Kincardine. The Royal Canadian Legion in Kincardine is up against it very tough. They have spent good money trying to make their historic building affordable so that they can keep it open. But unfortunately, their building is heated with electricity. It is just to the point of having to make a choice: What are they going to do? Specifically, it’s branch 183. It’s a 130-year-old heritage building right in the heart of Kincardine.", "Let’s realize this: Legions in every riding in Ontario are meeting places where people host their weddings and where people can socialize. But most importantly, everyone in this room needs to recognize that Royal Canadian Legions are where our veterans are honoured. As I said, in Kincardine, their bill is upwards of $4,300 per month, and half of that is comprised of global adjustment and delivery charges. They’re not going away, Speaker.", "This is not pocket change. It’s a massive increase that makes it next to impossible to operate the Legion in Kincardine. They’re trying to fundraise for a $40,000 propane furnace that they hope could be rejigged for natural gas. But unfortunately, that hope is going to be dashed as well, if this Liberal government gets their way and bans natural gas.", "With regard to the Royal Canadian Legions, I just want to remind everybody that Remembrance Day is approaching. The Royal Canadian Legion in Kincardine and, I’m sure, other Legions across the province should be planning on how to best honour the sacrifices of our veterans and not fretting over how to pay their hydro bills.", "We heard about curling clubs. There’s one in Walkerton that I want to draw attention to. Last December, they were billed $2,581 for electricity, $1,443.36 for delivery, $161 for the debt retirement charge, and $571.86 in HST. Of their $5,000 bill, only half went to the cost of electricity. The rest went to fees, taxes and charges. This year, it’s going to go higher.", "The list could go on and on. Just this past weekend, I was at a fundraising event for Community Living. They are having a tough time managing their electricity bills in group homes.", "Speaker, the gist of all of this is that the Liberal government and their poor decisions, their poor policy, has caused life in Ontario to become very, very difficult and unaffordable. We need to ensure that we take proper steps forward, because the pressure of the Liberals’ poor policy is causing the pillars of our community to crumble.", "Honestly, what we need to see—and by introducing this motion, with the hopes that the government and the third party would stand with us—is that they would take responsibility for past mistakes and focus on making life affordable for Ontarians throughout this province." ],

Most of the members sitting here today supported that policy. The Conservative policy paper basically said, “Sell hydro to private interests, and who cares what it ends up costing taxpayers?” Suddenly—and this is important—once they see how unpopular it is, they become opposed to the sale of Hydro One, while the NDP, for the last year, has gone to community after community after community in the province of Ontario talking about this crisis.", "I listened to their leader talk a few hours ago. He brought up Quebec and Manitoba having lower rates. He’s right about that. But does anybody know why? Because it’s publicly funded and publicly owned. That’s why it’s lower.", "I wish I could say that this was the first time I’ve seen the Conservatives do this, but in the last few years, they’ve been flip-flopping on just about everything. You don’t need to look any further than what they did in the recent by-election. The Conservative leader said that he was opposed to the sale of Hydro One. Are we sure he actually opposed it, or was it just something his chief of staff or the president of his party was saying? Are you sure they actually consulted with the Conservative leader this time, or is it just another policy of the party president that is not shared with the party leader? Because if we look at that by-election, it’s clear that the party president holds views and signs off on letters that supposedly the party leader doesn’t share.", "Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives now claim they are opposed to the privatization of our hydro system. If they ever form government, I can only wonder how long it would take them to reverse that position.", "In my riding, the Conservative candidate said no to GO for Niagara.

They opposed what is going to be a major economic boost to Niagara, and then, after all the work we did to make it a reality, against their best efforts, they now claim that they won’t cancel the project. At least, they say that now.", "Or maybe—and this is important, because they’re here. My colleague from Windsor West raised this. Maybe look at the auto industry in Niagara. Every time I bring this up, I hear their members screaming that they support the auto industry. Well, I’m going to say this again, because I was at the table in 2009. I listened to them say, “Let the auto industry die,” time and time again. He’s right here. He’s from Lambton–Kent–Middlesex. I actually got his minutes where he said they don’t pick winners and losers, but I’ll tell you who the losers would have been in that particular case: It would have been the auto sector dying. It would have meant no auto jobs, no parts jobs, no steel jobs in the province of Ontario. They would have been gone.", "But do you know what tore at my heart the most when I was at that table? I was thinking about the retirees who, the very next day, if they would have let the auto industry die, would have lost every single one of their benefits—every benefit, not only for themselves, but for their spouse. And then their pensions would have gone down from 100% to 34%.", "We have a party that’s saying they now stick up for the auto sector, or they care about manufacturing. They certainly didn’t care about it when I was there in 2009. I wish they would just stop talking about it, because every time they talk about it, it gets me going. They’re willing to make up their own history once they realize how often they’re on the wrong side of issues. Mr. Speaker, you can see how well we can trust these commitments where I come from.", "It’s nice to see the Conservative Party is apparently willing to join us and speak out against high hydro rates and the privatization of hydro now. Of course, as I mentioned, they supported it publicly in the past and created this situation in the first place, but it’s good to see them coming on board with us and actually standing up for the people of the province of Ontario.", "Frankly, it’s scary to see what the Conservative Party is doing here to try to win votes. This is important to listen to. I want my colleagues on this side to listen to this. They’re trying to convince the province that any support for environmental legislation is going to cause their hydro bills to rise. They’re content with using people’s livelihoods and the bills they can’t afford to turn them against the environment, instead of being honest with them about why their bills are so high. This is important to me. I don’t have a lot of time, but this is important to me. It seems they’re happy to sell out our children’s and our grandchildren’s future just so they can pretend like they’re being active on the hydro file.", "I’m proud to say I have three daughters. I’m fortunate that I have five healthy grandkids. I want to make sure when I leave this place that they’re in a better place than where I was, that we have clean air and clean water. This motion is an attempt to fight against those who have fought for the health of our environment, for the future of our province and our planet. It’s written to have the NDP vote against it, because they know we’re smart enough to know how wrong this motion is, and they’re hoping they can spin it. Imagine spinning it about our kids and our grandkids.", "The issue is not with environmental protection; it’s with the poor contracts that were signed by the Liberal government and with the privatization schemes started by the Conservatives. Hydro rates were steady at 4.5 cents per kilowatt hour for years. That was until the PC government under Mike Harris began to privatize it. What happened when they began to privatize our assets? The price per kilowatt hour doubled. The Liberals came in and they continued it. It’s now up to 30 cents.", "There’s a clear link that anyone can look back and see. Once they began to privatize rates, they began to rise.

  "text" : [ "Thank you very much, Speaker. I’m pleased to speak further to my concerns with changes under way at the Ontario Trillium Foundation.", "The buzzword that was being used by Trillium’s leadership is “regionalization.” Well, I’m pleased to announce this afternoon we learned the regionalization scheme that I’ve been calling to have scrapped since the spring is off the table. I want to thank my colleagues in the Ontario PC caucus who supported me in speaking out against it. The decision to maintain the number of catchment areas at 16, rather than reducing them to five, is great news.", "I want to stress that today’s announcement from Trillium comes with a number of other changes. I’m anxious to have a briefing from the ministry and the Ontario Trillium Foundation to discuss the impact that they will have moving forward.", "I can tell you that I have serious concerns with the plan to move to a single intake per year for seed, grow and capital grant streams. Already, my office has heard from local groups who are against a single intake per year for capital grants. Remember, the capital grants program stream was put on hold this year by the government so that Trillium could deliver the Ontario150 program. Today’s announcement from OTF indicates that the 2017 intake will be October 25. That’s a full year from today—a very long time to wait. It means that nearly two years will have passed before those small volunteer organizations that rely on capital funding to maintain their facilities and deliver programs will have access to a grant. As I said, I feel that’s too long to wait.", "On this issue, I want to emphasize something I’ve brought up whenever I have raised my concerned about regionalization: You can’t make these significant changes to Trillium without first consulting community groups and municipalities across the province. They need to be part of the discussion first, not brought in after the fact.", "Those are my initial comments, Speaker, on the announcement that I’ve heard today. I’ll have more to say after I learn the specific details of the program, moving forward.", "In my time remaining, I do want to touch on one of the issues I raised in my question last week, and that’s the tremendous number of vacancies on OTF’s grant review teams. Under its memorandum of understanding with the ministry, OTF is required to have a minimum of 18 and up to 24 members on each of its 16 grant review committees. However, I’ve discovered that just one of the 16 catchment areas—Toronto—has the minimum 18 volunteers, as is required in the MOU. The remainder’s average is 9.4.", "I emphasize that these volunteers are the heart and soul of the Trillium program—they who truly understand the communities. The irreplaceable local knowledge they bring to the table ensures that granting decisions have the most local impact. The minister should be outraged that Trillium is flouting the MOU, and I hope she will join me in demanding that those vacancies get filled immediately.", "Again, I want to thank Trillium, and I want to thank the minister for listening on regionalization. We’ve still got some work to do, but I’m pleased that our voices were heard." ],

I’m pleased to rise in response to the member opposite’s questions about the Ontario Trillium Foundation because, along with the members of Ontario’s not-for-profit sector, I greatly value the important work that Trillium does across our province. On this side of the House we’re committed to supporting the Trillium Foundation and its work.", "I would be happy to discuss this ongoing commitment that we have demonstrated with the member opposite. Frankly, I’m disappointed that he has chosen to go about securing a response to his thesis in this manner because of the implicit risk his comments carry in terms of propagating misinformation and the ensuing impacts that can have, given the role that Trillium plays as a funder in the sector. The other risk inherent in this kind of approach is one of politicization. The work that Trillium does can and should be independent of political discourse. As such, we should always steer clear of any temptation to leverage their work politically.", "A number of concerns that the member aired publicly could have been addressed in a conversation, but he never approached me or my staff. Had he done so, I would have told him that his thesis was built on faulty information and speculation. With his question last week, the member opposite demonstrated a disappointing lack of confidence in and, frankly, understanding of the Ontario Trillium Foundation’s grant review teams and their board of directors.", "As minister, I greatly value the work of our GRTs; in fact, their local lens is critical to the work that Trillium does. As minister, I welcome advice, input and, yes, questions about Trillium. In this context, I value this opportunity to clarify some recent misinformation that, regrettably, the member opposite gives voice to with his question.", "Last year, the Ontario Trillium Foundation launched a series of reforms to its granting process called ReDesign 2015. Since then, the Ontario Trillium Foundation has been making continuous improvements to their programs and service delivery. Speaker, we are right there along with them. I understand that the Trillium Foundation has looked at various options to further improve their granting process to ensure resources are being allocated in a way that enables applicants to put forth their best possible application and in a manner that enhances service to the folks that they work with to provide grantees across our province. In fact, as the member noted earlier this afternoon, the Trillium Foundation announced plans to do exactly this by creating one application window for each of its granting steams.", "What this plan does not do—and this is very important—is provide for a reduction in the number of catchment areas. So I’m pleased to clarify that, contrary to the member opposite’s claims, the Ontario Trillium Foundation’s current catchment structure is not changing. The member opposite’s assertions about the Ontario Trillium Foundation were thus unfounded and without merit.", "I understand that the board considered a number of options to improve customer service. After consulting with stakeholders across the province, the Trillium Foundation is moving forward with a new plan to improve service delivery, introducing a single application deadline for each of the three streams in funding. This will eliminate the confusion that can sometimes arise, streamline applications and provide clearer, better access and support for all.", "I should know, Speaker. Prior to being elected, I had the privilege of running a not-for-profit organization that was Trillium-funded. As such, I know the vital role that Trillium plays. But I’m also quite familiar with the challenges organizations can have in navigating the very difficult and, at times, somewhat complicated Trillium process. Thankfully, Trillium staff are there to help, and that was reinforced today.", "These changes also bring the OTF in line with best practices adopted by many other granting organizations, including the Ontario Media Development Corp. and the Ontario Arts Council.", "The changes that Trillium has announced will provide a number of benefits to potential applicants, including access to enhanced support and an even more focused and streamlined process. I have every confidence that the changes being introduced will improve customer service for applicants and build their capacity.", "In addition, grant review teams will be able to better assist applicants, ultimately supporting stronger applications that benefit Ontarians in every corner of our province.", "I would also like to address comments that the member opposite made about the public appointments process for our grant review teams. We understand the important work that these teams are tasked with. As I think the member opposite is aware, the grant review teams are comprised of volunteers who dedicate their time to making important decisions that impact all Ontarians.", "Our government works with the Ontario Trillium Foundation regularly to seek out new applicants and fill openings as efficiently as possible. I’m happy to report that staff are working to ensure that vacancies are filled expeditiously and accountably. We’ll continue working with the Public Appointments Secretariat and the Ontario Trillium Foundation to minimize wait times for applicants. We are making great progress in that regard, and as such, we are moving expeditiously to fill them.", "In closing, I want to underscore the fact that we must be cautious when we’re talking about Trillium, as it’s an organization that is a jewel in our Canadian framework and in the not-for-profit sector. They do tremendous work. I know that the member opposite shares my view of the importance of being cautious when it comes to working with Trillium and talking about Trillium and our grant review teams. I know he will join me in doing everything that we can to support our mutual efforts to strengthen Trillium.", "Thank you very much. I appreciate this opportunity." ],

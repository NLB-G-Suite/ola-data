I’ve been in this Legislature for a few of these budgets and budget bills, and it always amazes me how many areas of the province this single bill affects. Normally, these bills are stuffed with important changes to existing legislation, changes that stakeholders and people alike both voted for and wanted, but this budget bill is different.", "This budget bill contains policy changes that not a single Ontarian voted for. There’s the fire sale of our public assets without any concern for the province’s hydro debt. There’s the commitment to a carbon tax and a cut to health care dollars. The Liberal Party and the members opposite didn’t campaign on any of those things—not a single one. There’s a $100-million tax on beer, cuts to apprenticeship tax credits and the film industry, and—most shocking—an increased deficit for the third year in a row.", "This government continues to spend more than it takes in. That’s no way to manage a government or achieve a balanced budget.", "Applause." ],

It’s growing at a rate of 5.4% every year; health care funding is only growing at 1.9%, by comparison. This year, education is even lower than that. Interest on the debt is the third-largest expense on the government’s books and it’s growing the fastest.", "Ontario can’t afford more Liberal financial planning. That’s why, as one of our five budget asks, we asked for a credible and detailed plan to balance the budget. Instead, the minister opposite put forward a budget that simply hopes the deficit will go away. He plans to cap spending but doesn’t say how. He plans to increase revenue but, again, doesn’t say how.", "We all know this government hasn’t met a tax they didn’t like, leading us on this side of the House to believe that there are more taxes to come. Despite this fear, the Premier touted all weekend, on news shows, talk radio, in the media, that there are no new taxes in this budget. Yet there’s a recommitment to a job-killing payroll tax, the Ontario registered pension plan—a payroll tax by this government’s own admission—which will kill tens of thousands of jobs in its first year. That’s why we asked for the government to abandon this damaging payroll tax but, again, they ignored us. They also ignored our calls to walk away from the carbon tax that will raise the price of everything: gas, electricity bills and even groceries. Again, the Liberals rejected our advice. Not only did the Liberals recommit to new taxes; they also didn’t do anything to lower current ones.", "This government did nothing to address our ask to reduce hydro prices in Ontario. People are being forced to choose between heat or groceries. Hydro bills have tripled since the Liberals took office, even with the Ontario Energy Board, and they’re only going to go up with the majority sale of Hydro One. Not only could the government not guarantee hydro savings; they actually removed Auditor General and Ombudsman oversight of Hydro One in this bill. Now Ontarians will be forced to pay higher bills without any explanation as to why.", "This is a direct reaction to the Auditor General’s 2014 report, where she pointed out that the $50-billion global adjustment tax brought in under the Liberals was simply a cover-up for their failed green energy policies. On that note, Mr. Speaker, I’m sure the Ombudsman’s record-setting investigation into Hydro One’s billing practices isn’t favoured by the government either.", "The removal of this oversight is concerning. We in the PC caucus have raised concerns about Liberal choices regarding the existing $27-billion hydro debt in this province. That debt is supposed to be paid off by the money Hydro One makes. Now that money—60% of it—will go to private companies and the debt will balloon. A larger debt means larger interest payments, which means higher bills. That’s the reality for this government. It’s only going to get worse before it gets better. Hydro bills have already gone up by about $1,100 a year on average since the Liberals took office, and that’s before the sale of the majority of Hydro One. Quite simply, Ontarians can’t afford to pay more on their hydro bills, and that’s not what the people across the aisle campaigned on.", "The privatization of Hydro One should be done to improve customer service, to create lower rates and to improve the efficiency of the organization, not to find money to pay off the deficit of the government’s own making. On that note, the government has actually reached a deal to sell Hydro One Brampton. They reached this deal behind closed doors, in secret, with no competing bids and no public input. They sold the asset for a set price in a backroom. Well, that’s not good enough.", "How do we know, other than to take the Minister of Finance’s word and the Premier’s word—and their word is a little shaky at best. We’re to take their word for it that this multi-billion-dollar deal is the best deal for Ontarians. I don’t buy that, and they shouldn’t be allowed to get away with that. They should have the Auditor General looking at that deal to see if we are getting the best bang for our buck. It’s truly an ironic approach.", "On page 209 of the budget, the Liberals unveil plans to create a centre for evidence-based decision-making, yet pages 73 to 86 talk about maximizing assets, including the sale of Hydro One Brampton, without any evidence to back up their decisions. The lack of evidence is truly astounding for a government that claims to be the most open and transparent ever. It’s baloney.", "There’s also no evidence that hydro bills won’t go up. The Premier can’t guarantee it, and when asked for proof rates wouldn’t skyrocket, Ed Clark simply said, “We don’t think so.” Mr. Speaker, Ontario can’t afford to take this government at their word.", "One area where the Liberals are expecting Ontarians to take their word is that all is well in home care. Every day, the Minister of Health stands in his place and says that everything is fine. But we know Ontario’s home care system is a mess. It’s very badly broken. The Premier and her Minister of Health actually acknowledged this when they brought in Dr. Gail Donner to put forward recommendations to fix home care. Dr. Donner’s report stated quite clearly that the status quo is not good enough, that Ontarians can’t afford the same old home care system. That’s why we in the PC caucus, as our fifth budget ask, recommended tying funding for community care access centres directly to outcomes and streamlining the agencies and bureaucracies that a patient must deal with in order to get care. But sadly, that is nowhere to be found in this budget bill.", "Overall, we put forward five sensible policy directions to be included in this budget: walk away from the job-killing pension tax and carbon tax; fix home care and the deficit; and work to lower hydro rates. The Liberals ignored all five, leaving us no choice but to oppose this bill and the Liberals’ budget. Ontario cannot afford to continue on the path the Liberals have set us on.", "Mr. Speaker, I’ve spent most of my time today addressing what is not in the bill, but it’s important to know what is in the bill as well. Normally, budget bills deal with the finances of the province. Normally, these bills make changes to a variety of acts needed to fulfill funding commitments.", "But instead this budget bill takes that a step further. This bill reforms the Auditor General Act to actually force the Auditor General to submit her audits in full to the government before releasing them to the public. Simply, the Liberal government is tired of being embarrassed by the auditor. They’re tired of the auditor doing her job and exposing things like a wasteful $2-billion smart meter program or the $1.1 billion wasted on relocating gas plants. The auditor’s oversight should not be muzzled. This bill will actually make the government less accountable, less open and less transparent.", "But this government has shown a willing tendency to do what it wants, regardless of its mandate. When it comes to the sale of Hydro One, I thought that one day a desperate Liberal government may get itself into such a fiscal mess that it may start having a fire sale of our precious assets. That’s why, when I put forward the Electricity Act, 1998, I put a clause in that act that mandates that all proceeds from any future sale or partial sale of Hydro One must go to paying down the $27 billion of hydro debt. If all $9 billion of the 60% sale went on to that $27 billion, we’d start to see hydro rates moving in the other direction." ],

Instead of honouring the law, the Liberals have simply decided to change it. Mr. Speaker, that’s not how the world works. No family in Ontario can change the law just because they want to. Not a single Ontario family can just decide they aren’t going to pay their bills anymore, but apparently the Liberals can.", "To recap: We have a Liberal government that ignored our five asks, introduced new job-killing taxes, changed the law to fit their plans and didn’t take action to address Ontario’s health care system or deficit. I think the people of Ontario are going to thank the PCs for not voting for this budget. It doesn’t address their needs. It doesn’t address the most pressing problems of the day. It takes more money out of their pockets and raises the cost of living for everyone. We will not support it." ],

The Auditor General warned that we are starting to crowd out the services and the programs that we’ve come to expect.", "Today the government is crowing about their spending on infrastructure, but let’s get into that a little deeper than our leader talked about. He spoke about the hydro sale and the concerns that we have—which we’ll be talking about for many days and weeks—but I want to talk specifically about the $130 billion that was announced in the budget.", "It is exactly the same announcement that was made in last year’s budget. In fact, if you take the two and put them side by side, as I did in the lock-up, it’s a cut-and-paste. Word for word, it’s the same $130 billion, just recycled. But the bad part about all this is that not only is there no new money. They, last year, were going to put this $130 billion in with only needing to sell $3.1 billion worth of assets over four years. That’s all they needed to do. It was going to be the GM shares and a few other little things; $3.1 billion is all they needed to make that $130 billion work. So why, when the GM shares have already been sold, do we now need to sell $9 billion worth of Hydro One? And as our interim leader told us, they’re not putting the money into Hydro One, which would reduce the hydro bills; they’re stripping it away to put it into this program—ostensibly to put it into this program. That’s why our hydro rates are going to go up.", "So now all of a sudden we need $9 billion in hydro sales, we need the LCBO headquarters sold, we need the OPG building to be sold—these are all listed in the budget. We now need more than a dozen billion dollars to make that work. But none of that is actually going in to that $130 billion. It’s all being touted as transit, but it’s a shell game. That money was already in the budget last year. The $130 billion was already accounted for without this $9 billion in hydro being required. They’re talking about previously announced money, and now they’re talking about new money coming in. All that is only to balance their budget, or to attempt to balance the budget. It’s all about taking money that was already in the transit fund out, putting this new money in, but using the money they’ve taken out to attempt to balance the deficit. That’s all this is about. There’s no hesitation to tell the public that. It was already in the budget.", "Why are we in this problem? It’s because this government continues to spend. Spending was up $2.4 billion this year—$2.4 billion. They continue to tell us they’re controlling spending—they’re not. It’s tax and spend. Beer tax, the second installment of the aviation fuel tax kicks in, the Ontario payroll tax is going to kick in, and the mother of all taxes, the cap-and-trade tax on everything, which will be discussed this fall, was in the budget. This is going to be the biggest tax grab that we will ever have seen. Put a tax on everything.", "Our leader already talked about the energy sector. They have bungled that sector so badly that people are choosing between food and fuel. It’s to heat or eat. That’s the decision people are making. Many of us, from all three parties, were in Ottawa this year at the pre-budget consultations, where obviously there was no consultation being done. There was obviously nobody that listened to anything; the decisions had already been made. That’s, I think, one of the things that irks me the most: The decisions were made. The budget document would have been prepared as far back as that time.", "We listened to Jennifer—her name was Jennifer—a woman on ODSP. She sat in front of us and told our committee—all three parties were there—that she has to shut her power off at 6 o’ clock every morning to turn it on again at noon, only to shut it off again at 3 every afternoon and turn it back on at 7. That’s what she has to do to save enough money to eat. She says, quietly, “I put a few more sweaters on.” That’s what she does. That’s how she survives. That’s the Ontario that these guys have created. That’s the problem. They’ve been living off their credit card and not off their debit card. That’s the problem we have in Ontario.", "Speaker, when you think about the repercussions now—not just to the families, because there are going to be repercussions to the families—there are families who are going to have to sit down and have that chat with their kids about, “No, we can’t do that this year. It’s the hydro bill.” Can you imagine that? That Ontario—", "I walk to work every morning. I walk by the monument of Sir Adam Beck every single morning.

The city of North Bay’s rating got bumped downwards through no fault of their own, just for achieving the title of being tied with the province of Ontario—one of the highest ratings brought down. It put borrowing costs up. It put borrowing costs up at hydro. All the hydro utilities, municipalities like Ottawa and North Bay and many of the universities—all got dragged down along with the laggards here at the province of Ontario, who brought our ratings down. That was a shameful day, and a very expensive day for taxpayers.", "Speaker, I want to refer to a few sections in Focus on Finance because this is exactly what we said would happen in the province of Ontario.", "Moody’s debt-rating agency last year changed their outlook from “stable” to “negative.” Why? They expressed their concerns over the government’s ability to eliminate the deficit in three years.

They can’t control their spending.

No, each party has taken pretty well the same position. Have all the coal plants in Ontario been closed? They have. So we’re now debating a bill that, quite frankly, probably doesn’t need to be debated because we’ve already closed the coal plants. Every political party in Ontario has taken essentially the same position, and the government is moving this bill forward through the House.", "So you have to ask yourself why. I think it’s very simply this: This government is looking to put forward anything that seems to be progressive in the face of an austerity budget and the privatization of hydro. That’s what this is all about. The government is trying to say, “Look at this shiny penny over here. Look how progressive we are. We’re going to ban the use of coal in Ontario.” Who here in this House is going to vote against that? Nobody. We’re all going to vote in favour.", "But the point is that the government needs to do this because they have an austerity budget that they’ve essentially stolen from Tim Hudak’s last campaign document. They’re essentially doing what Tim Hudak said he was going to do in the last election except they’re trying to do it under the guise of being a progressive government, as the Premier says, governing from the progressive centre. Give me a break. If you have a cut and you lose jobs—and it’s probably going to be close to the numbers that Mr. Hudak proposed in the last election—I don’t see that as being progressive. I see that as being a pretty regressive move.", "To sell off Ontario Hydro at a time when hydro rates have gone up by 320%, to sell it for $4 billion that the province is going to get for infrastructure when we can do it a lot cheaper by other means—for example, cancelling the HST input clawback that the big corporations are going to get would more than pay for this. This is a shiny penny trying to say, “Look over here. Don’t pay attention to the unprogressive things that the Liberal government is doing.”" ],

The thing that’s most clear is that everyone really seems to enjoy the title of the bill. It sounds good. It’s something that we can pass. After all, who would be against cleaner air? The title of the bill allows you to give yourself a pat on the back, so why don’t we do that? Give yourselves a pat on the back. Go ahead.", "One of the major errors here is that the bill does nothing proactive. As we have mentioned time and time again, the coal plants are already closed down. Just as this government is preparing to sell energy assets that belong to the people of this province to make some extra cash—and this is a point that was raised by my colleagues on the other side—a government may turn to coal to save money. So at the very least, this bill will put a stop to that and require consultation, with this legislation. Right now, that’s the best thing this bill is for. Other than that, it’s a pat on the back and does nothing else.", "But really, what we should be discussing in this House—there are a lot more important things we could deal with this morning rather than legislating a problem that doesn’t exist.

These facilities are amongst the largest producers of greenhouse gases, which, as we all know, are a significant contributor to global climate change.", "In my riding of Burlington, Speaker, we came face to face with the impacts of climate change last August when a one-in-100-year storm brought 200 millimetres of rain on my community in just a few hours, impacting over 3,000 homes and causing close to $100 million in damage.", "Our government’s decision to eliminate all coal-fired generating stations, a prime indication of our commitment to preserving our environment for the enjoyment of future generations, is the largest initiative of its kind anywhere in North America. This underscores our commitment to make Ontario greenhouse gas emissions as low as we can, prioritizing Ontarians’ health and mitigating environmental damage to buildings, crops and ecosystems.", "I will reference health in a moment, and I will be joined shortly by my colleague the member from Cambridge, who, as a nurse, can speak very well to the increased number of intakes in emergency departments as a consequence of asthma and what getting rid of coal has meant to those numbers.", "To achieve this, it’s not simply enough to eliminate all facilities that currently use the burning of coal as a way of generating power. We must also ensure that these types of facilities cannot be built and/or operated at any point in the future. Opponents of this legislation will point out that there’s regulation that exists already which eliminates the use of coal in power generating in existing locations, but it fails to address any new facilities that may one day be built. This bill does just that: It will prevent the use of coal for producing power at any facility in Ontario, plain and simple, safeguarding our health and well-being now and that of future generations.", "This issue does not only affect our environment; it also has a significant impact on the economy. The costs associated with these types of facilities are estimated to be $4.4 billion per year. This includes both short- and long-term health effects attributed to poor air quality, pollution and climate change. Since we shut down the coal-powered plants, as I mentioned, we’ve had fewer smog alerts, and as someone who suffers from asthma and lives in a riding where close to one in five citizens is a senior, I certainly appreciate—and I know these vulnerable citizens do too—the impact this legislation and this initiative alone has had on our quality of life. This initiative has no added cost to it, only the added benefit of reducing costs.", "Businesses that rely on the use of coal for other processes and production need not fear, however, as this bill will only apply to facilities that use coal for the primary purpose of generating electricity. Companies that use coal or its by-products in the production of metals, for example, will be able to continue their operations as normal. There’s no intention of banning the use of coal for these purposes, as there are currently no alternates. Advances in technology must be made before such a step could be made without having significant negative economic impact on Ontario.", "This is not to mention the potential long-term health and environmental impacts which we have not yet seen. We have already made inroads into our understanding of these effects but it is difficult to know what will happen in the decades to come. All over the world, governments are making the decision to move away from the use of coal in their power generation facilities, and I am proud to be part of a government that is leading the way. By becoming the first jurisdiction in North America to completely do away with coal generation and ensure that it can never be used again, Ontario is taking the equivalent of up to seven million cars off the road. This legislation will do much to ensure that our health and enjoyment of our natural beauty and environment that we have come to love and treasure as Ontarians, and expect in our province as well, are protected for the enjoyment of all Ontarians for generations to come.", "Thank you very much for this opportunity, Speaker.

On May 9, 1992, when I was a grade 11 student in a small town called New Glasgow, Nova Scotia, at 5:36 a.m., our community awoke to one of the biggest mine disasters in the world’s history, the Westray mine disaster.

In Ontario last year, 349 people were killed on the job, thousands were injured, and countless more people dealt with complications due to work-related illnesses and disease. These numbers reflect an unacceptable trend of deaths over the last few years and hundreds, if not thousands, of injuries.", "In 2012, 298 workers lost their lives. In 2011, it was 349 workers. In 2010, it was 398 workers, and on and on—far too many people. These are the people who lost their lives. These are the families who lost loved ones. As I said, there are thousands and thousands of others, not reflected in those numbers of people, who were exposed to environmental toxins and who were exposed to stresses in the workplace that led to PTSD. Speaker, many more people were felled with illnesses and with diseases—as those also who were killed.", "As a province, we have a duty not only to honour these women and men but actually to ensure that our obligation stretches to make a difference for the future of workers in this province. We do this by making sure, for example, that workplace safety standards actually reflect the changing workplaces that we have in the province of Ontario—workplaces, for example, in construction, manufacturing, mining, firefighting and other hazardous places.", "Speaker, in 2009, you may recall that there was a fall on a construction site that led to something called the Dean report, which was commissioned by the government back in 2010. This is a report specifically for workers who are working in high places in the construction industry. We know that in 2014, four years after that initiative, we had seven workers die from high falls in the construction industry. Something is still not working. We saw a couple of deaths just in the last couple of weeks on construction sites in this province. There is something that is still not right when it comes to making sure that these workers are protected on the job.", "I’m proud to stand with a caucus that has been working to ensure that this province has greater workplace protections, helping first responders get recognition and treatment for post-traumatic stress disorders, for example; protecting child performers on the job; protecting the rights of interns in the workplace; and many, many other initiatives that New Democrats have brought to this chamber in recent years as well as historically.", "Too often, this government has been dragging its feet on some of the most important health and safety measures. It’s important to acknowledge that today, because if we don’t acknowledge it, we’re not going to fix it for the future.", "We have now recommendations that have come from a review of the mining health and safety act. It had been 30 years since the mining health and safety act had been reviewed. The workers in that industry were pressuring the government for years and years. In fact, they were calling for a public inquiry because it was so bad, the changes that had happened in the mining industry not being reflected in the language that was supposed to be the legislation that protected those workers on the job.", "Now what the government needs to do is act quickly on the recommendations that come from that review that they took on. I congratulate the government for finally taking that review on and doing that work and doing that consultation, but that’s not good enough. The changes that are recommended have to be implemented.", "Every injury, every death in the workplace is one too many, but every year we see these tragic events on the construction site, on the factory floor, in the field, underground and on the front lines. Families in the north and across the industrial heartland in rural areas and in our cities are left to pick up the pieces of their lives when their loved ones are suddenly taken from them at work.", "Every Ontarian has the right to safely earn a living. Every worker is entitled to the same protection, but the explosion of part-time and precarious work leaves far too many workers vulnerable to greater workplace risks and leaves them with fewer protections to speak up about workplace safety, for fear of losing their jobs.", "Every working person in Ontario, and their families, deserves the right of peace of mind. No Ontarian should ever have to worry if a loved one will go to work and never return.", "New Democrats are committed to strong safety regulations and enforcement. We’re committed to working with employers, unions, safety specialists, WSIB and the government to make Ontario’s workplaces safer for every Ontarian. We can’t stop until workplace accidents stop. Until then, we mourn for the dead and we fight for the living." ],

Immunization has been heralded as one of the greatest achievements in public health of the 20th century. It has resulted in the control, eradication or near elimination of numerous infectious diseases and saved more Canadian lives over the past 50 years than any other health intervention. Yet, despite these tremendous scientific advances, we are seeing preventable illnesses making the news in record numbers.", "As a society we have taken for granted the impact vaccines have had on our daily lives. Because we are not witnessing first-hand the effects of these diseases, we have forgotten their debilitating and sometimes lethal impact. We have forgotten what the pain and suffering looks like and that is because, when immunization programs work well, we forget that they are working at all.", "Vaccines are designed to protect the young, the old, the vulnerable and everyone in between. And in an age when health care centres on acute and chronic treatment, immunization allows us to flip the paradigm, protecting people before they become patients.", "Thanks to vaccines, it is almost unheard of that a child will die in Canada of smallpox, diphtheria or bacterial meningitis. Thanks to vaccines, our hospitals no longer need to treat the devastating effects of polio with iron lungs. Thanks to vaccines, we can protect our seniors against shingles and pneumonia. It is one of the best health measures that you can take to protect yourself and your loved ones from disease and illness, and a cost-effective public health measure that reduces the burden on Ontario’s health system through fewer hospital admissions and reduced medical care expenses.", "During National Immunization Awareness Week I ask of you, instead of forgetting the past, let’s remember it and work towards improving our future. As such, I respectfully remind all members of the House to keep up to date with their immunizations." ],

But the thing that is really starting to frustrate people to the largest degree is when you see a mill like what we saw in Iroquois Falls and Smooth Rock Falls close its doors—but what you now see is truckload after truckload after truckload of wood cut in Ontario forests, both poplar and conifer, and transferring it into the province of Quebec for processing.", "It is a very bad policy. Our policy should be that wood that is cut in Ontario should be processed through Ontario mills. If there need to be wood exchanges—because those have existed for many years, where mills across the border exchange fibre, because there are some fibre exchanges that do make some sense, but they’re essentially equal when it comes to the amount of wood being used—that is not a bad thing, and nobody will stand in the way of it.", "But imagine how the community feels in Iroquois Falls and in Cochrane where they’ve seen their mills go down, and there’s between 600 to 1,000 loads of poplar and conifer that are being shipped out to the province of Quebec from those particular forests at the same time that we have mills like Little John Enterprises, which is trying to get certainty on wood when it comes to poplar so that he can operate his mill. Imagine how they feel when they see the wood that could be feeding their mill being transferred over to Quebec and not given an opportunity to add value here in the province of Ontario.", "I call on the government to stop this practice." ],

Now the day of mourning is recognized in more than 100 countries right around the globe.", "Here at home, health and safety advocates in our businesses, schools and communities work hard each and every day to ensure healthy and very safe workplaces for our people.", "The good news today is that thanks to the efforts of all those people, we’ve significantly lowered the number of workplace injuries in the province of Ontario. In fact, in the past decade we’ve reduced injuries by 40%, making Ontario one of the safest places to work in all of Canada.", "Despite this progress, too many people, though, continue to lose their lives, or to suffer an injury or an illness, simply as a result of going to work. No job is worth a life; no job is worth an illness or an injury.", "While it is very important to track the numbers that will help us ensure our plans are working, there is, of course, a very real and a very human dimension to all of this. When workplace tragedies happen, lives are devastated. Families, co-workers, indeed whole communities, feel the impact, and it’s a painful impact. So I take this role very seriously; I know this House takes this issue very seriously as well.", "I’m urging each and every member from all three parties in the House today to make workplace health and safety a personal priority. I ask you to spread the word in your own communities that workers have the right to refuse unsafe work, that there are resources available through the Ministry of Labour so employers and workers understand their rights and they understand their responsibilities.", "I’m proud to be part of a government that’s actively investing in workplace health and safety. At my ministry, we’re working hard with our partners to continue to bring the injury numbers down and to eliminate these deaths. We’ve almost doubled the number of workplace health and safety inspectors in Ontario.", "Earlier this month we took action to prevent falls in the construction industry by making new working at heights training mandatory in the province.", "We were just recently in Sudbury to announce that the government is accepting and acting on each and every one of the 18 recommendations from the Mining Health, Safety and Prevention Review that was recently undertaken.", "We’re continuing to conduct inspection blitzes every year to raise safety awareness and to help prevent injuries and fatalities.", "But Speaker, I know as much as you do, much more must be done. We must continue to strive to make a difference on this issue for our workers. We need to ensure every workplace has the tools it needs to improve workplace health and safety, and that every worker in the province has the information and the support they need to make choices in the workplace.", "Let us all honour those we remember today by rededicating ourselves to doing whatever it takes to prevent workplace fatalities, injuries and illnesses. Let’s continue to work hard to change the culture around workplace health and safety.", "Let’s remember all those who have been killed or injured at work. Let’s keep them in our thoughts so we never forget the importance of our commitment to keep workers safe.", "Those who have died, been injured or become ill on the job deserve our respect and remembrance.

They are the heroes we call in our times of greatest need. Our first responders are there to answer that call and they never waver.", "My former colleague, Frank Klees, the former member from Newmarket–Aurora, deeply believed that public service performed by these men and women deserved to be recognized, honoured and cherished. That’s why he fought tirelessly to make May 1 First Responders Day, as a lasting testament to their brave service and sacrifice.", "Speaker, I developed a deeper appreciation for our first responders on Friday, September 3, 1999. While driving to work in Windsor on the 401, a thick blanket of fog appeared without warning in the vicinity of Manning Road, leading to the largest vehicle pile-up in Ontario’s history. I recall getting out of my car, rescuing a pregnant woman in the median, getting her to safety and then going back to my vehicle and calling the Chatham radio station to report the accident that was unfolding. In the end, some were able to pull over to safety, but many were not so lucky. I can still hear the vehicles in both the eastbound and westbound lanes slamming into each other. It was like I was in a war zone. All told, more than 40 people were injured and, tragically, eight people lost their lives.", "But our first responders were the calm amongst the chaos, compassionate in the face of carnage. To this day, I remember their unfaltering courage. I also remember the sights and sounds of that foggy morning, and can only begin to imagine the toll such service takes on our first responders. Many of them, I’m sure, suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder afterwards.", "To each and every one of our first responders in our great province, thank you for all that you have done and thank you for what you continue to do.

Instead of choosing to close tax loopholes for corporations, Kathleen Wynne is making Ontarians pay the price. This budget cuts education and closes schools. It cuts health care and fires nurses. It cuts poverty reduction programs. It sells off our hydro system to Bay Street and opens the door to more privatization in years to come.", "Speaker, this isn’t just what I think. This isn’t just New Democrats. Let’s see what other people are saying about this bad budget.", "The Toronto Star writes, “Austerity is the hidden theme.

And we agree. We agree that she has crossed the floor politically. We agree with OntarioNewsWatch. With a majority government, it seems that the fly-by-night progressive leanings of our Premier have suddenly disappeared for good.", "To make things worse, she and her government are trying to ram this budget through and limit public consultation. It’s bad enough that the Premier refuses to be straight with Ontarians about the privatization of Hydro One, but now her House leader is trying to limit public debate. Ontarians deserve the opportunity, through public hearings, to make their concerns and their suggestions known.", "The government has a duty to consult widely in communities all across this province because the impacts of this budget will be felt in all corners of the province. This is the democratic process. Having a majority doesn’t mean that you can ignore the people of Ontario. To try to ram this budget through and limit consultation is simply wrong. I hope the Premier will actually respect the people of Ontario enough to allow them to be heard.", "I want to be clear: The sale of Hydro One is the wrong thing to do. Privatizing hydro was wrong a decade ago, and it is still wrong today. We know this. We know this because we can look to other jurisdictions as well as our own that have privatized their hydro systems or parts thereof and see the results. Right here in Ontario, it went up 25% shortly after the Conservatives privatized the generation of power in this province—25% almost overnight. Nova Scotia privatized its electricity system and now has some of the highest rates in Canada, almost rivalling those of Ontario. This story has played out in many other jurisdictions in Canada and across the US.", "Privatization will be bad for Ontarians. Mark my words, Speaker, Ontarians will pay the price. Privatizing hydro will mean higher rates for Ontario families who are already paying the highest electricity rates in Canada. It will mean the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in stable annual revenue that’s needed to fund public services like hospitals and schools. It will mean less reliability and the loss of control of a critical public asset. It also means the loss of oversight by Ontario’s Ombudsman, whose work has helped thousands of people—literally thousands—with hydro billing issues.", "In fact, the Premier can’t even guarantee that the government will retain any control whatsoever of hydro. She is looking to sell 60%. That’s a majority stake, no matter how the Liberals want to spin it. That means that the government will no longer be able to make decisions that are in the public interest when it comes to electricity.", "Yesterday, we learned that this Liberal government is already exploring the possibility of having a stake that is 10%, keeping only 10% of a stake in hydro or perhaps even less than that. That’s not what the Premier has been telling Ontarians; it’s nothing like what the Premier has been telling Ontarians.", "It is time for this Premier and her government to be upfront and honest with the people of Ontario. They are privatizing Ontario’s electricity system. It is wrong. They know it’s wrong, but they are going to do it anyway. All of this so that the Premier can pay for Liberal scandals, for wrong choices and for bad decisions: $1.2 billion wasted on the gas plants scandal, $2 billion on the smart meter program that has done nothing to help with conservation efforts, another $1 billion wasted annually to subsidize the export of power to light up the Manhattan skyline. All of this paid for on the backs of ratepayers, on the backs of families, on the backs of businesses, on the backs of Ontarians; all of these Liberal scandals paid for by the people of Ontario.", "As if this weren’t bad enough, when we examine this Liberal government’s record on privatization, we see billions more dollars wasted: $1 billion at eHealth, another $1 billion at Ornge, the gas plants, the Presto card rollout, on and on and on. One of our favourites: the $8.2 billion wasted on the wrong-headed way that this government finances our infrastructure projects. Their privatization agenda has left behind a costly legacy of waste and scandal.", "The fact that the Premier and her Liberal government would gamble with Ontario’s hydro system is deeply, deeply troubling to New Democrats, and it’s troubling to the people of Ontario as well, especially when you think about the small return. It is a very small return: $4 billion represents at most 3% of their 10-year infrastructure promise.", "The National Post calls the Premier’s scheme “flawed from the outset,” saying that “selling off prized electricity assets to pay for transit projects smacked more of a cash grab than a considered approach to maximizing value and making sound energy policy.”", "For Ontarians who are already struggling under the weight of the highest bills in Canada, this is very, very troubling. Every day, my office is flooded with emails from people who are having to make tough decisions about how to support their families and keep the lights on.", "Since the Liberal privatization announcement, I have been flooded by letters from people who believe that this reckless plan is a bad idea for Ontario. In fact, I have not received a single message of support for the Premier’s privatization scheme—not a single one.", "Now, it is clear that the Premier has no support whatsoever for her wrong-headed privatization scheme. Ontarians did not vote for a platform of cuts and privatization. Ontarians didn’t elect a banker to run the province, but it certainly seems that that’s exactly what we ended up getting. The Premier needs to spend less time on Bay Street and more time on Main Street.", "You know what, Speaker? If she did listen to Ontarians, she would hear loud and clear that she does not have a mandate to privatize our hydro. New Democrats have always believed in investing in transit and infrastructure, but not at the cost of a short-sighted sell-off of our hydro public assets. This Premier is the first Premier in 100 years who can’t figure out how to build infrastructure without selling our electricity system. How sad.", "Ontario’s New Democrats are going to fight this sell-off, because Ontarians know that this is absolutely the wrong plan, because once it’s gone, it is gone for good.", "In the coming days and weeks, my caucus and I are going to be in communities across the province. What we are going to do is hold town halls. We are going to be talking to Ontarians about their opportunity to sign petitions, asking people to write to their Liberal MPPs, encouraging them to take that voice that they have and use it to tell their MPPs what they really think, and we’re going to be doing much, much more.", "The Premier of this province, the Liberal Premier, may want to shut Ontarians down, but New Democrats want to do the opposite. New Democrats want to respect Ontarians by giving them a chance to have a voice on this extremely important issue. Do you know why, Speaker? Because Ontarians deserve to have a voice. They deserve to be heard. They deserve to be respected, because they will be the ones paying the price.", "But there’s much, much more bad news for Ontarians in this budget, and I’m going to spend a few seconds on that. We already have nurses on the picket line. We have hospitals and wards closing in communities all around the province. We have hospitals that have been running in situations of overcapacity for months on end. In fact, I was just in Thunder Bay hearing from front-line staff about that very issue. We have nurses being fired. All of this is the result of the 2014 budget, Speaker.", "This year’s budget imposes even harsher cuts. The Ontario Medical Association said of this budget that it “puts the health care system at risk.” While health care costs are increasing in the range of 3% to 5% annually in terms of inflationary pressures, the government is only increasing spending by 1.2%, barely the rate of inflation.", "As the Ontario Health Coalition has said, “The real-dollar cuts across ... health care also mean damaging—and potentially irreversible—cuts, closures and privatization of needed health care.”", "The RPNAO, the Registered Practical Nurses Association of Ontario, makes it clear that front-line staff “will continue to suffer from increased workloads, stress, burnout and the moral distress associated with watching in frustration as their patients fail to get the level and quality of care they deserve.”", "Unifor puts it more starkly: “Keeping the health care budget ... below inflation puts lives at risk.”", "On top of the underfunding of Ontario’s health care system, this Liberal government will also be implementing, for the fourth consecutive year, hospital funding freezes. I would like to note that the ministry refused to answer any direct questions from my staff about hospital funding, but these freezes have been confirmed by ONA, the Ontario Nurses’ Association, and the Toronto Star—so much for the openness and transparency of the openness and transparency Premier. I think she forget her openness and transparency when she started to prepare this budget.", "As I was saying, this Liberal government will freeze hospital budgets for the fourth consecutive year. This represents the longest unbroken period of real-dollar public hospital cuts in Ontario’s history. This will have a devastating impact, as we all know, on our hospitals. People will wait longer for service. They will travel further distances to get the care they need. There will be more shortages of beds and more overcrowding. There will be real consequences because of these cuts.", "The Ontario Nurses’ Association makes it very clear that “another consecutive year of hospital funding freezes means that registered nurses will be cut, leaving hospital patients in Ontario at an increased risk of complications and even death.” That’s a pretty strong statement. That will be on the heads of the Liberals sitting across the way.", "This is the Liberal government’s transformation of Ontario’s health care system: Fewer resources for our health professionals, even as our aging population puts increasing demands on the system. New Democrats believe that Ontarians deserve properly funded, high-quality health care regardless of where they live in this province; it is a right that they all deserve. This includes northern Ontario, rural Ontario and southwestern Ontario, where people are seeing their local hospitals threatened. These communities deserve high-quality health care as much as anyone else in Ontario, as much as people who live in major urban centres, who have the luxury of a number of other hospitals at their disposal.", "I want to be clear, Speaker. New Democrats believe that this budget does great harm, possibly irreversible harm, to Ontario’s health care system.", "Look at education, and once again what we see in this budget is more Liberal cuts. This budget cuts education, closes schools and fires teachers. The Liberals have already cut $250 million so far this year as they work towards cutting half a billion dollars from education. In addition, there will be a complete freeze on spending from 2016-18, while during this period, inflation is projected by their own admission to be about 2% each year. This means even deeper cuts are on the horizon for education. Families, parents and students are already feeling the pinch, and they are seeing the results of all of this first-hand. They’re watching as teachers and early childhood educators are being fired. Already, we have disrupted classrooms and students out of school, because these Liberal cuts are hurting education.", "Meanwhile communities—especially some of the province’s most struggling communities—are staring down the possibility of seeing schools in their communities close. This, once again, so-called modernization—if it’s not transformation, it’s modernization—strategy will tear the soul out of these hard-working neighbourhoods. We know that this is short-sighted, and we do not agree with the direction of this government when it comes to education. We know—absolutely everybody is aware—that there is an ebb and flow to school enrolment, and that many of these same areas are seeing an influx of new Canadians at the same time as young families as well. So five years down the road, we will be struggling to keep up with demand in these very same areas where the Liberals are now closing down schools. It is very, very short-sighted.", "New Democrats believe that we should be smarter when it comes to our schools. Our schools are valuable neighbourhood assets that could be used to provide badly needed child care spaces or seniors’ programming or even rental space that would provide revenues. Closing our public schools is not only short-sighted; it is wasteful and, frankly, New Democrats think it is wrong.", "Unfortunately, our post-secondary education system doesn’t seem to fare any better in this budget. The government is committing to three years of funding cuts to Ontario’s universities and colleges. Three years of funding cuts is what’s in that budget. High-quality post-secondary education is a big part of what gives Ontario an edge as a labour force on the world stage. In fact, I don’t know how many times I sat in this chamber and heard Liberal Premiers say the exact same thing: that top-notch post-secondary education was what was going to make sure that we were going to have a top-notch labour force that was going to be able to compete globally with anybody else around the world.", "I have to say that the Liberal Premier of Ontario has abandoned all belief in that goal. These cuts leave groups like OCUFA “questioning the government’s commitment to a high-quality higher education system that is truly public, high quality and accessible to every student.” Further, they say, “Students, contract faculty members and their families are now paying for the government’s unwillingness to invest in universities. In the longer term, every Ontarian will feel the effects of the erosion of public university funding.”", "The Ontario federation of students calls the Ontario Liberal government’s 2015 budget “another missed opportunity to address the chronic underfunding of post-secondary education that has made Ontario the most expensive province in which to attend college or university.” The proposed changes to OSAP do little to address the upfront costs of post-secondary education of Ontario students, who are already paying the highest tuition rates in all of Canada.", "New Democrats believe that we need to invest in our post-secondary education system if we are going to be able to build the best possible 21st-century workforce. It is unfair for the government to saddle a generation of students with an unbearable debt burden. This will only hurt our province’s economy in the future. Once again, this Liberal government is being short-sighted and putting the burden of our province’s recovery on the backs of those who can least afford it.", "This brings me to northern Ontario, a region that is no stranger to being ignored by this Liberal government. It should come as no surprise that the 2015 budget, once again, ignores the priorities of northern Ontario. This Liberal budget, once again, has northern families paying the price while getting nothing—zilch—in return. It does nothing to address the electricity needs of the mining industry. It does nothing to address the government’s failure to form meaningful partnerships with First Nations leaders. It does nothing to address the failure of leadership on the Ring of Fire development.", "In fact, the budget tells us that there will be no investment in the Ring of Fire until after the next election. They’re punting their promise that they made in this last election campaign—another billion dollars, they announced at an election campaign a year ago, and now they’re saying, “We’re not doing any of that until sometime maybe in 2018-19. Thank you very much, northern Ontario. We’re going to wash our hands of you for the next couple of years.” Really, it is just unbelievable.", "The bottom line is, I was in Thunder Bay during the last election when the Premier did make that announcement. Somehow I don’t recall it—because it wasn’t done. She didn’t mention at all the fact that there would be no funding until 2018-19.", "You know what? I have to sadly say—and I’m sure my northern colleagues here would agree—it’s not a surprise. It is not surprising. It continues the sorry legacy that this Liberal government has shown on the Ring of Fire: complete lack of leadership. It is absolutely shameful: more than seven years of announcements and ribbon cuttings and blah blah blah, as our old friend Rosario Marchese would have said; oh, sorry, the ex-member, the former member. Should I say that, Speaker? The former member for Trinity–Spadina.", "But more than seven years of announcements and not a single thing to show for it. There is nothing in this budget for the north—nothing, big goose egg. A few re-announcements about roads—yes. Continuation of a $30-million cut to the NIER Program—yes. A step back from meaningful commitments to First Nations communities—yes. I think we went backwards in this budget when it comes to the north.", "The Liberals even managed to claw back that meagre commitment from the 2014 budget to First Nations.", "The Liberal legacy in the north is one of a failure of leadership, full stop.", "In wrapping up, Speaker, I want to say very clearly to the people of Ontario: This is a bad, bad budget. It is the wrong budget for today’s Ontario. It is the wrong budget for Ontario families. It is the wrong budget for Ontario businesses—small, medium, large. It is the wrong budget for agriculture.", "It is a budget that will hurt Ontarians not only this year but for many, many generations to come." ],

They’re very committed people. When we asked the hard questions, they helped us peel back the layers on this budget. I want to thank them for that.", "The theme that I’d like to focus on, actually, is that this budget, budget 2015, doubles down on austerity from last year’s budget. Every ministry, last budget, had a 6% cut. We didn’t hear too much about that during the election. It’s very unfortunate because people bought in to a definition of “progressive” which, quite honestly, we’ve had to move away from because it was just not true.", "This budget has 5.5% cuts in every ministry as well, with the exception of four ministries. But if we learned from last year’s budget, those cuts actually happened and they’re actually listed in this budget as well. Even though we heard that some ministries were safe, that was not the case.", "What I really want to focus on is that this budget is predicated on, and the spin around this budget is, that the selling off of Hydro One is good for the people of this province when, quite honestly, it isn’t.", "With the release of the budget last Thursday and the tabling of the budget motion, we know that the Liberals’ first priority is to sell off Hydro One. They are so desperate for revenue that they are willing to sell off the future of this province on reliable energy, on revenues from Hydro One and on rates that actually will only have one direction to go, and that is up. That’s clear from schedule 9.", "It’s also clear from all of the schedules which remove Hydro One from oversight, which is quite an undertaking—that is, removing oversight from all of the legislative officers. This is the other side of the coin. The Financial Accountability Officer loses oversight; the Auditor General loses oversight; the Ombudsman of Ontario loses oversight by taking away Hydro One’s status as a public sector entity.", "The goal of this budget obviously is for a quick cash grab. The people of this province, I think, are waking up to the reality of this sale. Certainly, and what they tell me in the grocery store, in the library and in the schoolyard, is that this was not part of the platform. The ministry—the Premier—does not have a mandate to sell off Hydro One. Yet here we are, looking for a quick cash grab—in all the wrong places, I would say.", "There are dozens of schedules in this budget bill, but the thrust is to double down on the selling off of Hydro One before most Ontarians even know what’s going on. We’ve been determined to share the story of what’s happening in this House with the people of this province, but thankfully there are some very progressive voices in the media who have actually weighed in on this. One of them—this was just in the Globe and Mail on April 27. Mr. Laxer says, “In truth, the big losers will be Ontarians. They will be reduced from owners of the system to its tenants and they will pay out extra billions to the new owners in the decades to come.”", "That’s essentially what’s happening. The people of this province are losing this important asset. They’re going to become tenants in this electricity system, and I think it’s pretty safe to say that there’s not going to be any rent control. If we’ve learned anything from the past, Mr. Speaker, it’s that rates will only go up.", "The Liberal government will say that there’s no choice. That’s the theme here. The Premier stands up, day in and day out, and says, “No, we don’t have any choice in the matter.” In order to make investments in transit and infrastructure, they say that we have to follow the advice of Bay Street, regardless of the conflict of interest that exists on this file.", "We just learned this morning that we paid $7 million for this advice, and what did they say that the province should do? Well, it’s not surprising what they said. They said, “We should sell off Hydro One to the private sector.” Imagine that, Mr. Speaker. Imagine that a group of private sector consultants, with connections to all of the Bay Street players, would recommend that our publicly owned electricity distributor should be sold off—" ],

It’s really quite surprising that the private sector would want a cut of that annual revenue. Of course, they’re looking for that revenue, and they see a willing partner in the Premier of this province.", "But the Liberals remain committed to telling you that there’s no choice. If you want transit, Hydro One must be sold. That’s the deal. It’s the only way.", "They also announced the modernization of alcohol policy in the province on the same day, just to say, “Look over here. We’ve got six-packs in the Walmart and we’ve got 12-packs over here in 10 LCBO stores. Don’t pay attention, folks, to what’s really going on in the province.”", "What if I told you that the $4 billion that the government will make by selling off the 60% of Hydro One is only 3%? This is an important piece. You are absolutely gambling the future of our electricity system, of reliable rates, of affordable electricity—for what? For 3%. It has been said that this won’t even pay for half of some of the big projects that you promised—or that you actually reannounced—in this last budget. It’s a drop in the bucket.", "But it is amazing that you have to go to the extreme of selling off this strategic, reliable, public asset for $4 billion when you could find money, no problem, when it was making a private energy company whole—you made whole a private energy company during the gas plant scandal. There was no problem whatsoever finding that kind of cash.", "Let’s get back to the impact on the people of this province, because what’s really going to happen—because we know from our history what’s going to happen—is that rates are going to go up, reliability will go down, and the province will lose an extremely valuable source of revenue.", "Let’s cover how the rates will go up.", "Right now, there’s no incentive to increase Hydro One’s profits. The mandate of Hydro One as an organization is to deliver reliable energy to Ontarians and remit any revenue above operating costs back to the province. There’s no one at the board suggesting that a renovation on a power line shouldn’t be done this year because it would look bad on the quarterly report of the shareholders. But that changes as soon as Hydro One starts issuing shares. Once this budget passes, the public loses control over Hydro One and then, according to the government, the OEB will protect ratepayers. Well, we know that that actually is not the track record of the OEB in the province of Ontario.", "Rates have gone up three times since 2002. They have tripled. All of us in this House fully understand that the people in our ridings cannot afford for those rates to continue to go up.", "It is also worth noting that the energy rates are now three times higher than they were when the Harris Conservatives started privatizing the energy system, and there has been inconsistency in delivery of those rates. There’s no rhyme or reason to it, quite honestly.", "Right now, there are thousands of people in this province who are having to choose between paying their energy bills and putting food on the table. That’s not right. That should be Premier Wynne’s focus, not what’s in the best interests of Bay Street. It is time to get our priorities straight in this House and put people first.", "As soon as this budget passes, there will be no recourse for Ontarians. That’s why this is such a serious issue. Accountability will be gone. Transparency will be gone. Annual revenue will be gone. This government is slamming the door on transparency and accountability on the electricity file.", "As it stands, the Ombudsman, the Auditor General and the privacy commissioner etc. can all investigate Hydro One. That kind of oversight improves things for consumers and energy users. The Ombudsman reports and Auditor General reports make energy delivery better because Ontarians can tell the government and the opposition the challenges that they are facing. This budget removes that oversight in several schedules.", "Even if the IPO doesn’t happen for a few years, oversight is gone when this budget passes. That, in and of itself, tells the people of this province whose interests this budget is in. It is not in their interest; it’s in the interests of Bay Street.", "The profit motive going forward with this new, privatized Hydro One will drive up rates in Ontario, and I think, fundamentally, people understand this. Even the Premier and Ed Clark wouldn’t deny that possibility on the day they released this paper. They prefer to talk about beer, but we really tried hard to bring it back to the rates. Rates are going to go up, and Ontarians will no longer be able to count on oversight to protect them or to shine a light on the problems that exist.", "Reliability is a related problem. Private shareholders will have no reason to invest in the distribution system to ensure it is reliable—that people in every corner of the province get the power that they need. Instead, the first concern will be shareholders. Sure, the province will be a shareholder, but not the majority shareholder. That loss of control will doom energy reliability.", "We heard yesterday, in our finance briefing, that the government has not crafted this piece of legislation to ensure that they will remain the majority holder. In fact, they’ve left that door wide open. The day that this announcement was made, a member of the media, from the Toronto Star, asked the Premier outright, “Is this the thin edge of the wedge? What else is for sale in the province of Ontario?” Quite honestly, the answer was, “Do you know what? We’re going to see how this goes.” So that door is open. That’s why the fight to protect Hydro One in the best interests of the people of this province is a fight worth fighting for.", "On the revenue side, for a government that is desperate for revenue, giving up hundreds of millions of dollars—annual dollars—that go to our schools and hospitals is incredibly short-sighted. It’s inconceivable that we’re even debating this issue. We should be debating job creation. We should be talking about an industrial energy rate. We should be talking about the youth unemployment rate and how to inspire investors in the province of Ontario to get our young people back to work. Instead, we’re talking about such a misguided plan. Really, it’s essentially throwing money right out the door, because once this asset is gone, it is gone, gone, gone. There is no recourse for the people of this province.", "It’s important for us to remember that this Premier has no mandate to do this. The average Ontarian, if you talk to them, had no idea that Hydro One was going to be for sale. They refuse to this day to say that they are selling off Hydro One. They refuse to say that they are privatizing. They say “unlocking” or “broadening the ownership.” I guess it’s time to broaden the definition of “progressive,” because there’s nothing progressive about selling off Hydro One.", "I do think it’s important to remember why we are here, in this place, in this time, in the province of Ontario. We heard a lot about what leadership is. Leadership is about making decisions, and it’s also about choices. This Premier has made some pretty devastating choices, Mr. Speaker, for the people of this province. She would have Ontarians believe that there is in fact no choice, that there is no recourse, that this has to happen. We challenge the premise of that wholeheartedly. She says that she must sell assets to pay for infrastructure, but we also know the choices that they have made, that she has made.", "We should remember that when the Premier was the Minister of Transportation back in 2010, she chose to remove $4 billion from the transit file, to cut that $4 billion from transit so her government could then give corporations a tax break that cost the provincial treasury $2.5 billion every year, an amount that could completely fund the Big Move." ],

There are only so many ribbons you can cut.", "Let’s remember choices, because for the Premier to stand up and say she has no choice—she had choices, and she could focus more on the revenue streams that are needed for this province instead of cutting. Quite honestly, some of these cuts are going to be devastating for the ministries. We’ve already heard from some of them.", "Essentially, what this budget does is really throws everything under the bus except for infrastructure. That comment came from Hugh Mackenzie. He makes some really good points as well. He says, “Elementary and secondary education spending is going up at less than the rate of inflation, and that includes the remaining cost of implementing full-day kindergarten.” That’s an important piece, Mr. Speaker, because this government throws a big number back at us on education.", "Whatever new money they did put in education went to FDK. The Rozanski report identified $2 billion in cuts from the former Harris government; those are still standing. Those cuts are systemic. They are built in to the education funding, and your own budget actually demonstrates that $248 million has been removed from education. That’s why it’s in brackets in this chart.", "“Post-secondary education will actually be dropping at a rate of 0.4% per year on the way to budget balance.” We met with university students—the member from London West and I met with OUSA last week—and they can’t believe it. They can’t believe that these cuts are happening because that’s not what they were promised. It’s a bit of a wake-up call, actually, for a lot of groups across the province.", "Of course, health care will increase at less than inflation, so that essentially is a cut.", "At this point, there’s no comprehensive strategy for aging in the province of Ontario. We had a round table in our riding—and I know that this is an issue across the province—around a lack of a dementia strategy, an aging strategy for the seniors in our communities. If you sit down and listen to these people, if you get out of this place and you listen to the real people of this province, if you don’t just spend your time on Bay Street, you actually can hear the pain that people are experiencing because this government has no strategy to deal with an aging demographic.", "The health care funding as it stands today will actually drive more people to the emergency rooms, and that costs more money. These cuts will not lead us back to prosperity. It is, pure and simple, an austerity budget.", "Social assistance benefits: Both Ontario Works and ODSP are still lower, by 5% to 7% after accounting for inflation, than where they were at the end of the Harris era. So this really is about priorities.", "Bay Street gets their attention. The consultants make $7 million for a report that recommends a financial strategy which, quite honestly, is bad for the economy of this province, and they get priority status. It is really incredible.", "Also, taking a step back just to look at the critical gaps which are already evident in this budget: The ministries that received the 6% cut, everything from worker safety—here we are on the day of mourning, five years past the mandatory recommendations that came out of the Dean report. There were 11; one of them was working at heights training, one was the swing stage—these have not been enacted, and that costs money, too.", "When you’re creating legislation or when you’re directing funds to those respective ministries, if you’re not being proactive or adopting an early intervention piece, or even a compassionate perspective on these issues, you end up spending more money down the road.", "What I think is really more disappointing than ever is that this government had the opportunity to actually demonstrate that they understood that there is a revenue problem in the province of Ontario. You just have to look at the budget itself, as contained in the charts. One of those, obviously, is job creation. This government predicted that last year they would create 67,000 jobs; based on the numbers contained in your own budget, those jobs were not realized. That is lost revenue.", "You have to peel back the layers and find out why those jobs were not created. A lot of it actually goes back to energy, because we lost those good-paying manufacturing jobs. When people think about investing in the province of Ontario, the energy rate is at the top of the list. So we are not drawing that kind of investment because of energy. At the same time, we’re contemplating cutting off one of the major revenue streams that we receive from OPG and Hydro One, as is indicated in your very budget.", "There are a number of other issues that we obviously need to talk about. Hydro One: Our leader covered the entire complement of issues that this sale will bring.", "The other issue, of course, is the ORPP. I have to say that the huge red flag for us on the creation of the ORPP Administration Corp., as was dictated in this budget, is the very fact that on pages 148 and 149, this government is putting out an RFP for a third party to come and manage the ORPP. If this government’s track record is anything for us to be concerned about—and it is; your track record is not good on these issues—one has only to look at the Auditor General’s report to verify how poorly you manage these issues." ],

If we look at what happened in BC, seven out of the 10 top public servants were managing that pension fund, so they’re doing okay. Some of the money that they are making is, quite honestly, obscene for managing a pension fund, when every dollar that is collected for a public pension plan should go into that plan for the people that it was originally created to serve. We have huge issues with the ORPP, but mainly, all of those issues are predicated on the fact that we don’t trust you to do it properly.", "Obviously, the ORPP Administration Corp. will also not be subject to the Corporations Information Act. Again, it’s another agency, another stand-alone third-party group to run wild with the money that’s in this province. The lack of oversight that you’ll have on this should be concerning to you, if you care about where the money is going, if you do care about where the funding goes.", "The other issue that I want to raise falls under schedule 40 under the Taxation Act. This government has promised to strengthen apprenticeships. There’s $23 million targeted. At the same time as the $23 million is on this side, you’re removing the tax credit for the private sector to actually bring those apprenticeships—you’re cutting it by $55 million." ],

You won’t say it, but I have to tell you, it’s out there in the open.", "A six-month transition period from royal assent is provided for Hydro One and its subsidiaries, so you get six months for the Auditor General, who is now conducting a current investigation of Hydro One—she has six months to finish up her audit because this government wants to sell Hydro One, and then she won’t get to review those findings in two years because she won’t have access to the information.

We can point to several areas within our provincial economy that have created an imbalance and inequity in incomes, retirement security and pension security. Inevitably, that has led this government to attempt to do something about it, from a chorus of stakeholders and everyday Ontarians who are calling for some measures on the part of this government and the federal government to protect and ensure that workers in this province who dedicate their lives and many years to an employer are able to retire with dignity and security. We assume that’s what this government is attempting to do through the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Act.", "Now, two thirds or 66.7% of Ontarians do not currently have a workplace pension. Imagine, you work your entire life—and more and more people in our economy and more and more job seekers and those who enter the labour market are finding employment with what we know now as precarious work, which delivers a job, certainly, but not a career and not a vocation, not something that we know traditionally gave families and individuals the ability to raise a family, to live that Ontario dream, that Canadian dream: to afford a home, afford to make those expenditures and afford to save. No longer are those the dominant jobs available in the workforce.", "I’ve done it many times. I’m able to juxtapose free trade and the elimination of those provisions, protection mechanisms, into a lot of our economic hardships. You point to that point in time when we lost so much of our domestic manufacturing, the backbone of our economy specifically here in Ontario.", "What I say is that the economic shift or the demographic shift in the jobs that are available is directly related to the measures taken on the part of the various federal and provincial governments over the years. Nonetheless, we’re here today attempting to deal with those ramifications.", "We know that 66.7% of Ontarians do not currently have a workplace pension, and some Ontarians with insufficient workplace pensions also still struggle into retirement. Undoubtedly, we have a retirement crisis in the province of Ontario. We know that when people have disposable income at the end of their working careers, something that they can literally bank on, they have a whole host, a variety of better social outcomes, whether it be health or whether it be security of self, and also economic generation in the buying capacity that so many organizations would point to as being an important metric in a healthy, stable economy.", "When we have an aging demographic that has purchasing power, we have an overall healthy economy. That’s no longer the case. Baby boomers are now competing with their children for decent-paying jobs—this is after their entire working career—because of the change, that seismic shift in the nature of work in the province and, I would argue, the entire country, where we no longer have built into workplaces the provisions of a defined benefit plan, which was the staple, which was the benchmark of what we would call a good-paying job in the province.", "What we find now is precarious part-time work, contract work that often doesn’t give any benefits whatsoever and leaves people even more vulnerable—and these are for older workers even. Imagine what it’s like for young workers entering the labour market. Imagine what it’s like for young workers who have incurred massive post-secondary education debt. The prospects are bleak, and we see no measures on the part of the government trying to attempt to remedy that, although this is one signal that can potentially give a little bit of hope that they’re even talking about it.", "I think, more so, it’s not born out of the ideology of the Liberal Party or the Liberal government; it is born out of the demand of Ontarians for this government or any government to do something. I would definitely say that the negligence on the part of the federal government to take any action towards enhancing the Canada Pension Plan, the GIS or the OAS is the reason why we’re talking about this today. No doubt, economists and pension retirement experts would point to enhancements in our Canada Pension Plan as being probably the most effective, efficient vehicle to ensure retirement security.

We don’t have to look too far back in this decade to see where many retirees and many who invested in RRSPs lost much of their value in their retirement savings. Even in private pension funds, we saw an enormous decrease in value.", "We would also point to the fact that this government and the federal government have yet to enact legislation to protect those who are invested in private pension plans, another initiative of the federal NDP, which brought about a piece of legislation that was called the workers first bill. We’ve seen far too many times where multinational corporations would, for one reason or another, declare bankruptcy in this country and absolve themselves of any of their responsibilities to the retirees and to those who have contributed to pension plans. They go at the bottom of the list when it comes to insolvency and bankruptcy. So you’ve got a mechanism where you’ve got law in this country that doesn’t protect people who already invest in private plans. Wouldn’t we, as a government, want to look at that provision first before we start to bring in other areas, where we’re essentially making up for the failures of private enterprise to provide security for those pensioners and those workers under their own retirement plans?", "My colleague Paul Miller from Hamilton East–Stoney Creek has brought forward a bill in the last sitting of the House that called on this government to secure and augment the pension benefit guarantee to $2,500 a month in that exact case: where corporations would declare bankruptcy and the fund set up under the pension benefit guarantee would enhance what their eligibility is.", "It’s something that is called on not only by those who have already been through this, such as Nortel workers—we know the experience that they’ve had through the insolvency and bankruptcy of the former Nortel—and it has also been called on by a lot of blue-collar workers in larger corporations who are vulnerable as well when large entities declare bankruptcy.", "That’s something that is an aside to what’s happening here. Speaker, this bill as it is—and as it stands is, of course, the first of three parts of a bill that will eventually, potentially, probably, maybe bring about some form of a mechanism for people to have some semblance of retirement security—it is essentially a shell of a bill. It gives the government the ability to create an administration corporation.", "What they have done is—and we read this in the recent budget—they will release an RFP to manage the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan. What does that mean for everyday Ontarians? An RFP—a request for proposals—has been sent out to, I guess, everyone; anyone who thinks that they have the abilities, the skills and the experience to manage a large pension plan. Who could that be? It very well could be the next Ornge, without the right oversight, without the right accountability.", "I see members of the government shaking their heads, “No, no, no.” They don’t think it could ever happen again, but the minister without portfolio, I think, fails to learn from his own mistakes and those of his government. As we have seen so many times, they are abdicating their responsibility to deliver effective policy and effective governance for the people of this province, and it is to the detriment of those who live here for them to not do the work that they are called on to do.", "To outsource this most important role to private entities that will inevitably have their own agendas when given a large sum of money, when given management and power and control without oversight, without accountability—Speaker, this is an I-told-you-so moment. We are telling you: Do not do this. Take control, take ownership, take management, take responsibility.", "If you’re going to deliver such an integral component of the retirement security that people are counting on, that you campaigned on, then, by goodness, take responsibility for it; do it right. Take the consultation that you heard in the committee reports and the committee travelling of this bill from experts in financial management who said, “You really shouldn’t relinquish the control of such an important fund and what ultimately will be quite a large sum of money, given that 50% of eligible workers in the province will be contributing to it.” Inherently there’s a problem there as well, because if it is truly to benefit the province at large, as the Canada Pension Plan does, being universal and being portable, it should have the most buy-in possible. But we’ve given a lot of outs, as it were, a lot of escape routes for many in private industry to not contribute to a plan that should be universal and should be accessible by all.", "What we think is going to happen, Speaker, is that the government will deem comparable plans as being defined contribution plans, as opposed to what could be, and what we know to be, more beneficial to retirees: defined benefit plans. What we don’t understand is how they can be comparable when defined contribution plans are at the whim of the market on many occasions and do not account for major losses in retirement security for the workers who contribute to them. So for them to be comparable is maybe a misnomer, but ultimately the government sees fit to allow that as an opt-out provision.", "The federal government should be playing a role here, there’s no doubt. I don’t think this government has imposed or attempted to impose the correct amount of pressure that they could on the federal government. We hear a little bit through the Finance Minister that they wish the federal government would be playing a bigger role. We do not hear that from their federal cousins in the Liberal Party—any type of pressure of that sort. We would imagine that they should be working in concert to try to take that road.", "Imagine what the province of Ontario could do. Imagine what a majority government in the province of Ontario could do to leverage that type of pressure on the federal government. They haven’t. We haven’t seen anything. It’s very unfortunate that we haven’t used more effort to make that happen because we know that is the most efficient and effective vehicle for Ontarians and Canadians at large to be able to retire with dignity and security. The CPP is a massive fund. It is well regarded. It is globally recognized as being a force not only for retirement security, affordability and livability but also through the management provisions of the CPP.", "Those are some of the questions that we have as well that don’t exist in this shell of a bill, questions that we don’t have answers to. What will those administration provisions be? Once you accept a RFP, how much is it going to cost us to manage this massive Ontario Retirement Pension Plan? We know that it’s going to be a whole bunch. It’s going to be a whole lot more, I think, than if you were to do it in-house.", "Maybe, inherently, that is the difference ideologically between them and us. We actually think we can do it. We believe in some of those public sector managers out there that already—like the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan; that is another globally regarded powerhouse that has returned massive dividends to its shareholders and to its contributors, the teachers of this province. We think we could tap into that type of knowledge base. We think we can do it at less of a premium than what the government is ultimately doing.", "If you look at the similarities between what they’re doing with this and what they do with other components and other integral systems in the province, we’ve seen this plan play out. The wording might be different. The mechanics might be different. Of course, the issue is different. But ultimately, we see a government that continues to abdicate its responsibility, to outsource any involvement in the public sector and to relinquish control and oversight of important, vital components of our economy.", "Why don’t you believe in yourselves? Why can’t you trust yourselves? I guess I don’t blame you given your track record. What we think is that there is a better way to do this. There is a more effective and efficient way to do this.", "Unfortunately, we’re already seeing with this bill that you’re heading down the wrong path. We see that many of the amendments that not only ourselves but the opposition PC Party put forward that may have been non-contentious—some of the ideas that came out of committee deliberations and committee testimony were completely ignored. You heard from experts. You heard from those who have seen these types of plans play out. However, we saw minimal amendments to Bill 56 that make it a broader, more fair and more efficient retirement savings vehicle.", "We put forward our own plan, something that mirrored the Canada Pension Plan, something that was designed to be a defined benefit, something that was transparent, something that was accountable. We delivered a plan, as we always do, that is in stark contrast to what the government has done, because we know their track record. We know the track record of the Liberal government in managing important files. We see it each and every day in this place. It’s too important to absolve yourself of that responsibility.", "What we proposed has been very well articulated and very well presented. As we move further through the legislative process, we will be able to contrast what your ORPP—Ontario Retirement Pension Plan—will look like and what the New Democrat plan would look like, which would be universal, which would be defined-benefit and which would absolutely end up with the end goal of providing retirement security where there is a vacuum from the federal government.", "What we’ve seen—" ],

It’s just another example of how they gouge and gouge, and Ontarians are becoming exhausted. All of these new taxes the Liberals are implementing are crippling our economy, and it makes it harder to live, work and raise a family.", "The Canadian Federation of Independent Business has come out strongly against the proposed ORPP on behalf of their members, stating that 86% of small business owners surveyed did not support the plan. What’s more concerning is that 69% of these owners would freeze or cut salaries, and 53% would reduce their number of employees if the plan was implemented.", "When is this government going to wake up?

Most recently, in eastern Ontario, we just heard that Goodyear is going to be closing up shop as well. It’s just the most recent example of how the Premier’s government is making it unattractive for business to come and confidently stay in this province, which is a very, very sad state of affairs.", "And you know what?

This government is so cash-strapped, they’re reaching and pulling at every possible little thread in that pocket of the Ontario taxpayer, because as you know, later this fall, we’re going to learn more about a disastrous attempt to tax everything in this province. That policy, that program, is coined as cap and trade, but we know the reality is it’s a carbon tax. It’s a tax on everything.", "You could also suggest that on the flipside of the coin, it’s an opportunity for carbon polluters to pay to pollute. So it’s not going to derive the result that everybody needs, which is ultimately a reduction of emissions.", "Going back to the carbon tax for one more second, many groups have raised concerns with the carbon tax implementation, including the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters, who—" ],

Failure to act in parallel on a North American basis” with regard to a carbon tax “would put Ontario manufacturers at a significant competitive disadvantage.” That is the common thread that I wanted to touch on: Ontarians indeed are at a disadvantage, even with this ORPP.", "I have been a strong advocate against implementing a carbon tax, which will inevitably increase the cost of everything, as I said, and contribute to losing high-paying jobs. It’s a rather rich irony here, Speaker, because what’s going to happen here is—this government is cash-strapped, so it’s introducing an ORPP to generate a new stream of revenue. But guess what? They’re going to be driving so many jobs out of this province because of their other ill-conceived notions and taxes. Again, they’re going to fall flat and fail. It’s going to be a go, let me tell you that.", "This government guesses that gas will increase, with a carbon tax, by three cents—another stress on business and on our taxpayers. Add that to the ORPP, and there’s yet another finger digging into that pocket.", "In rural and northern Ontario, I have to say, we don’t have a lot of options to commute to jobs. We need jobs in our small towns. I just can’t stress enough that the only option after a mandatory ORPP comes into place in small-town Ontario is for employers to try to save as much money as possible. This job tax is going to come directly out of their bottom line, and there’s not a lot of line left, if you will, Speaker. Because of that, we are going to see further erosion of our small towns.", "Because of this, families are going to be feeling it the most. Families are the ones that don’t have the opportunity to pick up and move, go across to the States or go out west, because they’ve got their roots planted in Ontario, and they’re going to struggle. They really don’t have any alternatives.", "In terms of alternatives, it’s frustrating when you think about the five budget asks that we presented to the Ontario Liberal government. We presented alternatives for them to consider to rein in their spending and to make life a little bit easier for Ontarians. Simply, the five items that we presented were all reasonable, sensible solutions to the challenges Ontarians are facing today. Sadly, the Liberal government turns a blind eye. They don’t care about sensible solutions. They know they’re cash-strapped, and they’re just going to dig as far as they can, with new taxes and new regulations that ultimately have negative effects.", "Sadly, none of our suggestions were taken into consideration. I just want to review them so that the Ontario taxpayer knows that it was the PC Party that truly was standing up for them. Simply, one of our suggestions was to cancel the carbon tax. Another was to cancel the ORPP to ensure business can and will grow in Ontario.", "However, instead of allowing business to grow, the government decided instead to move forward and force employers to compensate for the higher costs with fewer employees. The ORPP will force employers, as I said, to raise prices and cut staff—the list goes on and on. Employers will have to reduce their workforce, as I mentioned, because they can’t afford future wage increases. This is not what businesses want in Ontario.", "In my riding of Huron–Bruce, small business is big business. It accounts for thousands of jobs and our revenue in our communities. I really commend a bright group of people that have been pulled together by the county of Huron into a Huron county economic development board. They want young people to come back to jobs in our county of Huron. They want people to flourish and bring in jobs to keep people, specifically young people, in our riding. You know what? They’re frustrated because, at every turn, Liberals continue to introduce new taxes and new policies that strip them of their enthusiasm and their entrepreneurial spirit; it’s like one step forward and five back. Hurting the job creators is the last thing this province needs right now.", "The pension worry is shared, as I said, by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, which actually represents, as I’ve mentioned before—and this is important to remember—97% of small businesses." ],

Even with Bill 45, I was asking stakeholders who had taken time to create and provide submissions and to come forward to testify—I asked them, “Did this government reach out to you regarding Bill 45?” They said, “No. They did not consult with us.” It’s a trend that’s infuriating.

Currently, Ontario sits at the national average. The people who are struggling in pension years are often single, elderly individuals who have never worked and only receive 60% of their spouse’s CPP. These people are on limited resources, yet this government keeps driving the cost of living up, not giving a hoot about how people are trying to scrape just to get by. This is unacceptable. Sadly enough, this new tax that’s going to drive up the cost of groceries and drive up the cost of doing business is going to cause them to experience more expense when they’re already finding it tough to make ends meet. It’s unacceptable.", "If this government had a more accountable and transparent energy policy as well as tax policy, and opened themselves up to consultation to see, really and truly, how hard-hit Ontarians are today in 2015, maybe—just maybe—they would actually slow down on their tax-and-spend ways." ],

The government has prioritized a particular form of retirement plan which is going to benefit bankers and Bay Street, but they’re not prioritizing a plan that would actually benefit day-to-day workers in giving them a guaranteed and reliable source of income.", "There is a very interesting approach that this government is taking. They’re prioritizing and moving very quickly to implement a plan that is not reliable, that is going to be subject to the whim of the markets, and they’re moving very slowly on a plan that would be more reliable, on a plan that actually would benefit the workers of Ontario, that would actually benefit Ontarians. This priority is something we want to question. Is this government truly acting in a progressive manner when they are not putting enough attention into the type of pension that would actually benefit people in a meaningful way but instead are looking to assist some of their, perhaps, friends in the banking and financial sector that might benefit from the other sort of pension plan? That’s something we need to look at.", "I think what we’re seeing very clearly is that this government is not the progressive government they’ve made themselves out to be." ],

That’s because their beer sales plan shuts out every Ontarian in a rural community or a small town or city. No grocery store in a community with a population under 30,000 can bid on a licence. Rural Ontario loses out again with this government.", "I’m glad the parliamentary assistant to the Premier is here. I want him to explain to the people of Leeds–Grenville why they’re good enough to pay your $100-million beer tax but get none of your licences. That’s the fundamental inequity that we’ve got here today. You’re digging deeper into our pockets, but we’re getting nothing in return. It’s like it’s happy hour for your tax-and-spend cabinet but not for the people that I represent.", "This isn’t about the convenience of picking up a six-pack at the grocery store; it’s about economic development, job creation and the viability of our rural communities.", "I know it’s hard for this government to understand, but not everyone in Ontario happens to live in a city of over 30,000. I welcome the member for Etobicoke North to come to Leeds–Grenville this summer. We can take a tour, and I can show you the great things that are happening in my small communities. Maybe then he’ll understand why entrepreneurs in those communities are so frustrated with this plan: They can compete with any business anywhere in the province, but the Premier says they can’t because their store is located in the wrong part of Ontario.", "In the question, I mentioned Neil Kudrinko, owner of Kudrinko’s Fresh Mart in Westport. Neil and I have talked many times about the great opportunity a licence would create for his store. It would make it more of a destination for customers seeking a unique shopping experience. This man is an innovative forward-thinker. He’s an award winner, and I know that he knows how to make his community prosper. Neil can’t expand and hire new staff. It’s little wonder he described the government’s plan as “a mess from day one” in a local newspaper article.", "I also mentioned what a licence would mean to Lynn Laming, owner of Kitley Grocery in Toledo. After asking my question, I heard from Greg Williams, a neighbour of Lynn’s shop. He wrote to me and said how shocked he was at the Premier’s response and how little she knows about rural Ontario. Here’s what Greg wrote:", "“She stated she did not want them in the rural areas because it may cause the Beer Store to close down. Has she ever been to a rural Beer Store? My closest Beer Store is Smiths Falls, 21 kilometres away, next Brockville, 29 kilometres away.", "“How would Kitley Grocery, if given the right to sell beer, have much of an effect on these stores closing?”", "Greg is right. The competition wouldn’t close Beer Stores or LCBOs. The Premier’s response is a smokescreen.", "And it’s not just rural communities in my riding being left with an empty mug. The same day I asked my question, it was reported that the Beer Store in downtown Brockville is closing at year’s end. I’m hoping that the city’s economic development department will work with me and TBS to find a new downtown location. But here’s the point: In the comment section of the online story, people said it’s no big deal because the Metro grocery store up the street will soon be selling beer. Well, these folks are in for a shock, because it’s not going to happen. Brockville’s population is under 30,000, so the Premier says we don’t make the grade.", "Premier Wynne claims I want to hand a licence to every store in the province. She’s wrong, and I hope her PA won’t use that nonsense in his talking points today. What I want is a fair system for those 450 licences. What I want is respect for entrepreneurs and consumers. It’s a far better recipe for success than allowing governments to pick winners and losers.", "This is a very fundamental question for the parliamentary assistant. It’s a question of fairness for rural Ontario. So I ask the Premier’s parliamentary assistant to put away his talking points, save some time and make a simple commitment to me and members on this side of the House: Tell them you’ll stop playing postal code politics with your beer sales plan. Please go back to the drawing board, come up with a level playing field, and let’s grow the economy in every corner of Ontario.", "I look forward to the parliamentary assistant’s answer to my questions." ],

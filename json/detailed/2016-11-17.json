So we’re getting more people, and let’s be very clear.

The more regulations, the more legislation, the more provincial offences: There’s a correlation there.", "Each one of these regulations places an obstacle, a hurdle or a barrier for somebody to do things.

It is such a barrier, such an obstacle, that many people who are not wealthy, well connected or chosen by their political party will not have an opportunity ever to seek office at the provincial level in this Legislature.", "We know that Bill 2—the trigger for that was recognizing the abuses that were happening with election financing by Liberal ministers. But now the regulatory burden is not going to be focused on crown ministers or on elected members; the regulatory burden is going to be cast far and wide in a way that actually prevents people from running for office.", "This is what we’ve seen so often with this government: Public policy that is advanced not for the betterment of society, public policy that isn’t advanced for the public good, but public policy that is advanced for the Liberal good, for the Liberal benefit—not for the public benefit, and oftentimes, not just for the Liberal benefit but to the detriment of the public.

That’s because of a regulatory burden.", "The burdens of regulations, of poorly thought-out regulations, impacts everybody in society in many different ways. It impacts the truck driver.

Unbeknownst to him, he signed away the power of attorney for his family members and got captured by the Office of the Public Guardian and Trustee. For six months now, he has been trying to revoke the Office of the Public Guardian and Trustee, but the regulatory barriers are preventing him.

Angelina Anderson is a Canadian ex-wife who lives in my riding. She had a former husband who is from the United States. They owned a tourist operation up in far-flung northwestern Ontario. They divorced in 2004. He was abusive. She fled with her children. What has happened is, at that point, she signed over all the documents. Her name is not on the business. She has nothing to do with the business. Her husband has taken over ownership of the business. He stopped paying Ontario sales tax; he completely stopped. He owes $130,000 to this government.", "The government continues to allow him to operate. What they have done, because I guess it’s too difficult to go after an American citizen, is that they have placed that entire $130,000 on this abused ex-wife who is making a living for herself and supporting her children. It is absolutely disgraceful. When we have talked to the Ministry of Finance, they have said, “Well, perhaps she should talk to her ex-husband.” That is not an option. We have court documents that prove that she has nothing to do with this business. So the response then from the government was, “We don’t recognize those court documents.” This is an absolutely ludicrous situation: that a business can continue to operate, that they don’t even pay sales tax, and this government can’t even collect sales tax. How are they supposed to get the rest of this stuff right? It is absolutely ridiculous." ],

  "text" : [ "It is a privilege for me to rise today to offer some thoughts on Bill 27, the Burden Reduction Act, 2016, on behalf of the people I represent in London West.", "Many members may be aware that southwestern Ontario’s economy is somewhat distinct from other areas of the province. We have a much higher proportion of our economy and our labour force involved in the manufacturing sector. Certainly, burden reduction is critically important for the health of our manufacturing sector.", "I actually had the opportunity to attend the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters’ southwestern Ontario dinner that was held in London earlier this year, and I had a really constructive conversation with the director of policy and programs for CME Ontario. He talked to me about some of the things that CME, the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters, had heard from London businesses who had participated that very day in a focus group.", "He passed along some notes from some of the comments that were made during that focus group. He pointed out that there are close to 400,000 regulations that impact the members of the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters, and 1,500 regulations that apply just to the manufacture of automotive parts. He said that businesses who participated in this focus group remarked that they were spending 25% to up to 50% of their time in their business complying with these regulatory requirements. Businesses said that because of this compliance, this regulatory burden that is placed on businesses, they simply didn’t have time to innovate.", "Businesses made the point that the government’s responsibility is to provide an environment for businesses to succeed, and that without that kind of environment, there is a risk of an overemphasis on compliance that undermines productivity and undermines innovation.", "Certainly, in the context of that discussion, we know that reducing the regulatory burden is essential. It’s essential for businesses in my community. It’s essential for businesses across the province. Bill 27 begins that process. It begins the process of reducing the regulatory burden, as was mentioned. There are 50 acts that are amended, and 17 schedules in the bill. It is one of the thickest bills that I have seen since I have been elected. There are a lot of words in this bill; unfortunately, there’s not really a lot of significant content." ],

  "text" : [ "Exactly. So these 17 schedules—most of them, Speaker, are really housekeeping. They are really not the kind of significant burden reduction that would have an impact in jumpstarting the economy and enabling businesses to expand and grow. We know there are five schedules simply to bring Ontario into line with international commitments, through international conventions or agreements that had been made. There are a number of amendments that are just sort of tweaking of wording; for example, schedule 13 makes some housekeeping changes to the Protecting Child Performers Act, which was a piece of legislation that was introduced by my colleague the member for Hamilton East–Stoney Creek. And we support those word tweaks. We had wanted those wording changes in the first place, so that’s good to see in this bill.", "Unfortunately, Speaker, as has been pointed out by my other colleagues who have already spoken to this legislation, there are not one but two poison pills buried in this thick document.

  "text" : [ "Yeah, those old poison pills. As a result of those poison pills, the NDP will be unable to support the legislation that is before us today.", "I’m going to spend some time elaborating our concerns about those two poison pills. Schedule 2 of this bill makes some changes to a number of acts that are under the jurisdiction of the Attorney General. One of those acts is the Professional Engineers Act. This bill includes a proposal to cancel the repeal of clause 12(3)(a) of the Professional Engineers Act, a clause that is known commonly as the industrial exception. This exception allows unlicensed employees to design and modify production machinery or equipment that is used to make a product in their employer’s facilities.", "In other words, what it does is allow unlicensed individuals, individuals who are not engineers, to do the work that engineers are specifically trained and paid to do. They have the expertise through the years of their education. They have the experience and the knowledge of what needs to be done to protect the public interest and to ensure that the public good is front and centre.", "As well as being the MPP for London West, I’m also the NDP critic for research and innovation. In that capacity, I have had many wonderful opportunities to sit down with Professional Engineers Ontario, PEO, to sit down with individual engineers who live in my riding, and I have heard over and over again from those engineers that I have spoken to that they are opposed to this industrial exception; that the industrial exception undermines public safety, it undermines the public interest, and that it should be repealed. No province in Canada currently has an exception that allows non-engineers to do the work that only engineers are trained to do, and no province, except for Ontario, ever had such an exemption set out in legislation before.", "I know that PEO, the professional engineers’ association, welcomed the government’s commitment in 2010 to eliminate this industrial exception that shouldn’t ever have been there in the first place when they passed Bill 68, which was the Open for Business Act. This was an important public policy change that spoke to the professional obligation of professional engineers to ensure that the public interest is protected. Professional engineers recognize that repealing that exception would improve workplace safety, and that is what we are all absolutely committed to doing. We want to have an Ontario that is safe for workers to work, and repealing the exception could contribute to fewer workplace accidents and more effective and productive workplaces.", "I don’t know; I wasn’t here in 2010 when that bill was passed. I don’t know why the government chose not to proceed with the repeal of the exemption after making that commitment in the legislation at the time. I expect and I would hope that there had been some consultation prior to writing that into the legislation. I would hope that writing the repeal into the legislation was based on feedback that had been received that was based on research and evidence. But anyway, I don’t know what happened.", "What I do know is that six years later, we now see the Liberal government backtracking on that commitment to repeal the exception. For that reason alone, the NDP would not be able to support the passage of this bill. We cannot support legislation that could jeopardize the safety of workers in the province, and we cannot support allowing this exemption to remain in place that could potentially contribute to workplace accidents and injury—not only that, but the safety of Ontarians when this machinery is modified, or design changes are made, by unlicensed people who don’t have the qualifications and the training that professional engineers do.", "I also wanted to talk about the second poison pill in this legislation, and that is schedule 16. This is the schedule that opens up Ontario Place Corp. to having the land that is owned by the corporation—to having private interests move in and acquire some of this land.", "We know we heard the government protest loudly, saying that was never the intention of this legislation, this schedule, that this is merely boilerplate, and that the government has no intention—we can be assured that the government would never privatize Ontario Place.", "Quite frankly, Speaker, it’s hard not to take that with a bit of a grain of salt. I was elected in 2013, and some of the first debates that I participated in were around the privatization of Hydro One. I remember having conversations at home in my riding. We were sounding the alarm. The New Democrats were sounding the alarm that this was what the government was planning to do. I had conversations back in London West, feeling it was hard to get our alarms through, because people were saying, “The Liberals would never do that.” The Liberals were saying “We would never do that.” And then, lo and behold, after the 2014 election—this was not in the Liberal government’s platform; it was never discussed during that election campaign—the next thing you know, we see that it’s announced that 60% of Hydro One will be put up for sale.", "The track record, quite frankly, is troubling. Despite the government’s protestations, we have the obligation, as legislators, to ensure that the public interest is protected. The public interest is not protected by writing legal wording into legislation that opens the doors to the future disposition of property at Ontario Place.", "Like many MPPs who are in my age cohort, we remember with fondness when Ontario Place was the tourist attraction in the province. I would have relatives visiting from out of province, from out of country, and the first place we would want to take them to show off our province was Ontario Place. The Cinesphere, that iconic form on Toronto’s waterfront, is much loved by Ontarians, and the notion that this could now be taken over by the private sector is deeply, deeply troubling and is another reason for us to oppose the bill.", "There are a couple of issues that are referenced in the bill that, even though we’re not supporting it, it would have been nice to see the government go a little bit further. In particular, I wanted to talk about schedule 9.", "Schedule 9 refers to the classification of employees who work with the Office of the Fairness Commissioner. This is the office that oversees access to regulated professions by internationally educated professionals.", "I am sure that I’m not the only MPP in this place who hears regularly from foreign-trained professionals who come to Ontario, who bring high levels of education, who bring incredible skill sets, and yet cannot meet the qualifications in order to enter their profession and practise the skills that they were trained in.", "This is a huge loss to our economy and to our communities. It’s unfortunate, when the government is looking at the Office of the Fairness Commissioner, that they decided that reclassifying the employees was the only change they were going to make. There is so much work to do around the Office of the Fairness Commissioner, around the recognition of foreign credentials. That is certainly something that we need to keep our eye on and ensure is addressed in this Legislature.", "The other schedule I wanted to talk about, of course, is schedule 10 and the amendments to the OEB. Again, this opens the door to a very important conversation about electricity rates in this province. We know that the biggest burden on businesses in Ontario is high hydro costs. It’s the cost of electricity that is really preventing small businesses from their ability to be competitive and to grow and expand.", "The Ontario Chamber of Commerce just released a report last month. They noted that 33% of small businesses in the province believe that increasing energy prices will have a large impact on their organization, causing them to delay or cancel investment; 38% of small businesses claim that electricity prices are having the greatest impact on their ability to remain competitive.", "If we are truly interested in creating an environment that supports businesses, that enables businesses to grow and succeed, we have to do something about skyrocketing hydro rates. We see from this Liberal government an 8% rebate on the HST on hydro bills, after putting back in a 10% increase because of the cancellation of the clean energy benefit. That is not what small businesses are asking for. That is not going to make or break a business’s ability to succeed.", "People in this province understand the connection between the privatization of Hydro One and skyrocketing hydro rates. They also understand the connection between the Conservative government, who introduced the process of privatization, the Liberal government, who has taken privatization to heights that the Conservatives probably never dreamed of, and the New Democrat government—not government yet, but the NDP caucus—who has been outspoken and consistent in our opposition to the privatization of our electricity system in the province.", "In the minute and a half I have left, I wanted to share an experience of a business in London who wrote to me about another one of the schedules of this bill, schedule 11, about the EASR. They write, “We are compelled to outline our unfortunate experience with the EASR—the inadequacies of the process, the unprofessionalism of its administration and the lack of fairness in its application.” They were requested to register with the EASR and they were actually recommended by the ministry staff person that they were dealing with that they hire a consultant in order to register.", "The notion that this very small business was supposed to hire a consultant in order to complete this registration process is offensive. That, quite honestly, is a huge barrier to business growth in this province.", "They say, “Our frustration does not come from compliance with any environmental program that benefits us all, at a price, but to the issue of targeting small business to capriciously increase revenues for cash-strapped government. Does government focus on small business because they have neither the resources nor the time to fight such unfair programs”—" ],

They will reduce regulatory burdens and practices that cost businesses time and money while also, at the same time, protecting health and environmental standards, and always keeping an eye on workers’ safety. We’re going to do that in a responsible manner that meets all those imperatives; that is, grows the economy, protects the worker, protects the environment and so on.", "I want to comment on one really interesting piece in the bill.

So much time is spent by business filling out paper—piles and piles of paper. It’s time that we get caught up with the electronic age, the digital age.

I have to point out to the Minister of Indigenous Affairs and Reconciliation that, yes, the government has brought in Bill 27, and isn’t it interesting? We’re about 17 months away from a general election here in Ontario, and this government, since 2003, has been absolutely addicted to bringing in new regulations, more regulations than any other regime in the past—bringing in more and more regulations to make life difficult for people and for businesses in this province. Maybe they commissioned a poll that we didn’t know about. You know the one where 94% of the people think hydro rates are too high? Maybe there was another one on regulation, and they finally got the message that the people are sick and tired of having their lives controlled by this Liberal government and business being put on the brink of bankruptcy by being overregulated by this Liberal government.", "All of a sudden now, when we’re on the brink of another provincial election within the next year and a half, they’re coming out with a piece of legislation that they think the people are going to fall for, that all of a sudden the leopard has changed its spots. I say nay; not so, sir. They have not changed their spots at all. This is about putting out a new story, a new Liberal package for 2018 that says, “We’re actually in favour of reducing regulation.” They’re not in favour of reducing regulation; they are in favour of getting re-elected in 2018.

I remember—I’ve been here for nine years—when the Liberals used to say, “It is the Conservatives who do privatizations. We are Liberals. We are progressive. It’s the Conservatives who privatize hydro.” And then, the minute they get elected—they campaign as New Democrats but really, they govern exactly the same way that the Conservatives did. They kept right on at it, privatizing our hydro system, which leads to a poll that 94% of the people of Ontario find their energy bills too high.

Then why do you put a bill that allows you to do this?", "I’m working on Bill 41 right now, the Patients First Act.

I can bring to the table experiences that I’ve had from my business background, things as simple as working with a major manufacturer in my riding. They manufacture massive pressure boiler systems. Most of them are shipped by road to Alberta. Lately, most of them are being shipped by road or by rail to the United States and down to Texas. One of the things they’ve talked to me about over the years is how difficult it is to get their product out of our community. They have municipal road laws they have to follow, they have regional road laws they have to follow, and they have provincial road laws they have to follow. It’s not something that anyone would generally think about, but when you have a massive structure that may take up a lane and a half in size, getting it from my community to where it needs to go is a major part of the logistics, and it makes it really difficult for them to move product when they have these massive loads.", "So one little example from what we’re doing in this bill, in terms of making it easier for oversized loads to be moved from the manufacturer to the rail facility or to the end user—that small change alone will make a significant difference in the ability of the company in my riding to do business more effectively and more efficiently. They will be very happy with that, Madam Speaker. Again, it’s not the sort of thing that the average person would even consider, but that’s the sort of depth that we’re going into in this burden reduction bill, which we hear from manufacturers and we hear from business.", "The burden reduction bill, 2016, if passed, would support Ontario ministries in updating legislation to remove unintended burden on business and to create savings and benefits for both government and external stakeholders. I know sometimes, if you’ve not been involved with government at all, you wonder why oftentimes things take a long time to get done. One of the things that you soon learn, whether it’s as a town councillor or as an MPP, is that examination for unintended consequences is absolutely key. I know that even after a lot of examination and a lot of thinking, unintended consequences happen either at the beginning or just over years as the business environment and the regulatory environment changes. It’s time to look at all of the regulations and legislation and say, “Do we need this anymore? Does it fit with today’s modern world?” I’m pleased to see that there are a number of ways that we’re addressing that in this bill.", "Just to go back to the higher level, Speaker, the bill proposes to make over 150 amendments to more than 50 statutes from 11 ministries. This is a significant bill if you’ve got 11 ministries working together on it, I can tell you right now. The amendments included in this bill are good for business, but they’re also intended to ensure the necessary environmental, health and safety standards are maintained and even enhanced across Ontario. Really, the burden reduction bill, 2016, is the first of annual burden reduction bills serving as a model to meet a commitment to reduce burdens on Ontario businesses. The last such bill, I believe, was passed in 2010. The proposed legislative amendments either demonstrate a reduction of burden on businesses or achieve cost savings for government and external stakeholders.", "The cost of savings from the amendments in the bill would build on the government’s success of reducing burden on businesses by $122 million since 2011. I know that, in talking with business organizations out there, while they’re not always happy with what government does at any level, they have lauded the Ontario government for the reduction of red tape that we have brought about in this province over the past number of years.", "Some of the key themes of this bill, some of the ones that leap out at me: modernization—supporting the use of electronic communication between corporation shareholders, debt obligation holders and holders of warrants. The old days of needing the Pony Express to move documents around are long gone. We can use electronic signatures now. I’m looking forward to that modernization because, in the businesses that I’ve talked to, the businesses I’ve worked with before, that will streamline how they do business.", "Duplicative requirements: eliminating the Bulk Sales Act—it’s out of date. There are new and more effective processes we can call on that will protect business interests. One of the ones that I know drives not just businesses batty but consumers as well is synchronization and the “tell us once” approach. Why do we have to fill in a form, and then, two minutes later, when we’re working with another ministry or another government, have to fill the same information in again? That synchronization will really streamline how business is moving ahead.", "Streamlining a number of processes—and I spoke of this at the outset: streamlined delivery of superload permits by eliminating the requirement for police escorts, but ensuring safety by allowing for qualified non-police escorts. I said at the outset that there is one major manufacturer in my riding, and this is probably the single biggest thorn in the side they have of getting their product to market: coordinating their efforts with police, municipal governments, regional governments and provincial ministries in order to get their very expensive, well-manufactured products to market. That’s a very good one there.", "Creating opportunities through enacting: There are five statutes in this proposed legislation that we will adopt—internationally recognized rules affecting cross-border business activities that would harmonize Ontario’s business laws with international business laws and make Ontario a more attractive jurisdiction for resolving cross-border disputes. We know that Ontario businesses want to grow. We know that they want to grow outside of Ontario and that they have expertise and products that make them attractive to doing business in other parts of the world and vice versa. Ontario is a good place to do business, and we are attracting organizations as well. We’ll increase that by adopting these five statutes so that we harmonize Ontario’s business laws with international business laws.", "A little bit more about that going forward—I’ll just touch on that briefly. Increasing efficiencies: Businesses and government are always looking for ways to increase how effective and how efficient they are. Allowing provincial inspectors to get the information they need to do the job they need to do for low-risk activities by making a phone call to collect information—the way it is right now, the provincial inspector has to get in the vehicle, they have to go on-site and they have to get the information face to face—very time-consuming, very inefficient, even from the business’s perspective, the business side that is required to pull that information together.", "Being able to make a phone call—I suspect that our inspectors are going to be able to make multiple phone calls to multiple businesses where before they might have only gotten to one or two because of the time taken in transportation and moving ahead.", "Moving along, Speaker, one of the other areas, as I mentioned before, is Ontario’s business law review. I think it’s one of the most exciting things that this government has been doing and it’s one of the greatest things that’s been going on that no one really knows about.", "When I was the parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Government and Consumer Services, I was tasked with sitting in on a couple of the meetings. We had a round table with some of the brightest business lawyers from across Ontario who had volunteered to help advise government on how to streamline and how to internationalize our business law, to make it easier not only for businesses in Ontario—and doing business in Ontario—but to attract business to Ontario: to make Ontario one of the most attractive places, one of the easiest places to establish a business and to carry on business.", "I looked at the wealth of talent sitting around these round tables and could only begin to imagine, if they were billing us on an hourly basis, the thousands of dollars that it would cost. But they were there as volunteers, Speaker, giving us some wonderful advice which we have encapsulated in a great report and a lot of which is being adopted. Some of the key points are being worked into this legislation.", "Another point that I wanted to touch on is regulatory modernization. It’s one of the key pillars of this bill, and it strengthens our open-for-business mandate in a whole new suite of initiatives. The plan will foster a more innovative and dynamic environment for businesses to grow by lowering business costs in the province through modernizing regulations.", "Regulations for the sake of regulations just don’t make any sense. I think that in today’s fast-paced world where things change, the business environment changes, the world is changing, we have to make sure that there is room to change and room to grow.", "With those comments, Madam Speaker, I’ll stop now and I’ll pass the floor to the member from Kitchener Centre." ],

But in my riding, it’s double that rate; it’s 20%, so one in five jobs in my region is tied to manufacturing.

That is exactly what this bill is going to do.", "I know I don’t have a lot of time this morning.

November is a significant month in the Lebanese community. Each year, Lebanese people around the world celebrate Lebanese Independence Day on November 22.", "Earlier today, in commemoration of that, we here at Queen’s Park raised the flag. I want to thank the World Lebanese Cultural Union for sponsoring that event today and for all their work. I know that they’re here in the gallery today. They do a lot of work to support the diaspora around the world, especially in Canada. I want to thank them for being here today and for being here every year. Thank you very much.", "The riding I represent, the one I’ve lived in all my life, has I think the highest concentration of Canadians of Lebanese descent of all of Ontario. I think we’re in the top three in Canada. I certainly knew that growing up. Since I was very young, I’ve always had Lebanese neighbours and Lebanese stores and restaurants. So as I said earlier today, it’s not just part of the Lebanese culture in Ottawa South; it’s the Ottawa South culture.", "Every November, I’m here at Queen’s Park. We usually raise the flag and celebrate while I’m here. The fact that they organize this every year—I appreciate that as well too.", "Lebanese Independence Day is a national day that marks the liberation from the French mandate over Lebanese territory. Despite the French delegation proclaiming Lebanese independence in 1941 and having international recognition of that independence, Lebanon remained under the French directive until November 22, 1943. That was the day that France finally yielded to the increasing pressure of the Lebanese people, as well as demands of numerous countries around the world, and released the Lebanese officials and MPs being held as prisoners. Since that day, it has been celebrated as the independence day of Lebanon.", "Earlier today, the Speaker was talking about the fact that liberation—that ability to govern one’s self, that autonomy—having to fight for that is something that we don’t know in this present day or we really don’t know in this country. I think it’s important that we celebrate with those communities that gained their independence as a reminder to all of us that it’s something that we have to continually look at and fight for and guard against.", "If you take a look at some of the things happening in the world today—and I don’t want to get into too much about what we discussed this morning, but the risks of it becoming about the “me” and not the “us.” This celebration and the community that I live with in Ottawa South and, I know, throughout Ontario, the Lebanese community, are about the “us,” and it’s important that we celebrate that independence day.", "In the late 19th century, the first immigrants from Lebanon arrived in Canada. Today, the Lebanese population is mostly concentrated in Ontario. As I said, my riding of Ottawa South has a very high concentration. Somebody told me today it was about 150,000 if you take a look at how it has spread out over time in the Ottawa-Gatineau area, because Gatineau is kind of in the National Capital Region. In a census that’s about 10 years old, about 2% of the population in Ottawa was Lebanese, so we would have over 70,000 Lebanese Canadians living in Ontario.", "As I said earlier, I have the privilege of representing many Lebanese Canadians in Ottawa South. Growing up, throughout my lifetime, I always had neighbours and friends. If I talk about, just in my riding and outside, the Boushey family owned a store for years and years. There were a number of different Boushey families. They just recently closed the one on Elgin Street. I think it had been there for 60 or 70 years. It was a landmark. I remember that my father would go every Christmas Eve to buy fruit. They would always bring in large Indian River grapefruit—oversized, size 72—and Red Delicious apples. The reason I can talk about this is that I spent a lot of time in the food business, so I have a lot of affinity. There are many, many Lebanese Canadians in my community who were in the grocery business and the restaurant business.", "“Heritage” means something that has been handed down from the past, a tradition or achievement or belief that is carried forward by generations. Here in Ontario, we’re so fortunate to have many cultures from around the world that are represented in our communities. Being exposed to the customs and traditions of others, we truly enrich our own lives and the multicultural diversity of this province.", "We have a rich Lebanese heritage. Again, in my riding of Ottawa South—and I know it happens throughout Ontario—families of Lebanese descent celebrate every year, not just in November, which is a really important time, but the summer is a great time for food in Ottawa. In my riding of Ottawa South, St. Elias has an annual festival that I think they instituted in 1990. It’s one of the biggest festivals in Ottawa; it’s a five-day festival. The whole community, the whole church—everybody gets together and they have a fair. It’s a great, great celebration. It jams up the neighbourhood with cars. Every year, we have to park at Mooney’s Bay. The thing about it is, it’s not just a celebration of the culture and the heritage and the food. It’s also a charitable endeavour. They use it to support the church, but they also go outside to support many, many other charities, like the Ottawa Heart Institute. Every year, they pick a charity. They’re very outward-focused in their celebrations.", "I also know that at St. Charbel, which is just outside my riding, they have an equally great festival that I go to every year. Again, it’s a community coming together—St. Peter and St. Paul’s churches as well.", "There’s a masjid in my riding, Imam Ali Masjid, which celebrates in the summer as well. They just recently built their masjid. There’s a very vibrant outward-looking community that’s quite focused on youth in the community and the needs of their seniors.", "As you can tell, I have, Mr. Speaker, a lot of Lebanese Canadians living in my community.", "The Lebanese Canadian community has made, and continues to make, significant contributions across this province and country. These contributions include but are not limited to the fields of science, law, politics, business and culture.", "If you look at the history of Lebanon, you see that science, culture, arts and literature are very deep and rich inside the culture, and that’s something that has been brought to our nation. They’re also traders—they’ve always been traders. So the Lebanese business community is a very vibrant community in Canada.", "I’m going to mention some names, at the risk of not mentioning or forgetting somebody. There are so many names, I probably wouldn’t have enough time to mention them all. But in my riding, I want to speak to Father Hajal, who, every year, helps to work with the community to do the festival.", "Joseph Mehri, in my community as well, has been a constant source of connection to the community.", "We can talk about Canadians like Paul Anka. Of course, I had to bring in Andy Kim. I’m sure that I can see the member from Windsor shaking his head. We’re showing our age. And you have Nazem Kadri and Ed Hatoum in hockey.", "Of course, in levels of government—a very good friend of mine from Ottawa is Mac Harb, who was a very good friend of my predecessor in this seat, and also a very good friend of mine. He has such a big family. He has a cottage close to mine. It’s not a cottage; it’s actually part of an annex of an old hotel, at a place called Norway Bay. He has always been very generous. He was a truly great parliamentarian representing Ottawa Centre.", "Of course, we have the Ghiz dynasty in PEI—I’m going to miss somebody along here, and I apologize if I do.", "Mr. Speaker, I just want to finish by saying it’s not just about Ottawa South or Ottawa; it’s about Ontario and all of Canada. I know Windsor has a big community. I know that my colleague Minister Ballard has a big community. I know all across Ottawa—", "Interjection." ],

Maybe I’ll pop over there afterwards. It was a beautiful cake of the Lebanese flag. Congratulations to whoever brought the cake and made the cake.", "Just a tiny bit of background information on Lebanon: We all know that the Lebanese community chose November because there’s a national holiday on November 22 to remember the end of the French mandate over Lebanon in 1943, after 23 years of colonial rule.", "I want to remind everybody here that many in the Lebanese community—when we go to events—do speak French and, comme la porte-parole pour les affaires francophones de notre caucus PC, c’est une opportunité souvent de parler français avec les membres de la communauté libanaise; we say “Liban” in French for Lebanon.", "I really enjoy those opportunities, as well as being the interim chargée de mission amérique for the parliamentary branch of the world Francophonie organization. Lebanon is very well represented, sometimes, at the meetings. We always get to meet people from around the world and understand some of the problems that they’re facing. Not to be trite or anything, but sometimes it’s good to come back home from these meetings after hearing what hardships there are in some of the countries.", "I just want to mention that on the Lebanese flag, there’s a cedar tree, and it’s because the cedar forests are a very well-known part of the Lebanese landscape. The wood was prized by Egyptians for shipbuilding. Because of, I guess, the influence of the French, Beirut was once known as the Paris of the Middle East. It was a high-fashion city, and I think that many people who knew that Lebanon really want to go back to those days.", "We are joined here by some people I’ve gotten to know by going to Lebanese events and working in the community. First, I want to mention George Khouri. He’s a judge. He was born in Lebanon. He’s here in the members’ gallery. Welcome, George. He arrived in Canada 39 years ago. He studied law in Windsor, where he founded the university’s Lebanese students’ club and the Canadian Lebanese League, as well as a Lebanese program for the government of Canada to facilitate Lebanese immigration. His family has had three successful enterprises, and he has been the chairman of so many groups. I don’t want to list too many, but I’ll mention the board of trade and the Rotary Club. He’s just always a smiling face. I believe his wife’s name is Leila. He’s always a smiling face and always there to greet me whenever I go to events. So, thank you, George, for always making me feel welcome.", "Abraham Elias also sent me some notes to mention that he’s so happy that we are debating this today. He is looking forward to coming down to celebrate many Lebanese events at Queen’s Park and throughout Ontario. Abraham is the financial controller in a real estate group, but the way I know him so well is that he is now the treasurer of the PC Ontario executive. Thank you, Abraham, for all you do. It’s a volunteer position and we all really appreciate it and we need you desperately to help us in all of our endeavours.", "Cozette Giannini helps me. I actually called her this week. I had to give a French speech on Tuesday on French-language services. I called Cozette, read my speech to her and she made corrections. She has a beautiful accent in French. I think her mother was a French teacher in Lebanon.", "She also helps at a lot of the community events. I went with her to Our Lady of Lebanon annual festival at the Parya centre, which is actually a Persian secular centre in my riding. I went with Cozette and Michael Parsa, who is here and who has been a candidate for the Conservatives in Richmond Hill. We went to the Lebanese Friends of Canada annual barbecue by the lake, as well as the Jesus the King annual summer festival, which is at a church in my riding. Cozette likes to remind me that it was the first time I ate knafeh, which is our leader, Patrick Brown’s, favourite Lebanese dessert. He was in Lebanon earlier this year with our friend Robert Faissal, who is also from Lebanon.", "I just want to mention a few tidbits that people may or may not know. Lebanon has the oldest continuously inhabited city in the world, called Byblos. It’s over 7,000 years old. The ancestors, the Phoenicians, invented the alphabet and the numerals that we use today.

It’s really hard for us to ascertain how many Lebanese descendants there are because sometimes it’s one parent, such as Céline Dion’s late husband, René Angélil. His mother was Lebanese but his father was Syrian, so do we call him Lebanese? Do we call him Syrian? A mixture? It’s really hard to put exact numbers on people, but we know that there are many Lebanese communities in Ontario.", "Lebanon was one of the founding nations of the UN. The WCLU world president is Mr. Elias Kassab, who happens to be from the GTA and I believe was here today at the event, as well, from the organization. Welcome, everybody who came.", "I want to mention—because I also represent the Jewish community in Ontario and everybody knows that somehow I tie everything to either Israel or the Jewish community—that for a very long time the border between Israel and Lebanon was one of the calmest frontiers for Israel. I don’t think it was just for that reason. I think that it was a sort of shared respect that the new state of Israel had for the Lebanese country. So many things in Israel that many people might attribute to Israeli culture are maybe borrowed or shared with Lebanon. One of the things is falafel; another is shawarma—I know I’m mentioning a lot of food—hummus, baba ghanouj, tabbouleh, but also in terms of music and dance. When I was a kid going to Jewish summer camp, one of the folk dances we learned was the debka, and then I go to Lebanese festivals and they’re calling it the dabke. So I think that there are more similarities than differences between all of us, but particularly between the Israelis and the Lebanese.", "I’m sure everybody here would agree with me that we look forward to having that calm frontier again and sharing more cultural exchanges. Being able to visit across the border is a real dream for me and, I think, for everybody else who is here today. I hope that sometime we’ll be able to come here to celebrate Lebanese Heritage Month but to celebrate it for more peaceful times and more prosperity and to bring back the Paris of the Middle East to not just Beirut but across Lebanon as well.", "On a sadder note, unfortunately, I have a story here about Marc Diab, who served in Afghanistan. He died because of a roadside bomb in 2009. His family owns a restaurant in—I’m trying to see. His family moved to Mississauga, but I think they went to Petawawa and they opened the restaurant Madameek. It’s a shawarma restaurant. Every year, they give to the community by having free food for a day. There are long lineups. They have a picture of their son—I don’t know if the Speaker would give me leave to hold up a picture of their son, Marc, for everybody to see—in his uniform. It hangs in the restaurant.", "It’s a sacrifice when we have wars, not just in Afghanistan and the Middle East, but there are too many countries across the world where people are losing their lives so unnecessarily. We wish for peace in all of those countries.", "I have a quote that I want to read from a very well-known poet named Kahlil Gibran. I’m just going to say that he’s supposedly very well loved by the Lebanese community. “My Lebanon is a flock of birds fluttering in the early morning as shepherds lead their sheep into the meadow and rising in the evening as farmers return from their fields and vineyards.”", "It’s such a calming effect when you read words like that because it reminds you of peaceful times, of beautiful times. You can hear the birds singing in the sky and the fluffy clouds floating by, and I think we wish for that landscape for Lebanon. I know that everybody who’s here today is enjoying today, but there’s always a little part of them every day remembering their family members who are presently in Lebanon, and friends and family members who came from Lebanon, and would like to see the country go back to the beautiful landscape that it once was.", "In the last couple of seconds here that I have left, I just want to mention a few other famous people of Lebanese descent: Nazem Kadri, the NHL hockey player for the Maple Leafs; Paul Anka—I don’t even have to say, he’s such a famous singer; Kevin O’Leary—what a personality; I already mentioned René Angélil; Eddie Francis, the 33rd mayor of Windsor; Tom Leon from Leon’s Furniture; Milad Mansour from Sudbury, Ontario, who started a diamond lathe refinishing business; Mary Jo Haddad, former president and CEO of the Hospital for Sick Children; Marie Henein—boy, was she famous for representing Jian Ghomeshi not that long ago; Mr. George Hanna, who owns a pizza chain in Ottawa with 30 stores; and Mohammad Fakih, who owns the Paramount Fine Foods chain in Ontario.", "Welcome, everybody who’s here today, and congratulations.

I guess if we turn back the hands of time, we see that people from Lebanon began coming to Canada 134 years ago, in 1882. Eventually these newcomers from Lebanon found their way to Windsor and Essex.", "I know that by the 1920s the first Maronite Catholics built St. Peter’s church on the corner of Parent Avenue and Niagara Street just about a block or so from my riding boundary of today. The front doors of that church opened on February 7, 1924. Five years later, settlers from Hungary were holding services there until they could build their own church. In the late 1980s, many of the original families relocated their services to the St. Charbel Church at a monastery just off what is now Herb Gray Parkway in the town of Tecumseh. Saint Charbel was a Lebanese monk who lived like a hermit on top of a mountain and is known for miraculous healing powers.", "In 2000, the other members of Saint Peter’s parish purchased the former St. Clare of Assisi Catholic Church on Tecumseh Road at Dougall in west Windsor. It’s a beautiful art-deco-style facility. And there’s nothing quite like the St. Charbel Church and monastery property either. In fact, we just spent a lovely evening there with religious and community leaders a couple of weeks ago. I joined the leader of Ontario’s New Democratic Party, Andrea Horwath, as did the members from Essex and Windsor West, during the leader’s tour of southwestern Ontario. As a matter of fact, the federal member for Essex, Tracey Ramsey, was part of our delegation that evening at St. Charbel, as well as her constituency and outreach assistant, Nadine Abiraad, a proud Lebanese Canadian.", "We also spent time on that tour visiting with the leadership of the various Islamic communities. Yes, many of those leaders came here from Lebanon as well and are very proud of that.", "There was a civil war in Lebanon between 1975 and 1990, and Canada was one of only a few western countries to open its arms to those fleeing for their lives. We welcomed hundreds of these newcomers to the Windsor area. Many of the more recent Lebanese immigrants are Muslims and Druzes, and came to Ontario seeking refuge and a peaceful place to work and raise their families.", "Lebanon is a fabulous country, the Paris of the Middle East. It’s the most democratic country in the Arab world. They have a consensus democracy, whereby the highest political offices are shared among the various religions: The president is a Maronite Christian, the prime minister is a Sunni Muslim and the parliamentary Speaker is a Shia Muslim.", "Our local Lebanese population has grown immeasurably from the early days, and they’re spreading their wings. There’s a huge number of Lebanese Canadians now living and working in Leamington, for example. Some estimates have our regional population of people of Lebanese descent at 20,000. Of course, that pales in comparison to the Dearborn area of Michigan, just a short drive away from Windsor, which is home to 250,000 Lebanese Americans.", "Windsor’s previous mayor Eddie Francis, at 29, was the youngest mayor in Windsor’s history, and he is Lebanese. We have at least 40 medical doctors of Lebanese descent in Windsor and Essex county. Many of our most influential business leaders hail from Lebanon, as do many college teachers and university professors. We have at least 20 Lebanese restaurants and numerous Lebanese bakeries.", "Our regional communities have been enriched by our Lebanese friends and neighbours, and they have helped us become one of the most diverse regions in all of Canada.", "Speaker, this bill naming November as Lebanese Heritage Month in Ontario is welcomed and overdue.

It’s a wonderful motion that definitely recognizes the important contribution of Lebanese Canadians in our communities.", "As you have heard, Speaker, and will continue to hear, my region has a rich history of Lebanese immigrants coming here to make a better life for themselves and for their families. They sought peace, freedom and opportunity and found it in Windsor and Essex county and all around the province of Ontario. Our Lebanese friends have long contributed greatly to our community by introducing us to their culture and providing service and leadership in all aspects of life.", "Some of the more prominent Lebanese Canadians in our community—I’ll just name a few; there are hundreds.

They started arriving in Essex county at the turn of the century.", "The first Maronite Lebanese church, St. Peter’s, was built in 1924, and St. Charbel monastery is located on the boundary of my riding. I’ve been fortunate, as the elected official for Essex, to be invited to participate in events at Lebanese community festivals, and specifically, at the St. Charbel festival. I want to thank and give a shout-out to Father Daniel, Father Tony and Chorbishop Père Charles Saad for their hospitality to me and to my wife, Jennifer. We were just there last weekend celebrating the election of the new president, General Michel Aoun. It was a wonderful celebration, with folks from all different ethnocultural backgrounds. Man, oh, man, did we have fun. We ate, we danced, we sang, we hugged. I didn’t want to leave. It was wonderful. It’s just that graciousness and that hospitality that the Lebanese culture is so famous for that brings you in and speaks volumes about their contribution to our community. It’s wonderful.", "I had the pleasure of attending the Lebanese festival at both Maronite churches, where thousands of Lebanese Canadians gather every year to promote and celebrate Lebanese culture.

  "text" : [ "When I was asked to say a few words today about Bill 60, I was quite honoured and quite humbled. My riding of Newmarket–Aurora does not enjoy the bounty of other ridings in terms of people of Lebanese heritage, but what I have learned over the years is that the people who live in Newmarket–Aurora who do have Lebanese heritage play a very important role. I can’t think of another group that although small in number, has had such a large impact on our business community and on our social community as well. Whether they be members of the Lions Club, the Rotary Club or the chamber of commerce, I have gotten to know all sorts of people who, I only realized later on when we came together for celebration, were all people who were so proud of their Lebanese heritage. It really is great to be able to stand here—and to have been outside earlier to raise the flag—and to move Bill 60 along.", "I can say, I’m always interested in the history and heritage of the people who make up this wonderful multicultural province of Ontario. It’s fun to do a little bit of research to learn more about the Lebanese people and the fantastic contributions of Lebanon. Thanks to the wonders of Google, we were able to find some really fascinating facts that I want to share just for a minute here, just to talk about the impact of such a small geographic area, really, when you compare it, say, to the geographic size of Canada—but the real impact that it has had.", "The alphabet, for example, was developed around the second millennium B.C. It was the precursor to the Hebrew, the Greek, the Latin, the Arabic and the Armenian alphabets—no small feat there.", "We have a judge visiting with us today. For many years, Beirut has been known, right back to Roman times, as the “Mother of Laws,” with one of, in those days, the three best legal schools in the world.", "Mathematics: the Pythagorean theorem. Pythagoras was the inventor of not only the multiplication tables, but also the hypotenuse theorem. Any of us who have struggled through high school and elementary school having to memorize all of those will surely remember that name.", "Other great things like transparent glass and purple dye and the precursor to paper money—all really important. One of the things that attached me, at a very early age, to Lebanon—I really, just as a young kid, didn’t know much about it. My father wasn’t necessarily a great romantic, but one of the first books he purchased for my mother when they were first married in the early 1950s was The Prophet, by Kahlil Gibran; we heard his name earlier. Published in 1923, it’s now published in over 40 languages. Nine million copies are out there today. I can tell you that reading that book as a young fellow really influenced my perception of Lebanon and the people who make up that great part of the world. When I’ve asked my Lebanese friends about this poet, they speak in almost reverent terms about this man and how he represents their country.", "So that’s it. I will leave it there. Again, I’m really honoured and humbled to be asked to speak to Bill 60 today. I thank all of my Lebanese friends for the work they do in the riding of Newmarket–Aurora and all of the work that the greater Lebanese community does here in Ontario." ],

They welcome people from all across not only Essex and Windsor county, but they draw people from outside our area. People come from Leamington. Some people come from as far as London.

Since the early 19th century, the Lebanese Canadian community has made and continues to make significant contributions to the social, economic, cultural and political growth and prosperity of the province of Ontario. I believe that by proclaiming the month of November as Lebanese Heritage Month, the province of Ontario will recognize the meaningful contribution Lebanese Canadians have made in building and shaping communities throughout our province. As we have heard, their presence is felt in many communities, not only in one region of our province but in many of them.", "Lebanon is a country that is more than 5,000 years old and that throughout history has faced enormous challenges but has been able to overcome them because of the strong determination of its people. I don’t know if any of my colleagues have done so before, but I want to recall how important and significant their history has been for all of us as humanity. For example, they go back and are descendants of the famous Phoenicians, who invented the alphabet. They travelled the Mediterranean. They were dedicated to commerce, showed the world how they were the first traders and taught us about commerce.", "Their history, as we mentioned before, has gone through a lot of challenges. But November 22 marks the celebration of the Lebanese independent state. On that day, Lebanese people from all over the world commemorate the country’s liberation in 1943 after 23 years of governance by the French mandate that succeeded Ottoman rule, and that was a long rule. It is now a free nation.", "Lebanese Heritage Month here in Ontario is an opportunity to educate future generations—and I can see some students here in the gallery who can learn from this; hello—about the great contribution that this community has made to the multicultural fabric of Ontario and of Canada. Their knowledge and work ethic has made a significant impact on our economy by creating job opportunities and wealth for all Ontarians.", "Our strength in our province, both economically and from a social point of view, comes from our diverse culture. Premier Wynne and many of us in this House are strong believers that all of Ontario’s differing communities have helped build Ontario into the great province that it is today. Recognizing November as Lebanese Heritage Month in the province of Ontario reiterates Ontario’s commitment to embracing, to welcoming and to celebrating diversity.

If passed, this legislation would amend the Home Care and Community Services Act to close the gaps in home and community care.", "Speaker, I’d like to point out from the beginning that this bill has the support of the Ontario Medical Association, the Ontario Nurses’ Association, Hospice Palliative Care Ontario, Home Care Ontario and CUPE Ontario, who represent thousands of health care workers.", "Joining us at Queen’s Park for the debate today on Dan’s Law is Dr. Darren Cargill, the palliative care leader for the Erie St. Clair Regional Cancer Program. Dr. Cargill was also Dan Duma’s palliative care doctor. Also joining us are Ana, Dan Duma’s wife, and Laura Duma, the daughter of Dan Duma. I will be sharing Dan’s story this afternoon, as well as that of what his family experienced during a very difficult time for them all. I’d like to thank them all for being with us here today to watch the debate on my bill, which is named after someone who is so special to them.", "I think that’s important to point out: The people who have come today, Dan’s family members and his doctor, have travelled a great distance. Some have come from Windsor, and some have come from as far away as Alberta, because that’s how important it is to them.", "Under the current law, in the interprovincial billing agreement, residents of any Canadian province or territory who move to Ontario must apply for provincial health care coverage in Ontario—or, as we know it, OHIP—and complete a three-month waiting period before health care that is not deemed medically necessary is covered. This means that they can access physician and in-hospital care but do not qualify for home or community care. This is the health care gap that Dan Duma and his family were caught in.", "Speaker, I’m going to take some time to speak about the man who this bill was named after and some of the obstacles that he and his family faced. Although the ending is sad, because Dan is no longer with his family, there’s an opportunity for a happy ending for other people.", "Dan was an auto worker at General Motors in Windsor for many years. When General Motors closed, not only were several people put out of work, but several had to leave our province to go find employment. Dan and his wife, Ana, left their two daughters behind and moved to Fort McMurray for Dan to find stable employment. While in Alberta, Dan was diagnosed with liver cancer. In May, he was admitted to a hospital in Fort McMurray with some complications.", "At the height of the forest fires that were ravaging Fort McMurray and Alberta this year, Dan had to be evacuated to Edmonton, and his wife, Ana, joined him. Unfortunately, because they don’t have a home in Edmonton, Ana had to take up residence in a hotel.", "While Dan was in Edmonton, he was told that he was not going to survive his illness, and he had basically two choices: because he and his wife could not return to their home in Fort McMurray because of the fires, he could either live out his final days in a hotel room with his wife or he could return to Windsor, his real hometown, and be with his children.", "When Dan moved back to Windsor, his family assumed, like most of us in this chamber and most of us in this province and this country, that because we have universal health care, that meant Dan was going to have full access to all the health care services that he needs. Unfortunately, they found out that that’s not the case. If Dan was in hospital, he would receive all the health care services he needed for his end-of-life care, and that would be covered under the reciprocal billing agreement between provinces.", "As we know, not only has the province of Ontario, the government, recognized but everyone in the health care sector has recognized the importance of people who are facing end-of-life care having the option to live their final days in the comfort of their home, surrounded by those that love them, and to have the opportunity to die with dignity. They shouldn’t be faced with having to die in a hospital. That’s not where anybody wants to be. The government side has also recognized the financial importance of people having an opportunity to choose where it is they want to face their final days.", "Dan didn’t have three months to wait for his OHIP coverage to come into effect. Dan passed away on July 18, just one month into his three-month waiting period for care here in Ontario.", "Speaker, this isn’t about the quality of care that somebody is receiving. We know that the health care professionals in our hospitals do the very best they can every day with the resources that they are given. This is not about, necessarily, the quality of care that somebody is going to receive. It’s about where they’re going to receive that quality of care.", "I’m going to talk about the fact that during many interviews that I’ve done on this issue, there has been a lot of interest in this issue. I’ve had many media outlets reach out to me. As I said, there are many professional organizations who have contacted me and are in support of this bill. Many private citizens, not only in Ontario but in other provinces, have reached out to me in support of this. I think everybody like them recognizes the importance of what it is that the Dumas have faced, and how we would all feel if it was one of our family members, or ourselves, who had to move to another province for work and found out that we were facing the end of our lives and we wanted to be back home with our families. I think that’s something that we can all relate to.", "There is a gap that needs to be addressed. The Minister of Health, I believe, had acknowledged that he’s interested in engaging in conversations with other provinces and looking at filling this gap. But we have an opportunity, as a province, to be the leaders when it comes to home care and hospice care.", "We have the opportunity to say to other provinces, when you enter into those talks, that we’ve already done it; we’ve already said you’re welcome to come and be with your loved ones; we understand the importance of you receiving care at home—or in hospice, if that is the best setting—and we’re addressing that; we’re providing that care to people; we’re providing that choice, without a financial burden; we’re providing that access; and that we’ve set the examples and we want the other provinces to follow our lead.", "I believe that by supporting my bill, we’ll set that example, and that will move those talks along faster. What we’ll see, hopefully, is an end, very quickly, to people who have the same story as Dan. One more story like Dan’s is one too many. Dan’s story should not have to be told. Dan should have been provided with the care that he deserved, in a place where he wanted to be, surrounded by the people he wanted to be surrounded by.", "My hope is that this bill will address that; that it will have support from all sides; that it won’t just go to committee; that it will actually be called before committee so that we can have those discussions; that it will come back to this House and it will become law, and that it will happen quickly.", "Like I said, nobody in this country should have to go through what Dan and his family did. It’s all too common that we have people who have to move out of province—and not just in Ontario. Other provinces have it too, where people have to move out of province for work. They don’t have a choice. They shouldn’t be limited in their ability to return home to be with their loved ones in their final moments.", "As I had said, Dan didn’t have three months. Many people don’t have three months to wait for health coverage. I just want it to be clear—because that’s something that came up during many of the conversations that I had, too—on what the bill addresses. The three-month waiting period would still apply for all other health care services that weren’t deemed medically necessary. This bill only addresses home care and palliative care in a hospice. Those are the people who we are looking to help with this bill.", "I know that’s not fixing the entire health care system, and I know there’s work to be done with other provinces, but I just wanted to be clear, because some people were a little confused. All this is addressing is those people who need home care or palliative care in a hospice. It would eliminate that three-month waiting period. They would still have to apply for OHIP coverage for anything above and beyond that that wasn’t already covered under the interprovincial billing model. As I said, we have an opportunity to be the leader on this, and I think that if we do take the lead on this and we set the example for other provinces, you’ll find that they will come on board and they will do what’s right as well.", "It’s something that maybe we don’t want to talk about when we’re talking about a story like Dan’s, because Dan’s story is important and that’s really what people want to hear, but another question I’ve been asked about is the cost. What would the cost be of passing this law and providing the care that I’m asking for? Speaker, as the Minister of Health probably well knows, the cost of care in hospital far exceeds the cost of home care. In fact, the numbers that I’ve been given are that the average hospital stay—now, this will vary, depending on the needs of the patient, clearly—is $1,000 a day. The number that I’ve been given for home care—again, an average—is $100 a day.", "What I’m hoping is that if you want to look at it not just from the compassionate side of things—because we do need to look at it from the compassionate side of things—but if you want to look at it from a financial side of things, look at the cost. Look at the fact that for someone to be in hospital for end-of-life care, the average cost is 10 times more than to grant them their wish to die at home, in the comfort of their home, with dignity and surrounded by family and friends—the place they want to be and the place the government has recognized they should be." ],

I’m pleased to speak to Bill 54, Dan’s Law, An Act to amend the Home Care and Community Services Act.", "I am a recipient of seeing the excellent service in Ontario of home care. My mom, who passed away in July from cancer, wanted to die at home, and she spent the last few months at home. That was her wish, and my dad, who is 80 years old, worked hard along with the home care providers to see my mom’s last wishes come true. The service was excellent and it was always there. I know the importance of that. It was comforting to family members to have that happen at home. I am supportive of this bill for that, and I wish every Ontarian who wants the same thing and has the same wish, that this can happen for them as well.", "As you know, Mr. Speaker, our government is aware that health care is always the number one priority for Ontarians. We recognize the need for affordable and accessible care for all. Our government is transforming health care to make Ontario the healthiest place in North America for Ontarians of all ages. We know that home care is a very important part of that transformation.", "While we support this bill in principle, I am compelled to highlight the work that is already under way between Ontario and our partners at provincial and territorial levels to resolve these concerns through reciprocal agreements. Many of the costs associated with care would be included under reciprocal agreements between the provinces. We are aware that certain expenses may not be covered.", "This is an issue of concern for our government. That is why the Minister of Health raised this issue earlier this year with our provincial and territorial colleagues and partners.", "We are making the necessary changes to better accommodate all patients. We recognize the many challenges that families face when they are away from their home in this province, and it’s something that this bill somewhat addresses. It’s a good first step. This is why our government is investing $100 million in home care; $80 million of that will go to supporting and enhancing care for those who need it most. The other $20 million will be for caregivers’ respite.", "It is a priority for our government to ensure that Ontarians are receiving appropriate and timely access to health care. We are getting strong results when it comes to meeting our commitments to a five-day home care guarantee. Province-wide, 93% of Ontarians receive a nursing visit in their first five days; 84% receive a visit from a personal support worker.", "This topic was also raised again at the most recent federal, provincial and territorial health ministers’ meeting. Based on conversations our government, and in particular the Minister of Health, has had with other fellow health ministers, many of the provinces are very supportive and have agreed to form a working group to examine how we can ensure Ontarians and all Canadians receive the highest quality of health care and coverage, regardless of where they are in Canada. That’s the right thing to do, and that’s one of the reasons why I am supporting this bill.", "Over the past decade, Ontario’s health care system has improved significantly. It’s our hope that with our government’s continued investment, this pattern will continue. It’s a great first step, as I said, Mr. Speaker, and I again commend the member for bringing this bill forward. Thank you to the member from Windsor West for introducing this bill." ],

My views on this bill are shaped from my experiences as the past president of the Association of Local Public Health Agencies, the chair of the region of Durham’s health and social services committee for the better part of seven years and as a civil servant with the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care.", "The proposed bill, in my view, effectively bridges a gap in home care and community services provided to Canadians when they move to Ontario from another province or territory. What’s clear when you examine the bill is that under the current legislation for home care and community care services, there’s a three-month waiting period before Ontario residents who have moved from another Canadian jurisdiction can access those services. The effect of this proposed bill will be to eliminate that wait period.", "The government has spoken often about putting patients first. The Ontario Progressive Conservative caucus has been justly critical of the proposed legislation, Bill 41, that in our estimation does the exact opposite. But what’s clear is that patients are the very reason we have a health care safety net, aren’t they? It’s they who should truly benefit from the legislative amendments. Bill 54 does in fact place patients first.", "Provinces have taken very different approaches when dealing with wait times. For example, Alberta, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland, Saskatchewan, Nova Scotia and the Northwest Territories provide immediate coverage for Canadians moving from other provinces; the others do not. There aren’t any sound medical reasons for maintaining a wait period but many to support its removal.", "The Ontario Medical Association in a 2011 report said that people without health insurance tend to go to emergency departments for care, and sometimes they wait longer than advisable to seek medical treatment. In addition, data from the same report suggested that any immediate savings gained by not providing coverage for newcomers is subsequently depleted by the overuse of emergency departments.", "I recently read a report from the Wellesley Institute, and the institute pointed out that the three-month wait may worsen the health conditions of some newcomers to the province. It predicts that, due to this delay in care, some individuals will require more complex and costly health care down the road, once they’re covered by OHIP. The institute’s report continues on to say that the three-month wait builds inequality into our health care system by preventing newcomers from having the same access to health care as the rest of Ontarians. The simple conclusion: It is now time to re-examine the current policy and practice.", "Home care and palliative care have a growing importance within our health care network. Like the member from Windsor West, I’ve heard similar stories in my experiences outside this Legislature and, in particular, as the president of Ontario Association of Local Public Health Agencies. It’s important, in my view, that we do all that we can to recognize that fact.", "What’s clear, Speaker, is that we have an aging population. People are not only living longer; they’re remaining in their homes for a longer period of time. Evidence has shown that, when properly resourced, home-based palliative care services result in higher patient and caregiver satisfaction with end-of-life care.", "There is a growing recognition that providers must work together, not only to shift care to the community but to operate from the assumption that home is where care must be provided. In addition, significant shifts in society and the needs of individuals from the health care system are driving change, and as members of provincial Parliament we’re hearing it on a daily basis. Social and medical advances mean that people live longer even with diseases that, only a few years ago, would have been life-limiting.", "This being the case, where we recognize the growing importance of home care and palliative care services, it seems fair and proper that we remove this wait-time barrier for those entering Ontario from other provinces and territories.", "Most of us will speak with pride about the national health care system, the fact that it provides care for all Canadians, but at the same time we also recognize we have an obligation to strive to make it even better, in particular in Canada’s largest province.", "I, therefore, will be supporting Bill 54, as the proposed legislation would clearly put patients first by removing a barrier to accessing care and by providing coverage for all Ontarians when they need it and without delay." ],

For each auto job lost, we lose 10 times the number of spinoff jobs. That means that every single time someone in our province loses an auto job, there are 10 other families that are left wondering how they’re going to pay for food and raise their children.", "I hope these jobs will return to Ontario one day. That is why I know that making sure that happens is something that my colleagues will make a priority.", "I remember when GM left Windsor over a decade ago. We were wondering what those workers and their families would do. Where would they go to find work? Many, like Dan, were forced to leave their homes and their communities and seek employment elsewhere. Dan happened to be in Alberta.", "Mr. Speaker, Dan left his home so he could continue to provide for his family, who are here today. He left because the government had abandoned the auto sector in our province. Then the worst thing happened: Tragedy struck Dan and his family. When that happens, when tragedy strikes a family, women and men like Dan should be able to count on their province—that they spent their lives paying taxes to—being there for them.", "Unfortunately for Dan and his family, this government abandoned them when they needed it most. He was diagnosed with liver cancer while living in Fort McMurray. At the height of the forest fires this past May, he was evacuated to Edmonton. Then, when the situation got even worse and he knew he was nearing the end of his life, Dan’s only thoughts were of his two daughters in his hometown of Windsor, Ontario. Dan chose to come back to Windsor. Dan chose to spend his final moments with his family, who he loved dearly, only to be told that he’d have to wait three months for the public, in-home end-of-life care he rightly deserved.", "Mr. Speaker, Dan didn’t have three months to wait. Dan passed away before the waiting period elapsed. It was only in the last few days that he benefited from what our health care system has to offer, largely thanks to the work of the health care providers in Windsor. Like Windsor, Niagara, Fort Erie and Niagara-on-the-Lake and so many other communities across our province benefit from the amazing work of our dedicated health care providers.", "Today, the government has an opportunity to do their part. They have an opportunity to address the gap in our health care system that is cruelly unfair to those who are affected. No one—and I mean no one—should ever have to go through the end of their life not knowing if they’ll be able to spend the time with their loving family. Passing Dan’s Law would make Ontario a leader in home and end-of-life care. Let’s take this opportunity to do that.", "I want to thank my colleague from Windsor West for raising this issue in the House. I look forward to supporting this bill. I urge my colleagues across both aisles to do the same." ],

I certainly believe that everybody who is dying needs to have access and that we have to remove all barriers, whether that be an interprovincial barrier that we have right here, and that we have to find a mechanism so that does not happen.", "We are very fortunate to have people—I know Dr. Darren Cargill is with us here today.

You act out of compassion and love and do what you need to do and figure out the rest.", "We had that in Ottawa last year—Sarah Stott, who unfortunately passed away this year.

There were problems around getting her prosthesis and sorting out some of the care that was there. That’s a problem, and we need to be able to address that.", "The same thing happened that happened in Windsor, which was that somebody picked up and said, “We’ve got to get this thing done and we’re going to figure it out.”", "It’s up to us to figure that out in a larger sense as a legislative body and as a government, and as governments across Canada. I was just at a Palliative Care Matters conference, where the assistants’ panel said basically, “We’d like to have home care as something that’s written into the Canada Health Act.” Personally, myself, I believe that should be the case.", "I’m not sure of exactly all the mechanisms, but what I do know is, if someone needs compassionate care at the end of their life, or they are suffering, we have to remove those barriers. We don’t have any choice. That’s what our common humanity is.

It’s going to continue to increase, and we need to address that.", "The government has done some work on it, but there’s still lots to do, Mr. Speaker. I’m reminded that 39% of all money from home care, as per the Auditor General’s report, is going to bureaucracy, not to front-line care. Hopefully, this bill will help move some of that.", "It reminds me that in Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound, I had a case, an 89-year-old lady and a former resident of Ontario who was sadly driven across the border from the States and basically dropped. The people who dropped her off left a six-page letter detailing her likes and dislikes, one wheelchair, two sets of clothing and one bag of diapers, a bag of medication, two pairs of socks and an envelope with some papers in it, one of which was her birth certificate and one her marriage certificate. Sadly, even though she had been an Ontario and Canadian resident for many years, she’d left and lived in the States for a number of years. She was denied access and care right away because she had lived out of the country and had an expired OHIP card. Obviously, she was in clear need of support and care for many different reasons and in a timely manner.", "It is cases like Flora’s that make this bill a compelling case for passage as quickly as possible.

I want to thank you for that. It’s got to be tremendously difficult.", "When I first heard about this health insurance gap, I, like many others, was shocked to hear that this gap even exists. In Canada, we often take for granted that we will have our health care needs covered no matter where we move, even if it’s interprovince. But as this bill points out, that is sadly not the case. We have all found ourselves or someone we know in a position where they have to move, oftentimes for work. Certainly, with the tight economy that we’ve had, we are seeing more and more people travel to other provinces, like Alberta, just as Dan himself did.", "Increasingly, we’re finding that work takes us out of province, and we expect our universal health care needs to reflect these life changes. Our health care needs to be there for us when we count on it the most, and as was mentioned by many, there isn’t a medical reason to have a three-month wait. It’s most likely for bureaucratic reasons, to minimize the paperwork when individuals hop between provinces and territories for short-term work, vacationing or visiting family members, and probably in an effort to cut down on medical tourism.", "But this is clearly not the case when people are returning home to die and need palliative care services. This amendment is the right thing to do, and it is in line with what people expect from universal health care. For these reasons, I am proud to support the member from Windsor West, my colleague, and her amendment, and I hope that everyone in this chamber votes to support this as well." ],

I first of all wanted to commend the member from Windsor West for bringing this bill forward, increasing awareness and some of the discussion about where we need to be on this issue.", "This is an issue I know about first-hand. Not only was I a care coordinator for community care access; I worked very hard to be a founding member of the Hospice of Waterloo Region in the mid-1990s, and I also provided care at home and in the hospital in critical care situations, including pediatrics, for the palliative care patient population. It’s something that I really understand very well and had a lot of success in, in assisting patients and their families to move through the journey of their end-of-life care in the most dignified and cared-for way possible. I really do understand a lot of the issues that are facing us today.", "In saying that, I also did manage some patients who found themselves in Dan’s situation. I also wanted to reach out to the family and thank you for being here today, because in honouring Dan’s memory, you’ve been able to help us enter into the discussion this afternoon to try to provide a way forward on how to avoid this happening to another family, which I’m quite sure is part of your motivation to be here. So again, I reach out and give you my best wishes for the situation you’ve found yourselves in.", "In saying that, I also wanted to note that providing care for a family at the end of their life’s journey is very complex. Most patients and families wish to be at home; sometimes those journeys start at home and end up in the hospital or end up in palliative care. Wherever they end up, it’s our duty as a government and also as care providers to ensure that that dignified care is provided in the very best place possible for the patient and for the families, and that can be a changing circumstance at the end of that journey.", "But again, I want to also note that those folks who do provide the care—physicians, PSWs, families, nurses and all the other members of the health care team that provide that care—deserve a lot of credit for really trying to make the best possible outcome of that situation.", "I also wanted to note that there is work under way between Ontario and our partners at the provincial and territorial level to resolve some of the care and concerns through the most appropriate channel: reciprocal agreements. We recognize that there are challenges for families who receive medical care when away from their home province, and although many of the costs associated with care would be included under reciprocal agreements between the provinces, certain expenses may not be covered.", "It’s an issue of concern for our government, one of the reasons why the Minister of Health raised the issue earlier this year with our provincial and territorial colleagues.

It’s not an issue that Ontario can address alone. So our government will continue to work closely with our provincial and territorial colleagues as we seek to modernize and expand our reciprocal agreements.", "In closing, I really wanted to point out again that I know I’ve addressed these situations up closely.

It’s the Home Care and Community Services Amendment Act. What it’s addressing is the fact that, yes, we all understand there’s a three-month wait for OHIP in the province—when you move to the province, if you’re Canadian, and move from another province—but what people don’t realize is that there’s also a three-month wait for home care and for community care if you’re in a hospice. I think that other provinces have recognized that that’s not fair: that we’re all Canadians, that we have loved ones in other provinces, and that, at a difficult time in families’ and friends’ lives when they make difficult decisions, this isn’t something where they should have this type of hardship. Dan’s family is here to see that this bill moves forward. We recognize that more needs to be done.", "While we understand that there’s bureaucracy and there are difficulties when people are just visiting other provinces or having short-term work and just want to take care of a health care problem rather than waiting, we all know that emergency care would be covered. But I think that, when it comes to home care, when it comes to hospice care, that’s a little bit of a different story. I think that a lot more needs to be done.", "We have to look at the other side. We have to look at why: If the government is speaking in support of this, why aren’t they just able to put it in the budget or make the necessary changes very quickly? We don’t have to spend time debating. We don’t have to have the community come in and hear more stories like Dan’s. Why can’t that be done? Is it perhaps because they want to hide from the fact that almost 40% of the budget for home care is going to bureaucracy? Do they want to hide from the fact that so much money is being wasted that could be going to front-line health care?", "Let’s focus on getting things done right. Let’s focus on getting front-line health care dollars for what needs to be addressed for the home care of patients, for hospice care, for family members and loved ones. Let’s ensure that we don’t have to debate this bill again, because that’s too often what happens: Bills move so slowly that there’s a change in government or proroguing and we have to start with them again.", "These are Ontario citizens we’re talking about.

Everybody knows that we have access to care based on need, not on ability to pay.", "But this is only half of the story, Speaker, because what medicare is, really, is that we can go to the hospital and it’s free, and we can go see a physician and it’s free. Everything else is kind of a hodgepodge of services. Some are accessible; some are not. Some are private; some are public. But they don’t always work for us.", "Add to this the phenomenal shift that we have seen in hospital care. When Alain and I graduated, for a lot of procedures, you were in the hospital for one or two days before you had your surgical procedure, and we would follow you for three or four days, sometimes a whole week, after. Now, you come in that morning, you have your surgery, and you are out the door before the end of the day—which is not bad, which is very good. It means that medical care has progressed.", "But what has not progressed is the fact that as more and more care is shifted from hospital—where it would be covered no matter where we go in this country of ours—it moves into the community. And because of the location of the care, all of a sudden there are barriers to access. All of a sudden, if you haven’t been in Ontario for three months, you don’t have access. All of a sudden, if you don’t live in the right part of the CCAC, or you happen to need care more at the end of the fiscal year rather than at the beginning of the fiscal year, you don’t have access.", "The story that was shared with us of the last days, the last week, of Dan was gut-wrenching. We all know that what happened to this family is wrong. We all know that we failed that family, that we should have done better.", "We have an opportunity to do better. I remember, in this House—and you were there with me, Speaker—where we did the right thing. A similar situation was presented to us, but it had to do with people who served in the armed forces. Remember, if you serve in the armed forces, you don’t have a choice: If they move you, you move. So people who belonged to the armed forces were being moved from a base in Saskatchewan, I think, to a base in Ontario. All of a sudden, the child gets sick. We did the right thing. We said that for those families, we will do away with the three-month waiting period and we will treat them based on needs, not on ability to pay. I see and I heard a lot of goodwill from the people in this chamber today to do the same thing.", "If Dan had chosen to spend his last days in hospital, it would have been fine. It would have been terrible for the family, but it would have cost him nothing. But because he made the choice to stay home, where he was more comfortable, then nothing was available to him anymore.", "It is fine to move services from hospital to the community; this is what people want. It makes sense technologically, it makes sense care-wise, and it makes sense financially. But the rules have to change with them.", "We are the rule makers. Each and every one of us, we are elected by our constituents to do the right thing. Well, we have an opportunity to do the right thing, like we did—you and I, Speaker, and the other 105—when we decided that what had happened to the military families was wrong and we did away with the three-month waiting period.", "We have this opportunity today to do the right thing, to see that there will never be another Dan Duma family let down by this province. If you need palliative care that would be accessible to you if you chose to stay in the hospital, we will make it available to you if you choose to have it in the community or in a hospice. It’s as easy as that.", "If you look at the list of exceptions that we have for the three months, it goes on for two pages. Let’s add one more line, the line that says if you qualify for palliative care within our hospitals, we will cover you in the community—and we’ll call this Dan’s Law." ],

Collectively, humans are responsible for climate change, and we all have a responsibility to do our part to help solve the problem.", "Climate change is already present in our daily lives, Mr. Speaker. It’s real. It’s happening. Climate change is raising the cost of our food, causing extreme weather that damages property and infrastructure, threatening the outdoor activities we love and melting winter roads that provide critical seasonal access to remote northern indigenous communities.", "We recognize the need to take immediate action, because the cost of doing nothing is enormous. We are not willing to impose those costs on our children and future generations. Taking action now to reduce greenhouse gas pollution will mean cleaner air, less time spent in traffic, more comfortable homes and offices, and more convenient, livable cities.", "But we need to do much, much more and we need to work together to do it. Last year at this time, the world’s attention was focused on the Conference of Parties 21, better known as COP21, in Paris and the historic agreement that came from that conference.", "The main goal of the agreement is to, for the first time, bring “all nations into a common cause to undertake ambitious efforts to combat climate change.” To many, this agreement represents a positive shift towards global co-operation in meeting the enormous challenge we face in climate change. The motion I present to all of you today, if passed, would have this Legislature recognize the objectives and provisions agreed to in last year’s Paris agreement at COP21.", "I believe I speak for all when I say that I hope it will be an important turning point in history in how global leaders respond to the challenge of climate change. And as well, how as Ontarians and Canadians, we take positive change within our lives.", "On November 4, 2016, the Paris agreement came into effect. Over 100 countries have already ratified with more to come. I was particularly proud that the Canadian government ratified the agreement on October 4, 2016, and is now moving forward with a national framework on carbon pricing.", "At the provincial level, it is incumbent that we do our part to support national efforts to meet Canada’s greenhouse gas reduction targets and support the provisions within the Paris agreement.", "Earlier this year, the Ontario Legislature voted to enshrine the greenhouse gas emissions targets into law. Only the PCs voted against a reduction of 15% by the end of 2020, a reduction of 37% by the end of 2030 and a reduction of 80% by the end of 2050. Meeting Ontario’s targets, which are enshrined in law, will be vital in helping Canada meet its national targets.", "This motion, if passed, will also demonstrate the support all MPPs in the House have for both the Canadian and Ontario delegations representing us at COP22. Right now, the Ontario delegation, led by Minister Murray, is working closely with world and subnational leaders towards meaningful actions and results.", "Ontario is viewed by our international partners as a leader in the fight against climate change. Ontario is already leading the way by permanently ending coal-fired electricity generation, setting aggressive greenhouse gas reduction targets, establishing a cap-and-trade program and releasing an ambitious climate change action plan to combat climate change.", "Our presence at COP22 helps build Ontario’s reputation as a climate change leader and connects us with other subnational jurisdictions working to fight climate change. By working together, our collective actions are that much stronger.", "Our climate change action plan, which includes cap-and-trade, will help Ontario meet its GHG targets at the cheapest possible price for people and the economy. The plan brings together practical and effective climate-saving actions from across government. Whether you live in northern or southern Ontario, in a rural area or in a big city, the actions in this plan will help you reduce your emissions, use less energy and save more money.", "It will also help us to support up to $8.3 billion in green projects that fight climate change, like public transit, electric vehicle incentives and home energy retrofits. More specifically, our plan will help people and businesses reduce emissions, use less energy and save money by providing rebates of up to $14,000 to make buying or leasing an electric vehicle more affordable; support for buying and installing chargers for private home and business use; more public charging stations in cities along highways and in condos and workplace parking lots; and free overnight charging for your electric vehicle.", "I have many cyclists in my riding of Davenport, so this plan would also allow for more bike lanes and better cycling infrastructure to make it easier to get around on two wheels. It will also provide grants to lower the cost to homeowners of installing low-carbon technology, like a solar water heating system and other retrofits that will help improve home energy efficiency and save you money.", "Our plan will also establish a green bank that would help homeowners and businesses access and finance energy efficient technologies to reduce greenhouse gas pollution from buildings, work in partnership with First Nation and Métis communities to address climate change, and offer better protection for rural and agricultural lands in rural areas from urban sprawl, which will benefit us all.", "Many of my constituents in the riding of Davenport see climate change as a critical issue facing the entire world. They want to make personal changes by switching to lower carbon technologies.", "Just last month, I was pleased to take part in an announcement in my riding with Premier Wynne, showcasing efforts made by the local O’Hara family to go green. The O’Haras had made important changes in their home heating and cooling system. They installed a Nest thermostat, as well as brand new windows and doors. The result? Reduced greenhouse gas emissions and lower monthly bills. That’s a win for the environment and a win for the pocketbook of the O’Haras.", "This plan is good for business too. Our government is helping industries and manufacturers transform their operations and move off fossil fuels and peak electricity, while also creating good jobs in the clean tech sector and skilled trades. And we’re helping small and medium-sized businesses reduce greenhouse gas pollution and become more energy efficient.", "Fighting climate change while supporting economic growth is part of the province’s plan to create jobs, grow our economy and help people in their everyday lives. The fight against climate change is about respecting this province and this planet, whose care has been entrusted to all of us.", "Ontario’s climate action plan is a springboard to progress. It’s a five-year plan that builds on work already done and achievements already made in reducing Ontario’s greenhouse gas pollution. Its investments will help families reduce costs and make the switch to non-polluting choices easier and less expensive.", "Fighting climate change requires the involvement of everyone—individuals, businesses, diverse communities, governments—separately and collectively, both short and long-term. We all have a role to play. Ontario’s climate change action plan sets us on that path forward. Together, we have an opportunity to lead a climate change movement that will transform our province and ensure a healthy, prosperous and greener future.", "All over the world, households and businesses are making these types of decisions and realizing the cost savings. These are the types of investments we need to make across all sectors to ensure we are effectively and responsibly reducing greenhouse gas pollution. By moving ahead now, we can reduce pollution and move toward a low-carbon economy. In recognizing the 2015 Paris agreement, the Ontario Legislature can send a strong signal of co-operation and unwavering support on fighting climate change.", "I want to note that we have made great progress here in Ontario in the way we think about climate change, as well as our efforts to mitigate and adapt to its impacts. On this side of the House, we strongly believe that we are moving forward with a balanced approach that guarantees reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and also helps Ontario households and businesses make that transition successfully.", "We’ve had great support from the NDP on our plan in fighting climate change. Just last week, that party called for even more ambitious reduction targets for the province than what we are currently proposing. Even the official opposition have come around to supporting some form of carbon pricing. While we feel we’ve charted the most responsible, balanced path forward for the environment and the economy, we appreciate the dialogue both parties have engaged in.", "Madam Speaker, I will end by saying that it is imperative that we as Ontarians show support for the federal government, and that it’s crucial that all of the countries in the world come together to reduce greenhouse gas pollution. With world leaders of all political stripes coming together to ratify this historic agreement, it’s clear that the appetite for meaningful action to fight climate change cuts across party lines." ],

I recognize that the motion presented by the member from Davenport absolutely is something that crosses all party lines.", "I wish to begin by saying that the PC party will be supporting this motion, but—there’s a “but” here—we find it a little redundant because, you see, the provincial government has already pushed through legislation regarding climate change, specifically Bill 172, and the federal government has also announced its own plan, which prescriptively directs provinces to price carbon.", "Because of that, I’m not really sure why the Liberals feel it’s necessary to bring this motion forward at this time, because the reality is this, Speaker: We all recognize that climate change is indeed a serious challenge that requires a credible plan that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions while protecting Ontarians and our provincial economy.", "Around the world, businesses, industry and everyday people are making conscious decisions already to lower their carbon footprint and adopt greener, more environmentally friendly practices. But I would like to be clear that, as a government, our participation in addressing the impact of climate change should never come at the cost of forcing the market to adopt practices and technologies that make them uncompetitive. This is a position that we in the PC Party have advocated for quite some time now, and it’s one that we’ve heard echoed from stakeholders at all levels.", "Through the years, innovators and leading visionaries have driven the development of technologies that address the climate change concern and, most importantly, reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We have heard from the member from Davenport that Ontario is leading the way, and indeed we have. We must recognize that because we are already leading the way, Ontario’s total contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is less than half a percentage point. That’s 0.05%.", "But again, in the spirit of celebrating how Ontario is leading the way, I must say that everyone in the House today would recall that the first coal plant to be closed was under the direction of then-environment minister Elizabeth Witmer and Minister of Energy Jim Wilson. It was under their order that the very first coal plant in Ontario was closed down: the Lakeview station in Mississauga. So Ontario does indeed, as the member from Davenport said, absolutely lead the way.", "I want to talk, during my time during this debate, about more innovation that has led the way in Ontario. I think it’s really important to recognize and celebrate what already has happened in the spirit of embracing what can continue to happen in the future.", "A great historical example is the catalytic converter. The EPA told automakers in 1975 that cars needed to be equipped with catalytic converters. The adoption of the catalytic converter removed noxious gases from car emissions, meaning that the market adapted to the challenges of the day.", "In doing research for the debate today, we found an old General Motors ad explaining these new catalytic converters to consumers. They were proud that they had proactively solved a problem of their generation.", "While we all know that emissions continue to present challenges today in 2016, again the market has voluntarily responded with a wide range of initiatives to lower emissions. I’d be remiss if I didn’t say that the market and a whole host of a variety of industry sectors have volunteered, and that’s the important part. For instance, automakers are recognizing that there is public demand for lower-emission vehicles, and they’ve responded with great cars in that regard. For instance, we now have, time and time again, turbos being inputted into four-cylinder cars, and that is a great initiative to better engine performance and most importantly reduce emissions.", "My husband works at Wescast Industries in product launch, and not only are they focused on a variety of manifolds, but the production of turbos has really taken over and actually keeps them just as busy as manifolds.", "Only 15 years ago, Speaker, hybrid vehicles were only beginning to be viewed as an option when Ontario families went to buy cars, but people were concerned with the batteries in these vehicles and a perceived lack of power and range in terms of the distance they could go. But they were also intrigued and excited. They were intrigued and excited by the fuel savings and the emission reductions that these vehicles offered. Again, the marketplace was driven by consumers who wanted to do their part.", "As hybrid vehicles in turn were adopted by the public and as people embraced these vehicles, the skepticism surrounding the whole concept of hybrid started to disappear. Now we’re at a point where we see hybrids everywhere. Dozens upon dozens of models are available, and this was achieved due to private sector investment and consumer demand driving innovation with a better product.", "Now technological advances have taken us a step further with electric vehicles, better known as EVs. The EVs available today are great cars that many people want to buy, and there’s a whole range of vehicles for every price point.", "I must say that I hope everyone here at Queen’s Park took the opportunity to test-drive an EV during Plug’n Drive’s EV Day. I have to tell you that they had a great variety of EV cars to drive that day. What I left most excited about, given that I’m from the country—we live on a farm—I learned that day that there’s a Ford F-150 hybrid coming down the pipeline. If you know Dennis and I, you’ll know that we’ll be in line to snag one of those when they become available, because we all need to do our part.", "You know how we have “take kids to work day,” Speaker? He hopes that next year, “bring my husband to work day” happens on the EV Plug’n Drive day. It’s some fun that we have at home.", "We have to recognize that the EV vehicles are evolving. At one point, there was a high price tag, and the range in terms of distance was minimal. But technology is evolving, and that’s not so much a worry these days.", "People who can afford a $100,000-plus EV probably don’t need the incentive that we see today from this government, because as demand evolves, the price points vary, as technologies bring more and more variety onto the marketplace.", "The neat thing about what’s happening with automakers these days is that they’re indicating that they’re investing the revenue generated from the sales of EVs back into research and development, to improve these cars while driving down their price. That truly is market innovation that will benefit consumers.", "emissions. I’m sure we all know somebody who drives an electric car, and when somebody likes their car, they tell their friends, and they’ll tell two friends—that’s right—and so on and so on. That’s right.

Ontario farmers have worked very hard for decades now, in terms of embracing environmental farming practices. A lot of the practices embraced today are growing and sustaining carbon sinks, which we also need. The new technologies include no-tillage equipment, meaning we’re not turning over the ground, and many fields now are covered with cover crops. They’re very, very cognizant of the importance of maintaining our soil in good health as well as providing carbon sinks.", "But the sad part about all of this is, as we focus in on adapting and improving our ways to reduce emissions, some industries are not being allowed, to date, to be at the table with this Liberal government. I can tell you with 100% certainty that Ontario farmers want to be part of the solution, and because of that, they want to be at the table. Currently, they’re excluded from the discussions on offsets, and I find that quite shameful. I hope that changes over the months.", "Another industry that we need to recognize is the chemical industry. Nova Chemicals is doing a great job cutting emissions on their own. Every year, they report their reductions, and they are looking to continue to make incremental changes every year to lower their emissions footprint.", "When we talk about Ontario farmers, when we talk about Nova Chemicals, it’s clear that everyone wants to be good environmental stewards.", "Speaker, I just want to reflect on the fact that as we move forward and continue to talk about the serious issue of climate change, we need to be mindful of the fact that we all agree, in this House, on this motion. We all agree that climate change is indeed a serious issue. But I also want to be clear that because we’re supporting the member from Davenport today and her motion—I want to be perfectly clear that the Ontario PC Party will never support the Liberal cap-and-trade cash-grab scheme. Speaker, you know and everyone in this House knows, and Ontarians know as well, that we can’t use the environment as an excuse for a cash grab.", "The PC Party of Ontario has long maintained that the government needs to develop a credible plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, all the while protecting Ontarians and our economy. Unfortunately, the Liberals’ cap-and-trade scheme will not effectively tackle climate change, as we’ve seen with many examples across the globe that have also pursued cap-and-trade. The Liberals’ approach to generating their slush fund, if you will, will only make life more complicated and less affordable for Ontarians, and increase the cost of doing business in our province." ],

We all agree that climate change is real, and it appears that we all agree that the main cause of climate change is human activity. It’s good to hear that there is very positive input and very positive support for the member’s motion today recognizing the 2015 Paris agreement.", "We hear the terms “Paris accord” and “Paris agreement” bandied about. It’s good to take a step back for a second and remind ourselves just how big an accord this really is. There are currently 109 parties that have ratified it. Of course, as the member said earlier, the Canadian government ratified the accord back in October 2016. It’s good to hear today that we agree that it’s incumbent that we do our part to support national efforts to meet Canada’s greenhouse gas reduction targets and support all the provisions within the Paris agreement. Meeting Ontario’s targets, which are enshrined in law, will be vital in helping all of Canada meet our national targets.", "This motion, if passed, will also show support from all MPPs in this House to delegations from the governments of Canada and Ontario at the Conference of the Parties 22, currently being led by our Minister of the Environment and Climate Change, Glen Murray. Right now, as the minister is there working closely with the world and subnational leaders towards meaningful action, meaningful results, Ontario is already viewed by our international partners as a leader in the fight against climate change.

By working together, our collective actions are much stronger.

Some people want us to do nothing, but inaction when it comes to greenhouse gas emissions is not an option. Ontarians recognize that climate change is already causing increased insurance rates, higher food costs and more weather-related damage.", "That’s why it’s so important for Ontario to continue building on the historic Paris climate change agreement signed earlier this year. Minister Murray, as I mentioned earlier, is currently at the conference, working alongside leaders of all political stripes to do just that.", "We’re moving forward with a cap-and-trade system because it’s best for Ontario and will result in real emissions reductions. Our aim is to meet our GHG targets at the cheapest price possible for the people and our economy. Our investments will help families and businesses reduce costs and make the switch to non-polluting choices easier and less expensive.", "Third-party economic analysis has shown that Ontario’s cap-and-trade program, linked with California and Quebec, achieves the best environmental and economic outcomes when compared to a carbon tax or to an unlinked cap-and-trade program. The same study shows that a carbon tax could cost households up to $50 more per month, as opposed to $13 under our plan, just to get the same carbon reductions.", "Most importantly, this plan builds on what we’ve achieved already. By becoming the first jurisdiction in North America to eliminate coal, we successfully met our 2014 greenhouse gas reduction target. Thanks to Ontario’s leadership, we’re well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities and new jobs that will come with the global shift to a low-carbon economy.", "Mr. Speaker, with political leaders of all stripes coming together to ratify this historic agreement, it’s clear that the appetite for meaningful action on climate change cuts across party lines. The member’s motion calls on all parties here today to recognize the important climate change objectives set out in the 2015 Paris agreement. Ontario is already a climate change leader, and supporting this motion is another step in the right direction.", "We know that action by Ontario and other subnational governments will continue to play a vital role moving forward. That’s why we’re confident our climate change action plan is the next step in Ontario’s fight against climate change. Our plan, which we mentioned includes cap-and-trade, will help Ontario meet its target at the cheapest possible price, as I’ve said before, for people and the economy.", "It’s important to note that on average, over 80% of total current allowances offered have been sold at auction. In fact, the flexibility in the market-based program is a major advantage of a cap-and-trade approach. Covered entities are able to choose when to make their investments and allowances—for example, waiting until further auctions.", "In eliminating coal, generating 90% of our power emissions-free and ensuring that our system is clean and reliable, we’re already leading by example.", "Mr. Speaker, I’ll leave it there for now, but I fully support the motion that our member has put on the floor, and I look forward to support from all parties." ],

  "text" : [ "And you were right. You were right, and that’s something about you that everyone in this House appreciates.", "Speaker, I’ll be supporting this motion. I know you won’t be surprised. I don’t think anyone else in the House would be surprised. I have no doubt—none—that the Liberals who are present here and who may come for a vote will support it as well.", "But I have to say that I don’t have any confidence that the Liberals will actually meet the climate targets set out in the Paris agreement. I don’t think they’ll do it provincially, and I’m quite certain they won’t do it federally either, and that is of great consequence.", "Just a reminder—and I actually printed out a copy of the Paris agreement in case you, Speaker, are curious to see exactly what’s there. There’s a lot in there. It’s a useful agreement, well thought out, some really good language. But the central thing for us having this debate today is a commitment to keeping the increase in global temperatures to two degrees—actually, a target less than two degrees and, hopefully, 1.5 degrees centigrade. Here in Ontario, the government actions won’t meet the two-degrees target, let alone the 1.5-degrees target.", "I have to say that for many who may be watching this on television, many who are here in this chamber, those are just numbers. What’s 1.5? What’s two? What’s three? Really, it’s not part of our everyday lives. When we get up, we look at the thermometer and we listen to the weather report. If it’s 10 degrees out or eight degrees out, it’s not a big difference in our lives.", "But, frankly, as the world heats up around us, right now it seems as though we’re able to go through our daily lives with very little disruption—at least, here in Ontario. I would say that in the Arctic, people are seeing disruptions to their daily lives, no doubt about it. If you go to the Pacific, people on small island states are seeing disruptions to their daily lives. If you go to the Philippines or Bangladesh, people are seeing disruption in their lives. It’s very real.", "But the world as a whole—and not just those territories that I cited—is entering very, very risky territory. Two degrees was set as a limit on the increase, or a red line, because when you get past that, you start getting into some very unpredictable and risky territory. Even under that, you’re going to see more extreme weather events, more powerful hurricanes, more tornadoes, more extreme rainfall, drought, flooding and, frankly, more failed crop yields. That is of consequence to us. When you go past two degrees, you start looking at an acceleration of all of those things that will undermine our society and undermine our standard of living.", "I know that those who have spoken before have talked a bit about this, but in the middle of the last decade, the British government had a study done about the impact of climate change and the idea that we would go past two degrees and what that would mean in terms of our daily lives. It would mean, in terms of loss of our economic well-being, a descent to conditions comparable to the Great Depression or to World War II. That’s the kind of drop in our standard of living when we go into that area, that very risky and unpredictable area.", "When I say I don’t have confidence that the Liberal plans will actually keep us within that limit, I want to enlarge on that. But if we’re going to talk about the Paris agreement, I think this Liberal government needs to think very concretely about what it’s going to do to actually meet those targets—and not just talk about it, not just have a motion here on a Thursday afternoon where we get to talk about our commitment to climate action, but talk about what it means to keep our society and all of us safe in a world that is going to become more and more unpredictable.", "I want to start with the sell-off of Hydro One, because, increasingly, as the world transforms its energy systems, electricity is going to become the fundamental energy source that we use. If that is the case, we need to be able to control that energy system. Selling it off means that now there’s a group of investors whose interests are not the same as ours. Their interest is in maximizing their return. Our interest is in building this society and dealing with the threat of a hotter world. It will undermine our ability to act.", "I’ll just give you an example, Speaker. Ontario was able to shut down coal in this province. Conservatives promised it; we promised it; the Liberals promised it. There was a political consensus in this province. Frankly, we were able to shut it down. But in Alberta, where they want to shut it down, because they’re privately owned, those coal-fired power plants, the government is looking at dishing out large volumes of compensation to those legal owners. Here we have the legal ability and the financial ability to shut it down. When it’s privately owned, it’s a very different ball game.", "Frankly, in Germany they’re facing similar problems, where private interests—some domestic German, some Swedish and some from other countries—own these properties and are making money off them. By God, it’s going to be quite a fight to shut those down. It is going to be a very big fight.", "Germany, as well, used to have a publicly owned grid. In the 1990s, they sold it off. You need to know that in that country now, there are ongoing political battles to reclaim the grid into the public sector so that people can do what’s needed to actually transform the electricity system. That is being fought city by city and it is having concrete impacts on the ability of Germany to build the transmission lines they need, to move renewable power from one part of the country to the another so they can get off those conventional sources of energy.", "Speaker, when you want to build a house—if you want to transform the energy system or if you want to build a house—the first thing you do is not sell off your tools. You hold on to the tools you need to do the job. What the Liberals are doing with the sell-off of Hydro One is not only selling off a central tool to actually meeting our goals, but they’re going to make electricity and energy more expensive for everyone. That undermines the credibility of actions needed to address the climate crisis.", "People saw the polling that was publicized by the Canadian Press that showed up on CBC, in the Toronto Star and in the Hamilton Spectator within the past week: 94% of people in Ontario want action to reduce the cost of hydro. That’s no surprise. Some 64%, though, say that it’s more important to deal with the price of hydro than to deal with climate issues. That’s something the Liberals have done very well. Whenever they’ve been attacked on their complete mismanagement of the electricity system, they say it’s because of green energy.", "Well, Speaker, I’ll tell you: Privatization, Liberal hobby horses, looking after their friends—a variety of things—have driven up the cost of electricity dramatically. Green energy is not the heart of the problem. But because they use it as a defence all the time, they’ve legitimized it. They’ve undermined our ability to take action. That language, that rhetoric, undermines meeting the Paris agreement. So I’d say, if they’re actually going to live by the motion that should be passed today, they should knock it off, admit the mistakes they’ve made with Hydro, stop privatization, and actually help people in Ontario take on climate action.", "Speaker, I also want to note the market rhetoric from the Liberals about cap-and-trade. In California, the bulk of the reductions in emissions are not going to come from higher-priced energy. It’s going to come from investments in green energy technologies and it’s going to come from new regulations. Cap-and-trade can be useful, but it really is not the heart of what you need to do. That’s true not just with cap-and-trade, but with carbon tax. Pricing is not the key thing. Changing regulations and changing how you invest: That’s the centre of what has to happen.", "But that said, when the Liberals take the cap-and-trade money to pay for energy efficiency in the electricity system, which was already being paid for with rates, then they’re undermining their whole argument for cap-and-trade, which was to pay for new additional measures so that we could meet the targets that we need to meet. That, Speaker, undermines this motion, and that needs to change.", "I just want to note, because this Liberal motion references the federal Liberal Party and their actions, that in the last federal election there was—justifiably—an attack on the Harper government’s climate plan as totally inadequate, the minimum amount that Canada would do, according to the Liberals. And yet, in power, they’ve adopted it wholesale, completely. A plan that they recognized before the election was completely inadequate is now the policy of the government of Canada. It does not serve us well, Speaker. Even now, as people are analyzing—people in the wider world, in the climate community—and looking at what’s going on in this area, they’re seeing that Canada’s climate plans are inadequate to meet the Paris agreement. Frankly, what they have in place probably won’t even meet the Harper climate targets, which were junk and irrelevant even then.", "Speaker, to say that you’re doing something and solving a problem is like going out to rescue someone who is drowning one kilometre offshore, towing them in to half a kilometre and letting go of them. They’re still going to drown. You actually have to go the distance to make the difference. This motion, if it was going to address those failings, would be far more useful. As it is, I will support it, but I want to be on the record that the planning and the policies put in place by the Liberal government here in Ontario won’t meet the Paris agreement, will not do what needs to be done to protect the world from increasing warming, and, frankly, is not responsible. If we want to save the population from disruption, we need to have a much more aggressive plan." ],

I just want to address some of the things that he might have missed and perhaps contextualize a little bit of why this motion before us today is so incredibly important.", "I want to start, as many of us do in this House, by referencing my riding. I have the good fortune of being the MPP for Burlington, with an exciting array of very innovative companies in my riding, some of whom are already benefiting from the cap-and-trade system that, of course, Ontario is preparing to enter, which is really exciting. They’ve been into my office to talk to me about how pleased they are with our system and where we’re headed, and how it’s going to really enhance their bottom line even further because they are, like so many companies, operating in a global marketplace.", "This particular company is national in scope. They are already getting credits from Quebec and BC. They’re just delighted with what we’re doing. It really does my heart good.", "It hearkens back to a time in my early career when I had the pleasure of working at an organization called Sustainable Development Technology Canada that I was fortunate enough to help set up. Speaker, it is an organization that was started by the federal Liberal government in the context of climate change and the commercialization of sustainable development technologies. My point here is that SDTC, as it’s known, which again is all about demonstrating new technologies, promoting sustainable development, including technologies to address issues related to climate change, the quality of our air, water and soil—fundamentally, when SDTC was started in 2001 with a cash infusion of $200 million from the then Chrétien government, that created the kind of incentive for clean tech to be commercialized that much further and faster. There’s often a gap in the clean technology sector between the commercialization of technologies and when they come out of, say, the incubation stage. That venture capital gap is real and it exists. SDTC has done a great job. It’s leadership like that that reminds me of exactly what we’re trying to do right here in Ontario.", "Ontario and Canada want to lead the market and lead the world in sustainable development technology. It’s going to require systems like the one that we are implementing, like the one we are talking about in today’s motion, that will encourage and incent the development of sustainable development technologies and make us a world leader on a global stage, which increasingly includes countries like China.", "The Paris climate change accord agreement has been a powerful impetus for the broad recognition that climate change is the challenge of our lifetimes. We all know that, Speaker. That’s why our government is showing leadership in terms of ensuring that we remain commercially viable, that our economy doesn’t take the kind of hit that we know can happen.", "In my own riding, Speaker, in Burlington, I have to tell you, we had an amazing one-in-100-year weather event in 2014. We had a flood where we had the amount of rain in five hours that we usually get in a season. We had 200 millimetres of rain in a very short period of time. It overwhelmed our sewer system. We had $81 million in insurance claims. We had 1,800 homes that were impacted. As a consequence of that, our mayor and council have worked with us as a government to invest in remediation, of course, but also technologies that are going to help us and help them and help homeowners.", "This kind of issue is incredibly important for us, of course. I’m pleased that we’re taking action. I’m pleased to see the debate that has happened today, and I thank you for the chance to participate in it." ],

And I want to thank everyone for their overwhelming support on my motion here this afternoon.", "I know that the member from Huron–Bruce mentioned that Ontario is a leader in climate change. I agree, and I think I said that. I think most of us here this afternoon mentioned the fact that we are leaders. Part of that leadership has been due to our leadership in eliminating coal, which has helped attract a new industry here in Ontario and in essence has created over 42,000 new jobs. I want to thank her for acknowledging the importance that we have in fighting climate change, and for acknowledging the farmers in Ontario. I want to thank them for all the great work that they’re doing in our province, day in and day out, to also help us fight climate change.", "The Minister of Housing spoke about cap-and-trade. We are moving forward with cap-and-trade and it really, truly is the best for Ontario and will result in real emissions reductions.", "The member from Toronto–Danforth mentioned that he had no confidence in our government moving forward and meeting our targets. Well, I want to remind the member opposite that we were successful in meeting our 2014 greenhouse gas reduction targets, and we are fully focused on achieving our targets for 2020 and beyond.", "Mr. Speaker, this plan builds on what we’re achieving already.

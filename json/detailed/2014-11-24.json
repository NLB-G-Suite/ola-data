Drivers will pay two and a half cents more per litre of gas if carbon goes up to $15, six cents more per litre if carbon goes up to $30 per tonne and 10 cents more per litre if carbon goes up to $50 per tonne, which it very well could.

The funny thing was, he went to Ridgeway high school but he played for the Fort Erie Falcons because Ridgeway hadn’t had a team for about 30 years, since the mid-1970s. After he graduated and came back to Ridgeway high school, Calvin decided to bring football back to Ridgeway. He used that same defensive end tenacity to raise $33,000 from donors and bring a team back to Ridgeway-Crystal Beach High School.", "The night he died, he actually had the team in for a bit of a pep rally as the big game came up against the Beamsville Bucs. Sadly, he passed away of a heart attack at 48. His team rallied the next day, beat the Beamsville Bucs and then went on a tear.

I think we can all agree that the health and well-being of Ontarians is a top priority for all members in this Legislature. Bill 21, Safeguarding Health Care Integrity Act, is a combination of two time-sensitive bills that were previously introduced in the last Parliament.", "The first bill, Enhancing Patient Care and Pharmacy Safety Act, was introduced more than a year ago and was debated for many months in the House. The second bill, Voluntary Blood Donations Act, was first introduced nine months ago and was debated and referred to committee with agreement from all parties. Both bills died on the order paper last May. Both bills were also part of the Liberal plan that we put to the people in June. We are following through with that mandate.", "We’re now moving forward with Bill 21. This motion allows the House to pass this bill before the new year.", "Schedule 1 of the bill would prohibit paying or accepting payment for blood and plasma donations in Ontario. If passed, this bill would help preserve the integrity of the voluntary blood and plasma donation system we have in Ontario.", "Following the tainted blood scandal of the 1980s, Canada’s blood system was established on the principle of voluntary donation. However, as is public knowledge, there have been cases in Ontario of clinics that intend to pay individuals for their plasma donations. We’ve heard from many health care organizations and individual Ontarians, including victims of tainted blood, who oppose private, for-profit plasma clinics.", "With these types of private clinics, the principle of voluntary donation is at risk. As a government, we stand firmly against payment for blood or plasma donations in Ontario, and that is why we need to pass this legislation as quickly as possible.", "Schedule 2 of the bill focuses on the regulation of hospital pharmacies, specifically Ontario’s cancer drug supply system. When it came to light that 1,019 patients received weaker doses of chemotherapy drugs than had been prescribed by their oncologists, our government appointed Dr. Jake Thiessen to conduct an investigation to determine the cause of the underdosing. His investigation yielded 12 recommendations to protect public safety, and our government is committed to implementing them.", "One of the recommendations requires legislative changes, which this proposed legislation addresses. Our proposed legislation would amend the Drug and Pharmacies Regulation Act so that the Ontario College of Pharmacists can inspect and license all hospital pharmacies operating in Ontario. This is a means to ensure that medication management and processing systems in hospital pharmacies are standardized.", "Speaker, we know that there is support from members from all parties. In fact, members from both opposition parties have made positive comments in support of this bill. I’m very pleased about that.", "The member from Nickel Belt, the health critic for the NDP, agrees that there is an urgency to passing this legislation. Here’s what she said: “We have a bill in front of us. I hope it will go to committee as fast as we can send it there.”", "“Let’s move on with it. It has been two years. This is way too long.”", "I couldn’t agree more.", "The member from Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound has said, “My PC caucus colleagues, including our health critic, Christine Elliott from Whitby–Oshawa, are supportive … but we do want to make sure that it gets to committee.”", "Again, I couldn’t agree more. This is a very special moment in this Legislature, Speaker: We all agree.", "There’s also support for this bill from those who matter the most. Antonia Swann is the widow of a tainted-blood victim. She said, “I applaud Minister Hoskins for re-introducing this bill to make it illegal to pay for blood in Ontario, and it would be prudent for other provinces, as well as Health Canada, to follow his lead.”", "She went on to say, “I know that my late husband, James Kreppner, would commend the Ontario government for protecting the voluntary blood donation system.”", "It’s time to move forward with Bill 21. In the last Parliament, this Legislature was ground to a halt and was unable to move forward on important pieces of legislation like Bill 21. In fact, only 39% of government bills were passed in the last minority government. That’s compared to more than three quarters of bills that were passed going back to 1990.", "Voters of Ontario sent a clear message last June: They don’t want any more of the stalling tactics of the opposition parties. I urge all members of this House to support this motion. They agree with the substance. Let’s get this done. Let’s help pass this bill as quickly as possible." ],

As I’ve said in previous debates, there were a couple of bills that the government House leader asked both parties in opposition to allow quick passage for. This particular bill that this closure motion deals with, Bill 21, was a bill, as I indicated right from the very start, that our party felt needed to have a few extra days of public hearings. In fact, our critic, the member for Whitby–Oshawa, Ms. Elliott, did want to have some public hearings, and I communicated that very openly to the government House leader at our very first House leaders’ meeting.", "But last week, Speaker, I have to tell you, I had a great suggestion from the Chair of Cabinet, the minister without portfolio, the member for St. Catharines, the Honourable Jim Bradley, and I’m going to take him up on his suggestion.", "All of us here have a tremendous admiration for the member from St. Catharines. He has been here since 1977, so that means his 40th anniversary as a member will happen during this term. It’s an incredible milestone of public service. I think my colleagues here this afternoon would agree with me that Mr. Bradley has probably forgotten more about the inner workings of this place than some of us will ever know.", "Given that respect that I believe we as fellow legislators have for Mr. Bradley, when I was preparing for the debate, I took his suggestion, because who better to look to for some guidance on this troubling issue of time allocation than Jim Bradley?", "It’s a very important point. No matter on which side of the House you take your seat, deep down I think we all struggle with the concept of shutting down debate. Debate is the hallmark of our democratic society. It’s the reason we get up in the morning and come to this place at Queen’s Park.", "Over the weekend, I took the suggestion that Minister Bradley gave me and I reviewed Hansard over the weekend and checked the official record from my friend the member from St. Catharines.", "I have to tell you, it was a very illuminating read to look at his great concern for the erosion of the democratic process when he spoke as a member of the opposition on time allocation motions. I hope that the new members of the Liberal government will pay particularly close attention to his words, because we all know that they don’t have to do a lot of research on a bill or on a time allocation motion because the Premier’s office is ultimately just going to hand them their speaking notes on that particular motion.", "When I looked at the wonderful comments of the minister when he was in opposition, I had to make sure that I put them on the record today. Here’s what the esteemed member for St. Catharines had to say on December 11, 2001:", "“Mr. Bradley: This is indeed an interesting bill, but what’s even more interesting right now is the time allocation motion that faces us. For the people who are watching this perhaps on their television sets at home, I should clarify that. That is the choking off of debate, the ending of debate or the government allocating how much time there shall be for the debate on a piece of legislation.”", "Choking off debate—Mr. Bradley has such a way with words. I couldn’t have said it better myself. In fact, I think I’ll use his words, “choking off debate,” during our discussion of this motion.", "Let me continue, though, with his remarks of that day. Here’s the member for St. Catharines:", "“We are operating in this Legislative Assembly at this time almost exclusively on what are called time allocation motions. That’s most unfortunate, because it’s what you would call anti-democratic.”", "Wow: “operating almost exclusively on time allocations” and “anti-democratic.” I guess the saying goes that the more things change, the more they stay the same.", "I’m going to continue to quote, if you’ll allow me, the member for St. Catharines:", "“Is this the first government that ever used a time allocation motion or a closure motion? No. But this government has consistently used these motions to pass legislation through this House even after this government imposed upon the Legislature drastic changes to the procedural rules of this House to grease the skids for legislation that it deems appropriate for the province.", "“The best way to deal with legislation is to have the government sitting most of the year so it can receive careful analysis and debate in this House and in committees and, in fact, in committees that travel across the province to get meaningful input. We do not have that.”", "That’s an interesting point because that’s exactly what the opposition parties have been suggesting to the government. Our party has suggested that we have province-wide hearings on Bill 10. Our party suggested that we have province-wide hearings on Bill 21.", "It’s interesting, when we look back at the debate, to see that that’s exactly what the member for St. Catharines, when he was in opposition, recommended happen so that you could get that feedback.", "The next speech not only spoke to the problem with closure but it also talked about the concentration of power in the Premier’s office. I know that the current government House leader understands that, because the power of his position has been all but taken away. When it comes to the House leaders, he doesn’t actually negotiate with the member for Timmins–James Bay and me; he just carries out orders. He just basically gets the orders from the corner office, from the Premier, and that’s what he comes back to dictate to us on.", "Here’s a bit of a speech from the member for St. Catharines, Mr. Bradley, from May 30, 2001. Here’s the member for St. Catharines:", "“I regret that we are dealing once again with yet another time allocation motion, which is a motion that chokes off debate in the Legislative Assembly. It is my observation after a number of years, and I think talking to people who have observed this Parliament for a number of years, that it has been diminished so remarkably by this government that it has become almost irrelevant. That is most unfortunate, not simply for those of us who sit in the opposition or for the combatants who are of a partisan nature in this House, but for the democratic institution that indeed it has been in the past.", "“It was once a significant institution, in my view. I remember, as a person before I was elected, coming and sitting in the public galleries. Those were the days where you didn’t have somebody blocking you at the door and making you get passes and so on. You simply had to sit in the public gallery and watch the debates that took place. And we did sit in those days; the House did sit both in the daytime and sometimes in the evening, particularly on Tuesday and Thursday evenings.", "“If you listened to the debate in those days—I’ll say, admittedly, that there are always those who view the past as perhaps” much “better than the present, but I had a number of students who have gone through the Hansards and read some of the speeches and noted that indeed they were very good speeches in the House in those days. They were more lengthy than they are now, in many cases, so that ideas were able to be elaborated upon. There was a greater detailed analysis of legislation that took place, not only in the House in Committee of the Whole, because often we went to Committee of the Whole to deal with clause-by-clause, but also in committees of the Legislature.", "“I think it was more ecumenical than it is today.”", "The member goes on: “Today the strongest person is the party whip. The party whip simply tells the members of the committee what shall happen, and it happens. That’s unfortunate, because on all sides I think members have something to contribute: the opposition to concede when the government has made moves that are acceptable and good, and the government members to find problems that might exist in government legislation. But that is virtually gone. It is virtually dictated now by the Premier’s office. The speeches we hear in the House tend to be speeches which seem to originate from the government caucus service bureau, and I understand the need for some research for speeches, but they are virtually meaningless, because they can’t influence the government or the procedures that take place. That’s most unfortunate.”", "I wholeheartedly agree with the member for St. Catharines in his speech. Behaviour like he’s talking about is very unfortunate, and frankly, I’m surprised that the member is now willing to participate in this, given his so strong views.", "Now, granted, those two speeches that I quoted were made at a time when the Progressive Conservative Party sat on the government side. I think we remember those days, especially now that Ontario’s economy is struggling under the weight of this government’s mismanagement. Those were the days when Ontario’s economy was booming. It was a time when our great province was the economic powerhouse driving Canada’s economy. Unfortunately, things have changed. I know that sometimes I say we used to be the economic engine and now we’re the caboose; that’s the railroader family in me. I know that most people know there isn’t even a caboose now. This, again, is under the last 11 years of this government.", "I know my colleague, the House leader for the third party, is going to have plenty of things to say later about time allocation. But I also want to make sure that, in his remarks, he doesn’t just talk about PC governments and Liberal governments. I want to go back a little further in Hansard, if I might.", "My friend, the member for St. Catharines, had plenty of things to say, as well, about the NDP and how they ran this place during their reign. I have a speech during a time allocation debate on November 24, 1993. That’s right, Speaker. Coincidentally, the speech the member for St. Catharines gave was 21 years ago today. I hope, on this anniversary, that Minister Bradley will throw off the shackles that the Premier’s office has placed on him so that he can speak freely, so that he, himself, can quote some of his past comments in Hansard. Here’s a replay of that debate, 21 years ago, on November 24, 1993. I appreciate it’s long, so I would ask the members’ indulgence, but it’s very profound words.", "Mr. Bradley: “I wish to speak to the closure motion which is before the House by once again indicating my concern at the number of closure motions which have been forthcoming from the government House leader and under the NDP government of Bob Rae.", "“The reason I do that is that in many years gone past Mr. Rae entered the House in a by-election when Mr. Lewis resigned. Mr. Rae became the leader after Mr. Cassidy stepped down as leader. I can well recall that he felt very strongly about the fact that the opposition should have the opportunity to fully canvass all the arguments on any of the bills before the House, and he was a very strong defender of that particular opportunity.…", "“I’m concerned about the closure motions because I think they limit legitimate debate. I recognize that a government ultimately might have the opportunity to close down a debate that’s been going on a very long period of time. But as I’ve indicated to the House in days gone by, the purpose of these debates is to canvass public opinion, to make the public aware of what is happening.", "“All of us have experienced the situation where we have encountered our constituents and they’ve said, ‘What is this particular bill all about?’ or ‘How did this bill get passed and I didn’t know anything about it?’ They are legitimate questions. One of the reasons is that the bills tend to get passed very rapidly in this House.", "“Sometimes there are hearings. There is going to be a bit of an opportunity for hearings in this case. I think there should probably be more time provided for that, but also I think it’s important to provide more time to discuss the amendments that might be brought forward by both the government and the opposition. If the hearings are going to be meaningful, if the hearings are going to be worthwhile, then I think it’s exceedingly important for there to be legitimate debate over the amendments that flow from those hearings. That’s what makes a bill stronger.", "“If we want the Parliament to work on a more or less consensus basis rather than a confrontational basis, it’s important for the government to be able to accept amendments from its own members who may have some good ideas or from members of the opposition.

While there may have been quarrels from time to time with what a Speaker indicated by way of ruling, there was a general consensus that one should accept that ruling and the House should proceed.”", "That was interesting. Back in that time, the Speaker had the discretion to allow debate to continue; and then the issue of time allocation came forward.", "In the speech he also used the word “henchman,” which was a word that I’m not sure—" ],

Now it’s up to seven or eight bills, so it was a bit of a moving target, which is a whole other issue that I’ll raise in a minute. We looked at it and said, “Okay, let us go back to our people, think about if we had to pick from these bills, which ones we really want to have some time on, to make sure we give the bill proper time to be dealt with in the House and in committee. We’ll come back and make some recommendations.”", "Well, we got back and we started sort of testing the waters and saying, “Okay, we understand the government wants to move these bills forward, but we need to have some time for public hearings—and public hearings doesn’t mean just here at Queen’s Park. It means going to Hamilton, it means going to northern Ontario, it means going to eastern Ontario and different places around this province, so that the public can be part of this process, because after all this is the people’s Parliament. This doesn’t belong to you and I as elected members. We’re only here as the people doing the work of the public that sent us here.”", "So we came forward with some suggestions about some of the travel that we would expect to see, and I don’t think it was really unreasonable what had been put forward, but it was an opening position. I guess you could say that the government may have thought that the opposition was asking too much. Maybe that was their position; I don’t know. But we never got to the second step. They never came back and said, “Well, you know what? On this particular bill, you’re asking for X number of days of public hearings and travels around Ontario. We’re not happy with that. We would like to cut it down to” whatever. We never got to the second step of the discussion. This from a Premier who says she wants to get in a conversation with Ontarians. God, she can’t even get in a conversation with us, in her own Legislature.", "So the government turns around and says, “Never mind. We’re going to time-allocate everything.” What was the point of asking us that in the first place if the government had no intention of working with the opposition and determining some sort of way of moving forward that allowed the government to get their bills but also gave an opportunity to give public scrutiny to those bills that were of most interest to Ontarians and to the opposition?" ],

Poppycock! This is a Parliament. Go back and read your history. It has been in development for almost 1,000 years, and the whole premise behind the parliamentary system is that the government gets to put forward legislation, and the opposition gets a chance to scrutinize, along with the public. And guess what? The government gets its way. We understand that. That’s how Parliament is run in this place, and it’s how it has run in England for millennia—or not millennia but for hundreds of years—because the British parliamentary system is based on, over the years, the development of a system where there is that compromise between always understanding that the executive must have its way and also understanding that there needs to be some scrutiny and that the opposition is there to scrutinize legislation and, yes, at times, to propose, as has been the case in every Parliament.

Everything is going to be truncated. We’re going to have a flawed bill. It will come back for third reading, and we’ll get two hours of debate, if we’re lucky, the time divided equally between the whole gang of us. Who really is being served in this scenario? Is it the government? Well, the government would say yes, because they get their agenda forward. But does it make for better legislation? I argue it does not.", "I will propose that for probably 80% of what’s on the order paper today, the opposition could agree on passage, on some sort of quick passage, where there would be less time spent on certain bills and more time spent on others, as is the case.

The government couldn’t, on their own, force legislation through the House, because there was no time allocation. As a result, there was a need for the government to sit down with the opposition and try to find a way forward.", "Here’s the biggest difference, and my colleague the House leader for the Conservative Party, from Leeds–Grenville, mentioned it in the speeches that Mr. Bradley made, and Mr. Bradley is 100% right. The power of this Legislature has moved from the floor of the House to the corner office of the Premier. That’s what has happened over the last number of years. Is that good? If you’re the Premier, it’s wonderful. You get all the power. You get to do what you want. It’s almost like government by fiat.

As the slogan says, “It’s in you to give.” I encourage every Ontarian who has the ability to go and do that. I thank the Canadian Blood Services and all of the volunteer groups that do that.", "At the end of the day, it’s very important that we have time to truly debate this and know that we’re looking to the future. We need to have ways to ensure that that blood supply is there when we need it. If it’s your loved one who is in that situation, I think we want to ensure that it’s there regardless of what is your principled decision on whether you believe in volunteer blood or paid.", "At the end of the day, what we can’t be doing on things like this—like Bill 10, the Child Care Modernization Act, or like Bill 8, the MPP Accountability and Transparency Act—is to stifle debate and not allow Ontarians to have a say. If you’re truly sincere on that side of the House, then bring these things forward. Allow us to travel the province when we need to. Have the true open debate. That way, we hear, which is what our job is: to listen to the people who put us in the House and enact the best legislation that will serve them to the best of our ability." ],

No way can I match the passion of the member from Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound or my colleague from Hamilton Mountain, who spoke so effectively about this bill.", "Before I get into the meat and potatoes of what I want to say, let me just give you a quotation, something I found from Walter Lippmann. When we’re talking about transparency, when we’re talking about the role of the opposition, Mr. Lippmann, way back in 1939, said, “The opposition is indispensable. A good statesman, like any sensible human being, always learns more from his” opponents “than from his fervent supporters.”", "That’s why I think the government should listen to the opposition more. They shouldn’t be trying to shut them down. They should be open, they should be transparent and they should be accountable. That’s why I believe that, instead of stifling debate, what the government should be doing is going around the province in committee, leading the way back into the ridings where the people suffered from a lack of the proper chemotherapy drugs.", "I know that it was discovered in Peterborough. I had more than 200 in my area, in Windsor-Essex. I believe there were more than 600 patients in London who got the diluted chemotherapy drugs. The government, if you want to be accountable, if you want to be transparent, should be in those communities, meeting face to face with the men and women and children who did not receive the drugs, the treatment, that they were supposed to be given.", "Speaker, I can imagine, if you’re told you have cancer, if you’re told you’re going to have to undergo this treatment, that you put your faith in the system, you put your faith in the doctors and you put your faith in your medication. Who knows what long-term effects you will suffer because your initial treatment was not what it was supposed to be?", "Just take the common cold, Speaker. If you’re supposed to “take two tablets and call me in the morning” but your two tablets are only a quarter of a tablet, you’re going to make more than one call in the morning. You don’t know, if you would have taken those initial two tablets, if your cold would have gotten better overnight. It’s much, much worse when you’re dealing with cancer and when you’re dealing with a diluted drug.", "Let’s change this focus a bit. Let’s have the government go out on the road, go out into those communities—don’t go to New Brunswick, Speaker. Let’s just keep it in Ontario, but we do know that a lot of people in New Brunswick were affected by this lack of the proper drug as well.", "I think that’s what this government should be doing. I think they should be held accountable, and they should be held accountable to the people who elected them, to the people across this great province. They shouldn’t be afraid. They shouldn’t be afraid to take this on the road. They shouldn’t be afraid to meet the people face to face and hear the stories—to hear from the people who were actually affected by getting drugs that were not what they were supposed to be. I just don’t get it. You want to silence the voice of the opposition. You want to limit your debate.", "I’ll give you another quotation, if I can, Speaker; this one from Harry S. Truman, back in 1950. He was addressing Congress, and he said:", "“Once a government is committed to the principle of silencing the voice of opposition, it has only one way to go, and that is down the path of increasingly repressive measures, until it becomes a source of terror to all its citizens and creates a country where everyone lives in fear.”", "I don’t want to live in fear in Ontario. I don’t want people in hospitals to live in fear. I don’t want the government to be afraid of facing up to the people who received drugs that were not what they were supposed to be. I think we have to be open. We have to be accountable. We have to face the music. We have to face the people whom our methods have affected. We went out to tender for a drug. We went to the lowest common bidder. We changed the way we used to do business, and they weren’t given the drugs they were supposed to receive, that they had been receiving before. And it was only because a couple of alert people working in the pharmacy at the hospital in Peterborough caught it, so only one person was affected in Peterborough. But by then, more than 1,000 people had received drugs that weren’t up to standard.", "Speaker, when you want to silence the voice of the opposition, when you want to time-allocate a bill, you’re silencing the voices of the people who did not get what they thought they were getting. They did not get what they pay for. And that is not right. Ontario’s health care system deserves better than that, the people in Ontario deserve better than that and, Speaker, the government deserves to treat the opposition and the people of Ontario better than this. This is not something they should be proud of. They want to be accountable, they want to be transparent, and yet they want to slam the door on debate. They want to slam the door on the people who wish to speak to them, who wish to bring their stories to the people who make the decisions.", "Speaker, I can’t support time allocation. I know the government wants to do it. I don’t understand it—the government that prides itself on being open, transparent, accountable at the right time. But I guess this is not the time: not the time for debate, not the time to be held accountable, and for that I say shame, shame, shame." ],

Last week, the finance minister, in his fall economic outlook, used the word “overachieved.” In the 11 years this government has been in power, they have doubled our debt. They spend more on debt servicing yearly than they do on the whole social services sector I am privileged to be the critic for. I’m not certain what definition of overachievement that meets. It certainly does not meet the overachievement expectations of the Conservative Party on this side of the House.", "They’ll talk today about how they built a strong and dynamic economy in Ontario. There are hundreds of thousands of people who wake up every morning without a job. Every day in my constituency office, people are coming in saying, “Bill, things are bleak. Things are grim. I need help.” We’ve lost 350,000 manufacturing jobs, a lot of that attributed to both their mismanagement and the high, high energy prices that have tripled under their tenure, and they’re talking about another doubling to tripling in the next four years.", "So I struggle at times, and I’m trying to be objective. I’m trying to give them a fair shake to turn things around, to bring a different approach. For my first two and a half years here, under Premier Dalton McGuinty, I saw them going down the track of saying, “We know. We’re going down this path.” They didn’t want to listen. They didn’t want to accept input from either the official opposition or the third party.", "In a minority Parliament, we were at least trying to hold their feet to the fire and make sure they made good decisions. Now they have the majority, under Premier Kathleen Wynne. I spoke just recently to another bill, the MPP accountability and transparency act, Bill 8, and they’re time-allocating. They time-allocated that piece of legislation, that bill.", "Again, they say one thing and do totally another.

The unemployment rate is 6.5%, which is way too high for the province historically. Again, I think my colleague from Leeds–Grenville used the analogy today that we used to be the engine of Confederation, then we became the caboose, and now we’re not even certain what the caboose is.", "What I think of when I think about how this government has led us to the economic demise we are in is that machine at the end of the railway track. I don’t know what it’s called, Mr. Speaker. Maybe Mr. Clark, with his background and family on the railroad would know, but it’s one of those things where there are two people and they’re going up and down.

I believe even in the great riding of Fergus there was a large factory, a 100-year-old factory that went out of business under the tenure of this Liberal government, partly, again, because of their mismanagement of the economy, the high energy rates, the red tape that they’ve created—and all the while wasting billions of dollars on boondoggles like the gas plant fiasco that has never produced nor will ever produce a single kilowatt of power; and Ornge, that absolute boondoggle of our health care system where, sadly, four people have died. We see those tragedies continuing. We have the eHealth boondoggle, another billion dollars that could be going to the front line, to our hospitals, to our schools, to those that need community services and need a hand up. It’s a sad day when they continually come into this House and again say, “We are the masters of the economy.” The bar is pretty low.", "In my riding in the last number of years we’ve lost a thousand jobs—in London, 30,000 jobs since 2008. Half a million people remain unemployed today and half a million children live in poverty in today’s Ontario—half a million. That’s simply unacceptable when we see the continued waste of dollars and resources by this government—and no change, might I add. I don’t see a difference of approach from this government since I’ve been here in my three years. Under new leadership with Premier Wynne, it’s the exact same. There are some new people in the front rows and a few in the second row who I think are trying to make some change, but at the end of the day I don’t see anything significantly changing under this government’s leadership.", "This is no achievement; in fact, it’s colossal mismanagement and continues to be. After 11 years of mismanagement that ushered in thousands of new regulations, red tape that—again, small businesses, medium businesses, large businesses are saying to me, “Bill, I’m drowning in it. I’m spending more time doing paperwork and shuffling paper for the government’s needs than I am spending time with my clients, with my customers, or even with my own people to give them better training and more safety opportunities.”", "The Liberal government wants to unburden the Ontario public and businesses by setting up a so-called Burden Reduction Reporting Act. I’m not certain how many more studies this government can do. I’m not certain how many more high-paid consultants they’re going to hire.", "Again, when I first arrived they had hired Don Drummond, the TD economist, a renowned economist, their choice. They had that whole report put in front of them. At the end of the day, they were going to be proud and say, “We’ve implemented the bulk of those recommendations.” Well, all the minor stuff out on the edges—they’ve tweaked at the edges, but none of the significant, none of the really true, strong decisions that have to be made to move us forward have actually been implemented from that study. I’m fearful that the Burden Reduction Reporting Act—they should at least be stepping back, saying, “Why do we need a Burden Reduction Reporting Act?” if not for their failure to have a very streamlined process that allows people to get to work.", "Firstly, it’s ironic that this bill is coming from a party that, up until the year 2012, would not even acknowledge red tape was a serious problem in Ontario. But irony aside, I think it’s about time to eliminate unnecessary government burdens, especially the outrageous ones. Again, I’m going to cite some examples because I believe the people really need to see that we’re putting a thought process into this, and we want to be an opposition that truly holds them accountable and holds them to transparency, which they strongly suggest they want to do, despite—once again reminding the public—that they’ve time-allocated that very bill that they’re introducing into this House.", "Just as an example, and I spoke about this specific example last month in response to the government’s announcement to redevelop long-term-care beds, an investigation into Ontario’s LTC, long-term care, found that “there are as many as 160 distinct steps, including accessing nine separate databases, just to move a senior from hospital into a long-term-care bed in Ontario.” Mr. Speaker, 160 steps: Someone in that state who needs health care, and we’re putting them through 160—just think of it, not only for the patient but the family of that patient, having to go through that type of bureaucracy and burden to move a loved one from one facility to another. There’s no way anyone, I don’t think, even on that side of the House, can stand here and proudly say that they’re proud of that and they support that there needs to be a 160-step process to move someone from a facility to another.", "“Bureaucracy is such an obstruction that consultants to industry in the US … are being retained to help streamline the process of moving seniors into Ontario nursing homes.” Again, we’re hiring people from the United States. God love our cousins to the south, but I’d rather see that money going to the front line. I’d like to see that money going to the actual patients who are coming through my office saying, “I can’t find a bed. I have no ability to get my loved one the services they need.” They’re actually cutting back on home care services in some cases. Again, they’re spending money on a consultant from the US and we’re telling our constituents, “Sorry, but there’s no more service for you because there’s not enough money from this government.”", "Unfortunately, such bizarre facts are not limited to the long-term-care situation. Government or regulatory burden is widespread and costs over $11 billion in lost productivity annually. If you took that $11 billion in lost productivity that we could be putting through our economy, helping those people at the front lines, providing much-needed jobs, providing health care, providing education, providing those in community services and special needs with the service they need—$11 billion there. Then take the $10.5 billion this government spends on interest payments on the debt that they, and only they, have amassed. Think of that. That’s $21 billion—billion, with a B—that could be going to the front line to help those people wanting a job, to help those seniors who need help.", "They are now saying you are going to get less home care in some places. We’re going to go to the Alzheimer Society. In my riding, I just met with the executive director, Deborah Barker, a couple of weeks ago about this very specific fact. They’re stretched to the max. They’re already picking up a lot of other burdens, and this government just callously says, “We’ll cut back, but you just go out to another group like Alzheimer’s and dementia, and get your help there.” Well, they are breaking at the seams and can’t keep up as it is. So how do we just download that; take it off our accountability and put it onto someone else? That’s not acceptable from any government, and specifically not from this Liberal government.", "I especially look forward to seeing how this government reduces and/or streamlines the regulation burdens on farmers, who sadly are fed with red tape. Again, farmers in my riding, those who have had generations and generations, are bringing their concerns to me and telling me, “Bill, I don’t know how much more we can do in regard to red tape. I never have time to be on the land. I never have time to be on my tractor. I don’t have time to actually teach the next generation because I’m spending so much time filling out paperwork that, in the end, does nothing but burden me more and take me away from what I love to do.”", "The Ontario Federation of Agriculture gave both Premiers McGuinty and Wynne specific recommendations with regard to reducing the regulatory burden on farmers. The first and foremost recommendation was to involve the agriculture and agri-food sector in the regulatory development process. What a novel idea: going to the grassroots, going to the people at the very forefront of any industry and saying, “How can we do it better? What can we eliminate that is slowing you down, taking your eye off the ball, and not allowing you to be as productive and creative and innovative as you can be?”", "Why would we not go there? That was a pretty fundamental thing. You would have thought they would be ahead of that. They should, as a government, have already been there. You shouldn’t have even had to have that recommendation made to you, but they did, and yet they still haven’t really implemented the ability. Again, they’re stifling debate on various bills in this House so that we cannot go out to Ontarians, the stakeholders who truly can impact the system, and allow them to have their say, to give us their expertise and wisdom so we can create the best processes that we can.", "They’ve also called on the Liberal government to engage in a regulatory impact analysis. They told you that legislation like Bill 6, the Great Lakes Protection Act, is unnecessary, as existing statutes address the concerns you are claiming to address in this new bill. Nevertheless, you went ahead and introduced it. That’s one that, again, I watch fairly closely. Of course, my great riding of Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound is surrounded by the Great Lakes; they have a huge impact on all of us. The Great Lakes impact all of us, but that buzzword, “how would you not want to protect,” just goes to show that they’ll use that headline and cover it up with the details later on; there’s really no benefit. Why are we creating new agencies, new unelected bodies that are going to govern something as important as the Great Lakes? I will stand here whenever I can and ensure that we go back to the grassroots, that we have the stakeholders in the room on any issue, so we’re getting the best front-line thought process, experience and successes we can to ensure that we have the best legislation possible.", "As such, I think it’s key that the government define the word “burden,” instead of leaving its interpretation to the personal whim of whoever is the minister of the day. Again, we get caught up in wordsmithing here and using acronyms. What we really need is just frank, open, honest discussion. We need to ensure that we’re all in this room coming together to ensure that we develop the best legislation, the best regulation, that respects the front lines, that respects the experts in any of their fields, regardless of whether it’s agriculture, the nuclear industry, small business, child care, health care or education—it doesn’t really matter. We need the people who truly are at the front lines and know their game the best.", "It really would be helpful at times in this House if we could just get past some of the spin and rhetoric and truly open up. You can’t say “accountability” and “transparency”—I’m going to go on about this again today whenever I can. It just smacks of—I won’t say it—saying one thing and doing the absolute opposite. You can’t bring a bill on MPP accountability and transparency and shut down debate to slam it through the way you want it. If you want transparency and accountability, you have to open it up to everyone to have their say. You have to have a proper process so that the people out there agree and understand and feel they’ve actually had the time to input and give you the thought process and shape that bill to be the best that it can be.", "Mr. Speaker, I could talk about that all day long, and to some people, it seems like maybe I have. I’m going to move on.", "The second part of this bill deals with job creation, another sore spot for this party and this Liberal government after 11 years of mismanagement and poor calculation and, at times, just truly leading the public astray in regard to what they’ve said they’re going to do and, at the end of the day, what they end up implementing.", "They want to design, plan and organize geographic economies or so-called business clusters in different communities. At the end of the day, we need to ensure that a government is looking at all geographic regions with the ability to thrive and survive. A lot of what I’ve seen in my three years is very punitive to rural and northern Ontario.", "I introduced the transportation bill for rural and northern Ontario. It received unanimous consent from all three parties. That resolution received it the same day I presented it, and to this day they have not called one single meeting to even discuss that.", "We need those types of issues to be brought, for all three parties to discuss and find creative and innovative ways to implement solutions.", "This bill gives the government the mandate to plan and consult as well as amend and revoke economic planning. Personally, I feel insecure about any bill that compels us to trust the Liberal government to organize our local economies. I stand on fact: the absolute worst debt and deficit records in our provincial history. In 10 to 11 years, they have actually doubled the debt that took the rest of the governments of our proud history in the province of Ontario to accumulate. Sadly, what we saw in the last budget, which is why I voted against it, and in the budget before that, which I voted against, is that they’re continuing to overspend.", "We have to have the ability to live within our means. If not, we’re putting that debt on those great pages sitting in front of you. I come to this House every day because of my two sons, Zach and Ben, who are 17 and 20, and my nephews and my nieces, and friends of my family who have children that age who are in college, who are in university, who are in public school and high school, so that we have an opportunity for them to thrive and to want to be proud to stay in Ontario, and not jump on a bus and head to the west, not head down to the States, Mr. Speaker. Sadly, that’s what is really happening today as we speak.", "It was interesting earlier today in question period, the way the Liberals handled some of the questions. The reason why we have so many of our classrooms empty is because there are so many families leaving this great province, because it’s more prosperous in other provinces. Then they try to turn it on us and say, “Don’t downplay Ontario. Don’t talk down about Ontario.”", "Well, you know what? The reality is, if we weren’t standing here for Ontario, that exodus would be even faster. We want to turn this great province around. We want to ensure that we have the ability for the next generation to have the great lifestyle that I’ve certainly enjoyed as a result of those who went before me.", "The fact is, this government doesn’t actually know how to create jobs without paying cash for them. Again, you can’t continue to bribe and to tell people that we’re going to pay for something when all you’re doing is moving that debt forward a number of years. Again, as I said earlier today, $21,000 is what every single child born into this province of Ontario is indebted, the day that they are brought into this great province and this great world—unfathomable.", "Ontario has given 109 companies $800 million over eight years and created only 30,000 jobs. That may sound like a big number, but put that per job, Mr. Speaker. We’re the only jurisdiction, probably in the world, that pays upwards of $140,000 per job that never seems to last. We’ve had examples, and I can’t think of any off the top of my head right now, but there have been a number where they’ve handed out money to a very specific industry, only to find that that industry has left Ontario—no accountability, no recourse to have to pay that money back. They’re gone, and the money is gone with them. The jobs that they proposed never ever actually found their way to stay in Ontario as permanent jobs.", "The green energy sector, again with the wind turbines—they promoted 60,000 full-time jobs, I think it was going to be. I’d like them to stand in this House, just one of them, and give me the absolute black-and-white facts of where those 60,000 permanent jobs are. I just don’t believe it. I don’t think it’s there.", "Again, the 30-second sound bite: People just drive by it and, at the end of the day, take it at their word. We’re telling you, Mr. Speaker, there are a lot of those examples where they’ve said one thing and done another, and the action just doesn’t stand behind them.", "We have to support our small businesses. In Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound, we’ve lost small businesses on the Liberal watch, specifically abattoirs. We lost 50% of them because of the regulatory burden that they refuse to fix.", "They continually cut: $500 million in cuts to education are a direct threat to rural schools, many of which they’re targeting for closure, just as they targeted the Bluewater technology centre, which closed a few years ago. In my great riding, you take a school out of a small rural community—that’s the fabric of the community. That’s the heartbeat. That’s the jobs. That’s the factory. That’s the start of a downward spiral. You can use rhetoric like, “They’re half empty.” That’s because we’re not doing things in the Liberal government to ensure that we have a thriving economy so people want to remain in rural Ontario.", "I could go on and on—20 minutes certainly isn’t nearly enough for me to get into a topic of this magnitude. But I’d like to just suggest that we need to ensure that we always have the ability for government to set high bars. When you’ve doubled the debt and doubled the deficit in 11 years and you continue to dig and overspend—to dig that hole of deficit that these young children are going to actually, at some point not too far down the road, have to come up with, that’s a sad day. I’ll continue to stand in this House and fight to ensure that we get back to balanced budgets.", "I challenged last week and I’ll challenge again: If you don’t balance the budget by 2017-18 like you said you will, in the spirit of accountability and transparency, I would ask each of you to stand up that day and resign." ],

It’s got two schedules to it: a very easy bill to understand. It requires the minister to publish an annual report on the action that the government has undertaken to reduce unnecessary government burdens and regulations.", "I think all parties, at some point in their life as a government, have decided that it’s time to review the impositions we sometimes place or the impositions that can build up over time on the businesses that form part of our wonderful economy. That’s what schedule 1 does. It makes sense. I think it’s a sensible way to move forward.", "Schedule 2 supports the development of cluster growth. That is really something that I think is pretty exciting. Ontario already is doing very well in that regard. We rank number two in all of North America in the number of information, communications and technology clusters. That’s led by clusters in this area here, in the GTA, but also in the great ridings of Kitchener–Waterloo and up in the Ottawa area. When you look at us financially, Toronto ranks third in North America and 11th in the entire world when it comes to our competitiveness ratings for global financial centres.", "There’s a lot in this bill, Speaker. It’s the sort of bill we need to do. It’s not about what we regulate; it’s about how the regulations are actually brought into action. We understand the critical importance of cluster development, and, as the Toronto board of trade puts it very clearly, clusters collaborate, so our economy can compete.", "We need to pass this bill, Speaker.

  "text" : [ "This particular bill is much ado about nothing. What is interesting is, everything that is contained in this bill—in the two schedules of the bill—the government already has the right to do, which raises the question: Why is the government bringing this to the Legislature to demand legislative time that could be used on other bills that they say are supposedly important? I think the reason is pretty simple: They’re trying to send a signal to those people out there who are interested in less red tape, trying to make it look as if they’re doing something, but in fact are not doing a heck of a lot that they can’t do already.", "The bill essentially mandates that the government should write a report about what they’ve done to reduce red tape on an annual basis, but at the same time in schedule 1 of the bill they’re giving themselves the ability to decide when it’s going to be printed, should it be printed, or should it not be printed and not have a reporting date whatsoever. Let’s say the first report gets printed and they don’t like what it was and they got bad press. They, by regulation, can undo the whole thing and say, “We’re not doing it anymore.” This is kind of laughable because the government says it’s trying to be transparent, but in fact schedule 1 of the bill allows them an escape clause if they don’t like the report that has been written on the issue of red tape.", "On the issue of clustering—my God, Speaker, as if government never looked at industries in a cluster when it comes to doing things. You look at the mining sector, the forestry sector, the pharmaceutical or automotive sectors, we’ve been doing that for years. Again, there’s nothing here that cannot be done, that cabinet doesn’t already have the power to do. All of the legislation the government drafts, they’ve delegated the authority to cabinet to do what the heck they want. So this bill, at the end of the day, is not going to do much to hurt anybody, but I would say that this is more an exercise in communications than it ever is an exercise in actually getting something done." ],

Even the odd cuss word comes out, but then he retracts that and usually says so.", "Mr. Speaker, what we really need in this House, if they truly want to have a jobs and growth act, is that they need to actually get some control around the energy rates. We have the highest energy rates in North America. It’s driving small business, large business, big business—anyone—out of the province at record speeds. We can’t have that. We can’t continue to have the highest rates and expect we’re going to attract and retain businesses in Ontario.", "Training and apprenticeship: We’ve called again for apprenticeship.

They don’t even have to table it.

It was all introduced, I believe, by the Minister of Economic Development, Employment and Infrastructure way back on July 7, during that wonderful summer sitting we all so very much enjoyed.", "I thought long and hard about this bill, all six pages of it, Speaker, and I had a brief chance to review what some of the members have said about this bill in the debate leading up to my time here this afternoon. Listening to the members here this afternoon, I tried to understand what impact this bill would have on the businesses in my great riding of Windsor–Tecumseh and of course on the corporations that we have there, the big ones. I want to tell you a tale. It’s not a tale about two cities, although I suppose I could start with the words of Mr. Dickens: “It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness....” But that was 1775 and not today, 240 years later, in Ontario.", "Let me tell you not a tale of two cities but of two neighbouring jurisdictions: Ontario and the state of Michigan. Both jurisdictions are heavily involved in the automotive industry. Reporters and other editorials at my home newspaper, the Windsor Star, spend a great deal of their time writing about the automotive industry. As you know, what you read on a daily basis can shape your opinion, especially of course around election time. So when we discuss the six-page proposed Bill 7, when we discuss partnerships and jobs and growth, let’s spend a little more focus on automotive jobs and the growth potential of the automotive industry.", "Here’s what Michigan has done to preserve, protect and grow its automotive industry. Anne Jarvis, in a front-page story in the Windsor Star about a week and a half ago, says that Michigan is serious about the automotive industry. The governor, Rick Snyder, created an Automotive Industry Office. He appointed a very experienced automotive specialist, a special adviser, and the governor gets a monthly briefing from the special advisor on the automotive industry. Michigan, unlike Ontario, has developed a 30-year plan that capitalizes on emerging trends in vehicle design, technology and materials. It tracks drivers and the changing demographics of drivers.", "The results—and these are the results that speak to the aspirations, if you will, of Bill 7: Michigan, in the past four years, has attracted one quarter of all automotive investment in North America. One quarter of every dollar that has been invested in North America’s automotive industry has gone to the state of Michigan.", "Speaker, I’m embarrassed to tell you this, but right now, Michigan assembles more vehicles than Ontario—sad but true. When Michigan saw themselves losing automotive production, losing investment, according to Tony Faria, a good friend of mine who works at the University of Windsor—he’s an expert in the field; he’s the co-director of the office of automotive vehicle research at the University of Windsor—Michigan drew a line in the sand. Mr. Faria says they didn’t want to lose more production and investment. They fought to bring investment back. Talk about a success story.", "There was a Chrysler plant in Sterling Heights that was slated to close. Instead, $1 billion was invested. General Motors: Nearly half a billion dollars went their way, opening the possibility of a second shift at one of the plants. Michigan stamping plants benefited, plus R&D and a lightweight materials research centre.", "Bill 7 can make these examples a reality in Ontario if the will is there. We can have the best of times again if we use our wisdom and don’t follow a foolish path to nowhere. I know the minister will tell us that he has a plan, that the government has invested $800 million in Ontario’s automotive industry over the past 11 years. I know that the federal government has ponied up money as well.", "Let me digress for a moment. In this morning’s Globe and Mail there’s an article by Barrie McKenna. He writes about one of the federal funds that we’re talking about here. This is a fund from Ottawa’s budget of a year ago, 2013. There was $200 million set aside in the 2013 budget to spark innovation in Ontario’s hard-hit manufacturing sector. That’s a “best of times” kind of an announcement. But here’s the “worst of times” kind of thing about that fund: From that budget in 2013, Mr. McKenna tells us, “18 months later Ottawa has yet to approve a single project from its Advanced Manufacturing Fund.” That was revealed after the NDP industry critic, Peggy Nash, put forward a written question to see what the government was doing with our money.", "There’s no wisdom in that kind of government fund, but a lot of foolishness, if you want to ask me about it. Here’s a fund, Speaker, intended to pay for large-scale transformative manufacturing activities as well as to encourage commercialization and to spur the adoption of cutting-edge technology. Some parties can talk a good game, make a headline or two, but never spend the money for what it was intended, or delay spending the money that was budgeted. Do you think the industry doesn’t notice? Of course the industry notices when that sort of thing happens. You put the money in the budget but you never release it.", "Getting back to what I was saying about the better plans in Michigan, neither Ontario nor Ottawa have recouped anything close to what Michigan has. The sad part of it all is that the experts, the automotive analysts, say that Ontario is being left behind. That’s why this bill is so important. This bill can be a game-changer with the right improvements. It is essential that we recognize, no matter what side of the House we’re on today, that around the globe—and the auto industry is truly a global industry—auto assembly investment rose more than 9% to $17.6 billion last year, but Canada didn’t reap any of that investment, any of it.", "I expect the minister will assure us that just recently, he and the Premier announced $86 million, or 10% of the new money planned for the Honda plant in Alliston. To that I say thank you from this side of the House; thank you for that money in Alliston. But while that secures the future of that plant and the existing jobs in Alliston—and that is important; don’t get me wrong—it doesn’t grow the industry.", "Bill 7 talks about partnerships for jobs and growth. Speaker, a short history lesson: Last spring, Chrysler Canada was in discussions with the government about growth at the Windsor assembly plant. You remember that; I’m sure you do. We all do. The former leader of the Conservative Party made headlines when he called any provincial investment at the Windsor plant “corporate welfare.” That prompted Chrysler’s Sergio Marchionne to walk away from those discussions, saying they had become a political football and he wanted no part of it.", "The scary thing about that experience is the warning of Mr. Marchionne, who, by the way, is one of the most highly regarded, respected visionaries in the automotive industry today. In walking away from those discussions about the provincial partnership with the long-term growth plan for the Windsor assembly plant, Mr. Marchionne said Ontario and Canada have to decide if they want to be part of the global auto industry in the future. He said—these are his words, words to heed, words to take to heart—that we, the Ontario government and the feds in Ottawa, don’t appear to be working hard to attract investment.", "I find that a very scary indictment, Speaker. We have a short-term investment plan for the Windsor assembly plant, but because of the way that deal was bungled, there is no long-term plan, no 30-year plan like they have in Michigan. That should scare us all.", "The Michigan plan created a one-stop office to cut the red tape, to assist industry investors to navigate the myriad of government agencies and regulators. It established another Michigan priority: expanding the skilled trades base through education and training, so that when the new plants relocate to Michigan, the skilled talent is there to fill the jobs.", "This was a really good article by Anne Jarvis. I think the ministry staff should check it out if they haven’t already done so.", "I know that some skeptics on the other side may well say, “We can’t compete with jurisdictions, especially those in Mexico and some of the southern states, because of the incentives they throw at the feet of industry decision-makers.” But Ontario and Michigan have other attributes, other advantages: having the right talent, the skilled workforce, the engineers; having the right supply chain; being geographically located. These are all highly rated, as well as what could be improved in this bill.", "The minister has the ability. His hand is on the button. He can press that button. He can improve this bill. He can save the Ontario automotive industry. Instead of sitting on that button, he can get off his button and make amendments to Bill 7 and get Ontario’s automotive industry back on track. Indeed, Ontario’s manufacturing industry can be put back on the rails.", "We need a real policy, a made-in-Ontario automotive strategy. We need a made-in-Canada automotive policy, but if Ottawa won’t lead, then Ottawa should follow or get out of the way and let Ontario take over. Let Ontario restore to greatness our manufacturing industry, our automotive industry. It’s within this bill to make that happen if, and only if, the Liberal government will follow Michigan’s example and get serious about a 30-year plan. The government can say they have a plan. The minister can tell us again about his dedicated automotive unit and about its staff dedicated to attracting foreign investments, about the $2.5-billion Jobs and Prosperity Fund and the southwest development fund. But, Speaker, where are the jobs? Where’s the future growth? And where are the results—the determination?", "Mr. Marchionne doesn’t think much of what Ontario brings to the table, what Canada brings to the table. This is a global industry. We need visionaries. We need people to think outside of the box. In an editorial on November 15, the Windsor Star concluded, “Whatever fuzzy, inarticulated game plan Ottawa and Queen’s Park claim to have isn’t working. Just ask Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne, who basically said our country lacked an understanding and sophistication when it came to the global auto sector in the 21st century. Either get in the game or get lost. And rightly so.” That editorial went on to suggest that we should follow Michigan’s example and hire an auto czar, someone with personality and energy who knows the industry and can work the room.", "It needs to draft legislation that gets more people trained in the skilled trades that are required or will be required in the future. It needs to do more on the supply side of the automotive question. Bill 7 doesn’t do that.", "Let’s do more. Let’s dream bigger, or higher. Let’s work together to improve this legislation. It is a good start. It will certainly be supported on this side of the House, but let’s be more creative. Our taxpayers deserve nothing less. We have to do more to secure a better future for our manufacturing industry and the people who work in those fields. These are good, well-paying jobs, the kind we need to protect and preserve, and to grow, to give us hope for a better future, to set the bar higher for the next generation. We can’t sit back and allow our manufacturing base to slip away piece by piece, plant by plant, cluster by cluster.", "This bill speaks to the development of clusters. But without more planning, without a long-term strategy, this could be cluster’s last stand." ],

We need to formulate a legislative policy that protects what we have, that attracts the attention of the industry decision-makers and that convinces them, “Yes, indeed, Ontario has turned the corner.”", "We wish to be a player.

We need to stand on the rooftops and make our voices heard: Ontario gets it—finally. We will bring forth the incentives. We will secure the jobs. We will invest in Ontario’s future.

We will show those around the globe that have been winning the competitions up till now that the gloves are off, it’s game on in Ontario, and we’re in it to win it. The bill speaks to the beginning of that, Speaker, but it doesn’t go far enough.", "We can’t deny that talking about reducing red tape for business is a good thing, and developing clusters, as I’ve mentioned. But I will say—and hopefully the government is listening—that once this bill makes its way to the legislative committee process, the bill should be fully discussed in more detail and proper consultations should be held around the province in the various regions, in the manufacturing regions.", "We should have committee hearings in Windsor, in London, in St. Thomas, in St. Catharines, in Oshawa. We should have them across the province. If this bill is going to have the effect on business that the government thinks it will, then I say we should be taking feedback from those who live and breathe the world of business every day.", "I hope the government is prepared to have a proper consultation period, not like the time-allocated consultation that has been happening to some of the other bills in this session of Parliament.", "I’m not a business person, but I’ve dealt directly with business people for a long, long time and I listen to what they have to say. They say that there’s a lot of red tape that can be cut, a lot of process that can be trimmed. I think that the people who put those kinds of hours into their business deserve to be listened to, and to do that, you have to get away from Queen’s Park, out of this bubble, and go listen to what people in Ontario are saying.", "Speaker, just as I wrap up, I want to thank you again for listening. I thank the voters in my riding of Windsor–Tecumseh for sending me here to bring their voice to this floor, and I hope today that voice has been heard." ],

The first one talks about the need to be able to diminish the regulatory burden. Well, as we all know, the government already has the ability to do that. Government is the one who makes regulations at cabinet. That authority has been delegated to cabinet by this Legislature. So the government can change any regulation it wants, because they’re the ones who drafted the regulation and they can be the ones who un-draft the regulation or get rid of it or amend it.", "As for the issue of clusters, nobody disagrees—and I think the member from Windsor–Tecumseh makes a good point—that we need to have a very strong approach to how we deal with various sectors of our economy and various geographic areas of our province, to be able to stimulate growth and get the investment we need to create the jobs that are necessary in our economies.", "But tell me what in this bill the government doesn’t already have the ability to do. The government has been there, what, for 12 years? They’ve allowed how many closures of how many car plants in southern Ontario, how many saw mills, how many paper mills, how many pulp mills? How many of everything has shut down? And the government, all that time, has had the authority to do what’s in this bill, yet all those places have shut down.", "So why does the government come into this House with this bill, if nothing other than they want to be able to have a communication exercise to say, “Listen, I’m doing something for you”?

However, on behalf of the residents of Dufferin–Caledon, I’m pleased to participate in this debate.", "I was scanning the explanatory notes and the schedules in Bill 7. There are two schedules in Bill 7. I have to say, Speaker, not to be rude, but there’s an awful lot of wiggle room in this bill. I call them “wiggle words.” When I ask my daughter to clean up her bedroom, I don’t say that I would consider it advisable; I say, “Thou shalt.” There are a lot of words like “if” this act requires; the minister “may” consider it advisable; “if” the plan is continued; and “if” the minister prepares a plan. I particularly like this one in schedule 2, where it talks about subsequent reviews of the plan:", "“If a plan is continued, the minister shall, on or before the fifth anniversary of the day that the report stating that the plan is being continued is made public, conduct a review of the plan for the purpose of evaluating whether the objectives and intended outcomes of the plan have been achieved by,", "“(a) consulting with persons or entities who have an interest in the development of the cluster.”", "I have to say, on the day that we have just debated yet another closure motion on yet another all-important piece of government legislation, it’s a bit rich to be talking about “they must consult.”", "This Bill 7 has got some interesting words, very little action and very little meat, for lack of a better word. Bill 7 is supposed to talk about the Better Business Climate Act. How appropriate that we’re doing this today, because earlier today I met with the Ontario Real Estate Association, and as our meeting was concluding, David Grime and Jenny Anderson—thank you very much for driving all the way from Dufferin to have a meeting with me here at Queen’s Park—talked about what they need to see from their government to make Ontario better and to make their industry thrive. We got to talking about the value and the importance of jobs and industry.", "On the one hand, it’s nice that the government has brought forward a bill. It is just very unfortunate that there is not a lot of meat in it. The success of our economy is tied to that success. We all remember the disastrous global economic recession that occurred not too long ago. Countries that believed they wouldn’t be touched by the recession were hit harder than expected. Ontario, of course, was hit hard and I would suggest to you is still recovering. Ontario’s economy went into a recession and has since then never been able to rekindle its past productivity.", "Our federal government counterpart has done a good job in protecting our country’s economy. That is why they will balance the budget, and have a surplus, I might add. This government has not done enough to promote our province’s economy. Rather, I believe they’ve made it worse. The policies of this government have decimated Ontario’s manufacturing jobs. Over the last decade, the province lost 300,000 manufacturing jobs. My own riding of Dufferin–Caledon has been adversely affected by the rising energy rates in our province. A company in my riding notified me earlier this fall that their energy bill for one month—one month—came to a total of $37,802.41. That’s absurd. Only under this government’s watch would we have the highest energy rates in all of North America. If we don’t understand that high energy costs impact businesses’ ability to thrive and to choose where they want to do business, then we’re not paying attention.", "Let’s put that into perspective for a moment. Back in 2003, Ontario’s energy rates were 4.3 cents per kilowatt hour. Now it’s more than 15 cents per kilowatt hour on average. In addition, the average price paid by large industrial power users is 4.8 cents in Montreal, 5.45 cents in Chicago and 8.12 cents in Detroit.", "Part of having a competitive business climate includes having competitive energy prices. The two must go hand in hand. You cannot expect a company to thrive if they are paying exorbitant energy costs and their competition pays a quarter of that on their energy. Unfortunately, this government has not come to that realization. That’s why this government has said energy rates will continue to rise for the foreseeable future.", "Speaker, I’d like to discuss the purpose of Bill 7. Bill 7 was brought forward to help improve Ontario’s economy through the reduction of red tape and through the development of geographic economic clusters. I will speak about the second portion of the bill soon enough.", "This government loves to boast that they like to eliminate regulatory burdens. The fact of the matter is they’re not doing a very good job. Government red tape is one of the primary causes for the destruction of Ontario’s manufacturing sector and for the overall stagnation of the province’s economy. The Canadian Federation of Independent Business estimates that government red tape costs Ontario businesses $11 billion a year. This is a staggering amount. That’s time and money that could be spent on small, medium-sized and large businesses hiring more employees, branching out to new sectors and helping spur innovation. Instead, what employees are spending their time on is filling out yet more government paperwork.", "The CFIB also noted that government red tape is the second-largest concern for businesses. Too often, we’ve heard story after story of companies leaving Ontario because the business climate is no longer sustainable under this government’s watch. What is even sadder is the fact that many workers who have lost their jobs when companies have either gone bankrupt or left are now moving from this province to others like Alberta, where their business climate is welcoming to industry.", "This government has no credible solution to stimulating job growth and attracting new business investments. In the past eight years, this government has spent more than three quarters of a billion dollars in the name of job creation. In this year’s budget, the government introduced the creation of a $2.5-billion Jobs and Prosperity Fund. Will it make a difference? This government thinks picking and choosing winner-and-loser companies will make them want to do business in Ontario.", "But there’s no logic to this. This government continues to live in a fairy tale. They believe continuous spending will result in economic job stimulation. Just look at what we heard from the Auditor General recently in her study of the reopening of teachers’ contracts. It mentioned that we spent half a billion dollars to solve one issue. Where did that money come from? That came out of a tax system that is already overburdened.", "This government doesn’t even pretend to balance the budget. Just look at last week’s fall economic statement. This government’s revenue projections were completely wrong. They missed the mark by half a billion dollars. As a result, they lowered the revenue projections for the next three years compared to what they initially said in this summer’s budget, which was only three months ago.", "Based on this government’s own calculations, the province’s GDP growth has stagnated and will remain at 2.4% for the next three years, yet this government continues to tell us they’ll be able to balance the budget by 2017-18, even though they’ve missed every deadline so far.", "The government also claims that the economic outlook is improving, but Ontario’s fiscal outlook is worse than it was 12 months ago, with larger deficits expected over the next two years compared to the projections in the 2013 fall economic statement. In fact, the government’s economic projections for this year and every year through 2017 have been lowered from those in the 2014 budget passed just four months ago.", "The Bank of Canada, the Conference Board of Canada and the Ontario Chamber of Commerce have all provided evidence that the government’s path is unsustainable. The chamber’s recent report concluded that Ontario will not grow its way out of debt, but I ask this government: How will they balance the budget when revenue projections continue to go down? The answer? Pretty simple: They intend to increase taxes.", "In the fall economic statement, they said that “should economic conditions persist that result in the province’s revenue outlook falling further below the 2014 budget projection, the government will consider other tools, as necessary.” This government loves using phrases like “other tools” as a euphemism for taxes.", "This government does not have a grasp on the everyday life of Ontario residents. The average Ontarian cannot afford any more tax increases. They already have to pay for our province’s debt and high energy costs. The total cost of servicing the debt, paying the interest, was $12.6 billion. This is the third-highest expense behind health care and education. Ontario’s debt is larger than the debt of all of the other provinces combined. What is also interesting is even while admitting to considering increasing taxes, they also claim, “This would be done while continuing to make critical investments in the programs and services that people depend on, such as health and education.” I don’t think that’s happening, Speaker.", "Numerous CCACs and hospitals are reporting operating deficits across the province. This has led to cuts at the Erie St. Clair CCAC, the closing of the Leamington obstetrics unit, poor service at the Champlain CCAC and the layoff of 40 workers at Timmins and District Hospital.", "The president of the Ontario Nurses’ Association has said that the government has laid off 1,600 nurses in the past number of years. What’s ironic—no, it’s not ironic; it’s frustrating—is that executives at CCACs have experienced salary raises. Earlier this month, I questioned the Minister of Health and Long-Term Care on the Central West CCAC’s decision to limit the number of new patients it helps due to its supposed lack of funds while their CEO was given a $24,000 increase on her salary in 2013, which brings her salary to $267,333.47 a year. But they can’t provide service.", "This government wants to talk about improving health care. Well, a good start would be to prioritize front-line care over executive compensation at the CCAC. We shouldn’t be increasing executive salaries at CCACs when people like my 87-year-old constituent, who suffered a severe heart attack, was refused access to a personal care support worker. Instead, his daughter was expected to care for him. But she, too, has physical ailments that limit her capacity to care for her dad. There are many more cases like this that I hear about in Dufferin–Caledon.", "Health care should not be about giving out hefty raises to bureaucrats. It is about funding front-line care that all Ontarians deserve. That is why front-line health care should be the number one priority of CCACs. My constituents expect their tax dollars to go to services that matter most to them, and if they only knew that their hard-earned money is going toward executive bureaucratic salaries instead of front-line care, they’d get very angry. This government can continue to claim they will make investments in health care, but we all know that’s not true at the front line.", "I also want to mention this government’s hypocrisy when they say they will make investments in education. We just found out that this government plans to cut half a billion dollars—" ],

My apologies.", "However, that doesn’t take away from the facts, and the facts are that this government plans to cut half a billion dollars from education funding. This will inevitably mean school closures—school closures in areas where you would need to travel longer distances to get to the next school. We would be putting an unnecessary burden on our system and on our parents to transport their children to further schools because their government decided to close the local school. Once again, Speaker, this government can continue to claim they will make investments into essential services, but we all know that has proven not to be the case.", "This government believes they will be able to find $700 million by tackling the province’s underground economy. It sounds like a good idea. They boast about tackling contraband tobacco and tax avoiders, but the fact of the matter is, they can’t even track individuals who are released on bail and have already broken the law. I asked the Attorney General if they tracked those released on bail. Unfortunately, her answer was no. How can this government expect to get their finances in order when they can’t even track the criminals they’ve already caught? This government is incapable of leading this province to success.", "We once were the backbone of this country’s economy. But under this government’s watch, we have become a have-not province. I want to emphasize this because it’s not about pride, it’s about our ability to take our resources, to take our excellent manpower and put it into manufacturing and building Ontario. We don’t have to rely on other people’s help to pay for essential services that our citizens have come to expect. Now, we have become the reverse. We are the ones asking for money from the federal government. This government continues to complain that the federal government is not doing enough for Ontario. What this government fails to mention is that their own public accounts documents show they received $600 million more from Ottawa last year than the previous years. This government needs to stop blaming others for the mess they’ve created. This government needs to take some responsibility.", "Speaker, I want to spend a few minutes discussing the various clauses of Bill 7. The first part of Bill 7 requires the minister to publish an annual report on what the government is doing to reduce unnecessary regulations, or as we like to call it, tax burdens. In addition, part 1 of the bill sets out that the minister will have the power to make regulations with respect to the report which may include regulations “specifying any actions to reduce burdens that must be referred to in the report” and “prescribing the manner in which the minister must evaluate, quantify or describe actions of the government.”", "I’ve spoken about this before. Regulations, to me, are very concerning, because all it takes is two signatures from cabinet ministers. It doesn’t even have to have a debate or a discussion at the cabinet table, let alone, a public debate, that is Hansard here in this chamber, or a public forum at a committee where members of the public or impacted individuals can talk about their concerns. Regulations have the ability to change the intent of legislation within days. It’s the worst way to govern, because you govern by stealth. You can pass a bill that sounds very nice—Better Business Climate Act sounds pretty harmless, sounds like a good idea—and then the regulations can change the entire intention of what we thought we were debating and discussing here in this chamber. I’ve talked about it before.", "In this small, six-page bill, regulations are mentioned, I think, half a dozen times. So if you think, as a member of the public, that by reading this piece of proposed legislation you know the intent of the bill, you don’t, because you have to wait until you see the regulations, and the only time you get to see the regulations is after they are passed. So it is very concerning to me.", "I spoke about it at the beginning of my debate. There’s nothing in this bill that compels the government to take the requisite action to crack down on unnecessary burdens. The government doesn’t need Bill 7 to ensure that we are open for business here in Ontario. What they need is ministers who get the importance of manufacturing, who understand the value of what we need to create jobs and have a proper business climate in Ontario. They don’t need it through legislation. What we need to do is have ministers who are doing their jobs proactively, going out and seeking out new businesses.", "I’m sure everyone here does it in their own riding. When a business is interested in siting in and opening up in Dufferin–Caledon, I absolutely talk to them. I talk to them about the opportunities. I talk to them about the business climate that happens in Dufferin–Caledon—the job market, what our unemployment rate is, what our hydro rates are—so that they have all the information they need to make the choice to site their business here in my riding, in Dufferin–Caledon. I’m sure we all do that. The minister should be doing that at a macro level across Ontario. He or she certainly doesn’t need Bill 7 to accomplish that.", "I think I will leave it at that. There are all kinds of improvements that can happen in committee, not the least of which is to take out some of those wiggle words like “may” and “if,” and actually make this legislation something that we can be proud of and that we can point to for new businesses that want to site in Ontario and actually make a difference." ],

But we already have these clusters that are formed—unique; sometimes in two cities. In London, in effect, we have manufacturing clusters. We have a very up-and-coming digital technology enterprise that’s growing in London. I’d like to know a little bit more about how this government defines what their role is in the cluster portion of this bill.", "Also, the member from Timmins–James Bay makes a very good point, that this bill is already—in effect, the information in it is already being done, because the government can make changes to regulations. Regulations don’t come before the House, so they have the power to make those changes without legislating this particular bill.", "When it goes to committee, I’ll be really interested to hear how businesses find that this will be a helpful tool going forward in job creation and making it a better business climate. I look forward to that and hope that businesses will have that information in their deputations to actually make this bill stronger and move us forward into a better business climate for the growth of jobs." ],

I think, given the discussions that have been ongoing over the past few months, Ontario really feels that it’s on its own, trying to move forward. Our finance minister made the point recently that Ontario puts $11 billion into the national treasury that it does not see back. And $1 billion or $2 billion back would go a long way to helping not only with our marketing but all sorts of different areas of government.", "With regard to Bill 7, though, since 2008 the government has eliminated 17% of all regulatory requirements. That’s 80,000 regulatory burdens. The new burden reduction strategy will save over $100 million by 2016-17.

I believe, if I can recall, that they voted against it.

Yet the CCAC in Windsor is running a $4-million to $5-million deficit and making all kinds of cuts. I don’t know who’s calling the shots—who’s running the show—but I know there are definitely cuts in the health care system at the CCAC in Windsor.", "When I was elected, a friend of mine, Paul Couvion, from the west side of Windsor gave me a bunch of red tape—rolls of red tape. I was going to bring in a roll for the minister, but I was told it would be unparliamentary, so I can’t give him the tape and the scissors. But it begs the question, if you’ve been there for 12 years and you’ve created some of this red tape and lived with it for 12 years, why now? I guess it’s never too late to do the right thing.

I’ve got to tell you I was so excited; I was going to write a speech. But I thought, “You know what? I think I’ll just ad lib it, because there’s not a heck of a lot in here to write a speech about.”", "So let me go through this. But first of all, before I go there, what’s interesting is that the government is not participating in this debate. If the government was really, truly excited about this bill, you’d think the members of the government would be up on their feet talking about this and, more importantly, saying to the opposition, “Let’s get this out of the House so we can get it into committee and actually go out there and do the work that has to be done to make sure these two schedules of the bill get done in such a way that is the best possible for our economy and the people of Ontario.” But, Mr. Speaker, they’re not even doing that. I would be somewhat remiss, if I was a government member, to participate in this debate, especially if I had read it, because there is nothing in this bill the government can’t do now.", "Let me explain why. The government, for years now—and this didn’t start under a Liberal administration. I want to be clear. I want to be nonpartisan on this point. Governments over the last 20 years have started to delegate the gist of bills, when it comes to regulation, to cabinet. It used to be, when I was first elected here, that a government would draft a bill and very little of the regulation was left to cabinet. In fact, everything was pretty well spelled out in the bill. It would say, “The minister has the power...” It would say, “The minister shall do the following.” It wouldn’t say, “The minister may ...” but “the minister shall do the following in the prescribed manner of the bill.” All of the nuts and bolts of how legislation works were actually designed right into the bill.", "The reason we did that, Mr. Speaker, was really simple. You remember. You were a bright-eyed, bushy-tailed young member. Do you remember that, 1990, when we both came in that class? We were all excited. We came into this Legislature.

Fortunately, because we got into the mode of leaving everything to regulation, Premier Harris delegated the authority on how that bill worked to cabinet.", "And then what happened, Mr. Speaker? It turned out that the government under Mr. McGuinty changed the regulations in the bill so that you didn’t have to have a referendum. So where the House had proclaimed itself to have a referendum, the government took away that right just simply by regulation, and they were allowed to do that because everything was delegated to regulation.", "This is the point of this bill. This bill does two things. It deals with Schedule 1, which says, “The minister shall make available to the public an annual report with respect to actions taken by the government of Ontario to reduce burdens.”", "“Burden” is described in the act under section 1: “‘Burden’ means a cost that may be measured in terms of money, time or resources and is considered by the minister in consultation with other members of the government”—meaning cabinet—“of Ontario to be unnecessary to achieve the purpose of the statutory, regulatory procedural, administrative or other requirement that creates the cost”—fardeau fiscal, as we say in French, or fardeau administratif.", "The point is, the government already has that right. The government, because we delegated the authority to cabinet, can do this already. So the government doesn’t need the permission of this Legislature to say, “Oh, there’s a regulation somewhere that we can change in order to make it that, yes, we protect the environment; yes, we protect health and safety of workers; yes, we protect the rights of the citizen; but we can do it in a smarter way that is less burdensome to business.” The government could do it now. Why do they need a bill to do this?", "Here’s what’s really interesting. It says, under section 3 of schedule 1, “The minister may make regulations respecting the report, which may include regulations,", "“(a) specifying any actions to reduce burdens that must be referred to in the report;", "“(b) prescribing the manner in which the minister must evaluate, quantify or describe actions of the government...;", "“(c)”—this is the important one—“prescribing a date for the purpose of clause 2(2)(b).”", "So the government, by its own power that they’re giving themselves in the bill, can choose or choose not to do what is spelled out in the bill, something that they already have the authority to do in the first place and that they don’t need a bill to get done. Did you follow that? That was pretty interesting, the way that I pulled all that together.", "My point is, all this does is say the government shall draft a report, the minister will decide what’s in the report, the minister will decide how the report is written, and the minister will decide when the report is to be published on what they’ve done to lessen the burden on businesses when it comes to regulation. Well, you hardly need a bill to do that. So you’ve got to ask yourself the question, why is the government doing this?" ],

He talked about those in the automotive sector who are trying to do exactly that but feel somewhat stymied by the Canadian/Ontarian experience of dealing with government.", "It’s not that government is a bad thing. I’m a New Democrat. I believe government is a good thing. I believe that government can be an instrument to make good things happen. There are all kinds of experiences in our history where government, when they decided to do something, did it extremely well. This nation would not be a nation if it hadn’t been for the building of a railway across this country, something that government decided to do. There are all kinds of examples, from 1867 on, that show that government could do good things.", "But schedule 2—give me a break: “Ontario is committed to maintaining its competitive edge in the increasingly competitive global economy.” That’s in the preamble. Oh, my God. Like we didn’t know that? Wow. I read it in the bill—I was so excited this weekend—so I knew it was true.", "Then it says, “Clusters, which are geographically concentrated groups of interconnected businesses and related entities, can perform an important function in regional economic development by increasing productivity, innovation and competitiveness.” Like we didn’t know that already? My God, I read it in a bill. I was so surprised when I saw it there, I thought, “What a good idea.” Can you imagine that? Somebody actually looks at the mining sector and says, “I have a strategy on how to assist the mining sector, create more jobs and be responsible to the environment and to Ontarians.” Can you imagine the government having an idea of doing something around the automotive sector? I would have never thought that if I hadn’t read that in that bill in the preamble. I thought, “Very, very smart. Boy, these guys have it.”", "Then in the last part of the preamble, it says, “Ontario can act as a catalyst to spur the development of clusters. By working with businesses and other entities to develop plans with respect to the development of clusters, Ontario can promote the growth of jobs and the economy.” Oh my God, I didn’t know that was possible, Mr. Speaker. I read it in the bill, I hurried to my computer, I started to write this very long speech and I went, “But they can do that already.” It was like a huge letdown. As I looked at the iPad that I got from the Legislature as part of the little project that they’ve got going on, I read the bill and I thought, “My God.

This takes the cake. It defines both “cluster” and “minister.”", "“‘Cluster’ means a geographically concentrated group of interconnected businesses and related entities; (‘pôle de compétitivité’).” Okay, cool. I’m cool with that.", "“Minister” I don’t need to describe. We all know what that is.", "Here’s what it is. It says, “The minister may prepare plans with respect to the development of clusters.” My God, a minister could never do that until this bill came to this House. Did you know that? Never would a minister even think of doing something like that.", "It says, “The minister may prepare plans with respect to the development of clusters,” and then it talks about the content of the plan: “A plan with respect to the development of a cluster shall include the following:", "“1. A description of the cluster.” Did you know that there’s an automotive strategy, member for Windsor–Tecumseh? Did you know there was a mining sector, Mr. Mantha from Algoma–Manitoulin? Did you know there was an agricultural sector, Mr. Clark from Leeds–Grenville? My God, we didn’t know that until we saw that bill.", "“2. An assessment of challenges and opportunities with respect to the development of the cluster.” We don’t know there’s challenges? We deal with them every day. I just got off the phone with somebody with regards to a challenge in one of these clusters.", "“3. The objectives and intended outcomes of the plan.” I didn’t know. My God, they need regulation and they need legislation to do that?", "It goes on to describe—but here’s the thing: Under section 4, “If the minister prepares a plan with respect to the development of a cluster, the minister shall”—and this is really the fun part;", "“(a) make public a draft plan and consult”—oh, no. I wanted to go to 5. Sorry. Let me get to 5:", "“Amendments to plan", "“5(1) The minister may at any time make amendments to a plan with respect to the development of a cluster by making public the amended plan along with an explanation of the purpose of the amendments.” In other words, if he don’t like what’s going on in the cluster and what the government is doing, he or she can change it. Hello? Like ministers can’t do that now?", "Then it goes on to say, “Plan preparation ceased, plan revoked", "“6. The minister may decide to cease the preparation of a plan with respect to the development of a cluster or revoke the plan at any time by making the decision public, and the minister’s obligations under this act with respect to the plan cease immediately.”", "Let me see if I understand this. They have fallen off the turnip truck and they’ve found out there are clusters in our economy, something we already knew; they have decided they’re going to make a plan on how to work with the clusters in the economy, something that the cabinet already has the authority to do; and they’ve got to make that report public. I guess that’s the only new part. I guess you can give them some credit for that one.", "But then in the end, guess what? The report comes out. It’s a damning report that they don’t like? Under section 6, schedule 2 of the bill, they can get rid of the whole darned thing.", "So I say to myself, “What is this all about?” This is a communications exercise. This is the government of Ontario saying, “We want to ring the bell. We want to shine the light over there, showing that we’re doing something, because we certainly don’t want you looking over here, where things are going on.”", "Again, I say it’s interesting that members of the government have decided not to participate in this debate. I would think they would be proud: They would be on their feet, they would be engaging in debate, they would just be pushing their points forward, and they would be so proud of what they’re doing. Well, if I was a government member, I don’t think I would get up either. I would be surprised.", "So I’m saying to my friends on the other side, with all due respect and all friendship—you know me, I’m a big friendly kind of guy. Meet me in the hallway, and I always say “Hi,” and all that kind of stuff. But couldn’t we be using our legislative time to be doing something else? Is this an attempt or a tactic, as the Deputy Premier said earlier today, for the government to filibuster its own Legislature with a bill giving themselves the authority on something they already have the authority to do? Is this a strategy? I’m beginning to think that it is.", "It is unbelievable. I’ve been here for 25 years, and this is one of the—it’s well-meaning. I don’t want to make fun of the fact that we should be working to develop plans around clusters of industry. My good friend from Windsor–Tecumseh made good points about why that’s so necessary. But to have a bill to give you the authority to do something which you already have the authority to do is a little bit strange, would you not say? I bet you, opposition House leader from Leeds–Grenville, that this might get some committee time. This might get traveled around the province. If there’s one bill that the government will decide to travel, I predict it will be this one, because they’ll be able to say, “Look what we’re doing for the people of Windsor, the people of Brockville, the people of Ottawa, the people of Timmins and Sudbury and London and Windsor” and different places. If there’s any bill that will be traveled, the unfortunate reality is—not that this is a bad bill. It doesn’t harm anybody. It’s more or less a communication exercise on the part of the government." ],

But no, instead, we’re going to use legislative time to debate this for six and a half hours. The government is going to bring in the two-hour time allocation motion.

It talks about what it can do, and it talks about what goes into the plan besides who should be consulted. It determines how the plan is reviewed, revoked or made public, but they don’t even have to bring that plan back to us. They don’t have to bring that report. They’re going to spend lots of money again on a report that may never see the light of day if it doesn’t say exactly what they want it to say, and we know what that will be: The world is rosy, everything is good, the economy is rolling right along, and they’re overachieving yet again.", "Tell that to the 300,000 people who are unemployed.

The cost of energy is driving them out of business. They can’t keep up with the burden of all of the red tape from this government. They want to see some significant change.

What we want to see soon—I’ve wanted to see it the whole three years I’ve been here—is the actual action piece to all of these bills that they bring out, not talking about the platitudes of how wonderful they’re doing.

I was in the midst of explaining what a great evolution or progress this government has made with respect to drastically reducing and eliminating some of the regulatory burden. That’s one of the reasons, along with a lot of the other crucial investments we’ve made to help keep the economy strong, that just recently we’ve seen such strong employment numbers and such strong job numbers. It’s why the province of Ontario remains either the best or second best in terms of its ranking with respect to foreign direct investment. It’s why there’s a great deal of optimism in communities right across this province with respect to our economic future.", "I would hope that because, by and large, the members from both opposition parties who spoke did not talk with respect to opposing the substance of this bill, we can continue to move the debate forward, get the legislation passed and, together, we can ensure that Ontario’s economy remains strong." ],

This is like, “Everybody, look over here. Look over here. There’s something that’s nice and shiny and new we want you to look at, as if we’re doing something.” But the reality is, they don’t want people looking over here, which are the problems in the economy.", "Across this province, we’re having a problem when it comes to the economy, and the government wants to be seen as having done something, but the reality is, there’s nothing in this bill that’s any different than what the government could do now. This is nothing short of a communications exercise on the part of the government. The government, in a funny kind of way, is filibustering its own legislation with a communication exercise.

This is one of these bills we could have easily given you quicker passage on in exchange for allowing other bills to travel the province on issues that are important to the people of this province. We need to remember: This is not only our Legislature. More importantly, this is the Legislature of the people of Ontario. What we need to do is always remember that it’s them that we work for. When we don’t allow the people of this province to fully participate in vetting legislation by way of the committee process, I think that’s a pretty big letdown on the part of this Legislature when it comes to the responsibility that you have as a government to the people of Ontario." ],

The member from Timmins–James Bay was right: This can all be done in regulation. It does not have to have a formal piece of legislation. Even within the act, it says that the government has the ability to withdraw everything that the act may be able to do to help small business. Talk about redundancy and a bill that really is fluff and does not need to be done.", "The Canadian Federation of Independent Business has been encouraging the government for years to reduce the regulatory red tape burden that’s unnecessary. It’s incredible how the piles of paper grow and the government jobs grow for red tape and regulations that don’t need to occur. No wonder taxpayers go crazy when small business people get strangled by red tape. Every time they have to fill out more papers, it takes away their profitability. It takes away their chance to maybe create some more jobs. But no, it’s buried in red tape, buried in paperwork that does not need to occur. In fact, every hour that a small business person has to spend dealing with government forms or dealing with what seem to be unnecessary regulations is an hour taken away from that very thing that I just mentioned, what they do best, which is actually serving their customers, trying to expand their customer base, trying to grow more jobs, because they want their businesses to grow and be profitable. That is the goal of most small business people. I don’t think it’s understood by the government at all. We, along with the CFIB, have been saying for years with great passion, “Stop killing small businesses in Ontario. Stop making it more frustrating for us to do business here and to grow. Get out of our way.” Of course, there has to be a certain amount of regulations that are existing in the province, but not near as many as this government has let grow and expand.", "The CFIB said, “Well, it’s an okay first step. It’s not really what we asked for, but at least they’re looking at it and saying ‘reducing red tape and regulation.’” They are asking for regulation reduction targets to ensure that there is zero net growth in terms of regulations and red tape, helping to reinforce the one-to-two rule whereby for every new regulation affecting small business and tying them up, two regulations would be eliminated. That’s something that we have long been crying for, but again this could just be done—if I can say the word again—in regulations, not in legislation, not taking up our time where we could actually be doing something to solve the large number of problems that exist for small businesses out there.", "One example that we continually hear is not just about red tape. It depends on what business you go into. You can have an example every day of ridiculous pieces of regulation and paperwork that need to be done, but it actually is something that we have to focus on. So, yes to reducing red tape, but we know that energy is a huge problem out there. If I did a survey of businesses in my area, hydro would be number one, followed closely by red tape.", "I know that there have been many, many articles written about the exorbitant cost of hydro and electricity bills, but also the exorbitant waste of government bureaucracies within OPG and Hydro One. There have been some articles written lately. This one is by Lorrie Goldstein on November 8. It’s called “Wynne’s Billion-Dollar Hydro Boondoggle.” Basically, it says, “‘Ontario’s Breath-Taking, Record-Breaking Month for Electricity Bills’ … reveal that last month, Premier Kathleen Wynne’s Liberal government paid $1 billion more for electricity than the market value of that power.”", "The “‘global adjustment’ in Ontario—the difference between the market value of electricity and what it actually cost to produce—topped $1 billion, for the first time, ever.”", "That’s like the power plants all over again, just in one month." ],

We have, in this province, for the 90th-some month in a row, the highest unemployment in the whole of Canada. The Liberals have been in government for 11 years, so I can’t say they’re really on the right path.", "The waste in electricity from poor planning is costing us businesses and manufacturing jobs—over 300,000. I’m sure there’s more. How do you actually get those jobs back? We’ve got a little bill here that says they’re going reduce the red tape and do some clusters for economic growth. Really? That’s going to help bring manufacturing jobs, or jobs at all, back to the province of Ontario? I don’t think so.", "Like I said, a good first attempt, the red tape thing, but really something that could be done in regulation.", "The real story is, if you don’t have a proper business climate, which we don’t—I touched on hydro and forcing wind turbines upon us in rural Ontario and solar projects upon us, subsidized to a great extent, in communities that don’t want them. Right now, there’s an Environmental Review Tribunal going on in my riding of Haliburton–Kawartha Lakes–Brock that’s in its second week, in which we’ve had Manvers Wind Concerns. Groups have had to raise a great deal of money to do the appeal for five wind turbines. They’re going to interfere with the projects of the Cham Shan Buddhist temple, the Peterborough airport—they are business expansions. The Cham Shan temple is a business expansion. The biggest thing is, they’re building them on the Oak Ridges moraine. We’re overproducing tons of electric power here, but yet we’re subsidizing projects that communities don’t want. It is bad, bad policy.", "There are actually some solutions out there. I know that Parker Gallant has said, “What’s the solution? If the province wants to contain electricity rate increases, it needs to halt new hydroelectric, wind and solar projects. In order to reverse rate increases” which the government has said is going to increase by at least 47% over the next five years, they should “seek opportunities to terminate the existing contracts between renewable energy companies and the OPA.” But the Premier has indicated that “that’s not where they’re headed.” They’re actually going to ask for more projects in their next energy plan.", "Alternatives to costly new renewables have been mentioned here—also, importing electricity from Quebec while Ontario refurbishes its nuclear power plants. We’ve seen European countries that have shut down their wind turbines. We’re not learning anything. All we are doing is increasing energy rates, driving residents out of their houses and driving people out of their homes.", "There was a man during the campaign who would correlate the increase in his hydro bills to how many extra loaves of bread—he obviously owned a bakery—that had to be made. I think he said it was almost $700 more that he’s going to have to make in his bakery, so that many more loaves of bread, in order to pay for the increase in his electricity bill.", "At some point, there’s a breaking time, when people say, “I just cannot make it.” That, I think, puts it in perspective. So when we say we want to help small businesses, and I said the pretty title that goes on, the reality is that we have a huge debt, a huge deficit. Businesses that want to start up or expand see that, that we’re $287.3 billion in debt, and 11 years ago it was $139 billion. It’s averaging out to about $21,000 per person in the province of Ontario, and this government has put this burden upon them.", "The deficit is not going down, as the government says; it’s actually going up by $2 billion and it’s a $29-million-a-day interest payment. Just servicing all that debt is the third-largest budget item.", "The member from Dufferin–Caledon spoke earlier about health care costs and how the CCACs are cutting health care costs and the Ontario Nurses’ Association is saying how many nurses are laid off. Unfortunately, that’s what happens when you don’t balance your books and when you don’t have proper fiscal management. Health, social services, education: They all suffer. We know $500 million is coming out of education. We don’t know what schools they may be closing, but we know that there’s $500 million coming out of education.", "So when they bring forward Bill 7, it does a bunch of schedules, it does a little bit of red tape reduction. Let me see. From CFIB, another statistic: It’s an $11-billion loss in productivity with red tape every year—" ],

It’s a lot harder to get high-speed Internet there because of the geography of the area. The Eastern Ontario Wardens’ Caucus has produced papers upon papers—very good information about eastern Ontario and the fact that it is harder to do business and it’s a struggle to do business in eastern Ontario. Has the government listened to any of this? I don’t think so.", "I think that every ministry has been analyzed by its stakeholders—say, the Ministry of Agriculture. You can go into areas in my riding—we went into Sunderland Co-op. They had to have so many permits they covered a whole wall. We took a picture of it. The number of permits was unbelievable. For every ministry, they have to go in and fill in the same thing: their name, their address, things that take up time. You can get into 50-some permits required by Sunderland Co-op or a co-operative like that. They already can tell you what red tape and regulation needs to be eliminated that is no longer useful. If you look at the agriculture sector and you look at the Ministry of Natural Resources, they can tell you. The people out in the field can tell you what red tape and regulations need to be gotten rid of.", "It also says in here “the regulatory burden.” Well, let’s just talk a little bit about the apprentices and the College of Trades. We long fought against the College of Trades over here. Tons of industries signed up to stop the trades tax, people who want to grow their businesses, who want to be employed in Ontario. A College of Trades is unnecessary. They’re already regulated by other ministries. They don’t need a college of trades, which, by the way, for people listening at home, is not an actual college that helps young people get into the trades at all.", "We’ve long said that the ratios are wrong in the province of Ontario. I said earlier that the west has won. The west has won the battle for our young people. If they wanted to get a trade, why would our young people not go to a province in western Canada where they are accepted quickly, it’s structured with business and education out there so they can get into their trade and make good money? We all know there’s a shortage of skilled trades coming—well, it’s here. If you go to northern Ontario, in the mining field they’re bringing in people from as far as Africa because we cannot get young people into the fields that they need.", "I fought for over a decade, as my colleague from Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound—I fought for over a decade before your time here—" ],

When she originally stood up, the Speaker said, “Further debate,” waited a little bit, “Further debate,” waited a little bit. Nobody stood up, so of course the member immediately jumped out of her seat to continue this debate, because we’re trying to express that this bill seems to be—what we’re looking at on the face of it—a marketing tool for the Liberals.", "If the Liberals truly believe in this bill—and that’s something I wanted to ask them; I don’t know if that’s out of order when you’re in debate. I wanted to ask the members on the other side who are listening to the debate, why aren’t you standing up and speaking to this bill if you believe in the bill? If you believe in something that your government puts forward, wouldn’t you be passionate about it to sell it, to market it to us so that we can buy into the bill and so that the public can buy into the bill?", "I challenge you to stand up and debate your own bill—if that’s allowed. Tell me what you find wonderful about this bill, how it’s going to make a difference to the climate and make a better business climate for businesses in Ontario. I hope you take my challenge seriously and stand up to speak to the bill. I’d love to hear from a member backing up the legislation that has been presented." ],

I promise that I did, and I of course heard the member from the NDP caucus, I suppose, challenging our side to stand and defend the bill itself.", "I had the chance just a couple of minutes ago in the previous round of debate to talk a little bit about why this kind of legislation is important. Of course, there was a bit of an interruption in my remarks earlier, so I momentarily lost my train of thought at that particular point in time, but what’s really important from my perspective is to remember that this legislation, Bill 7, is something that’s extremely important to the business community in particular and to those who have a passionate interest in moving Ontario’s economy forward.", "I think of people in my own community. In the wonderful community of Vaughan, just sitting on the northern edge of Toronto, representatives from the Vaughan Chamber of Commerce—I was at a breakfast a few weeks ago that the Vaughan Chamber of Commerce hosted. If there’s one message I’ve heard from business leaders in my own community—and I’m sure the other 106 members of this Legislature hear a similar thing—it’s that they want an ongoing dialogue and partnership with government to make sure that we make decisions here about where and how we’re going to invest in the economy, but also how we’re going to intelligently, surgically and sustainably lessen the regulatory burden that they’re facing.", "We see repeatedly—and I mentioned this in my earlier remarks—very clear evidence that the plan is working. I talked about what we’ve done since 2008 and the extent to which we’ve actually been able to work closely with business to reduce the regulatory burden, and we see the positive results that have occurred here in the province since that time. I talked about the job numbers we saw recently. I talked also about the fact that we continue to have a plan to move the province forward and things like investing in transit and transportation infrastructure. This is what the community out there needs to see. Most importantly, they want to see this kind of legislation get passed so we can move the province’s economy forward and keep moving in the right direction.", "I look forward to the rest of the debate this afternoon." ],

One of the words she used at the very end of the speech when she referred to Bill 7 was a “gesture,” and I think that was a very good use of that term, because when you start to look at some of the business organizations—and I appreciate that the Minister of Transportation spoke earlier about chambers of commerce.", "I, too, was at one of my local chambers of commerce. In fact, two chambers of commerce had their awards ceremony recently, one in Brockville and one in Gananoque that encompassed both Gananoque and the Thousand Islands. Many of those chamber members were members of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business. I note from their recommendations to the government on red tape reduction. If you read the five recommendations, this bill, this gesture of a bill, really only deals with half of the very first recommendation. On the other four recommendations there’s silence.", "Obviously the half that they’ve done is, they’ve introduced legislation. What they haven’t done that other provinces have done is prescribe reduction targets, and I think it’s very important to be able to put targets within the bill.", "As well, the CFIB is recommending that government fully implement the regular review of high-impact regulations. In fact, they’re asking the government, encouraging them, to implement the measure across the entire government, to review some of the delegated administrative authorities like TSSA, Stewardship Ontario, rebranding their regulatory feedback form, and also improving services through bizpal.ca.", "The CFIB has made a number of recommendations, and with Bill 7, they’ve really only scratched the surface. I agree with the member. This is a gesture and only a gesture." ],

She talked a lot about the need to cut red tape.", "I’d like to bring the debate back, if I could, because I know those issues are important in her community. In my community, we keep calling for a real made-in-Ontario solution to the loss of manufacturing jobs and the loss of automotive jobs. What we need is a real automotive policy, a real manufacturing strategy. If the government wants to get serious, they can send a message to Ottawa to either lead, follow or get the heck out of the way, and come up with a policy in Ontario that will force Ottawa to come dragging its heels behind, because we need to do something to protect our manufacturing base in this country—in this province, especially.", "Michigan has a real plan. They’ve proven it. They’re doing it the right way. We could clearly follow them, not what this is, a kind of fuzzy, uncoordinated—it’s not a blueprint for success, what’s on the table, and it’s a long way from that. We need a real, focused approach. We need to create jobs and protect jobs, and this bill is falling short of that.", "What this government could be doing and should be doing is taking this bill around the province, consulting with workers in the manufacturing sector and the automotive sector, asking those on the line, asking management, asking the people who rely on the manufacturing base in our communities what they can do to improve their lives, and they can come up with a real policy, an automotive policy, a manufacturing strategy that Ontario so desperately needs." ],

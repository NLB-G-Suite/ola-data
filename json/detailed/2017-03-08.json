  "text" : [ "It’s a pleasure to rise and address Bill 68, An Act to amend various Acts in relation to municipalities.", "My colleague the member from Windsor–Tecumseh had an opportunity to speak to this bill about a week or a week and a half ago, and I have to say that he made some very useful commentary on this bill. I thought that as our municipal affairs critic he had gone through and picked out those things that were important, those things that had to be commented on.", "I will take an opportunity to go back to some of his earlier comments but I want to note—before I talk about some of the pitfalls or failings in this bill—that there are amendments incorporated in this bill that provide greater power and responsibilities to municipalities to take into account climate change and energy planning in their planning processes. I have to say that this is a useful move on the part of the government. I think that all municipalities, over the years to come, are going to be spending an awful lot more time addressing the energy issues, addressing the climate issues.", "I know that here in the city of Toronto a study was done about three years ago looking at the impact of climate change on the city itself. I don’t know if any other municipalities have done it. One of the things that, for them, was most startling and most difficult to handle was the realization that the city sewer system would not actually be adequate for future rainfall events, that rainfall that we’ve seen on a once-in-100-year basis will become far more frequent. Frankly, the city is faced with spending many billions of dollars to upgrade the sewer system not just to ensure safety of the person, but simply to ensure that basements don’t flood on a regular basis throughout this city. The idea that all municipalities will have to start addressing these issues is a good one.", "As the legislation is written, there isn’t as much about adaptation; it’s more about mitigation, about reducing the amount of greenhouse gas that’s put into the atmosphere. I think that’s good. I think that’s a positive thing. I hope that municipalities take advantage of the legislative powers that have been given to them to actually put in place plans to look at energy needs and bring forward programs, regulations and activities that will protect the local environment and, at the same time, protect the global environment.", "My colleague from Windsor–Tecumseh talked about a variety of things when he talked about this piece of legislation. One of the things he talked about were the changes in the bill to allow more rapid collection of unpaid taxes.", "In the past, municipalities would have had to wait for three years before they could take a property and sell it for unpaid taxes. As my colleague noted, it’s now a two-year limit, or will be, once this act is passed.", "Oh, you’ve changed, Mr. Speaker. It’s so good to see you.", "He notes that municipalities, as you’re well aware from your previous experience with municipal councils, have to have a balanced budget. They can’t run deficits. Increasingly, as people face financial pressures, their ability to meet their tax payments has been flagging.", "My colleague, quite correctly, talked about the fact that this province hadn’t addressed the hydro affordability problem as a substantial factor in people’s difficulty in meeting their bills and dealing with tax arrears. It will be very interesting to see what happens when this government brings forward its bill on hydro fees, hydro rates.", "We in this party have brought forward a plan to deal with rising, soaring hydro rates. We think it’s a practical plan, one that doesn’t put an undue burden on future generations and one that actually deals with the structural problems that we face here in Ontario when it comes to electricity prices.", "The government has brought forward a plan, which is essentially going to Money Mart to borrow large volumes of cash to pay current bills. It’s not a sustainable approach. It may be popular, but not sustainable.", "My colleague from Windsor–Tecumseh noted that he was seeing more people dealing with tax arrears because in fact they were having difficulty meeting their hydro bills.", "The government has responded to the needs and the concerns of municipal governments, because it’s saying, “Okay, people can’t pay their bills. We’ll give you the opportunity to seize their property more quickly and allow you to deal with your financial constraints.”", "But the government doesn’t address the underlying issues, doesn’t deal with rising hydro rates and doesn’t deal with the change in work in this province. Increasingly, we’ve been losing those well-paid, high-skilled jobs, and we’re becoming a province in which people are working shorter hours. They’re more often working part-time, more often working for lower wages and more often working on an unpredictable basis. They don’t know when they’ll be called in to work or not. Obviously, such people have huge difficulty paying all of their bills, including their municipal tax bills.", "My colleague from Windsor–Tecumseh, talking about Windsor, noted that in 2016, about 100 properties were registered under tax lien. In the years before that, we were seeing 200 properties a year, but I’m told he was told by senior officials in the finance department of Windsor city hall that we will see about 1,450 additional properties come up for registration this year. Speaker, that indicates the difficulties that the population is having in meeting its bills, and certainly the difficulty that municipalities have in ensuring that they have income.", "The member from Windsor–Tecumseh noted that since 1953, the Municipal Act had been updated roughly every 10 years or so. When that happened, there were public consultations held, an opportunity for people who had difficulty with their municipality to say, “Here are changes that we need in the act,” and an opportunity for municipal officials, elected and employed, to talk about what was needed to allow municipalities to function more effectively.", "But this time, that wasn’t the case. The public wasn’t asked to come in and speak about the shortfalls in municipal legislation. The public wasn’t engaged in any way that was discernible to my colleague and, frankly, discernible to me.", "Again, as my colleague said, it would have been fairly straightforward for the minister or members of the government to wander through Tim Hortons in any riding that they were representing and talk to people and at least get some early sense—although that may or may not have happened, it’s never a substitute for a proper public consultation process, one that is missing here.", "Municipalities are struggling with downloading, downloading that was put in place by Mike Harris’s Progressive Conservative government. There was about $3 billion that was dumped on the laps of municipalities. And as you’re well aware, Speaker, municipalities have been struggling ever since, dealing with those problems. Here in the city of Toronto, Toronto Community Housing, which is a responsibility of the city of Toronto—a large part of that housing used to be run directly by and financed by the provincial government, and it’s now in the city’s hands. This government has reduced, on an ongoing basis, support for that housing.", "When you talk to those who work with Toronto Community Housing, who are trying to make it work based on the municipal tax base, they find they don’t have enough money. Frankly, Speaker, that has meant an ongoing degradation in the level of maintenance of those units and a loss here and there now of units that are no longer habitable, but a great fear that we will start to see the loss of whole buildings. The download that was created by the Conservatives and perpetuated by the Liberals has left cities in a position where they can’t actually provide the funding necessary for community and social housing.", "Speaker, you also have to know, of course, that selling off our publicly owned Hydro One by this government has undermined the finances of the province as a whole. Hydro One earns revenue of $700 million to $800 million a year. By selling off 30% of that asset, we’re losing about $200 million a year. As the Financial Accountability Office has said, that means a long-term reduction in revenue for the province of Ontario and a long-term reduction of our ability, frankly, to fund and support social programs like affordable housing.", "Now, that wasn’t part of this act, but the failure on the part of the government to protect provincial revenues, to hold on to revenue generators, means that no matter what this act says, it is going to be more difficult for the province in the future to actually provide the services it has to provide and, frankly, to upload expenses from municipalities—something that is going to need to be done if those municipalities are going to remain viable, if they’re going to be able to provide the services, the roads, the sidewalks, the police, the fire and the public health services that are needed for modern municipalities.", "My colleague also noted that there was a failure in this act to actually give powers to municipalities across Ontario, to increase the range of taxes they could collect, to put them on the same footing as the city of Toronto, and that’s a problem. That is a problem because those municipalities, like the city of Toronto, find that the property tax base is not enough for them to actually provide the services that citizens need, but they don’t have the wherewithal to reach out more broadly.", "“The City of Toronto Act”—I’ll quote my colleague—“allows for an alcoholic beverage tax. It allows for an entertainment and amusement tax. Parking levies could range from 50 cents a day for each spot to as much as $1.50. Toronto has the ability to tax tobacco between 1% and 10%.”", "Now, my colleague is correct: Very few municipalities in Ontario would actually take advantage of those taxing powers—no question. But as he says, that’s not the point. Don’t Ottawa, Windsor, Hamilton, Guelph, London, Thunder Bay have responsible governments? Aren’t they grown-up levels of government? Should they not have powers that the city of Toronto has to actually deal with their financial difficulties, with their financial responsibilities? I think that my colleague was correct. The Liberals missed an opportunity here. As he says, “They could have slipped that in here as easy as pie.” Who knows, Speaker? Who knows? But when this bill goes to committee—and I have no doubt, given the numbers in this House, that it will go to committee—there may be amendments to deal with some of these outstanding problems in the bill.", "My hope, at least if this bill goes to committee, is that there will be broad consultations and that people across Ontario will be made aware that there are hearings and that they will have the opportunity to intervene and speak.", "Still, it would have been much better, prior to the introduction of this bill, for the government to have held a consultation process so that people would have that opportunity to say what should be in the bill. It’s always so much easier, before the bill is actually committed to the printer, to get those things in. Once it gets here—and it’s just our nature; just the kind of people we are—it can be a bit harder to actually change.", "This bill speaks as well to the requirement for legislation integrity commissioners. I have to say, I do admire the sense of wit of my colleague from Windsor–Tecumseh. He had to say: “Let’s talk about integrity for a moment. We all know what that is. Some of us even claim to have a fleeting relationship with it.” I think it was Winston Churchill, talking about Stanley Baldwin, who said that Stanley Baldwin occasionally stumbled across the truth, but when he did, he’d pick himself up and go on as he had before. I think my colleague from Windsor–Tecumseh has the same dry sense of humour when it comes to integrity.", "As my colleague said, every member of this House has the provincial Integrity Commissioner, that we deal with. Where we falter, where it’s brought to the Integrity Commissioner’s attention or where the Integrity Commissioner notices, then that commissioner can call on us to address the issues that have come up.", "In this bill, existing municipal integrity commissioners will have some of their powers expanded. They will be doing work on code-of-conduct provisions as well as the conflict of interest act. They’ll be working with municipalities on procedures for ethical behaviour. There will be an educational component to their work as well.", "One thing that my colleague noted, though—and he has a good point—is that the bill allows 180 days as the period of time from the time a complaint is launched against a municipal politician—a councillor or a mayor—before things are addressed. As he says: Why not 30, 60 or 90? If a complaint is launched against a municipal politician and it takes many, many months to resolve that complaint, that person, innocent or guilty, is presumed to have done something wrong by the public. Whether people are right or wrong to assume that is beside the point; it’s just simply what happens. My colleague notes, and I think he’s right, that having something hang out in the air like that for six months can make it very difficult for a councillor or mayor to function. It makes far more sense to try and expedite that process and resolve those questions as quickly as possible. I think my colleague is right to say that these cases need to be resolved fairly quickly. The saying is, “Justice delayed is justice denied.” And I think he’s right. In this case, that will be an issue, and frankly, in an election year, it can be a huge issue. If someone has an integrity problem, that problem needs to be addressed, needs to be assessed and needs to be ruled on in a rapid basis. Failure to do that is not good for the population as a whole, because people want these things resolved quickly, and it’s certainly not good for the politician who is affected.", "There’s a section in here that requires municipalities to develop policies on the relationship between members of council and the employees of that council. He speculates that this may be related to some complaints about Mayor Bradley of Sarnia." ],

I think everyone in this House can support the leave provisions. Clearly, if you don’t attend council on a regular basis, at a certain point, council decides that you’ve given up, but in relationship to pregnancy and parental leave, it needs to be recognized in this society that the current system is not fair to women. We want more women in public life, certainly on municipal councils, and this change is a useful one.", "I’ve just touched on this bill. I appreciate the work of our municipal affairs critic, the member from Windsor–Tecumseh, in doing his leadoff and actually doing an assessment of what’s before us. I look forward to the debate and the comments from my colleagues. There’s no doubt that there needs to be an update to the legislation.

He spent a bit of time talking about or, actually, criticizing the former Conservative government for their downloading exercise. Before I make my comments, it’s important to note for people in municipalities who are residential property taxpayers that when we say “downloading,” what we’re talking about is that the former government that was referenced by the member was taking work and costs that were formerly borne by the province of Ontario and basically putting them onto the backs of the municipal residential property taxpayer. Where he went off course in his remarks was he implied that we were continuing and perpetuating that downloading exercise when, of course, exactly the opposite is the case.", "He went on to talk for a while as well about the city of Toronto specifically when it came to the downloading exercise. Speaker, what I would tell you and what I would tell people right across the province who have all benefited from our uploading exercise, but specifically in the city of Toronto: This year, just on uploading costs alone, the city of Toronto and all the residential property taxpayers in the city of Toronto will benefit from almost $450 million to $500 million in uploaded costs that come off their residential property tax base.", "In addition to that, the city of Toronto has benefitted from about $2 billion in gas tax funding since we brought that in. Of course, we’ve announced that their annual rate will double beginning in 2019, be doubled by 2021. They’ll be getting $340 million every year in gas tax starting in 2019 as that gets doubled. It’s quite the opposite of what the member tried to imply when it came to downloading.", "We have been uploading. All municipalities across the province have benefitted from that—from $1.1 billion in 2003 up to $4 billion in financial assistance for all 444 municipalities in the province of Ontario." ],

There are many more, including the Northern Services Boards Act.", "The committee meetings that will result from this bill moving on: Those committee meetings need to be held throughout Ontario, not just here in Toronto. There are 444 municipal bodies in Ontario—444.", "Now here’s why this bill needs to travel and be heard. We need to hear from many of these communities. On the same day Bill 68 was introduced, the government also introduced Bill 70. It was what we call an omnibus bill. It had more than two dozen different acts, including, strangely, the Municipal Act was affected.", "Not only does this bill affect it, but typical of the Liberals, what they did that week was cut off debate, held a vote at 11:45 in the morning to send that omnibus bill to committee at 1 o’clock that day, and that was it. It ended at 6 o’clock that day. Nobody from the north, nobody from rural Ontario was able to find out about this, scramble and come to Toronto that day. That was typical of what this government did, and that’s why we need to have a committee across Ontario." ],

One of the things that municipalities talk about is the struggling revenue sources that they have. Their budgets are stretched to the maximum.", "I went to OGRA a couple of weeks ago. I met with representatives from the city of London. One of the topics they had that they wanted to talk about was transit. London is embarking on an expansion and improvement of their transit plan. They have submitted their application to the government and other documents that they require in order for the government to approve funds.", "They said that the government seems to be favourable, but there’s not a definite answer back as to whether or not the funding will be there on the provincial portion. The municipality is going to contribute one third. They’re asking the province to contribute, as well as the federal government.", "One of the things they mentioned that they were concerned about is that this government said in October 2016, there was a report that they were waiting for in order to finalize some of these discussions and funding proposals. Apparently, at the time, when we met with OGRA, at OGRA, that report hasn’t been done. They haven’t heard anything. There’s silence from the government on that report.", "I’m going to maybe approach the Minister of Transportation today and ask him about that report and where that is. If that’s the missing link for them to move this project forward for the city of London, I’d like to know that so that I can push this government to get that information and come back with a decision on transit that’s so important to our municipality. It will be an income source. It will be a job creator. We need that in London.", "Our London is one of the largest cities in southwestern Ontario. We are a leader.

The public consultations ran from June 5, 2015, until October 31, 2015. The government held a number of consultation meetings with municipal stakeholders, including the city of Toronto, the Association of Municipalities of Ontario, municipal staff, provincial and local accountability officers, and the ministry met with business stakeholders who expressed an interest in the review. It was a pretty wide discussion that took place with people across the province about what should go in to a bill of this kind.", "On the issue of downloading, I’m glad he mentioned it, because sometimes people forget this, that the last time the Conservative Party was in power—or as they’re called, the Progressive Conservative Party—they downloaded financial responsibilities to municipalities. Particularly the rural people out there would know some of these roads that were downloaded. Our government made a decision to upload those costs to the provincial level of government so they wouldn’t be borne by the property tax, where we felt they should not be borne.", "I know that every time a council meets in the province of Ontario, they credit the provincial government for doing this; they thank the provincial government. I can remember, when we were looking at ways to save money to be able to balance the budget, some people suggested, “Why don’t you stop the uploading process that’s benefiting municipalities, but going on the tax base of the province?” We did not do that, and I think municipalities are better off as a result." ],

I think our critic for municipal affairs set that up fairly well in his initial speech. If I did not make that clear enough, I hope that I have with this correction.", "I want to note the Minister of Municipal Affairs’ comments. When you actually look at the commentary from the Association of Municipalities of Ontario, in 2015, they were saying that municipalities were facing a huge tab for operating the social housing that was downloaded to them by the provincial Conservatives and that the province simply had not lived up to its promises to help with that. In 2013, the city of Toronto lost $150 million in funding from the province for housing and there’s been a continued reduction in support for housing in Toronto, which has meant a deterioration of those buildings and, ultimately, a loss of housing.", "Similarly, the city of Toronto, but my guess is it’s the same with Ottawa, Hamilton, London—those municipalities used to have a very good funding program from the province. Half the operating costs came from the municipality—for the city of Toronto, over $300 million per year. A promise to increase the gas tax a year after the next election is not an adequate commitment to actually dealing with that download." ],

The offices of members of council would not become vacant because of an absence related to pregnancy or parental leave for 20 consecutive weeks or less.

  "text" : [ "I’d like to begin by saying that my new title is Minister of Seniors Affairs. With that said, good morning to everybody. I’m very pleased to share my time and speak to Bill 68, the Modernizing Ontario’s Municipal Legislation Act.", "My colleague did a fantastic job of speaking on this bill. She focused quite a bit on the parental leave and on the climate change piece, so I will focus my comments on the integrity commissioner piece, open meetings and prudent investment.", "I do want wish everybody a happy women’s day and recognize the MPP from Kitchener Centre for her leadership on the parental leave piece, which, of course, affects both fathers and mothers, but certainly affects mothers and is a big step for women. I’m glad that this bill and that part of the section was spoken to today, given that it’s International Women’s Day.", "I’m really pleased that Bill 68 is proposing that every municipality have a code of conduct and provide access to an integrity commissioner. This would promote a more consistent level of accountability across our local governments. As MPPs, we are all familiar with the Integrity Commissioner and the role of the Integrity Commissioner that we value so much. I think it’s really timely that this bill now provides that every municipality should have a code of conduct and an integrity commissioner.", "What I really like about the way this proposal is structured is the fact that it recognizes that municipalities have different sizes and different resources. That’s why it provides for the option that municipalities would have the option to pool their resources and share an integrity commissioner or hire a commissioner on a fee-for-service model. It’s really well structured. The intent is access to an integrity commissioner and some flexibility that allows municipalities to tailor how they would avail themselves of the services of an integrity commissioner. This is something in line with what all modern democracies are moving toward, which is greater integrity and transparency.", "The second piece that I want to speak to is about open meetings: again, keeping in line with democracy and technology that is allowing us to provide for greater transparency in governing. Currently, there isn’t enough clarity under the Municipal Act as to which meetings ought to be open to public scrutiny. I’m sure many of us have read in the papers about cases where city councillors may have met and made decisions in what could have been or should have been a public meeting but was not a public meeting. To clarify, the proposed amendment would change the definition of a meeting to apply to council and local board meetings where a quorum of members is present, and they deal with a matter in a way that materially advances the council’s or local board’s business or decision-making.", "The use of the word “materially” advancing decision-making is really important because that’s a word that everybody understands. It’s being introduced there to ensure that an informal, casual gathering of four or five city councillors in perhaps a public place or events that they are attending generally as part of their daily lives doesn’t turn into public scrutiny if material advance is not being made for the local board’s business or decision-making.", "The final piece that I want to talk about is giving some more flexibility to municipalities as they conduct their business, and this time it is around where they invest their funds. Under current legislation, municipalities can only invest their funds in a list of eligible investments. There is, of course, good reason for that. These are public funds and it’s important that they are prudently invested.", "This brings us to the proposed change. The proposed change, if passed, would provide municipalities with the option to invest according to prudent investor standards. What this does is it allows a municipality a slightly broader range of eligible investments but keeps in mind the original intent, which is that all investments are to be prudent.", "Taken together, Mr. Speaker, all of these proposed pieces of legislation do one of three things: They either increase transparency or they increase parental rights or—" ],

Then, all of a sudden, they do the public part of the meeting when nobody is around and nobody is allowed to be in, or anything of the sort.", "To say that Bill 68 will fix that—no, because they can only enforce the rules that are there.

These are uploads which reverse what the previous Conservative government did when they downloaded those responsibilities financially to municipalities.", "The OMPF: $505 million in unconditional supports to municipalities. That’s primarily, and understandably so, in rural and northern municipalities.", "The OCIF: $100 million a year, which will increase to $300 million a year in 2018-19.", "We decided to take a portion of the gas tax—I don’t call it the “gas tax.” I’ll call this fund the “provincial transit fund.” We take two cents of the gas tax; that will go to four cents of the gas tax. That has had a profound effect on local transit systems, where the gas tax now is $334 million to 99 municipalities, including many small, rural and northern communities. That’s extremely beneficial to them. It allows them to expand their service and to enhance their service. We see much better buses now, for instance, more environmentally sensitive buses, which operate in a better fashion and have better fuel efficiency.", "I’m pleased that the government of Ontario has made those moves in recent years.

The member from St. Catharines actually gave a number: $2 billion in uploads, and an additional $2 billion of funding that wasn’t there when we first came into government. Not to mention that, down the road, there will be more gas-tax funding. I can tell you that the good people of Mississauga are really, really pleased with the uploading of funding.", "Speaking more to this bill, I know that the people of Mississauga will be very pleased with the idea of an integrity commissioner at the municipal level.

This bill goes some way in, once again, restoring some more powers to municipalities, and greater flexibility in how they go about their business. Overall, I know that the people of Mississauga are going to appreciate this bill." ],

This is a bill that actually does contain some very positive measures, but it’s also full of a few concerning elements. We are pleased that the legislation looks at a number of items that municipalities requested, such as the definitions of meetings, expanding prudent investor rules to all municipalities, and moving the start date of new councils.", "The PC caucus is also pleased to see the updates to the Municipal Conflict of Interest Act, which includes new options for penalties. As servants of the public, elected officials—we believe—must be held to a high standard.", "The Association of Municipal Managers, Clerks and Treasurers of Ontario conducted a survey last year stating that 86% of Ontario councils have a code of conduct or are developing one. The municipalities of Chatham-Kent and Leamington already have their own codes of conduct for council. For those municipalities that have resisted adopting a code of conduct, this will in fact make them mandatory. It’s a small percentage of stragglers, but it’s important to get everybody on board.", "Bill 68 also seeks to address the issue of closed-door meetings. By including a clearer definition of what constitutes a meeting, it will make rules easier for the public to understand. Additionally, it will stop the use of informal gatherings of councillors in an effort to get around closed meeting rules.", "This is a positive step to increase accountability and transparency, and that’s something that I will always support. However, I was saddened to see another section of the bill that would reduce transparency and accountability.", "As our critic noted in his remarks, we have some serious concerns about the government’s proposal to allow municipal councillors to call in to council meetings instead of attending in person. It’s not transparent. That’s not accountable. Even Liberal MPPs understand that this is a bad change to make. The last time this government tried to pull off this change, their own members voted it down. They said that it was an accident, but they might have been being modest.", "The reasoning given by the government was that it would make it easier for rural and northern communities where weather may prevent councillors from attending meetings. Well, if that’s the reason, then why would they extend this change to the City of Toronto Act as well? Are Toronto suburbs considered rural to the Ontario Liberals? Well, it’s also worrisome that the ministry was unable to answer the question of whether calling into a meeting would count as an absence. How is it even possible to try to make this change without having an answer to such a basic question?", "Specifically, this bill would grant new abilities, meaning that, “A member of council, of a local board or of a committee of either of them, can participate electronically in a meeting which is open to the public to the extent and in the manner set out in the bylaw provided that any such member shall not be counted in determining whether or not a quorum of members is present at any point in time.”", "What does “participate electronically” mean, exactly? Maybe the next move for this government will be allowing people to Skype into council meetings; or maybe they’ll want to let people Snapchat their support during votes. Perhaps this Liberal government will also want to be able to tweet a new tax. Who knows? Maybe they’ll eventually try replacing MPPs in the Legislature with holograms.", "Here in the Legislature, every single minute of debate is recorded and broadcast in English and in French. They also provide all of the committee meetings. It takes an incredible amount of work each and every day to broadcast the happenings of the Legislature on TV and online. Why do we broadcast everything that is said or done in the people’s House? For big ratings? No, we broadcast our words and our actions because it is incredibly important to be open and transparent. Our words and actions matter, and the public has the right to watch elected officials as they meet, if they so choose.", "Speaker, the truly ridiculous thing is that the Liberals are working hard to ensure politicians can skip meetings and vote from the beach in Florida. I know it sounds wild, yet here we are in 2017 and electronic petitions are still not accepted by the Ontario Legislature. That really says it all about where their priorities lie. Companies are designing autonomous cars, but in Ontario you can’t file a petition electronically. Instead, the government wants people to be able to vote from the beach in another country—and I say that with a rather perplexed look on my face.", "Technology should be used to help people have their say, not to help politicians get their way. That’s all I have to say about that.", "There are also a few other troubling elements of this bill dealing with election financing. Last year, Minister McMeekin said, “We hope to increase transparency in municipal elections, so we are proposing a framework to regulate third-party advertising in order to increase accountability for advertisers and ensure more fair and transparent support. This would include setting contribution and spending limits.”", "Sounds good, right? Well, not so fast. Only a few months later, the same government introduced this bill, which seeks to dramatically increase those very same contributions they previously said they wanted to limit. They would increase from $750 to $1,200. This change would mean that fewer, larger donors would be helping to decide crucial elections through large campaign contributions.", "Bill 68 seeks to make a change that would allow municipal staff to access private property with no requirement to ask permission. The bill states: “A municipality may enter on land adjoining land owned or occupied by the municipality, at any reasonable time, for the purpose of maintaining or making repairs or alterations to the land owned or occupied by the municipality but only to the extent necessary to carry out the maintenance, repairs or alterations.” It’s all about private property.", "This would cover routine maintenance and non-urgent repairs. I’m sure that many people would not feel comfortable in their homes knowing that municipal staff can enter at any time without notice for non-emergencies. This is an invasive, overreaching power that could do a lot of harm in the wrong hands.", "Bill 68 also dumps new costs onto municipalities while this government cuts the grants they depend on. Specifically, this bill requires municipalities to provide access to an integrity commissioner. This is a positive thing, but the question is, who will pay for this? Not the province, that’s for sure.", "Although it is helpful that the bill would allow municipalities to share an integrity commissioner with one another to cut down on these extra costs, the Association of Municipalities of Ontario recommended instead that the provincial Integrity Commissioner be the default adviser for municipalities. That would address the concern about extra costs being dumped to municipalities.", "Despite some of this bill’s positive elements, I cannot support a bill that has the potential to damage our democracy. The removal of transparency and accountability by allowing elected officials to skip meetings and participate electronically will surely lead to some politicians spending more time away from the communities that they are supposed to be serving. It will provide a degree of separation at a time when officials and their constituents should be coming together.", "So, Speaker, it’s for these reasons that I am unable to support Bill 68, Modernizing Ontario’s Municipal Legislation Act, at second reading. We also know that the government has a majority government and of course this bill is going to pass, but I would hope that the minister and those in committee would have an open ear to amendments that we would be bringing forward." ],

One of the ministers talked about having an open forum from June 2016 until October 2016. But I’d like to ask the question of the government: Was that strictly for submissions by email or did they actually travel the province and hear from the public? I think that’s very important to openness and transparency. Many people prefer to have their presentations done in person. It also talks to the point of where the government is going about voting during municipal decisions. If they are going to use electronic means to do that, maybe now they are using electronic means to do their consultations.

I don’t think that’s a partisan comment. I think it’s a fact, and I think it’s a reason why a lot of people ran for provincial office in 2003. They were not a happy bunch. I include myself in that group. It was certainly part of the decision-making for me in terms of why I chose to run provincially.", "When the member was making his comments, Speaker, and some of the criticisms or comments contained in his remarks—I think if you look at it a little closer, you would see that some of the steps we’re taking in this legislation demonstrate a respect for the municipal order of government.", "He spent a fair bit of time talking about electronic meetings. I think it’s important to know that people miss meetings all the time already. This might actually enhance participation. It’s important for the public to know that you still need to have quorum before you can hold a public meeting. It will not be considered a meeting unless there is quorum. You can’t have more people phone in or Skype in or however it would be done. There has to be a quorum in person for the meeting to occur.", "That’s one example. It would be enabled by the municipality. They would have to pass a bylaw. We’re not forcing it on them, and that ties back to my remarks at the beginning. This is a demonstration of our respect for municipalities as an order of government that has an ability to make their own choices. This is an example of that. They can pass a bylaw to do it, or they don’t have to. It would be up to them.", "Broadening municipal investment powers is another example. They can’t run deficits on the operating side. We’re changing the rule to allow them to invest differently to help them perhaps gain better returns, if they so choose, and to be able to sustain themselves more appropriately and better than they already can. Thank you for your time." ],

We took that on at the Ontario Good Roads Association and ROMA that year, through asking and putting that question on the floor of the bear pit over and over again; finally, the government relented, because they were embarrassed about it.

  "text" : [ "I’m pleased to rise today for the next 20 minutes and continue debate on Bill 89, Supporting Children, Youth and Families Act, 2016. I will start with basically a brief overview and then delve into some specifics, Speaker.", "The Child and Family Services Act is 32 years old. An update is well overdue. The purpose of the changes in this act is to protect vulnerable children and make sure that the child is at the centre of all decision-making. Children deserve a safe and loving home which respects them as individuals.", "We support giving children rights and a voice in their own future. For too long there have been serious deficiencies in the system which have let our most vulnerable slip through the cracks, and in some cases we have seen death occur. I can point to Jeffrey Baldwin and Katelynn Sampson, who I will talk about a bit later, Speaker.", "With respect to the changes in this bill, what this bill will bring, there is updated language in the bill which is consistent with the language used in the Ontario Human Rights Code. We see that as one of the basic changes.", "This bill increases the age of child protection to include 16- and 17-year olds.", "This bill will provide renewed emphasis on the treatment of indigenous children.", "A final change is that there is additional oversight of children’s aid societies and funding and accountability.", "Before I get into the specifics, though, I do have to address some additional points with respect to the Auditor General. As I said right at the onset, these changes are long overdue. While we’re happy to see the government take action on this, it really does sadden us to know that it took three separate audits from the Auditor General before any substantial action was taken. After 13 years and audits in 2003, 2008 and again in 2016, the Auditor General found that the minister was still not monitoring the delivery of services to ensure that children were receiving adequate treatment. That is unacceptable in Ontario.", "In 2016, the Auditor General found that the Ministry of Children and Youth Services had not been measuring “individual agency performance against targets, and does not effectively monitor client outcomes or overall program performance against measurable and meaningful targets.” Again, that, at this stage, is simply unacceptable.", "If we looked a little deeper into the 2016 Auditor General report—let’s look at some of the facts. The auditor has highlighted four important points, the first being that “there is a risk that the mental health of children and youth can deteriorate while waiting for service, but little is done to monitor wait time trends and their impact.” We believe and understand and trust what the auditor is suggesting here about that additional risk to our youth.", "The auditor also pointed that “agencies do not monitor and assess client outcomes to determine if clients benefited from the services they received.” When you look at a key performance indicator—or KPI, as it’s called in the financial sector—you need to measure it. You can’t fix what you can’t measure. That’s why it’s important to have an outcome determined.", "The third point is that the “ministry does not fund agencies based on the current needs of children and youth served.” Again, we go back to the fact that this act hasn’t changed in 32 years. We go back to the fact that the auditor pointed this out in 2003, 2008 and 2016. Here we are today, and the ministry still does not fund based on the current needs.", "The final fact from the Auditor General tells us that the “ministry does not monitor the performance of the program or agencies to facilitate corrective action,” wherever it is deemed to be needed, “and does not collect data on all current ministry performance indicators.” That’s the KPI, or key performance indicators, that I spoke about. If you don’t collect that data and you’re still funding things and you know it’s not at the right level, you’re not going to be able to fund it properly without having a thorough understanding of what those performance indicators are. That’s why we need to have the Auditor General’s key facts acted upon, and acted upon quickly.", "This part, Speaker, will be a little bit boring or pedestrian. I’m going to actually list all of the acts that are affected, because, as I say, it hasn’t been touched in all of these decades. We are going to see that in Bill 89, supporting children, we’re going to affect dozens upon dozens of acts here:", "—the Assessment Act;", "—the Broader Public Sector Accountability Act will be affected;", "—the Child Care and Early Years Act will be affected;", "—Child, Youth and Family Services Act;", "—Children’s Law Reform Act;", "—Christopher’s Law—that’s the sex offender registry of 2000—will be affected;", "—City of Toronto Act, 2006;", "—Compensation for Victims of Crime Act;", "—Coroners Act;", "—Corporations Tax Act;", "—Courts of Justice Act;", "—Early Childhood Educators Act;", "—the Education Act itself;", "—the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act will be affected by this;", "—French Language Services Act;", "—Health Care Consent Act;", "—Health Protection and Promotion Act;", "—Intercountry Adoption Act;", "—Jewish Family and Child Service of Metropolitan Toronto Act;", "—Long-Term Care Homes Act;", "—the Ministry of Community and Social Services Act will be affected;", "—Ministry of Correctional Services Act;", "—the Municipal Act—which we’re also working on in Bill 68 currently, which I spoke on this morning—is going to be affected in this bill as well, as well as it was affected in Bill 80 just before our winter break;", "—Ontario Works Act;", "—Pay Equity Act;", "—Pension Benefits Act;", "—Perpetuities Act;", "—Personal Health Information Protection Act;", "—Police Record Checks Reform Act;", "—Private Hospitals Act;", "—Provincial Advocate for Children and Youth Act;", "—Public Sector Labour Relations Transition Act;", "—Residential Tenancies Act;", "—Substitute Decisions Act;", "—Vital Statistics Act; and, finally,", "—the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act will also be affected.", "As you can see, this is all-encompassing. It has taken a long time to get it here—decades. And now we’re about to embark on a tremendous amount of work that has been done and that will continue to be done. Then, hopefully, we can see additional work done through some amendments if this bill passes and gets into committee.", "Basically, Speaker, I want to speak about part I, “Purposes.” Again, the purposes of this act—and there are many. But the beginning of “Purposes” is to support the integrity and autonomy of the family. This act at least appears to take the least disruptive actions. I think all in this House—and indeed, perhaps, in this province—believe that services to children and young persons should be provided in a manner that, first, respects a child’s need for continuity of care and for stable relationships with family and cultural environment. It should take into account the physical, emotional, spiritual, mental and developmental needs. It should take into account a young person’s surroundings, whether it’s race or ancestry, their colour, their ethnic origin, and a long—indeed, a long list that must be taken into account with respect to children and youth. That would also include cultural and linguistic needs.", "At the end of the day, when you include all, Speaker, it really needs to provide a service in a manner that builds on the strength of the families. That, I think, is the underlying essence of this. It should include the participation of the child or the young person, their parents, their extended family and indeed the community, if that is what it takes to achieve the end goals I think we all want. It should respect regional differences. It should build on the strengths that we find in families.", "It should recognize the culture, the heritage, the tradition, the connection to community and concept of extended family for First Nations, Inuit and Métis children. This act is going to begin to recognize a lot of these, Speaker, because a lot has happened in 32 years.", "I want to talk again for a moment about the children’s and young persons’ rights. This act actually outlines the rights of children and the young persons who are receiving services.", "This will allow the youth, as defined, to express their own views freely and safely about matters that affect them. You can tell, Speaker, this is not something that may have occurred 30 years ago. This is a positive change.", "The children and the young people are to be engaged through an honest and respectful dialogue about how and why decisions that affect them are made, and to have their views given due weight in accordance with their age and maturity. Again, you would not have seen this 30 years ago.", "The children are to be consulted on the nature of the services provided, or to be provided, to them and advised of the decisions made in respect of those services.", "It’s interesting, Speaker. I watched an episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit last night, and it really did address this in the most interesting way. As I say, I’ve talked for almost 15 minutes; I’ve got five more minutes to go—but a few lines from the show last night encapsulated everything we were talking about. There was a young child who was in crisis and was able to be brought in to speak directly to a judge. The judge and the prosecutors talked about the fact that had this happened only X years ago, a generation ago, 20 years ago, the judge would not be able to speak to that young child. He or she would have to speak to the prosecutor and/or the parents, but never to the child. But last night they talked in the episode about how they can actually speak to the child now.", "So much has evolved; so much has changed. As I was preparing this, I was thinking when I saw the show last night, “My gosh, that’s exactly what I’m going to be talking about tomorrow afternoon.” And here it is. Whether it’s life replicating art or art replicating life, we’re all catching up, and I think that’s really the message that I want to see delivered today.", "As I continue talking about the children’s and young persons’ rights, the fourth point would be to be able to raise concerns or recommend changes with respect to the services provided or to be provided to them without interference or fear of coercion, discrimination or reprisal.", "They will be informed in language suitable to their understanding. Again, we talked about that earlier, in which some of those languages and cultures include—they will be informed about their rights, under this section.", "They will be informed, in language suitable to their understanding, of the existence and role of their Provincial Advocate for Children and Youth, and how the provincial advocate may be contacted. Again, Speaker, many people may have already thought this occurs, but it doesn’t.", "These are changes that are going to allow those things to be able to happen, where we can speak directly to the youth and the children who are affected.", "This part also prohibits service providers and foster parents from using corporal punishment. If you can imagine, we need to have this written. And that corporal punishment includes detention in a locked room and use of mechanical restraints. It’s interesting that here we are in 2017, and we’re addressing this today, Speaker.", "Children also have a right to be heard with respect to the decisions that will affect them with respect to treatment, education, training or work, creed, community, identity and cultural identity, discharge from a residential placement or transfer.", "They will also have the right to have their views given due weight. They count. Their views will matter.", "Again, they have the right to be informed in language suitable to their understanding.", "They have a right to a plan of care within 30 days.", "The youth and children will be able to participate in the development of their plan. They will receive meals that are well balanced. They will be provided with good-quality clothing, will receive medical and dental care, will receive education that corresponds to their aptitudes and abilities, will participate in recreational and athletic activities.", "Speaker, earlier, I went through the dozens of acts that will be affected, and these are but a few. I wanted to focus on these first because I wasn’t sure how long I would spend in the preamble. But I think it is important—at least, it’s important to me—to talk about the endgame here. This is all about the children, the youth, and what is needed for them and what has been lacking in some cases for them. I really believe that this act—we do have amendments that we will be bringing forward should this bill pass and get to committee stage. I hope that as much careful attention is given to the amendments as was obviously paid in drafting and crafting this bill. It’s important.", "Again, as I said earlier, it’s long overdue. The auditor was very clear almost 14 years ago—2003, 2008, 2016. I look forward to an audit report when the auditor sums up the various committee work and the various acts that have been passed, and I’m looking forward to the check mark in this part of the Auditor General’s report, whether it’s December 2017 or beyond." ],

Quite frankly, probably where the bill stemmed from was after the inquest about Katelynn Sampson.", "We’ll start with the preamble. The preamble is strong and talks about all of the principles that need to be enacted and what the meaning of the bill is, but when we get to the actual bill, in the legislation there’s no teeth. If you don’t read the preamble, you would never understand any of the principles of Katelynn’s Principle. You wouldn’t see any of that. It’s not reflected in the bill. I’m not the only person who is saying that. All of the stakeholders who I’ve met with feel the same thing. There’s nothing to actually uphold those standards, to measure the standards, to enforce the standards. There’s no teeth in the bill to actually make sure that children are listened to and that they must be listened to and that they must be respected. That’s a big concern that we have as New Democrats.", "I’ve heard from stakeholders that they would like to see Bill 57, Katelynn’s Principle, be a companion piece of legislation to Bill 89, to actually put some teeth into it, and to give it an underlying basis of something that people could grab on to, and to know that speaking and listening to and ensuring that children’s needs are met and respected would be the most important part of enacting Bill 89. So Bill 57, Katelynn’s Principle—a companion piece of legislation." ],

We have introduced the Ontario mental health and addictions strategy and the Moving on Mental Health strategy. Through Moving on Mental Health, my ministry has established 31 of 33 areas across the province to make it easier for families to know what services are available and how to access them.", "Specifically on Moving on Mental Health, it defines the common mental health services that must be available to everyone in the province, no matter where the child or the youth lives. Where there are lead agencies responsible for the delivery of these services, we need to make it easier for people to know where to go and how to access that help.", "The mental health and addictions strategy will support the creation of local service pathways through community-level planning across the sector. Community mental health agencies are working with the health and education sectors, such as hospitals and schools, to better coordinate service and supports.", "I know that we continue to look at those areas and we will do more work in that area going forward." ],

  "text" : [ "Thank you to the member from Nipissing for his very thoughtful comments on Bill 89 here this afternoon. No system is perfect. However, I think the vast majority of people who have made their way through our children’s aid societies have come out with positive results—but certainly not 100%. I know that in my region, the former Prince Edward County Children’s Aid Society a few years ago had some very, very serious charges laid at a number of foster homes where children were abused. You hate to see that type of thing happen, and that’s why it’s so necessary to update the legislation here that’s taken 32 years to get to this point, with Bill 89—and it’s not perfect either. There are some amendments that need to be made.", "There are many volunteers in our community, though, who need to be commended for the work that they do in volunteering their time to make sure that some of our most vulnerable children have the most positive experience they can get. Just on Saturday night at the Sears Atrium in Belleville, we had the annual Guardian Angel Gala, which is put on by the local Children’s Foundation, the charitable arm of the Highland Shores Children’s Aid Society. We honoured a couple of volunteers from Trenton. Ken and Cynthya Schmidt were awarded their guardian angel wings—they’re the owners of the McDonald’s restaurants in Trenton and Brighton—for the work that they do in ensuring that the children in our community have a better chance at life, particularly those who are wards of the CAS and in foster homes.", "I commend all of the volunteers, those who help raise money to help our most vulnerable children and those who sit on the boards. We need those types of volunteers on the boards at our children’s aid societies. We thank them for the work that they’re doing in our community, and we thank the member for Nipissing for his comments this afternoon as well." ],

She’s been a strong champion and advocate for issues impacting young people, and I think she deserves a lot of acknowledgement for that.", "She’s actually pointed out some key issues. Any time you want to address a problem and you enact legislation that seeks to address the problem—whether it’s the fair treatment of children or ensuring that children are kept at the centre of all discussions in all decisions—that legislation is only as strong as the enforcement. If there isn’t enforcement, if there isn’t a way to ensure that the policies or the preamble are actually implemented, then the legislation doesn’t really have the impact that we want.", "As it stands, one of the key criticisms that has been outlined by my colleague is that, sure, the preamble might be strong; sure, the language indicates the importance of putting the child at the centre of the discussion, but where are the remedies? Where are the measures to ensure that this is enforced? How can we ensure that every decision is actually followed through in this manner? What is the accountability in cases where it doesn’t actually happen that way? What are the remedies in those circumstances?", "We know that there have been some horrible examples of mistreatment of children in our province. This is something that we all share responsibility in. As legislators, we have to ensure that this doesn’t happen again.", "We have an opportunity now to remedy and rectify these problems, but we can’t do that unless we have legislation that’s strong. I think the suggestion that there is a companion piece—ensuring that the private member’s bill, Bill 57, Katelynn’s Principle, acts as a companion to ensure there is the enforcement—is a strong recommendation. I encourage the government to support it." ],

Our MPP from Stormont–Dundas–South Glengarry had brought a private member’s bill, Bill 32, the Right to Care Act (Children 16 Years of Age and Older), in 2016, and former MPP Rod Jackson’s Bill 8—which, at the time of discussion, had passed second reading, had passed committee during the last Parliament, and had all-party support. It also had proposed very similar steps.", "Mr. McDonnell’s bill summary said, “At a challenging time during their development, 16- and 17-year-olds deserve the right to access care services if they need them. The alternative could be youth homelessness or a deterioration of their physical and mental health, which prevent them from achieving their potential and affect local communities.”", "Speaker, we know that the expansion of the age of protection to age 16 and 17 has been widely called for by stakeholders, by children and by our very own members. Bill 89 does indeed require a children’s aid society to protect children aged 16 and 17, while the previous PC private members’ bills I spoke of offered children the option of children’s aid society protection." ],

  "text" : [ "It is my pleasure, as it always is my pleasure, to rise to share some thoughts on any legislation before this House. Today, we’re speaking about Bill 89, the Supporting Children, Youth and Families Act.", "Speaker, in the last—well, even today, in fact, we’ve heard people talking about the education system and children in the education system. I had a ministerial briefing on the Family Responsibility Office and the importance of support payments and what that means to the children who are supposed to benefit from those support payments, and now we’re talking about a piece of legislation speaking about children in care. I think it’s important to highlight the common theme, which is children.", "If there was any doubt in anybody’s mind, with the amount of discussion that we have about children in this House, even specifically for me today, it is crystal clear how important children are to our province and how important it is that we as adults and as legislators ensure that children are supported and that they’re protected so that they can grow up and go on to be whatever it is they want to be and do what they want to do—including, for some of them, standing where we are today and doing the job that we’re doing.", "I would like to start by commending my colleague from Hamilton Mountain, who is our critic for children and youth services, on the work that she has done specifically around the issue we’re addressing today, but on children’s issues in general. She is a tireless advocate for the youth of this province. I know that it is something that is very near and dear to her heart. I want to commend her for the incredible work that she has been doing.", "Speaker, because I’m speaking about my colleague from Hamilton Mountain, it’s important to point out that last year she brought forward a bill, Bill 57, called Katelynn’s Principle. It was specifically addressing children in care, and how, when decisions are being made on their behalf, they have to be included in that process. They have to have a voice and consideration in that process. It is paramount that when adults are making decisions for children in care, that they actually get to know those children, that they have conversations with them, that they listen to what the needs, the desires, the thoughts of these children are and base their decisions around that.", "Now, I’m not talking about—any of us who have children know our kids will come to us to and tell us that they need to have that candy, that new video game, that specific brand of jeans. I’m not talking about that. I’m talking about when a child is in care and they’re expressing that they’re struggling with a particular issue while in care, that needs to be taken into consideration, that needs to weigh heavily when it comes to the decisions that are being made on their behalf.", "When I had an opportunity to speak to my colleague’s bill, I shared a very personal story. It was around the fact that I myself am adopted. When I was placed for adoption, I was not immediately put into the home of the family that raised me. I actually went into foster care for a year. So I spent some time in care.", "The point that I was making when I was talking about my own personal story—because I can honestly tell you that, at a year old, I don’t remember what it was like to be in care. I don’t remember the foster home, although I can tell you that my foster parents were fantastic. They took notes. They talked about the dog and my relationship with their dog, with their two boys—so my foster brothers. They wrote down my eating schedule, my sleeping schedule, the things that made me laugh, the things that made me cry, so that when I was placed into a home, they were able to give that information to my forever family. They were, from what I can tell, wonderful people, but I don’t personally remember being in care.", "What I do know is that because of the work of the foster family, because of being placed in a forever home, I had an opportunity to go on and do whatever I wanted to. Some days I walk into this building and I think, “How the heck did I get here?” How did someone like me land in a place like this doing the job that I’m doing knowing where I’ve come from and some of the struggles that I’ve had? The answer to that is it’s because of the support that I’ve received. It’s because there were people along the way who actually consulted me and asked me as a child what it was I wanted, what my thoughts were on certain topics, what I wanted to be when I grew up and how they could support me to get me to where I am.", "I think that’s really the core of what my colleague’s bill was trying to address: that we need to make sure that children in care are getting the same opportunity that I had, getting the same considerations, getting the same supports that I received so that they can go on to maybe someday do the job that I’m doing, and hopefully make a difference in the lives of other children.", "The bill before us, Bill 89—as it has been pointed out, the preamble says all the right things. It says everything that it needs to say. Unfortunately, when you really get into the bill, into the meat of it, there’s not a lot of substance. There are not a lot of actionable items. There are not a lot of teeth in the bill. That’s rather unfortunate, because it is the lives of children that we’re talking about, and trying to give them the best opportunity so we don’t find another case like Katelynn. Katelynn didn’t have the opportunity that I have. Unfortunately, Katelynn will never have the opportunity to stand and do what I’m doing. When we’re looking at legislation like this, we need to make sure that it’s really good, solid, comprehensive legislation so that we never, ever have to find ourselves talking about another child like Katelynn, whose life ended well before it should have, and needlessly.", "We also need to be talking about making sure there is funding in place to support anything that’s in the legislation. So to say this is what we want to do, this is what we’re going to do, and the people that are put in the position of having to fulfill the legislation that we enact—if we’re going to make people actually do these things, we need to make sure the funding is in place to provide them with the opportunity, the tools they need to actually do the job and do it well. What we are finding is that more and more funding is being dialed back, it’s being cut, and the workloads of those front-line workers, those that would actually have to fulfill what we’ve put in legislation, are increasing, but they don’t have the tools to do their job. They are finding themselves more and more stretched and they are unable to reach the children and help the children that they really want to help and that they’re meant to help.", "A case in point: the CAS workers, CUPE Local 2049, who are currently locked out. They are in Nipissing and Parry Sound, and they’re currently locked out. It’s important to point out that when they are locked out, that means they are not able to provide service to these children. We have children who are vulnerable to begin with, and now they’re in an even more precarious or unstable environment because they don’t have the supports, the workers that they need in place. And rather than using the skilled workers, those that actually know the work and have been trained to provide the services—instead of having them, there have been replacement workers brought in, people who don’t have the education or the knowledge or the skills to navigate the system and help these children.", "For these workers that are currently locked out, one of their biggest concerns that they brought forward is workload and not being given the tools that they need, or the time, frankly, that they need to provide the services to make sure that children who are in care are safe and are thriving. I think that’s a really sad statement to make.", "When we’re talking about the protection and the safety of children, that’s something to be taken incredibly seriously. We do need to make sure, and this legislation does not do that—it doesn’t talk about funding that system properly; it doesn’t talk about supporting the workers in the system, the front-line workers that are actually going to service and help these children. This legislation doesn’t offer any of that. I believe it was a missed opportunity on the part of the government to really look at the system and, rather than put a preamble in that sounds great and talks about all the right things, actually put legislation in place that includes all of the tools that not only the front-line workers need but, frankly, Speaker, the tools that these children need to be able to thrive in the environment that they are put in and go on to do incredible things." ],

They were recognized—actually, I believe it was by New York state—for the achievement. Akwesasne looks after New York, Ontario and Quebec, so it’s a little bit of an anomaly when it comes to a municipality. But it certainly took those services back and has been very successful in providing them in their own community.", "It just goes to show that there are good ways of doing things and there are positive things in front of us, and with today’s technology we should be able to move to those places faster. We should be able to look around, and instead of reinventing the wheel all the time, try to go to places where they’ve been successful, to see what’s working and look on improving those. Instead of rebuilding—we talk about the CPIN computer program, another example of building something from scratch and it doesn’t work. The government has a record of being unable to handle IT programs. Go to somebody where it’s working. Let’s look at the small improvements that take a successful operation and make it better." ],

I was struck certainly by the very personal story by the member for Windsor West. That kind of personal experience is invaluable as you try to frame a piece of legislation that is about doing everything possible for what I might say is Ontario’s most precious resource, our children.", "Just reflecting on the story of the member from Windsor West, probably one of my best friends in Peterborough, Glenn Pagett, who served with me on Peterborough city council, and his wife, Velma, had their first son, Joel, who was by birth their son. Then there were some medical complications that they couldn’t have any other children. So they adopted a fine young girl, Julie, whom I got to know extremely well through my association with the Pagett family.", "I remember quite vividly chatting with Glenn and Velma when it came to a point in Julie’s life where Glenn and Velma wanted to introduce Julie to her actual birth parents. That’s a very, very emotional situation for a 17-year-old—Julie was 17 at the time—to finally get introduced to her birth parents. Glenn and Velma really provided the great basis for that to happen. I remember going through that with the Pagett family.", "Again, it’s about how these things evolve and how that gives you great experience in life, and certainly with Bill 89.", "My last term on Peterborough city council was between 2000 and 2003, before I got elected to the Ontario Legislature. I was one of the council’s representatives on the Kawartha-Haliburton Children’s Aid Society. That for me was a great personal experience in order to see the phenomenal work that is done by children’s aid societies in terms of crown wards and looking at foster families, as the member from Windsor West describes so well, to provide that nurturing framework and that important foundation, a basis for character, as one certainly evolves through life.", "I talk to my wife, Karan, frequently about these matters. She is a principal at St. Patrick elementary school in Peterborough. From time to time, she has students who are involved with the Kawartha-Haliburton Children’s Aid Society. We must all work together to make sure that we look after our children each and every day.", "Again, I think this is a rare opportunity, a rare opportunity in Bill 89 for all sides to work together. It will go through, I have no doubt, with a series of amendments, if all sides collectively work together to make sure that this becomes a great piece of legislation that all 107 members can take pride in, because we’re doing something fundamental, important and caring for every Ontarian, almost 14 million Ontarians, to do our best to make sure that we provide this kind of commitment to our children.", "Mr. Speaker, you well know—your wife is a teacher—that every time we get the opportunity to go into elementary schools and secondary schools just to see the kind of talent that’s really there—I’m often asked, “What does the future look like for Ontario?” I always assure everybody, and I can assure you, Mr. Speaker, that the future is in good hands with those young men and women who are in elementary and secondary school.", "We have an opportunity. You know, one of my great political advisers is my son Braden, who is 18 years old. He likes to chat with me on a day-to-day basis. I value his opinions highly when he’s giving Dad some very sage advice when it comes to public policy in the province of Ontario. When you are in classrooms and you just take the time—as I know you have, Mr. Speaker, and all 107 members—to sit down beside and chat with the kids, you learn something important each and every day. I think, as I said, that we have a real opportunity, through Bill 89, for all members of this Legislature to do something very, very important that we could all take pride in.", "With those remarks, Mr. Speaker, I want to turn it over to my colleague the hard-working member for Etobicoke–Lakeshore." ],

As we heard, it has been over 30 years since this act was last revised. How the world has changed; how our attitude to children, to families has evolved in that time.", "Many of the provisions in this act are indeed long overdue: increasing the age of protection to 16- and 17-year-olds; affirming the rights of children; affirming Katelynn’s Principle in this legislation, that children have a voice, have a right to be respected and have a right to participate in the process of decision-making around their care, their placement and their treatment.", "It’s also very important to me personally that expectations for how service providers are supposed to conduct themselves are a part of this bill. My wife and I went through the adoption process, and while the outcome was fabulous—a beautiful, healthy, wonderful daughter—the process itself was awful. At many times, there were comments that were completely inappropriate. There was information that was misleading. There was information that was withheld. The important thing was to focus on our daughter, which we did, and as I said, everything worked out fine, but that’s in our case. There might be other cases where it would not be so. That’s why it’s important that this legislation moves forward.", "As has been said earlier, this is a piece of legislation that all members in this House, all sides in this House, I’m confident, will work on together. This is not a partisan issue in any way. This is about our children. Everybody in this room was a child, of course, or a parent or a grandparent, and we all understand how important it is to include our children in these decisions.", "Aspects of this bill which I think are incredibly important are enshrining the CPIN in it and the ability to track children, track children’s history, track children’s care, track the interactions that various service providers would have with the child over the course of their young life to ensure that nobody falls through the cracks again—so incredibly important. As I said, to me and my wife the knowledge that the government will have more ability to hold service providers and children’s aid societies to account as to how they conduct themselves is incredibly important.", "We’re in second reading on this legislation. It will move on to committee. I’m confident that there will be many well-thought-out amendments that will be brought forward as we think long and hard on how we can best protect our most vulnerable children who are in the care of these societies.", "We know that children who are given supports early on and throughout each stage of their development become successful. They don’t become a burden on themselves or on the rest of society. That is why getting this right is so incredibly important. I am proud to be participating in the development of this most needed reform to this legislation." ],

It’s in place in a few locations, but they’re saying it will be 2020, 2021 to finish this.", "I go back to a case that I’m aware of back in our own neighbourhood, where I guess what you’d call a bad player was involved with dealing with children, was close to getting identified in another area and so moved into our community, and got identified by accident by somebody who was visiting the house to drop something off and noticed the children and the state they were in. Of course the police were called and the person was identified and charged.", "There was an article about a month after that talking about this family and saying it was the worst case in the history of Quebec for child abuse.

It talks about the importance of not only having a tracking system, but having the ability to correspond with other areas.", "Unfortunately, that happened I’m going to say 25 years ago or more, but here we are in 2017 and we still haven’t got a tracking system in place.

When we’re doing something as large as replacing an entire act, that’s something I hope the government will take into consideration. I understand they feel that they have timelines and constraints, and they want to be able to make those timelines, but making the timelines with a poor piece of legislation won’t be good enough for the people of Ontario.", "I wanted to hit on what the member from Etobicoke–Lakeshore talked about.

It makes those parts of the legislation very difficult to be able to discuss and to be able to debate, when we don’t actually know what those details look like.", "A lot of that is happening within this legislation, a lot is being left to regulation, so there is so much conversation to be had.

I know that our children’s aid society in Kingston and the Islands has gone forward with the CPIN program, and it’s a challenge for staff. I have been hearing from the staff.

It seems like, for whatever reason—and I’m not trying to be critical here, but I want to understand why technology and government don’t seem to evolve as quickly as technology in the private sector. We’ve seen so many examples over the years, whether it’s eHealth and the amount of time it’s taken—I know it’s a complex system, and there are a lot of medical records, and there are a lot of people involved, and Ontario is a very large jurisdiction. But it blows my mind, how long it takes and how expensive it is for the government of Ontario to move into technology.", "We saw it with the SAMS system in our Comsoc sector, and how there was a terrible, terrible launch of SAMS that created chaos, not just for the clients in that sector but also the employees who work in that sector, and why it didn’t work, and so much more money had to be invested in that.", "Now we’re hearing the same thing with the CPIN. It’s taking longer to get it up and running, and it’s obviously going to cost more.", "In the private sector, technology seems to move ahead at the speed of light, but whenever government wants to get involved in technology, it seems to take forever and cost a lot of money.

It was called for debate on February 22, March 1, March 6, and here we are today.", "This is a very, very important piece of legislation, and I would say that at the outset. I think that, of all the responsibilities that the provincial government has—and we have significant responsibilities—the protection of vulnerable children has to be amongst the highest priorities. We all know of situations that have arisen over the years that are very troubling, very tragic, very sad, and obviously, the legislative framework has to be in place to ensure the level of protection that these vulnerable children need. That’s why I think that we’ve got to take great care with this issue.", "This bill is long—270 pages. We’re going to have to ensure, when the bill goes to committee, that it receives adequate public hearings and clause-by-clause scrutiny to ensure that everything is done as it should be.", "I would say, at the outset, that we support this bill in principle, and we expect it to pass because it’s a government bill. From the debate I’ve heard so far, it seems that all members of the House—who have spoken, at least—in all caucuses support the bill in principle and believe that, after 32 years, we do need to update this piece of legislation.", "But again, the bill needs to go to a standing committee, and it needs to have public hearings and there needs to be, as I said, very, very close scrutiny by all members of the House. I would hope that that can take place.", "So why do we support it, Mr. Speaker? Again, our caucus believes that, because of the fact that the Child and Family Services Act is 32 years old, changes are needed to ensure that our most vulnerable children are protected and provided the best service possible, and that these changes are long overdue.", "We believe that, for many years, many organizations and stakeholders have pointed to the ongoing issues with the child welfare system. The Auditor General has laid out problems with the ministry’s accountability in three different audits—2003, 2008 and 2016—and expressed concerns on a number of occasions. Obviously, this Legislature needs to respond to those legitimate concerns that have been expressed.", "We believe that children deserve a safe and loving home, which respects them as individuals. We support giving children rights and a voice in their future. For too long, we believe, there have been serious deficiencies in the system, which have let some of our most vulnerable children literally slip through the cracks and, in some cases, caused their tragic deaths.", "A couple of names that keep coming up in this debate. We think of Katelynn Sampson, who was seven years old, lived in Parkdale and tragically died in August 2008. She was in the care of two legal guardians who had been given custody of her, and they were ultimately charged with her murder. Katelynn died of septic shock. To read the story of Katelynn Sampson, as I did again today—and I recall reading about it when the newspaper stories initially appeared—it is so tragic that it brings you to tears.", "We also think of a little boy, Jeffrey Baldwin, who lived in Toronto and, at the age of five, died tragically in 2013 in the care of his grandparents, who, in turn, were charged with his murder.", "Again, it’s the saddest details you can ever imagine when you read these stories, just imagining the circumstances that these poor children were in. We as a society, we as a government, we as children’s aid societies weren’t able to step in and do what needed to be done to protect these children. There are other examples. Those are two that come to mind and that have been talked about recently.", "I do, though, want to express my appreciation to Family and Children’s Services of Guelph and Wellington County and the staff and volunteers who support that agency, as well as the Halton Children’s Aid Society. I represent, as you know, Mr. Speaker, the town of Halton Hills, so I have an involvement with both of those agencies. I think that their staff are outstanding professionals who are caring, compassionate and are doing a great job on behalf of the families and children in our community. I also believe that, through the support of volunteers, there is great work being done.", "I would also want to point out the foster parents, of course, who do incredible work in our communities. I think of my friends Gord and Wilma Tosh from Rockwood, who have been foster parents for more than 30 years and have fostered 80 children over that time, in addition to the two naturally born children that they’ve had. They’re an incredible couple. I’ve known them for years because of their multiple involvements in our community. They deserve enormous credit for what they’ve done for the people of Ontario. It’s interesting how they keep in touch with many of these children, who are now adults. Many of them still call them Mom and Dad, which is really a heartwarming story. So there are great stories of success. Even though we talk about where the system has failed, there are great success stories that we need to remember as well.", "There are issues that need to be discussed in the course of second reading debate on this bill, most likely at committee as well. The question of whether or not we should be encouraging the amalgamation of children’s aid societies; whether or not bigger is better—bigger might be more efficient or less efficient; whether or not communities lose their voice if we have bigger agencies: Those are serious questions. I think that, before we enter into discussions of amalgamations, we obviously have to do a really thorough and honest assessment of the costs and the benefits, as opposed to having a forced marriage of some of these children’s aid societies, forced by the minister or the Legislature.", "I think the issue of what the powers of the minister will be is an important one for discussion. I know my colleague the member for Dufferin–Caledon raised a number of concerns about that. I was reading her speech. I think that those issues need to be carefully reviewed and clarified.", "The authority of volunteer boards and what is the appropriate scope of their authority: again, a very important question that needs to be thoroughly discussed and examined by a standing committee—" ],

We need to carefully study and evaluate the outcomes of the work that’s being done by our children’s aid societies to ensure that we are measuring progress, that our outcomes are getting better and better all the time, and, if not, studying how we can improve those outcomes and ensuring that there are adequate resources to discharge this very important responsibility.", "I also want to recognize the member for Haliburton–Kawartha Lakes–Brock and the great work she has done on the issue of human trafficking.

Of course, that built upon work that was done by our previous member for Barrie, Rod Jackson, who brought forward a similar private member's bill to allow for temporary care agreements for 16- and 17-year-olds. As we know, previously when a child turned 16, they were no longer eligible for the care that was provided by the children’s aid societies. Now, of course, with this piece of government legislation, we’re going to be including children who are aged 16 and 17. They will be eligible for care up until the age of 18. So that’s a good thing too.", "I have some other comments I want to add, but I will perhaps reserve them until after I’ve had my two-minute response. Hopefully, I can include some of them. But, again, I would reiterate: This is absolutely, vitally important to the province of Ontario, this piece of legislation. We have to get it right. We have to ensure that in the committee hearings and clause-by-clause consideration of the bill, we take the time to get this right. It’s so vitally important. Quite frankly, children’s lives are at stake, and we’ve got to make sure that we do all that we can to ensure their adequate protection." ],

When we’re talking about bringing 16- and 17-year-olds into the system, and there’s the debate through stakeholders of: Is it appropriate to say that they only have to come in if they so choose—because I’m hearing the other side of it as well. Sometimes they are in danger and don’t recognize their own danger. They could be involved in human trafficking. They could be involved in a dangerous situation where they would be afraid to say yes. Then I read in another part of the bill that a judge has the right to enforce that they are brought into care. So there are a lot of questions around what’s happening with 16- and 17-year-olds.", "The most important part that I think is happening with 16- and 17-year-olds is the funding. I’ve heard from many stakeholders that there’s no funding envelope being offered with this bill. There are a lot of changes that are happening here, and if the funding dollars are not there to go with them, then this is all for naught. They won’t be able to bring in those 16- and 17-year-olds when they’re already underfunded, they’re already struggling to make ends meet to ensure they’re meeting the no-deficit budget that is mandated on them.", "Without giving the children’s aid societies the dollars to bring it in, without ensuring what the measurement is, how we’re seeing if a 16- or 17-year-old is in danger, are they part of something where they’re not safe—what’s going to ensure that we’re bringing them into the fold, and are the dollars going to be there to cover it?" ],

I know that’s something that has been brought up before. This proposed legislation is going to introduce new accountability powers to hold societies accountable for compliance issues, the quality of their services and management, and their governance capabilities. It includes providing the minister with authority to appoint or replace a minority of board members, including the chair; and to appoint a supervisor to temporarily operate and manage a society where there are compliance issues and where it’s in the public interest.", "I also want to acknowledge the member from Wellington–Halton Hills for his thoughtful discussion on this bill. He’s very correct: Nothing is more devastating than the stories of Jeffrey Baldwin and Katelynn Sampson, absolutely nothing. I don’t think there’s one person in this Legislature who was not affected by those stories. It stands to reason that we need to get this bill right, as has been said a number of times. We feel that it is a comprehensive bill.", "The member for Hamilton Mountain has also brought up the situation with extending care to 16- and 17-year-olds voluntarily. We are pleased that 1,600 additional youth will be able to be served within this new system. We feel that it’s important. We feel that it’s important also that their voice be considered and that it be voluntary. At a certain age, like 16, we feel that youth will be able to have an impact and a say in what happens." ],

The issues that he raised, this bill does not address: areas of authority where he wasn’t allowed to investigate. You’ve really got to wonder why the child advocate wouldn’t be allowed to identify—he gave examples where if a child would call in with an issue or a complaint, he wouldn’t be allowed, in most cases, to investigate it. If it came through the school or education, through health care, he’d be blocked from finding out information about it. So children who had reached out to him were not being helped.", "He recounted that he had at first been given some reassurance from the ministry that they would be addressing this issue, and of course, sadly, they didn’t. One of the comments I saw last week: One of the first signs that you won’t get something done with this government is from the promise that they will. So you’ve got to really wonder why. He’s an independent officer of the Legislature—and I think we should be looking at ways of making their roles more effective. That was really his message. It’s hard to believe that somebody would actually get hold of their office and he might be told that he had no authority to look into the case.", "We’re hoping that we’ll see movement and maybe an amendment so that we can get some of these issues changed, but I know in past attempts, amendments were being voted down. So we look forward to that." ],

I can tell you that every single child they brought in, they loved from the bottom of their hearts. They supported them, took care of them, and they were able to get on with their lives—very similar to what we heard earlier in a story from one of our colleagues.

The idea was to ensure that families had the supports they needed, so that children at risk could be identified early on, that it would be a preventive measure and we would be in a situation, hopefully, where we could prevent problems before they became large ones.", "In the next provincial budget, that Progressive Conservative government, led by Mike Harris, dramatically expanded the budget for Healthy Babies, Healthy Children.

She has been a true champion and advocate for young people when it comes to these issues.", "I also want to give a particular shout-out to her private member’s bill, Bill 57, the Katelynn’s Principle Act. I will use those principles to lay out some of my comments with respect to this bill.", "The first issue is that as a guiding principle, we need to ensure that we all understand how important it is that Katelynn’s Principle is implemented, not just in the spirit of the law, not just in the letter of the law, but in the actual enforcement of that law.", "We all know, and I think it’s important to reiterate, that Katelynn’s Principle is essentially ensuring that we have a child-centred approach. The preamble of this bill does include a very clear child-centred approach. The foundation for this approach was, as we all know, the very heinous and tragic incident surrounding Katelynn Sampson. At the end of the inquiry, the jury recognized a number of things. One of the key things they recognized was that children should have a role in the determination of their own futures; in specific, the policies and legislation, and the decisions made with respect to their welfare, should involve their voice. All of our decisions should have this framework of what is in the best interest of the child, and to have that sense and that understanding of what’s in their best interest, we need to have their voice.", "The change in this legislation, the amendment to increase the age of young people who are protected to include those who are 16 and 17 years old, is something that we support. A number of the provisions are all very positive additions that improve the current circumstances and provide greater benefits for young people.", "But the point that was made by the member from Hamilton Mountain, which we have reiterated a number of times, needs to again be highlighted and emphasized: Any piece of legislation, whatever that piece of legislation, if it doesn’t include strong enforcement; if it doesn’t have provisions that ensure that there’s a remedy if anything is contravened; if there isn’t a way to ensure accountability with respect to the principles, to ensure that they’re actually followed through, then the legislation does not have the appropriate strength that we need. In this case, that’s why we’re advocating for the implementation of Bill 57, so that we can ensure that there is strong enforcement of the principles, that we actually see follow-through, and that there’s accountability.", "Another area of concern is that the bill seeks to refine some language around First Nations, Métis and Inuit communities and ensure that the language is appropriate. There is also a problem here. Using that same principle, that same value, that same idea that we need to ensure young people and children have input in decisions that impact their life, similarly, if we understand that that’s an important principle for young people, we have to understand that, for the people who are being impacted, they should have a voice. With respect to our First Nations communities, with respect to indigenous people, that same principle applies.", "The current structure ensures that the minister has power and ensures that there are requirements and accountability on the minister and the ministry. But there isn’t the same level of respect given to First Nations people, to indigenous people, so that they have their interests reflected and that their concerns are reflected in decisions that impact the outcome of their youth.", "That’s a failing in this bill. We need to make sure that the people impacted have a voice. In this case, speaking about indigenous, First Nations, Métis and Inuit communities, they are not actually reflected the way they need to be. That’s another issue.", "I should have begun my comments by saying today is International Women’s Day. All members of this House celebrate the importance of ensuring we recognize the struggles and the problems that continue to be faced by women, the fact that we lack equity, we lack equal access to opportunities; and that we also celebrate the tremendous achievements, the resilience and the strength of women who, in the face of those difficulties, have achieved so much. That’s something that we also wanted to acknowledge today.", "It’s also important to celebrate, despite the difficulties we face, despite the problems we face—it’s important to celebrate our victories. As a caucus, we’re really proud to say that we are now over 50% represented by women, and that we are led by a woman, which is extremely powerful.", "Coming back to the bill, I think it’s important to point out that much of the bill is left to regulation. This is an issue that we’ve raised a number of times, but in particular, this piece of legislation is even more so an example of what happens when so much is left to regulation. It limits our ability, as opposition, to actually provide input.", "With respect to how the changes will actually be enforced or come to fruition, we don’t know how that’s going to actually play out. We don’t know what that looks like without seeing the regulations. The problem, as a framework, is that we have legislation that is presented in the House, and we don’t know what the regulations are, so we can’t actually provide in-depth analysis about whether or not this is going to be appropriate or whether it would be adequate, without knowing what those regulations are.", "That criticism that applies generally is even more so in this case. Many of the components of the bill are left to regulation, more so than many other pieces of legislation, which creates a difficulty here.", "My colleague from Niagara Falls mentioned this issue. I think it’s also important to reiterate that if we give such importance—it’s very appropriate to give importance to this bill, because it deals with those who are most vulnerable in our society; it deals with young people who are some of the most hard-off or are in some of the toughest situations that people can be found in. We also need to give attention to the realities in this province when it comes to CAS workers.", "It’s far too often that we are finding CAS workers who are being mistreated at work in their work conditions, who are in positions where they are being locked out. Currently, we have a lockout, which members have talked about. It’s important that, if we recognize that young people are so important and they need to be protected, those who provide the services for these young people need also to have the working conditions to be able to do their jobs.", "We know that this government has a very bad track record when it comes to negotiating contracts, when it comes to dealing with public service workers. We have seen conflict in our schools with Bill 115. We’ve seen problems with doctors with respect to negotiations. We’re seeing registered nurses who have been fired. Now, with respect to Bill 89, we are talking about the importance of young people, but at the same time, we have CAS workers who are in very difficult circumstances, and this government is to blame for that.", "If you want to really follow through on not just talking about legislation, we also need to have a system that works, a system that actually represents people and respects the people who are fighting for and working for the children who are most vulnerable.", "I was also in the House when I had the tremendous honour of hearing our member from Windsor West’s story. I think that’s such a compelling story, to hear an example of someone who has gone through the system in a manner. To share her personal story, I think, takes a lot of courage, so I want to commend her for sharing that story.", "I think it’s also important for us to acknowledge that people have such amazing potential. Young people have such amazing potential and capacity. But often, these young people aren’t able to achieve that potential because they are not given the supports they deserve and need. It’s incumbent on this government, and it’s incumbent on us as legislators, to ensure that we give those young people those opportunities.", "This legislation is a step in the right direction. Implementing Katelynn’s Principle is a step in the right direction. We have a responsibility not only to the young people and their bright futures, but to all of our futures, to ensure that people are able to express their full potential and able to achieve their full potential. To do that, we need to give them the supports they need, and I hope to see that happen in this province." ],

We know that the impact of solitary confinement is devastating. It literally leaves people changed for the rest of their lives. We know that solitary confinement is something that is extremely oppressive. There have been many human rights groups talking about ending the use of solitary confinement once and for all. I absolutely support that notion that it should be ended. It’s not the appropriate way to deal with people, but particularly for young people who are still developing and growing; it is a horrible way to address young people. We need to look at alternatives in terms of ways of addressing people who have difficulties. This is an opportunity for us to ensure that young people do not ever see solitary confinement as a form of restraint, or any form of restraint, that it’s a policy that is not used whatsoever.", "In addition, the member from Trinity–Spadina talked about how this bill was a hefty bill, or that it responded to other concerns. The problem with this bill is that despite maybe being lengthy, it doesn’t actually have a great deal of clarity in details. It leaves much to regulation. As stated before, this is a problem with bills in general, but this bill is one of the most vague, with respect to that criticism.

Since I was elected in 2014, I have always had the pleasure to speak to my constituents and to listen to their stories. While many of these stories are happy, some of them are truly heartbreaking.

In addition to providing outcomes for kids as they transition into adulthood, these provisions would bring Ontario in line with other provinces and territories as the eighth province to raise the age of protection. That’s 1,600 kids who can grow up, go to college or university, find good jobs, start families and lead happy lives, just because of one piece of this comprehensive legislation.", "While some on the other side of the House have said that this bill is toothless, I ask them to think about 1,600 kids a year who will have better lives as a result of it.

This an important initiative that will assist children’s aid societies in delivering more culturally appropriate services and appropriate protection for children throughout this great province. This bill puts a strong emphasis on respecting the culture, heritage and traditions of First Nations, Inuit and Métis people.", "I had the pleasure of travelling this province roughly two years ago, developing a strategy for FASD. During those travels, I heard about how this piece of legislation needed to be upgraded and amended to be more appropriate so that we could more ably protect our children in the province of Ontario. This bill seeks to do that. With the help of all members in this House, we know we’ll put the interests of our children first and foremost. We are going to work hard to make this bill as effective and as perfect as possible, if there is any such thing as perfection. On this side of the House, I know we are willing to work on behalf of our children to make this bill effective for all.", "We will work hard to keep children and youth with their families, in their communities, whenever possible. We’ll support them with culturally appropriate services.", "These are changes that will also be transformational for the operation of children’s aid societies throughout this province. The proposed legislation would strengthen the ministry’s ability to hold children’s aid societies accountable for the services they provide and for the appropriate management of public funds.", "We are committed to ensuring that Ontario’s children’s aid societies remain, first and foremost, accountable to the public. In addition, with this legislation, our government intends to strengthen the ministry’s oversight of licensed settings in order to protect the health, safety and well-being of children and youth in residential care in Ontario.", "It will also enhance the quality of care provided in licensed residential settings. Bill 89 will give the Ministry of Children and Youth Services the authority to appoint inspectors who can conduct announced and unannounced licensing inspections. This will ensure that services being provided meet appropriate standards.", "Our government is also committed to helping more children find stability through permanent homes and relationships that are meaningful to them. That is why this legislation will give children who are being adopted a stronger voice in decisions being made about their relationships with birth families and others who are important to them post-adoption.", "Speaker, this legislation will also provide children, youth and families with the right to access information in the files about them. I have heard from families in my great riding of Durham and throughout this province how frustrating it can be when it’s not consistently administered, repeating their story when trying to access services they need. We have to make sure they are able to access those services. This bill is about that. It’s about protection and the accessing of services for families and, most importantly, our young people.", "I am pleased that the new rules around information sharing between service providers will make it so that families only have to tell their story once. This will create a more holistic system that improves both the experiences and outcomes for children and their families. I’ve also outlined this modern child- and youth-centred legislative framework, which will bring so many positive changes for all Ontarians." ],

The act has obviously needed a review—32 years in time since it was first reviewed. A lot of the changes come out of the coroners’ cases that a number of people have spoken to, and certainly those would cause concern in the community, the children’s aid community and for people who have children in care.", "One thing that we certainly applaud in this act is recognizing—the 16- and 17-year-olds who have moved into being recognized now as still in care. A number of the Auditor General’s reports—I think it was 2003, 2008 and 2016—recognized the number of improvements and changes they felt needed to be included in this act, so I applaud the government for that.", "We’re looking forward to getting to committee.

There are so many things that we need to be able to get to the bottom of, and taking that time and really digging into what’s happening in this bill is so vitally important.", "One of the things that the member talked about was 1,600 youth being brought in by the end of the first year. Somebody on this side of the House had mentioned that some of the legislation was toothless. I definitely have concerns. Are there dollars going with those extra 1,600 youth who could possibly be brought in by the end of the first year? Our children’s aid societies are already mandated to run at a zero deficit. They have to balance their budgets. They’re barely making it by. They have CPIN being enacted and brought in. The rollout on that is costing way more than the $220,000 that’s being allotted to each children’s aid society. That’s putting them over the budget. Now we’re going to add 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds without funding to add to this legislation. We’re literally playing a shell game, and we’re going to have children’s aid societies cutting services that families need.", "Now, we’ve seen this happening in the last couple of years, when budgets were cut for some and increased for others, but the bottom line is they’re all running on shoestring funding. So I hope that, with these extra 1,600 kids who are going to be living this wonderful life after they’ve had the ability to be part of the system, the dollars are going to be there to ensure they do get the services they need." ],

They had 25 different foster children over a nine-year period, and many of them were abused, and many of them are still feeling the effects of that abuse today. They have mental health issues, substance abuse issues, an inability to trust, and they will have those issues for the rest of their lives.

The Elgin-Middlesex Regional Intermittent Centre was scheduled to receive its scanner the following year.", "At some point, a bit of revisionist history came into play and the government backed away from its original promise to have a scanner installed at EMDC’s main facility by the end of this very month. Now, the new minister’s office is saying that the scanner is prioritized for installation in the fall of 2017.", "I just can’t understand how something can be prioritized for installation later than the original promise to have it installed. When did the government remove EMDC’s main facility from the high-priority list of facilities to receive scanners by March 2017? In light of an overdose death last November, I think it’s entirely reasonable to ask.", "I now move on to “The $1-Billion Hellhole,” Toronto South Detention Centre. That’s not my quote, but Toronto Life’s quote, the magazine. I encourage every member of the Legislature to read Toronto Life’s article on this jail. It’s heartbreaking, and we must learn from it.", "Sheldon Small is a correctional officer at the jail who I have had the opportunity to get to know over the past couple of years. He showed true courage by speaking out for better conditions for his brothers and sisters in corrections, as well as calling for better treatment of inmates. He saw what happened when I first raised serious safety concerns, when all staff were issued a memo to stay quiet or risk losing their jobs. He knew the risks and did the right thing. These people, Speaker, are true heroes.", "He commented on the government’s naive plan for this jail, as well as the violent, dangerous conditions in Toronto South and its impact on morale. He was quoted as saying, “This was supposed to be a cheaper jail, with less cost and less staff to run it. The inmates were supposed to be more compliant. But they forgot to tell the inmates that.” He added, “If you’re an officer and there’s a guy on your unit who has assaulted 12 of your friends, would you feel like coming in tomorrow?” Imagine if you were assaulted and no records were, in fact, kept.", "Toronto South’s problems are hard to fathom in a brand new facility. Mould problems started within the first year. Unbreakable windows were broken and over a thousand panes of glass were replaced. Software systems broke down, leaving alarms non-functional. The decision to understaff the facility by trying out a supervision model never before seen in Ontario was reckless and a typical example of Liberals knowing better than the experts. Staff were concerned that the direct supervision model would put inmates and staff alike at increased risk, and they have been proven right.", "Auditor General Jim McCarter warned in 2008 that the government had not undertaken the necessary formal studies to determine whether this experimental supervision model was suitable for Toronto’s inmate population and corrections system. Specifically, he warned that the use of a direct supervision model “may significantly affect its operating costs and the health and safety of its staff and inmates.”", "In an attempt to save money, the Liberal government may cost the province nearly and dearly. A billion-dollar class action lawsuit is being prepared against the Ontario government on behalf of all inmates who have experienced staffing-related lockdowns.", "In conclusion, the government ignored front-line staff who warned them about the dangers of trying this experimental model. The Liberals even ignored the Auditor General’s warning. They even ignored my question asking why they dismissed so many warnings. Sadly, we cannot ignore the blood that is spilled due to these hellish conditions." ],

  "text" : [ "Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I’m pleased to rise to respond to the member from Chatham–Kent–Essex.", "Our government is on track with the installation of full-body scanners in all the 26 adult provincial correctional facilities by 2018. This is all part of the corrections reform to further improve staff and inmate safety, reduce contraband and enhance security.", "As mentioned this morning, Mr. Speaker, we can confirm that 11 body scanners are currently installed in Ontario jails. I know that our correctional staff are very pleased with the success of the body scanners in detecting contraband and preventing these items from entering our institutions.", "I would like to note that the installation of body scanners at a number of correctional facilities, including the EMDC, requires some renovation work to accommodate the new equipment and its use. When a body scanner is brought into the institution, it cannot simply be installed in the nearest facility or just anywhere in the facility. The scanner must be placed in a manner that upholds the security for staff while maintaining the continuity of operations within the facility.", "We know the importance of installing a body scanner at the EMDC, which is why we have ensured that it will be installed by the fall of 2017. The minister is committed to the safety and security of both the staff and the inmates. The EMDC now has approximately 350 new security cameras and six additional metal detectors, in addition to the upcoming full body scanner.", "We have also invested $33 million annually to address immediate priorities in our system as a whole, including $14.8 million for capital improvements. These initiatives will better allow correctional officers to identify inmates attempting to bring contraband into our correctional facilities. Enhancing security in our facilities across the province is a key part of the government’s transformation of Ontario’s correctional system to build safer communities.", "I know the member opposite also brought up additional concerns with another one of our facilities this morning. The Toronto South Detention Centre was specifically designed to include the newest practices in the field of correctional services. This is important as we evolve our understanding of corrections as a whole. There are 54 dedicated rooms for programs to help inmates deal with drug and alcohol problems or anger management issues. There are also six classrooms for inmate learning, as well as indoor and outdoor smudging areas for indigenous inmates and two multi-faith worship rooms. Rehabilitation is an essential part of our correctional system, and these initiatives aid in achieving this.", "Minister Lalonde visited TSDC just last month and saw a number of positives and great potential for the design and layout of the facility. She also notes that there is still a lot of work to be done, including at the other correctional facilities.", "One of the biggest issues the minister noted are the staffing levels. We know our facilities need more correctional officers, nurses, maintenance staff and cleaning staff. Increased staffing levels would help better maintain the safety, security and well-being of our inmates, as well as alleviate the pressures our existing staff are feeling. This is why we’ve committed to hiring an additional 2,000 correctional officers since 2013. We have since deployed 1,482 new correctional officers to our correctional facilities. An additional 137 are expected to graduate this month alone. Our government has also created an additional 58 mental health nurse positions to provide specialized services to inmates. At the same time, we are ensuring that all new correctional officers now receive core training to help them better care for inmates with mental illnesses.", "These are just some of the ways we are continually reforming our correctional systems. Ultimately, the safety, security and well-being of our staff and inmates are the greatest consideration in any decision our government makes or has made to our correctional system." ],

I asked for this late show debate due to my complete dissatisfaction with the response I received on an important question this morning that I asked of the Acting Premier, regarding her response to the federal government following the call to the Council of the Federation for input from all provinces.", "I was seeking clarity, of course, on the Premier’s response to this request. I know that Attorney General answered the question, but I will remind folks what the question actually was. I asked her to give her assurance to the federal government that Ontario was in favour of ending genetic discrimination through Bill S-201.", "Instead of answering my simple question about the Premier’s stance, the Attorney General attempted to silo the issue into constitutionality at the federal level. Given the federal request that the provinces weigh in, this is a distinctively provincial issue as well.", "With that, I would like to go over the background on Bill S-201, which is being voted on tonight—actually, likely as we speak—and which would prohibit the requirement of genetic testing or disclosure in contracting of any kind between individuals, thus preventing discrimination.", "Three constitutional experts who came before the federal justice committee agreed that this legislation was within the authority of the federal government to pass and did not infringe on provincial jurisdiction. Federal Justice Minister Wilson-Raybould was apparently not satisfied with this and sent a letter to the Council of the Federation, requesting that it respond, communicating its stance on Bill S-201, given some concerns on constitutionality.", "The Council of the Federation is comprised of all Canadian Premiers, and a request to it is a request to the Premiers. I wanted transparency on what our Premier’s response to that can request was.", "Genetic discrimination is very obviously an issue that is important to Ontarians and the Premier’s own caucus, considering the provincial bill addressing genetic discrimination came from the member from Eglinton–Lawrence. That member called it “appalling” that the federal government would hide behind this jurisdictional non-concern to avoid ending discriminatory practices in the provinces.", "I want to know, did the Premier communicate to the Council of the Federation, or to her federal counterparts, that the province of Ontario is in favour of prohibiting genetic discrimination and that it supports Bill S-201? The member for Eglinton–Lawrence has asked the Premier and the Attorney General to show support for this bill, and I want to know what response, if any, the Premier and the Attorney General gave.", "If the Liberal government is in favour of ending genetic discrimination against Ontarians and all Canadians, the government should take an open stance. The federal government has specifically requested that the provinces provide a position on the constitutionality of this bill. Quebec, Manitoba and BC have all sent an answer to the federal justice minister. Of course, Ontario has not, and that was why I was asking a question, which I believe the minister simply wasn’t prepared for, or had very little, if any, knowledge about.", "It was a significant news story over the weekend that the member for Eglinton–Lawrence had commented on. We, of course, debated this bill previously in the Legislature. Through prorogation, after second reading, it was wiped off the order paper, but I believe that the member had re-tabled the bill, and I believe all members of this Legislature, all three political parties, supported that bill. Again, either the government supports the bill federally or it does not, and they should be willing to state that openly on the record. That’s what I was asking.", "This is not an issue that can or should be shrugged off to the Council of the Federation. The Premiers are, in fact, the council. If our neighbour provinces can take the time to provide a stance for or against, why has the Premier or her government—including the Attorney General, of whom I asked the question this morning—not? Why has she not done so, when the subject of genetic discrimination is worthy of debate here in Ontario?", "The vote in the House of Commons is set for this evening. There is likely still time for the Premier and her officials to reach out to her federal counterparts and convey Ontario’s position on this issue. All she really needs to do is just pick up the phone.", "I had hoped that my question today might shed light on where the government stands on this important issue, but the unwillingness of the Premier, through the Attorney General, to openly declare a position on Bill S-201 in response to the federal government continues to leave us in the dark, just hours before the final decision is made. So, Speaker, I hope for some clarity tonight, knowing that I’ve given them some time about the issue, and hopefully they can clarify." ],

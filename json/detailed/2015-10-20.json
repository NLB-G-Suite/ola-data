  "text" : [ "It is my pleasure to speak to Bill 113 this morning, An Act respecting police record checks. I think everybody would agree that police record checks have multiplied exponentially over the years and that our administration, oversight and transparency of police record checks have not kept pace with that exponential growth. In effect, we don’t even know how many police record checks are taking place or under what circumstances and what information is being provided. So this bill is a much needed and long overdue attempt to address some of the unknowns, the uncertainties and the failings of that system that we have at the present time.", "Although Bill 113 does make a significant attempt and initiative to improve that system, there are some failings with the bill, in my view. I want to take a moment or two to illustrate to the members in this assembly what some of those failings are and what some of the criticisms are that I have on Bill 113, in hopes that you will take them with sincerity and consider these criticisms when it comes to committee and a further examination and evaluation of this bill.", "First off, there are three clauses in Bill 113 which I think need to be seriously re-evaluated. The first one is section 22(1). I believe these next criticisms that I’m going to speak about are really about a significant undue delegation of authority by this assembly to individuals without the proper oversight. Section 22(1) allows cabinet to exempt anyone from any provision of this bill. Seldom do we see such broad powers being provided to cabinet to exempt any person or class of persons from any provision of this act. That could be done by order in council. The Legislature would not be aware of that exemption or who it applies to. That, clearly, is not in keeping with a transparent and open administration.", "It goes on. Section 22(2)(c) allows the minister to create new offences under this act. There are offences enunciated and enumerated in this act. We can all look at them, evaluate them and debate them. But then the bill goes on to allow the minister to create new offences without legislative oversight. That’s 22(2)(c). Both of those are serious and, I believe, undue delegations of authority.", "Lastly—this, again, is one that I’ve never seen, and it speaks to our adherence, our convention and our knowledge that politicians ought not to interfere with the administration of justice or the prosecution. I’d like to ask everybody to take a look at section 19(3) of the act. Section 19(3) says, “A prosecution shall not be commenced under this section without the minister’s consent.” That is a worrying clause. If there is anybody here on the Liberal benches who can respond to these comments this morning, I would be very happy to hear what the rationale is behind these undue delegations of authority, specifically this one: Why will it be a requirement that the minister consents to any prosecution? No prosecution can go forward under this act without the minister’s signed consent. We would never allow that, and we have never allowed that in any other statute before this House, that I’m aware of. None. It is a very, very troubling clause, especially when looked at in light of the previous two clauses that I spoke about. I do hope someone on the Liberal benches will respond to that.", "Just think of it, under this act—as we know, police record checks are provided in large part by police services boards. There is a growing element of third-party providers as well, which I’ll speak to later during this debate. But anybody who is not in compliance, anybody who provides improper disclosure, would generally be the police services board, as it now stands. A complainant, somebody who would be upset or found that their privacy was violated and improper disclosure was made, would, of course, have to go back to that police services board that they have the allegation against in the first place. And now, that individual, if the police services board refused to bring in information to the justice—first off, they would have to get the minister’s consent to bring a charge against themselves.", "Second off, if an individual wanted to lay a private information with the courts to proceed with that allegation, he wouldn’t be allowed to enter a private information. He would not be allowed to go to the courts to seek recourse or remedy; he would have to first go to the minister, and we know how easy that is. We know how easy it is for any individual to approach a government minister and get his or her consent before he or she puts a private information forward. That cannot be allowed to stand, in my view—cannot be allowed.", "During committee hearings—because obviously this bill will pass; it’s a government bill, and it will pass. But we cannot turn our administration of justice into such an animal that requires the minister’s approval prior to any laying of charges under this act.", "Those are the three most serious concerns that I have on this bill that I am absolutely confident to assert need to be remedied. But another important part of this is the requirement for the providers of police record checks to compile, record and document statistics, which is a great thing because we don’t have any—or we have very few—statistics at the present time. That’s a good step in the right direction. However, the act does not identify which statistics are to be recorded and documented. We don’t know how many applications will be recorded. We don’t know, if there are any refusals to disclose, if they are going to be recorded. We don’t know if the duration or length of time to comply with a background check is going to be incorporated into those statistics.", "I see the Attorney General. I would love the Attorney General to take a look with a fine-tooth comb at some of these comments I’m making on this bill and provide this House with some level of assurance that the right and appropriate and relevant statistics are going to be recorded. They should be enumerated within the legislation so that we know, and so we also know, then, that it becomes a requirement of the provider to provide that information.", "One more element on that topic specifically is that this act is to be reviewed by the minister after five years. That is section 21, and it says, “The minister shall conduct a review of this act within five years after the day this section comes into force.” But again, in the interest of transparency—and democracy demands transparency—that clause ought to include “and table his or her review with this assembly,” so that we can all examine and evaluate the review. We can then examine and evaluate the statistics that have been collected, and we can then move forward in an informed and intelligent fashion about the effectiveness of Bill 113.", "I think that’s an important consideration. It’s just not good enough for the minister to review the bill after five years and be silent or have no obligation or duty to inform the House of his or her review. That would strengthen it. I think it would also be consistent with the Premier’s assertions that she wants to be the most open and transparent of all governments. You can’t be open and transparent if there’s no requirement to table reviews, investigations and evaluations with the House.", "I want to put this forward for the minister’s consideration: The enforcement of this act is in a very murky and muddied area, in my view. As I identified, anybody who has a complaint under this act is most likely to go to the police services board, who provided that disclosure. That individual is, in essence, prevented from seeking remedy in the courts for any improper disclosure. This is not just the police services board; it could also be a not-for-profit, a charitable organization or anybody else who inappropriately seeks background police record checks on an individual. Again, prosecution is dependent on the minister exercising his authorities under this act to allow a prosecution to go forward.", "I think the bill would be far more substantive, complete and effective for the people of Ontario if there was an independent body that was authorized to be the enforcement and compliance agency for this legislation. I can think of groups such as the OIPRD. The independent police review might be an effective and appropriate organization for allegations or complaints under this act to be brought forward, just as we do today. If a police officer is alleged to have been engaged in improper use of force or misconduct, individuals have the opportunity to go to the OIPRD. The same could apply with this legislation. There are other avenues; the SIU, I guess, could be another one.", "Right at the moment, we’ve created a real juggernaut for individuals, when this act gets passed, that will have statute to protect their privacy, will have statutory authority to indicate how it is to be done, but there will be no remedy for failure to perform to the standards that this act sets forward. I think those are important clauses for the government to re-examine.", "At least, in the minimum, I think there is a duty to this House that the government provide us with the rationale and an explanation of why we have this tremendous undue delegation of authority and this complete contradiction to the separation of our courts and separation of our law enforcement from the political arm of government.", "I know the Liberal members will have two minutes to respond. If anybody there could respond as to why it is that the minister must consent to a prosecution under this bill—I know the attorney general is here. Can you imagine, if every time a police officer goes to lay a charge, instead of going to the crown attorney and seeking advice in the laying of the charges, the police officer would have to go to the Minister of the Attorney General and get her consent before a charge is laid. Absolutely astonishing—I don’t understand how that can be viewed as an appropriate clause.", "So once again, table the review. After five years, after the government has reviewed, examined and evaluated the efficacy of Bill 113, table that review with the House so that we can all see it.", "Second, consider that enforcement and compliance be done by a separate agency, not this less-than-clear view that we see now, and certainly without the need for the minister’s consent for any prosecution.", "Also, enumerate the statistics and the data that are to be collected so that we can all understand. I would think the minister would want this as well. How can the minister review an act in five years’ time if it’s not enumerated what data is going to be collected and how it’s going to be documented and who is going to have access to it?", "Finally, that cabinet can exempt any person or any class of persons from any provision of this bill: I always grew up and understood that neither prince nor pauper is above or beneath the law, that we have a general application of the law that affects everyone. Why we would give this authority to cabinet to exempt anybody or any class of people from any provision of this bill without coming back to this House and seeking our consent is unacceptable, as well as section 22(2), where the minister can create new offences by regulation without coming back to this House seeking our consent.", "With that, Speaker, I’m looking forward to other members in the House responding to those concerns and looking forward to getting a handle on police record checks. I’ll finish off with this one statement—I think it’s important—from the civil liberties: “The bottom line is that widespread, unnecessary police record checks do not contribute to public safety; they undermine it.”", "I think it’s important that we get a handle on them and we do these police record checks properly." ],

  "text" : [ "It’s always great to get up and respond when a member is debating in the House.", "I just want to focus in on two areas of this bill, though. The member from Lanark–Frontenac–Lennox and Addington actually spoke about this general application piece and the ability for cabinet to exempt certain classifications or individuals. In my experience in the health care field, there certainly have been a couple of issues while I was working there. One was the length of time it actually took to get police checks. We would have 100 vacancies, for example, in a large health system in Niagara, with nurses waiting to get a job, so their employment was impacted. Sometimes it could take eight, nine, 10 weeks to actually get a police check, so not good for patient care when you are actually working short in our health care facilities.", "I’m not saying that it’s a bad thing to do police checks in a sector where we are dealing with a lot of vulnerable patients, but there needs to be a way—if the government is going to put in new regulations, then it needs to put the resources in place as well to be able to actually accomplish those checks in a timely way.", "The second piece was also in the health care sector. You could have a nurse who had practised faithfully for 40 years, retires, decides to come back and work casual in the health care field, and suddenly now requires a police check, after having practised for 40 years without any issues whatsoever, reporting to their respective college—nothing on their college record. Suddenly, they too have to go and get a police check, and they have to stand in line and wait for that." ],

I listened very attentively to the member from Lanark–Frontenac–Lennox and Addington and to my colleague from Welland. Some of the suggestions and comments he made will also be heard when we go to committees and hearings. But I want to bring the member’s comments forward. He focused specifically on enforcement and the role of the minister, the cabinet minister. I heard you, but I think the member opposite also has to recognize that this particular proposed legislation has been heard from various stakeholders as well. I know every member of this House needs to recognize that we need to balance public safety and respecting privacy.", "This past week we had a constit week, and I spent much of my constit week dealing with the issue of police background checks. One issue—we have been very, very clear that when constituents need to go to work, as well as in a volunteer capacity, because every child who graduates from Ontario’s system must do 40 hours of volunteer work—we know that. They may be asked to do a police background check. I had to be dealing with this all last week with respect to this particular area. We now have kids who are 14 or 15 years of age being asked to do a police background check. It is absolutely important that we make sure we have a balance between public protection and safety, and respecting and protecting privacy, because at the end of the day, there have been records shared—especially mental health—that affect careers, but, more importantly, employment opportunity and also travelling. We’ve seen all that. It is a concern, and I know the government is prepared to repair that." ],

Subsection 19(4), the minister’s proof of consent: “The production of a document that appears to show that the minister has consented to a prosecution under this section is admissible as evidence of the minister’s consent.” Even that is kind of murky. This is a bill about getting away from the murkiness of police record checks, and, instead, while they’re trying to do a good thing, they’re making it even more murky.

We’ve heard positive responses from members on this side of the House that this initiative is definitely something that is long overdue. There have been contradiction, and conflict, on this issue when people are looking for background checks and sometimes what results come out, and there are limited opportunities because of the information that is presented.", "I want to echo some concerns that the member for Bramalea–Gore–Malton has also presented. Several organizations, as well as people from across this province, may have the same concerns as well. There are some very good aspects to those bills, so first I want to start with those.", "The bill indicates that non-conviction information about an individual will not be disclosed in response to a police record check, in response to a criminal check or a judicial matters check. This section is imperative because there are cases when non-convictions actually appear as part of a police check, and they restrict, as we mentioned before, volunteering and employment.", "My colleague from Bramalea–Gore–Malton highlights some of these facts, but I think they’re well worth repeating so that members of Legislature really understand the impact of what’s happening with this bill. It is a good bill, but we can’t forget that our job is to be very critical of what’s in the bill so that we can make improvements and offer suggestions to the government.", "What exactly are non-conviction records? These involve, according to the John Howard Society, calls to 911 for assistance, victimization, mental health crises involving the police, being questioned by the police, and arrests and charges that did not result in convictions. Another thing that some people may not realize in this bill is that if you were a witness to a crime or just a witness in some kind of incident and the police spoke to you, you could have that on your record. If you get a check done, that will appear just because you were questioned. Most people don’t even realize that that’s something that can come up on a background check for them.", "The examples that we’ve been talking about today are on mental health. I presented a bill in this House, Bill 95, a mental health and addictions bill, which helps people who are experiencing mental health issues and addiction have a better opportunity for access to those services.", "Right now, many health care treatments, programs or therapies are in the community. We all know that those things belong in the community. That’s what patients want, but we also need to have the resources and the management of those therapies and treatments that are out in the community to be implemented so that patients have access to those things in a timely fashion.", "What I think I can say from what has been going on in London is that the police services have contact—I’ve talked to the police chief. Once a year, I contact him to get an update on what’s going on, and each year he expresses to me that a disproportionate amount of their emergency 911 calls are coming from mental health patients—mental health issues.", "What has happened there is that people are not able to access mental health. They’ve gone to the hospital or to other areas or organizations and there’s a backlog. They are confused on where to go. So their mental health illness continues longer than really they need it to, perhaps, because they haven’t been able to seek assistance. Then they reach a crisis point where they don’t know where else to turn. What they do is they call 911. The police respond. There are incidents where perhaps things are said of a violent nature. So the police will write the report. In that case, there is a record of that incident. It may have been a result of the person coming to a boiling point where they couldn’t access health care in the time that they needed it and now they’re at a crisis point. That’s a really, really unfortunate status of events, when someone who’s in a vulnerable position ends up with a record check because of other reasons—they couldn’t access health in a timely fashion—therefore limiting opportunities such as employment, education, as well as even rental homes, insurance and volunteering.", "I have had a couple of examples, as we all have had, of constituents calling my office, and the examples that they have articulated are very real effects in their life that have disadvantaged them. One person applied for funding through the MTCU, and they just had fines, apparently, on their record which were years and years old. They made arrangements to pay those fines, but then they were told it was going to take at least—again, the length of time—five months for that to come off their record.", "There are many opportunities that have gone by for people in the London–Fanshawe area where they are trying to get funding for a second career, and they may have this situation where there’s a fine and now they’ve got to wait five months. That affects which career choice you’re going to make. It is something that we need to address. We need to make sure that record checks that don’t include criminal behaviour or criminal convictions are not part of this equation.", "The member from Scarborough–Agincourt talked about high school students doing their 40 hours of volunteer work in order to graduate with their diploma. Speaker, I can tell you that’s something that is a concern as well. I was talking to a staff member just recently in the legislative building about this particular issue. My concern, when I read through the bill, was that if you’re going to submit an application or your name to an organization where you want to volunteer, and they say to you, “Mrs. Smith, you need to obtain a records check,” and you say, “Sure, no problem”—as far as they know, they have nothing on their record, so they go to the police and they ask for a police records check. The police records check then comes back—and one good thing in this bill is you have to give consent. I applaud the government for putting consent in this bill so the person who is applying for any position realizes that is actually happening. They give consent for that. So they go to the police station, they get their records check back, they get called by the police, they go in and they see their records check. Lo and behold, there’s “I’m a witness to an event.” There’s really nothing that prevents them from becoming a volunteer or getting a job. But in this particular incident, where the high school student that the member from Scarborough–Agincourt was talking about—there’s an example: The high school student was a witness to an incident. Prior to this act—that’s what I want to clarify—that records check was taken by the person who was ordered to get the records check and given to that organization. There’s a problem with that. I think that’s flawed. That records check should not be a document that you pass on to a third party. All kinds of questions are raised in that respect. What happens to that records check? What kind of privacy and confidentiality practices does that organization have? That organization can have good intentions, because a lot of not-for-profit organizations do have good intentions. But even though it’s an innocent example of a records check piece of information that can come out on a records check for someone, it shouldn’t be public knowledge to anyone but the police and the person ordering it.", "This is where we’re talking about the high school student. High school students may not question the process. This is where information shouldn’t be out there without proper checks and balances before it’s released. I don’t even agree with the fact that it should be released to a third party. I think it should be between the police and the person ordering it, and if there is a concern, then the organization is called and told there’s a concern. They don’t need to know what kind of concern or what the context of it is. That’s all they need to know. Or even better, the person who is getting the records check can identify if that is going to be a concern to the organization or not-for-profit where they are applying for a job and they can just say, “You know, I’ve decided I’m not pursuing that opportunity.” Then that leaves it so that they don’t have to actually say, “There’s something on my records check and I’m not willing to volunteer,” or “I’m prevented from volunteering.” That’s another reason why it should go no further than the person ordering the records check.", "I’d like to know, and I guess I’ll have to enquire about this and I’m going to ask the government: Is that in place, where once that records check is ordered, it doesn’t go any further than the person ordering it? If there’s a concern, it’s either the police say there is a concern or not a concern, and no one needs to know what the context is of that. I’d like to know what happens at that point, because right now, my understanding is—and I’ve had calls in my office—the practice is the organization gets a copy of that.", "Another example I had in my office, Speaker: A young man was wrongfully accused of a crime, went through the terrible experience of being put through the court system, and then he was acquitted. That was on his records check. His parents called, thoroughly upset, just devastated that their son’s future was going to be affected because of this record information on there. Again, the son was applying, a young man, and he was told it was going to take five months for that records check to be corrected. So even when you have the expunging or the pardon on things, it can become a serious issue.", "The last example: A student in our area was applying for the nursing program, as the member from Welland talked about. She wanted to become a health care provider. Many, many years ago she experienced—this is an illness. Mental health is an illness. We’ve got to get away from the stigma of mental health. People have an illness, they have a mental health concern; they seek help, they get medication and they can get better. They do get better and they’re very functioning citizens in our society.", "The student had a situation where she wasn’t feeling well. Police were involved. Again, phrases were expressed that were of a violent nature and she couldn’t get into the course because it’s a requirement to have a records check in order to get your co-op experience.", "That was really devastating for that student. She wrote a wonderful piece to us, an email, explaining how she did have a difficult time in her life as a young woman, experienced some stressful situations in her life that were out of her hands, that affected her inadvertently, and therefore she had some mental health issues, and she’s not denying that. Identifying that you have mental health issues and seeking help is wonderful, because it is an illness, a mental health issue, and should be treated as such.", "Now she’s gotten better. She’s healthy and she wants to pursue her career in nursing, and she was stopped.", "I definitely think that looking at non-criminal offences is a huge piece of the positive nature of this bill. It’s going to help a lot of people in functioning in life in many ways.", "I want to talk about my mental health bill again, and the reason I want to do that is because Bill 95 is affecting so many people when it comes to issues, even housing. When you go to get a home, people are discriminated against when they have mental health issues. Having Bill 95 pass through committee—it’s gone to committee, but bringing it to committee for debate and for people to present—I think would help people access mental health and give them a little bit of hope that they can move on with their life.", "I was at a poverty seminar this weekend and there were different aspects to poverty: homelessness, as we all know; health care is another, accessing health care. There was also food stability. That was important. Food security, that was important. We talked about those different aspects of it.", "The other one, of course, was jobs. The precarious work that’s happening, the contract work that’s happening—people don’t have benefits. When you don’t have benefits and you’re working in a stressful situation and you don’t know if your job is going to be there for a few years to come, sometimes that adds stress to mental health. You don’t have benefits, so you can’t even access services. It all ties in: precarious work, food security, homelessness and health care. I think passing Bill 95 would be a positive step to addressing some of those issues that I talked about and that we had a discussion about in a seminar this weekend.", "I also went to an event last week in my riding: international World Homeless Day. We were at the London InterCommunity Health Centre and we were talking to a gentleman who has been working with homelessness issues and people experiencing homelessness for about 26 years. The question was posed to him, “What do you think the main cause of homelessness is?” You know what he said, Speaker—which is actually quite surprising, because there are an accumulation of reasons why people end up homeless. He said it was poverty. Poverty is the number one factor of homelessness. You can have mental health, you can have all kinds of other issues, but if you don’t have the means to afford a home, to buy—" ],

Poverty can hit any one of us when there is illness in the family or you lose your job.", "Tying that in, unfortunate situations that occur when someone has interaction with police when they’re not criminal need to be addressed.

He is correct in saying that the powers that the minister is being given under this bill with regard to determining whether prosecution is going to be admissible in this situation when someone does commit an offence—when an organization wilfully contravenes this act, there’s a fine of $5,000. That is concerning because the powers given to the government, whether or not they decide the law has been broken, are in question. Definitely, we want to talk about that a little further, even examine it in committee.", "Being in that process when it does go to committee, I’d really be interested, even if I’m not assigned to that committee, to sit in and listen because, in many ways, this touches all of us. We can have unfortunate situations where we are involved with the police, whether it’s health care, whether it’s being a witness, whether it’s fines or whether it’s being falsely accused of something.

I’ll just go back to my speaking notes and the opening remarks made between the minister and myself as the PA. It’s says that this legislation, if passed, will establish and standardize three types of record checks, as follows: a criminal record check, which is where only criminal records will be released; a criminal record and judicial matters check, which is pretty straightforward; and I think the one that the member across the way expressed, a vulnerable sector records check.", "I would like to assure her, because the minister quite clearly stated—I will read his exact words. It says, “Quite simply, a police record check should never disclose personal health information or identify that someone was a victim or witness to a crime.” She was outlining someone having a problem before; they had a mental health situation and their information was revealed. Clearly, what we’ve put in this legislation will stop that from happening in the future.", "The other issue that she raised was someone trying to seek employment or volunteering. The legislation is very clear, and the Hansard would have it very clear that the minister made it very clear that in the vulnerable record check, the person that is being checked receives a copy of the record, has an opportunity to ask for a review and, based on those circumstances, that person can clearly state, “I’m not interested in the job I’m applying for and, therefore, do not proceed to send my record check to the particular employment opportunity” or agency or whatever. It’s clearly in the minister’s speech and it’s clearly in the legislation.", "Basically, the rest of it, I would say that the member supports the legislation, so let us all support it." ],

There is an opportunity in Bill 113 to improve that process and make it easier for people to volunteer. So I will once again put in a plug for one section of the bill that specifically references that individuals have the opportunity to review their police record check information before deciding to release it to the requester i.e. an employer or volunteer organization.", "I would like to suggest that we add an amendment to that and say allow that police record check, once it has been provided and reviewed by the individual, to multiple volunteer organizations. We all know that people who volunteer tend to volunteer in more than one organization—on behalf of more than one organization. This will simplify the process so that that mom or dad who is reading in their child’s school can take that same police record check and volunteer for the local Big Brothers Big Sisters and volunteer for the local organization that has an event once a year. The process of getting a police record check for a one-time event is too onerous and too time consuming. That’s the amendment I’d like to see in Bill 113, and then I’d be proud to support it." ],

Many times, people with mental health issues, during a 911 call, for example, or a call from their family, are combative. They can be combative. They’re off their medications. They’re not really in control of themselves initially. In many cases, I’ve seen them being charged by the police. They’re initially charged with either assaulting police or resisting arrest because the police—they’re not necessarily known to the police. That record follows them for the rest of their lives. Many times, people with mental health issues don’t have continuity in the workforce, and so volunteering is an opportunity for them to actually gain those skills that they need to perhaps get into the workforce when they have been able to successfully access mental health treatment.", "But mental health is sorely underfunded in this province and across Canada. The services are just not out there and available. Every day I have parents, of teenagers in particular, coming into my office trying to access even an initial assessment for their child, let alone any psychotherapy which would assist these teenagers.", "To have something like this on a record following a 15-year-old or a 16-year-old for the rest of their lives really is discriminatory in my view, and so we need to do what we can do to fix this." ],

It’s a bill that provides a balance—a balance that protects civil liberties and also protects the vulnerable sector, as children and elderly folks have to be protected and we have to ensure those protections are in place.

All his friends knew right away that there was a serious situation because he just collapsed without, in any way, trying to break his fall. Eric Shannon, who was nicknamed “Cotton” because of his soft hands, was clinically dead. The trainer and the medic, Kaylin Perchinig, and two of his teammates—Haydn Gage, who is a trained firefighter, and Conor McCann, who is also training to become a firefighter—ran over and immediately started CPR. They did so for about 10 full minutes.", "Meanwhile, someone went out to the field and got a defibrillator. It took three shocks to get his heart going, but they did get it going. A week later, he was released from hospital, fully healthy, as if nothing had happened.", "Eric has said that there should be a defibrillator at every single sports field such as Fletcher’s, and we agree with him. I raise this to raise awareness so that we do take the time and the effort to ensure that there are defibrillators at all public and private sporting arenas.", "I’d also like to raise the fact about the important training that firefighters get in life-saving techniques. Had it not been for that training, had it not been for the defibrillator, Shannon would not be with us today." ],

So hopefully it extends. That was very good.", "Today, I’d also like to, through my statement, welcome the Ontario Environment Industry Association to Queen’s Park. ONEIA members are committed to providing market-driven solutions to today’s environmental problems using world-class technologies that are both cost-effective and environmentally sound.", "Ontario’s environment and clean-tech companies are vital to the health of our dynamic economy and provide industry with the tools they need to succeed in world markets. Their innovative solutions help companies produce higher-quality goods with a lower environmental impact, all while reducing their energy costs. Truly, these companies help create win-win situations for everyone involved.", "Because of this, Ontario’s environmental industry is recognized globally for its innovative approach. This booming sector, comprised of more than 3,000 environmental companies and upwards of 65,000 employees, exports technologies and services approaching $1 billion in value to every part of the globe. In fact, this industry is so robust that last year, 75% of these particular businesses reported that they would be increasing their employees and hiring this coming year.", "I look forward to their reception this evening in the dining room.

People from the Ottoman Empire arrived on our shores in the early 20th century and established a life here in Canada.", "What may be interesting for my colleagues to learn is that people of Turkish origin are not merely from Turkey but actually from about 15 different other countries, which include Turkey, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Azerbaijan, and even China, Iran and Russia.

To truly assist people suffering from addiction, to help future generations and to protect our community from the dangers associated with drug use requires a multi-faceted approach.

It’s great to see that here today.", "I’m honoured to rise today to recognize National Disability Employment Awareness Month. Ontario stands in solidarity with provinces and territories across the country to highlight the skills that people with disabilities bring to the workplace. National Disability Employment Awareness Month is a great way to encourage more companies to tap into this workforce and, like our province, to see accessibility as essential to a competitive and dynamic economy.", "What a great time to be celebrating and accelerating our efforts to make our workplaces across Ontario and Canada more accessible. We’re hot on the heels of the most accessible Parapan Am Games ever held. We can’t help but be inspired by the athleticism, courage and talent of those incredible athletes from across the Americas who participated in these games. Let us use those memories to inspire us to move forward.", "To that end, this year we also proudly celebrated the 10th anniversary of the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act. This landmark law is transforming communities right across Ontario into more inclusive, accessible places to live.", "While we’re global leaders in implementing regulations to enhance accessibility in Ontario, we’ll only reach our true potential if we can combine these efforts into a significant, province-wide cultural shift. To that end, this year we launched The Path to 2025: Ontario’s Accessibility Action Plan. A key pillar of this plan is to help businesses understand the value of hiring people with disabilities and strengthening our workforce. We need to change mindsets and build on the progress we’ve made. We want to make sure that Ontarians are not overlooked in the job pool simply because they have a disability.", "There are clear benefits to this. In 2010, the Martin Prosperity Institute outlined that by building an inclusive Ontario, we would see a $7.9-billion increase to GDP, and that is good for business.", "Mr. Speaker, we’re focused on being a world leader, setting the standards in accessibility, while building an innovative next-generation economy here in Ontario. To get there, we need the talents and skills of all Ontarians, including people with disabilities.", "Along with my special adviser on accessibility, the Honourable David C. Onley, we’re focused on promoting employment opportunities for people with disabilities. We’re all privileged to have Mr. Onley helping lead these efforts. I can’t imagine a more respected or more accomplished Ontarian when it comes to driving us forward to become a more accessible province.", "Ontario has an employment standard that was established under the AODA. To be clear, this standard does not force employers to hire people with disabilities, but as part of a significant long-term societal shift, it helps raise awareness and break down barriers for qualified people right from the point of applying for a job. For example, organizations must implement accessibility requirements by a certain time, rather than waiting for an individual to make a complaint under the Ontario Human Rights Code.", "The public sector has been required to meet the employment standard since 2014, and it will come into force for large private sector and non-profit organizations in January 2016. We want companies to understand that the shift to an inclusive mindset in human resources will help draw the best talent and grow their bottom line.", "In our action plan, we announced two new employer-focused programs. Our Ontario Community Loans Program will provide small and medium-sized businesses with discounted rates on financial products, such as loans, when they commit to hiring people facing barriers to employment, including people with disabilities. We’ll be partnering with financial institutions to deliver this program next year. We’ll also be introducing a new $5-million Partnership for Accessible Employment program. This program will help small and medium-sized businesses with knowledge and human resources training, to give them confidence in hiring and retaining persons with disabilities.", "Our government has also established a Partnership Council on Employment Opportunities for People with Disabilities. This summer, the council presented its first recommendations to me, and we are already moving forward on many of them. I want to take this time to thank all members of the partnership council for their past and their ongoing leadership and advice.", "Mr. Speaker, while Ontario is a global leader in accessibility, we’re also leading the way in cutting-edge accessible technologies and market and investment opportunities. Nowhere was this more apparent than during the province’s first and highly successful Accessibility Innovation Showcase, held during the Parapan Am Games. It brought together top innovators, investors, academics, students and the public to see new discoveries and market-ready technologies. Innovators included eSight, an Ottawa-based company whose revolutionary digital technology is making it possible for people with low vision to see. This technology allows people with vision loss to enhance their lives by making education and workplaces accessible to them. It even made it possible for a new mother to see her newborn child for the very first time. More than 50 companies and organizations attended the showcase to demonstrate their amazing accessibility technologies—companies like AlterG, which has developed bionic leg technology, and Komodo OpenLab, which has developed solutions for people with upper-body mobility challenges to gain access to computers, smart phones and tablets. These are just a few of the companies offering incredible technological innovations and further positioning Ontario as an accessibility leader.", "Technological advancements may soon level the playing field for people with disabilities. Unfortunately, we’re not there yet, and there’s still more work to do.", "Mr. Speaker, Ontario embarked on its ambitious journey towards becoming an accessible province a decade ago. We’re proud of what we’ve accomplished and look forward to supporting more change in the years to come.", "I invite and challenge businesses to work with us to continue to build on our strengths and sharpen our focus, and illuminate our path towards our goal of an accessible province by 2025—an Ontario where people can contribute their skills to the workplace, reach their full potential and help grow our economy. So please join me in observing National Disability Employment Awareness Month." ],

It’s wonderful that we have this opportunity to increase awareness about the positive outcomes of hiring people with disabilities. It is true that some people have a disability so severe that they can’t enter the workforce in any capacity, but there are many who want paid employment but are unable to attain it, not because of their condition but because of barriers in the workplace.", "Discriminatory hiring practices, unwillingness to offer accommodation and accessibility can all be issues. Some employers may hesitate to hire people with disabilities because they aren’t comfortable having that discussion with employees and because they don’t have a comfortable working knowledge about disabilities, duty to accommodate, the costs related to accommodations or what their legal obligations may be. The discussion about disabilities has broadened in the social context, and we need to extend that conversation to the workplace.", "There were 10 disability types identified in the latest Canadian Survey on Disability: seeing, hearing, mobility, flexibility, dexterity, pain, learning, developmental, mental-psychological and memory. Many of these disabilities are not visible and are not well understood by people who have no personal experience with them. That’s exactly why we have National Disability Employment Awareness Month, so we can open up that discussion and help to ensure that good information is out there for employers and for prospective disabled employees.", "It’s an unfortunate reality that there are almost 800,000 disabled working-age Canadians who are able to work but have no jobs. Almost half of these people have post-secondary education. Very good work has been done to narrow the gap in employment between people living with disabilities and the general population, but there’s still much to do. It’s not just about having a job; it’s also about underemployment and addressing gaps in education and in wages as well.", "It’s important that we recognize that taking steps to address these issues is not just for the benefit of disabled people, but also for the good of our employers and for Ontario’s economy. When it comes to recruitment, companies that open the door a little wider will find a segment of our workforce whose potential is waiting to be unlocked. With rising retirement, failing to build a more inclusive workforce represents a large opportunity cost.", "There are many great stories we hear from employers who have realized there are benefits to hiring people with disabilities: for example, the tech companies who are hiring people who fall on the autism spectrum, recognizing how the focus and attention to detail associated with autism can, in fact, be a great asset. Tim Hortons has a great record on this front, and owners of those franchises report that disabled employees are often the hardest working and most dedicated. Other companies are recognizing that it pays to have a diverse workforce that resembles their customer base and can speak to a broader clientele. For those disabled employees, this means independence, confidence and the opportunity to put their skills and knowledge to use.", "The benefits of labour market participation are a key component of social integration. In my riding of Lambton–Kent–Middlesex, there are many organizations that do great work to provide job skills and facilitate employment for those living with disabilities. Right across the street from one of my constituency offices, we have Middlesex Community Living, which has been doing tremendous work on this front for 50 years that has been benefiting both the people they support and the entire Strathroy-Caradoc community at large.", "The bottom line is that we all see positive social and economic outcomes when we take these steps to build an inclusive workforce that leverages people’s abilities instead of focusing on their disabilities. I hope this month will help open up that dialogue and help us move toward a fully inclusive workforce in the province of Ontario." ],

The definition of “disability” should be interpreted in broad terms. People with disabilities include physical, non-physical, visible and non-visible disabilities of all types, including diabetes, epilepsy, partial hearing loss, chronic pain and depression.", "As Ontarians, we understand that employment and economic security are critical to fulfilling our hopes and aspirations. We also know that we are stronger when our province can benefit from the skills and talents of all of our citizens. No individual in our province or country should face unnecessary barriers to success, and no Ontarian with a disability should be limited in his or her desire to work. A large number of working-age Ontarians have some sort of disability. One in seven people in Ontario have been identified as a person with a disability. Over the next 20 years, that number will rise as our population ages. According to Statistics Canada, 15.9% of Canadians have a disability, and an astounding 49% of adults who have a disability are not in the workforce.", "People with disabilities are far more likely to be unemployed than the rest of the population because of the barriers they face, and most of the time, those barriers are not physical. It’s a lot easier to address the barriers we can see, hear or touch, but invisible barriers also make it hard for job seekers to obtain employment. Respect for the dignity of persons with disabilities is the key to preventing and removing barriers, as indicated by the Ontario Human Rights Commission. This includes respect for self-worth, individuality, privacy, confidentiality, comfort and independence of persons with disabilities.", "During National Disability Employment Awareness Month, we must challenge ourselves as a community to renew our focus on improving employment opportunities and career pathways that lead to good jobs and comprehensive economic futures for people with disabilities. I commend workplaces across the province that have an attitude of inclusiveness and give people with disabilities an opportunity to work.", "People with disabilities have the fundamental human right to full integration and participation in society. They should be able to access services, employment and housing, and face the same duties and responsibilities as everyone else. They deserve to retain the small income that they have been able to earn without those earnings being clawed back. When we have this discussion of awareness, it is important that we recognize the financial hardships that are put on the backs of people with disabilities. It’s not fair and it’s not acceptable. I was relieved to hear the government’s decision to suspend the cancellation of the Work-Related Benefit, funds that allow the opportunity for bus fares, lunches and work clothes. Those funds are the difference between working or not working for some.", "As the MPP and critic for community and social services, I will continue to advocate for legislation that will advance the equality for workers with disabilities and play a role in educating my community about accessibility rights and relevant legislation, such as the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, the AODA, as will our NDP critic the member from Essex. He will also be fighting those battles when it comes to the AODA, making sure that we’re pushing it forward and holding the government’s feet to the fire to make sure that we get it done.", "Ontario has laws to improve accessibility for people with disabilities. The goal of the AODA is to achieve accessibility for Ontarians with disabilities with respect to goods, services, facilities, accommodation, employment, buildings, structures and premises. Businesses have an obligation to make their facilities accessible. Under the Ontarians with Disabilities Act, ministries are required to produce and make available to the public annual plans that identify how they will set out and remove barriers to accessibility.", "I will continue to address the government in keeping them responsible for supporting the rights of workers in Ontario." ],

  "text" : [ "Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I’m pleased to rise in the House today to speak to third reading of Bill 37, the proposed Invasive Species Act. Ontario’s natural resources provide a significant source of jobs and economic benefits for our province. They’re also a priceless asset in terms of our quality of life. As a consequence, we must take stronger action to address the threats that invasive species pose. We remain committed to addressing this serious threat to our environment and to our economy. With this legislation, our government is showing leadership on this important issue.", "I was reminded of this recently when I attended the annual general meeting of the Ontario Invasive Plant Council, held at the Royal Botanical Gardens in Burlington. I was pleased to address this forum and had the opportunity to consult them and secure their feedback on the legislation and, perhaps more importantly, its implementation.", "One of the reasons why we decided to act is because Ontario is located contiguous to the Great Lakes. As a consequence, our waterways and our extensive trade links make us more vulnerable and put us at greater risk than other provinces. As a result, more invasive species have become established in Ontario than any other Canadian jurisdiction.", "Finally, climate change puts stress on ecosystems, making them more vulnerable to threats from invasive species. We need to act so that future generations will continue benefiting from Ontario’s rich natural legacy.", "Managing invasive species has always been a shared responsibility across all levels of government, with industry, with environmental groups and with the public. One of the reasons that these partnerships are so critical is because more than 20 provincial and federal acts are used in Ontario to respond to invasive species threats. These include the Canada Shipping Act, a piece of federal legislation that manages the discharge of ballast water; the Plant Diseases Act, a provincial act banning the transport and sale of diseased plants which could include an invasive insect or pathogen; and the Public Lands Act, again a provincial statute that allows landowners to remove some invasive plants from their shorelines.", "None of these laws were designed specifically to address invasive species. If passed, the Invasive Species Act will be the first stand-alone legislation of its kind in Canada. It would complement the role of the federal government in managing invasive species and it would promote shared accountability for managing invasive species.", "Another important aspect of this legislation is how it addresses the threat to our biodiversity. Once invasive species are introduced into the wild with no natural predators, they can spread very quickly. Invasive species often out-compete domestic species for food, and they can destroy the habitat of native species. Invasive species are the second-greatest threat to species at risk in Ontario, and they are a leading cause of extinction of species globally.", "Closer to home we continue to hear about the pernicious impacts of two invasive species, not only in our consultation with stakeholders across the province, but also I heard them from representations made at the annual Association of Municipalities of Ontario meeting. Two such examples include invasive phragmites, which release toxins from the roots into the soil to harm and kill surrounding plants. It degrades habitat and decreases food supplies for native wildlife, including several species at risk. The invasive dog-strangling vine impacts the reproduction of the monarch butterfly, which is a species at risk. The butterflies lay their eggs on the plant but the larvae are unable to complete their life cycle and do not survive.", "Invasive species are also a quality-of-life issue. Fishing and hunting are fundamental to the tradition of all Ontarians but in particular our First Nations, and Ontarians of all walks of life value our natural environment. Invasive species are a threat to the beauty of our natural areas and all our communities. They impact the lives of every Ontarian and cost the Ontario economy tens of millions of dollars each year. They also threaten resource-based jobs in the forest industry, commercial and recreational fisheries, tourism and agriculture to name a few.", "By applying a risk-based approach that considers the full range of threats, costs and benefits to the environment, society and the economy, Bill 37 would provide the province with better tools to prevent, control, monitor and eradicate invasive species. It would help by providing the powers to intervene earlier to help prevent invasive species from becoming established. It would give Ontarians the tools to ban activities, such as processing and transporting certain invasive species. It would allow the government to enable rapid-response actions to stop an invasive species from spreading. And, when needed, it would provide strong inspection and enforcement powers as part of a modern regime necessary to prevent threats today and unknown scenarios well beyond those we can anticipate.", "A broad range of stakeholders have expressed strong support for further action to address invasive species; indeed, we saw this during public hearings. The stakeholders include municipalities, conservation groups and industry. They recognize the need for stronger action to manage this threat to Ontario’s natural environment and our economy.", "We have listened to stakeholders and the public and recognize the importance of using clear language in the proposed bill. That is why we amended the names of the classifications from “significant” and “moderate threat” species to “prohibited” and “restricted” species. This language is commonly used in other pieces of legislation and is consistent with class names used in other Great Lakes jurisdictions. This is important because the Great Lakes governors and our Premiers have committed, through bi-national agreements, to work collaboratively to combat aquatic invasive species, so using the same names for classifications strengthens our partnership abilities.", "They also provide clarity, enhancing the capacity of the public to understand the rules governing them. The public will further understand and appreciate that “prohibited” means that a species is generally not allowed, and they will also know that “restricted” means that a species may be allowed under certain conditions.", "Prohibited species will have the full suite of prohibitions applied to them. Restricted species will have the full suite of prohibitions available to be applied to them; however, these prohibitions and restrictions would only apply if prescribed in regulation. Our government, as consequence, will conduct significant consultations and will solicit feedback from stakeholders and the general public.", "By making this change, we are making it clear that prevention is the key to fighting the effects of invasive species and prohibited species that threaten Ontario and state clearly that they are not allowed. This change also provides flexibility to the public and landowners who are vital partners when it comes to invasive species.", "The change to “restricted” species would allow prohibitions to be applied on a case-by-case basis. This flexibility will allow us to balance prevention and management objectives with landowners and other interested parties. This change is especially important to landowners who, through no fault of their own, may have restricted invasive species already established on their own property. The goal with restricted species language is to clarify the classification in order to prevent the further spread of these species and to inform the public on how to safely manage them.", "Based on additional stakeholder feedback, we have also made an amendment to broaden prevention measures by enabling the preparation of prevention and response plans for all listed species. We have listened to stakeholders and the public and recognize the need to take a more preventative approach to managing invasive species. Enabling the participation from the public and stakeholders is essential to effectively managing and controlling invasive species. Allowing the development of prevention and response plans for both classes of invasive species will better enable and guide partners and stakeholders while undertaking the activities. Prevention and response plans will be available online and easily accessible to interested parties and members of the public. This change will strengthen the act and enhance our ability to implement the tools necessary to successfully prevent, detect and rapidly respond to invasive species threats.", "We recognize the need to exempt partners and individuals from sections of the act for the purposes of implementing prevention and response plans. Partnerships and co-operation from the public will be critical to the successful implementation of the act. This change will clarify that an individual is not contravening the act as long as he or she is undertaking the prohibited activity in accordance with the provisions of the prevention or response plan. This means that landowners and partner organizations will be able to assist in the destruction and management of an invasive species while also ensuring appropriate prohibitions are in place to prevent their spread.", "When it comes to personal information, we have listened to the Information and Privacy Commissioner’s office and have made amendments to strengthen the protection of it. This change makes it clear that information can only be collected for the purposes of notifying individuals that they may have been in contact with an invasive species, giving notice of an order or facilitating public consultation.", "Finally, we recognize the importance of making information on actions and orders associated with the proposed Invasive Species Act available to the public. That is why we made an amendment to improve transparency and help with educating the public on actions and orders taken regarding invasive species.", "The change will require the ministry to publicly report on the use of any minister’s orders to control an invasive species threat. Our government is committed to transparency and making information available about invasive species, and this will be a key component of prevention and response plans.", "In closing, no invasive species are currently listed in Bill 37. The proposed act would enable the Lieutenant Governor in Council to make regulations to list invasive species and carriers of invasive species that would be subject to the act.", "The proposed act would provide the minister with the authority to temporarily designate an invasive species where the threat posed requires immediate action.", "If the act is passed, extensive public consultation would occur before any species would be listed in the regulations, and any proposed regulations regarding any invasive species would be based on risk assessments that consider the environmental, social and economic impacts.", "Stakeholders, including industry, would have an opportunity to review and comment on any proposed regulations before they are made or enforced. Consultation would include posting proposed regulatory conditions and associated information on the environmental and regulatory registries so that the public and stakeholders could review and comment.", "If passed, this proposed legislation would broaden the actions we can take in combatting invasive species. To manage them most effectively, we must find them early and respond quickly.", "Preventing new species from arriving and preventing the further spread of those invasive species already here is the most cost-effective approach to addressing the long-term impacts of invasive species." ],

  "text" : [ "It is a pleasure to speak to Bill 37, the Invasive Species Act.", "The intent of the bill: Those of us on this side of the House agree with the intent of Bill 37, the Invasive Species Act. We understand that invasive species are an urgent problem that has potential catastrophic, adverse impacts on the environment and on the economy. Whether species invade our waters, such as the Asian carp, or our land, such as the invasive phragmites, the potential harm invasive species can cause is significant.", "While we support the intent of Bill 37, I still have a number of noteworthy issues with the bill as currently written, which I feel are worth repeating in this forum.", "Prior to submitting amendments to the committee, I wrote to the Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry identifying my concerns with Bill 37. I articulated my feeling of disquiet with the sections authorizing warrantless entry, pointing out that private property rights are the foundation of Western developed civilization and that the continued erosion of the rights of private property owners, even for the noblest of causes, is simply wrong and creates mistrust between residents and government.", "I submitted that education and outreach lead to co-operative, mutually respectful relationships with landowners, which results in much better outcomes.", "In addition, I asked that the bill be amended to include clearer language on full, fair and timely compensation for the loss of use, enjoyment and/or value of private property.", "We all know it is wrong to steal, regardless of the motivation. If it is wrong to steal, I submit that it is doubly wrong for the government to use its monopoly of force to steal from citizens. Governments use vaguely worded terminology such as “the public interest,” as defined by the government, to routinely take private property from citizens. I cannot emphasize enough that the taking of private property and/or private property rights, such as the loss of use, enjoyment or profitability and/or a decrease in the value of private property, needs to be fairly compensated in a timely manner.", "The provincial government’s history with respect to taking and the lack of compensation is disappointing, to say the least, which is why I asked for clear language to be included in the bill to safeguard the rights of private property owners. Unfortunately, that request fell on deaf ears.", "Subsequent to the public hearings, we worked diligently to craft thoughtful amendments to submit to the committee which addressed these and other issues—amendments which were tossed out by the government without thought or care.", "Costs and benefits: Another related issue I have with the bill as currently written is my well-founded fear that the government will socialize the benefits and privatize the costs of the removal of invasive species through the implementation of this bill. What I mean by that is that society as a whole will benefit from the removal and eventual eradication of invasive species, but the individual landowners will foot the bill. This is unfair on the face of it, given that the threat of invasive species coming onto private property is not necessarily the fault of individual landowners and generally cannot be controlled by individual landowners. The landowners certainly want to help tackle invasive species, but may not have the knowledge or expertise to identify an invasive species and/or the necessary resources to properly remove particular species.", "The mismatch between who pays the costs and who reaps the benefits is not a new issue, particularly when it comes to obligations imposed on landowners. Government wants the benefit of the people’s work and resources, but is often unwilling to pay the associated costs.", "This same issue plagues the implementation of the Endangered Species Act, which financially penalizes individual landowners who currently host species at risk on their property while exempting everyone else from those costs, including opportunity costs. To reiterate, the landowner who currently hosts the species is at risk to bear costs; those who potentially contributed to the species becoming at risk bear none of the costs. This is upside down and, in the end, incentivizes bad behaviour; namely, “shoot, shovel and shut up.”", "People do not want to behave badly, but when you threaten their livelihood and their family, they often feel they have no choice. I believe that government—including legislation, policies and programs—needs to undergo a fundamental attitudinal change to that of incentivizing and rewarding good behaviour rather than prohibiting and punishing everyday common activities, and therefore incentivizing bad behaviour.", "People want to do the right thing. We need to find a way that encourages, motivates and assists people, not punishes them for protecting their families and themselves from an intrusive government.", "On warrantless entry: In the 17th century, the famous English jurist Edward Coke wrote that a “man’s home is his castle.” In 1763, in a speech to the British House of Commons that vividly illustrated the strengths of the protection of property rights, William Pitt said, “The poorest man may in his cottage bid defiance to all the forces of the crown. It may be frail, its roof may shake, the wind may blow through it, the storm may enter, the rain may enter, but the King of England cannot enter; all his force dares not cross the threshold of the ruined tenement.” Property rights have long shielded homeowners not only from assaults from other people, but also from assaults by government themselves.", "In 1991, Canadian Supreme Court Justice Claire L’Heureux-Dubé wrote, “Both the legislator and society as a whole recognize the truth of Edward Coke’s adage ... property rights are considered fundamental in our democratic society,” which gives rise to the question: Why does this government continue to include warrantless entry into so many of its bills? Warrantless entry is a sure way to anger landowners, if that is the government’s intent. If, on the other hand, the government’s intent is to eradicate invasive species, creating instantaneous suspicion and conflict, and initiating battles with frustrated and angry landowners, is not the best strategy.", "Warrantless entry is also a fundamental breach of Canada’s Charter of Rights protection against unreasonable search and seizure. Police officers must obtain a warrant, barring exigent circumstances, to enter private property, even in the pursuit of a suspected murderer. Why, then, are bylaw officers, provincial enforcement officers or even charitable organizations given power-of-entry authority onto private property? Do they have superior training to police? Are they less likely than police to abuse their power? As observed by Peter Jaworski of the Institute for Liberal Studies, it is perverse to say that because the stakes, i.e. the punishments, are less, the protection against unreasonable search and seizure should be discarded.", "Increasingly, we are witnessing the creation of laws focused on accommodating the public service—focused on their convenience versus accommodating and protecting the rights of residents.", "In conclusion, even though I support the intent of the bill, which is to remedy the problem of invasive species—I will support this bill, but under protest, given the potentially significant adverse social and economic impacts on property owners and municipalities of warrantless entry and the lack of compensation." ],

We all have the same goal: to stop invasive species from damaging our natural wildlife, from damaging our economy, from damaging our way of life. We have to look at, also, the history of invasive species, because now we have—I guess the ones that come to mind: phragmites, the Asian carp. We have purple loosestrife, which we’re still dealing with.", "Actually, if you take a walk in Queen’s Park, in the park part of Queen’s Park, there are a bunch of trees from other parts of the world, and they’ve got plaques on them saying where they’re from. If you take the act too far, they could be invasive species. In my former life as a dairy farmer, the Holstein cow could be conceived of as an invasive species to North America. Obviously, we don’t want to eradicate the trees in Queen’s Park or Holstein cows. But we have to make sure that the act is comprehensive enough and flexible enough to make sure that, although those things sound ridiculous, other actions equally as ridiculous don’t result from this act.", "As I’ve often said in this House and will continue to say, it’s easy to make regulations that appear to work wonderfully in these halls, but out in the country or in the suburbs or in the city might not work as well as we think they’re going to.", "So while we support the intent, there are a few parts in this bill that cause some concern. We’re going to vote in favour. We can live with them. But we want to make sure they’re on record that they’re not definite enough, and that we have to, in the future, look forward to what the minister does or doesn’t do with them.", "This bill gives the Minister of Natural Resources an awful a lot of power. In some cases, when you’re dealing with an invasive species, when a species that’s unknown to the province is invading your territory, the minister needs power. We’re not disputing that. But power is dangerous.", "If you look at the bill, 15(1), on who is qualified to be an inspector—“The minister may appoint a person or class of persons as inspectors for the purposes of this act”—it says nothing about how qualified these people are or what organizations they belong to. That’s a problem.", "In 15(2): “An enforcement officer is an inspector for the purposes of this act by virtue of his or her office.” We’re in favour of that. We have conservation officers who are very good at their job, who know native species, who know introduced species, who know invasive species. They’re good at their job.", "In my riding, we’ve got 50 townships that are patrolled by two conservation officers. I think it would be a better idea if, instead of giving the minister—“appoint a person or class of persons as inspectors for the purposes of this act”—to actually say in the act that the minister should make sure that there are enough conservation officers in the province to make sure they can handle the new powers given under this act. That would be better. Right now, in many parts of this province, there are not enough conservation officers to control hunting laws. It’s easy, it’s nice to make a new regulation, which we need, but we also have a duty to make sure that these regulations, which are very powerful, can actually be enforced; that if we have an invasion of a species, which happens—it has happened with the carp; it has happened with phragmites—that we actually have the professional capacity on the ground to deal with it.", "Right now, judging by the capacity we have on the ground with the Ministry of Natural Resources on wildlife species, on nuisance bears and on a lot of other issues, it’s questionable whether that capacity on the ground exists. Does it exist in theory? Probably. But does it actually exist in a fashion where we can actually react?", "One thing that’s happened in the past with the SPCA and quality care for animals is that we have people who are involved with animals, with farm animals, and they want to take care of them, and in some cases—not all cases; I don’t want to paint with a broad brush. But we have had instances in my riding as well where people didn’t have enough training for the powers that they were given, and that was a disservice to the owner of the animal, to the animal and, also, to the inspector who had the best interests of everyone at heart. We run the risk of doing this again, because we don’t have the quality of people, the amount, the number—we don’t have the number of trained people in the province right now to enforce the powers that are here right now, before we pass this act. So after this act is passed, these people are going to have even less time. So that’s a big consideration.", "I flip to another section of this act—it’s on page 29—29(1). It’s regarding compensation. With invasive species, it could very well be that a landowner has an invasive species—and there’s two or three different quantifications of species here in this act, and I’m not going to get into that. But it could very well be that a landowner has an invasive species on his property that is discovered, and it’s deemed that it needs to be destroyed. That’s a loss to the landowner. The landowner himself or herself wasn’t responsible for bringing that species there. So this act talks about compensation, and that’s a good thing, because it’s happened in the past that society wants to make a decision for society, but an individual pays for society’s decisions. What happens there, Speaker, is that the results you want from the act don’t happen.", "That happens with another act: endangered species—very different legislation. In that case, a landowner, if he has an endangered species, often isn’t compensated, so as a result the endangered species becomes more than endangered. That’s because the Endangered Species Act looks great on paper, but it isn’t as good as it could be if it actually worked with the landowner. So at least this act recognizes that there are cases where, when society wants to make a decision for the betterment of society, for the betterment of all Ontarians, all Ontarians should help pay for the betterment. I think it’s a step in the right direction. As all acts, it could be more prescriptive, but the fact that compensation is mentioned in the regulations is a good thing.", "I’d like to return to the fact that the minister can decide, after we pass this act, who is actually the inspector. There are a lot of powers. You can go, warrantless, on people’s property. You can’t go in their dwelling; according to this act, the inspector needs a warrant to go into the dwelling, but no warrant to go into the rest of the—now, I’m a farmer, so I’m thinking of a farm. I don’t know what kind of invasive species could be in a barn, but if an inspector decided that there is a risk of an invasive species being in someone’s barn, they could just trot right into that barn without a warrant, despite biosecurity protocols that that farm would have in place, despite rules like that. That’s worrisome, because, with this act, we don’t know what training those people will have.", "A conservation officer—different story. Conservation officers are well trained. I don’t think everyone in the province always agrees with some of their interpretations, but they are well trained. So we have a lot less problem with the conservation officer because we know what their training is, we know what their background is, we know what their purpose is.", "But the part where the minister “may appoint”—it doesn’t prescribe what qualifications the person has. So you can appoint someone to go warrantless in your farm buildings when the owner doesn’t know what the qualifications are. That’s a problem with this act, and I think that’s something that we have to be very careful and cognizant of as we proceed.", "In closing, we are in favour of this act. I, personally, would really like to encourage the government to actually make sure that there’s enough horsepower on the ground to enforce the laws we have now regarding species—endangered species, wildlife species and now invasive species—because, right now, it’s not there. We need to make sure that laws and rules and regulations that we talk about here actually work in the field, in the forest, in our beautiful lakes and rivers." ],

  "text" : [ "I’m glad to stand up and speak on third reading of Bill 37, the Invasive Species Act. I was happy to speak during second reading of Bill 37. I, at the time, talked quite a bit about the deficiencies in the bill, as I should as the opposition member, and hopefully during committee time the government would take heed of the notations I made during my debate and possibly affix any amendments to the bill. I’ll be discussing that further on down the road, but, first, I am glad Bill 37 has reached third reading. It has been over a year since it was first introduced by the government. Before that, it was introduced in a previous form in their previous term as government, and unfortunately, it hadn’t made its way into law yet.", "I know Ontario is in desperate need of some sort of organization in order to deal with the invasive species that are occurring throughout Ontario today. Particularly, we look at Asian carp, and the member from Haldimand–Norfolk has been a champion on dealing with the Asian carp invasion throughout our province. We’ve seen a few of the carp making it into our waterways. That’s quite a concern when you look at the devastation these fish can cause our environment. Unfortunately, I had hoped that, two years ago, when the government first brought out this bill, it would have been a priority for them to pass it and get it into legislation so perhaps we could have prevented some of the problems coming forth with Asian carp.", "I know the federal government did their job when, over a year ago, they introduced changes to invasive species in the waterways and, in addition to taking care of ballast water, they introduced a bunch of new regulations that would help to battle the Asian carp. But ideally, we need the province on board in order to deal with the tragedy that may occur if the Asian carp does, in fact, join our waterways, particularly in our Great Lakes.", "I also want to talk about phragmites, Mr. Speaker, and the potential phragmites plays in destroying our wetlands, destroying our farmland and destroying any waterways that we may have throughout our cities. I’m proud to say, in my riding, in St. Thomas, David Collins, who’s the chair of the St. Thomas Phragmites Control Committee, has been hard at work trying to control phragmites within St. Thomas. They have a goal of, by 2020, St. Thomas becoming phrag-free, and they’re well on their way to the goal. I’m sure if this bill is in place, it would enhance the ability for them to attain their goal—and in general, getting access to the necessary chemicals they need in order to fight phragmites.", "I’m sure that everyone knows at home what phragmites is: It’s that tall, weedy-looking grass that we see every day on the sides of the 400-series highways growing up. I always wondered why nobody was cutting the grass, but it’s the phragmites. Their root structure is tremendously huge. It goes through and kills other vegetation along the way. Usually it grows in wet areas; that’s why it’s always in ditches. Unfortunately, it’s such an invasive species that nothing else survives in its potential to grow.", "The inability for local farmers and groups such as the St. Thomas Phragmites Control Committee to access the necessary chemicals to deal with phragmites has been terrible. We need safe chemicals, of course—they have to be able to use them in waterways in order so that it doesn’t kill our waterways but kills the weed. The necessary way to treat the phragmites is usually in the fall—you nail them in the fall and then again in the spring, and hopefully they don’t regrow.", "If you don’t treat phragmites, which is potentially a problem—we look at Long Point conservation area, which is bordering my riding but, again, into Haldimand-Norfolk’s area—the wetlands, the places where ducks live, where they migrate to and from, are being taken over by phragmites. It’s definitely an invasive species that needs to be taken control of.", "We’ve seen the effects of phragmites overgrowth already. If you look at Harsens Island, which is on the American side of the St. Clair River, and you look at Walpole Island, which is on the Canadian side—massive fires from phragmites overgrowth. That’s the downside of phragmites: It’s such a dry plant that it burns up quite like an inferno and quite quickly. Harsens Island was almost burnt to the ground a few years back because phragmites caught fire. The fire department had the boats out trying to control the fire, and it took quite a bit; the same with Walpole Island.", "I’m glad Bill 37 has finally made it to third reading. I’m hoping the government can implement this in a timely manner going forward once it is passed, because we’ve made note that we are supportive of it. Of course, the government, being the majority, will pass it. This brings me back to my concerns, and I’ll just reiterate my concerns that we had during the initial reading of this bill:", "Public consultation: This bill, again, has had little public consultation from its development. As I said, it has been two sessions of the Legislature. You’d think, when they took the time after the last election, before reintroducing it, they could have had plenty of time to have the proper consultations that certain groups felt they were excluded from, and made the changes to the bill and reinstate it. Obviously, the government wasn’t in that much of a rush to get this bill passed; it’s pretty close to a year since they introduced it. They could have probably put it off a month or two after having proper consultations.", "We find that this bill is very reactive and not proactive. It’s harder to deal with a problem once it’s already situated in the province. It’s better to deal with a situation before it comes in. That is taking an approach—and I got this idea from Ontario Nature, which is an organization which is deeply invested in our environment: to use the pathways approach, which basically outlines what an invasive species is before it hits Ontario, much like they’ve done down in New Zealand, where they put the necessary precautions in place to stop the invasive species from coming in.", "Right now what’s going to happen with this bill is, we will have a strategy to deal with invasive species, but we wait until they come and affect our environment. We had hoped the government would have taken a science-based approach of determining what should be prevented from entering the province so it doesn’t become an invasive species.", "We’ve also dealt with the information with landowners—downloading the responsibilities to landowners. Who is going to pay for what? Is the government going to have access to woodlots, to simply walk in and clear-cut a woodlot without even talking to the landowner? Under this legislation, that can happen. We kind of wish the wording would have been changed and some sort of compensation would have been in place for the landowners, not only so they don’t get stuck with the bill for MNR coming in and clear-cutting, but to compensate them for the damage that would be done—and hoping to redevelop the land that the government is going to walk in and destroy.", "We brought forth many amendments to this bill. It’s pages and pages of amendments. I’ll tell you what: Not one amendment was approved by this government. It’s unfortunate that a government that is wanting to work with the opposition, wanting to make a better Ontario, thinking that we can all work together but, unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, there was nothing accepted in amendments on the PC side. Again, this government says one thing and does another.", "Hopefully, as we go forward—we have two and a half years left to work together for the betterment of Ontario, and I’m hoping, come committee time and when other bills come forward, that when we have a discussion of possible amendments they will listen to us and possibly make some passes.", "As I said earlier, I’ve talked to many groups regarding Bill 37. We do still have our concerns with the bill; we’re going to support the legislation, because invasive species—we do need a strategy from the government to help landowners and to help groups that want to deal with invasive species—like phragmites, like I mentioned—so that they have access to the tools that are necessary for them to ensure that the spread of these invasive species is minimized.", "We hope the government will go forward and expand upon the Invasive Species Act, going further; maybe they can stick in regulations that we start looking at creating a list using science-based evidence of what we can restrict from coming into this province—much like New Zealand has, as I mentioned earlier—creating a system that protects our environment so that we’re proactive and not reactive.", "Thank you again, Mr. Speaker, for allowing me to have the opportunity to make further comments on Bill 37. I look forward to hearing from everyone else." ],

Also in the riding of Essex: Tracey Ramsey has taken over the riding of Essex for the New Democrats, and we’re very pleased about that, down in our neck of the woods, in the great southwest.", "Speaker, it’s a pleasure to stand here today and be the voice of the residents of the riding of Windsor–Tecumseh. It’s always an honour to stand in this House and take part in the debate, but when we’re talking invasive species, it really hits home because, down in our neck of the woods, we’re a part of the Great Lakes river system—the St. Lawrence River system, if you will. It extends all the way up through, starting at our 100 Mile Peninsula, if you will, down around the Pelee peninsula or south Detroit, whatever you want to call us.", "We are very familiar with the history of the invasive species on the Great Lakes. If you go back to the 1970s, I can recall the big debate over the sea lamprey eel at that time. The sea lamprey got into the Great Lakes. It was eating a lot of the fish—many good fish. Then I think that was followed by the spiny water flea, the round goby, zebra mussels, purple loosestrife and the emerald ash borer.", "I remember being on city council for seven years, and we had to deal with the first hit in Ontario of the emerald ash borer. It cost us millions of dollars, because we lost thousands of trees, trees that used to be on our boulevards and in our parks system and on our great streets. You have to take them down, Speaker, when the emerald ash borer gets into the ash trees, because they weaken them. You can’t leave them up because, in high winds, they’ll come down. They’ll come down on cars; they’ll come down on homes; they’ll come down on children playing in the parks, if the emerald ash borers attack the trees that are in our city parks.", "Right now, of course, the big war is over phragmites. Phragmites looks like a decorative grass, like the old, tall prairie grassland that we used to have in a great part of southwestern Ontario, but it isn’t. It’s an invasive species and it eventually will wipe out a large part of the vegetation.", "I think the member from Timiskaming–Cochrane spoke about the patchwork of the 20 or so federal and provincial bills dealing with invasive species. At least this bill, the provincial bill, will put it all in one ministry, and that is long overdue.", "The member from Timiskaming–Cochrane also talked about the number of inspectors that will be needed. Of course, if you’re going to be hiring inspectors to keep track of all of these invasive species, you need money, and there’s no money in the budget. In fact, the ministry is one of the ones that’s getting a 6% cut, so where the inspectors who are going to police this new bill whenever it gets up and running are going to come from, I don’t know.", "When you talk about losing, say, a tree, such as an ash tree, and you think of the value of a tree, some people just take them for granted. But when you think, really, they’re the lungs of the Earth and they improve the air that we breathe; they take the pollution out of the air. It’s important to us in my part of the province, because the prevailing winds blow pollution from Michigan, Ohio, Indiana and Illinois; they blow that bad air from the coal-burning plants, the steel mills and so on into southwestern Ontario. So we need all the trees we can get.", "I remember when I was on the Essex Region Conservation Authority, I planted hundreds and hundreds of trees every year. I was on the authority for seven years, chair for a year, vice-chair twice, and I planted a lot of trees, Speaker. That is so important, and I give full credit to the Essex Region Conservation Authority for all the work they do, let alone alerting us to invasive species but also the planting of trees, not only to replace the ash trees that we’ve lost but all species of trees which help us breathe better air. I think that’s a very important thing that we do.", "Earlier today, the member from Windsor West and I presented a petition to the House. We’re talking in this bill about invasive species, but the petition we presented has over 12,000—12,873 or something like that—names of people who are worried about protecting the land around the Ojibway Prairie Complex. That’s a park system right on the river, right near the Detroit River, and it totals 332 hectares. It represents half of the city of Windsor’s remaining natural areas.", "We’re talking invasive species, but at the Ojibway nature complex we have 160 species at risk. That’s 20% of Ontario’s species at risk and 32% of Canada’s species at risk, and it’s the world’s and Canada’s most endangered ecosystem. We have 4,000 species living on the site: over 700 plants, 100 of them rare; 3,000 insects; and, if you do a manual bird count, 233 bird species. We have breeding evidence, actual evidence, for 71 species. We also have 15 mammals. So as we talk about invasive species, we have to do more to protect the species that we have already who are at risk.", "And where this park is, Speaker—I know you’ve been down around there, down around Windsor Raceway—has been designated as natural heritage. Environmentally significant areas are there. It’s a provincially significant wetland right there and an area of natural and scientific interest. The way we protect biodiversity—it hosts 12 endangered species right there, so they want us to do more to protect what we have as we discuss the threat of invasive species coming in and the inspectors that we need for that.", "When you have 91 species at risk, including six endangered and 12 threatened species under the Endangered Species Act, I think we have to do more to help those people in their petition drive, and I hope that the government will eventually see fit to do so.", "At various times in the last few weeks, we’ve been up talking about—let alone invasive species—the need to protect the Great Lakes. I think we’re all pretty well on board, at least in the Liberals and the New Democratic Party, on protecting the Great Lakes—a bill that we are fully supportive of. As I say, when you live in that 100 Mile Peninsula and are bordered by water on three sides, you know the value of the Great Lakes.", "We’ve seen the lakes used as a political football, and I hope that nobody uses this species-at-risk/invasive species bill as a political football. What we need more than anything else, I think, are some timelines to actually get some things done, some money in the bill to actually do everything that we want to do.", "When I was talking about the threats to the Great Lakes not that long ago, Speaker, I brought to your attention the great Canadian author Pierre Berton. Pierre Berton wrote a coffee table book back a few years ago, about 20 years ago, called The Great Lakes. This great Canadian iconic author saw Lake Superior as “remorseless and masculine.” Lake Huron, to Mr. Berton, has 30,000 islands; it reminded Mr. Burton of “a fussy maiden aunt,” while Lake Michigan, half wild to the north and heavily industrialized in the south, he saw as “an errant uncle.” Pierre Berton said that Lake Erie “is a wilful ingenue of changeable mood and false promise.” As you know, Speaker, Mr. Berton lived in Toronto, and when he looked out at Lake Ontario, he saw Lake Ontario as “a complacent child.”", "We recognize the value of the Great Lakes, but we know that invasive species can easily get into the Great Lakes. We’ve all heard in recent weeks, months and years of Asian carp and the threat of Asian carp getting into the lakes and destroying the species that we have now that thrive in the Great Lakes.", "I know the federal member for Windsor West, Brian Masse—congratulations, Brian, by the way, on your victory last night, a resounding victory in Windsor West—has been talking at the federal level about the threat of Asian carp and the need to, if you catch them, eviscerate them before you can ship them. If you get these carp and they get away and get into the lakes and propagate, we’re going to have a real problem.", "Brian Masse has also made a big deal out of a lot of the other things that threaten the Great Lakes, such as those minuscule little plastic beads that you don’t really see, but they’re there in our toothpastes and shampoos and so on." ],

Those of us who like fish—I grew up on the east coast, and my grandfather, my mother’s father, made his living as a fisherman back in the day. When he was a boy, he would get on a schooner and go out in the middle of the Atlantic. They’d put him in a little dory and he’d row out, put his cod trap out, put his net out, and catch the cod, then try to find the schooner. Sometimes, in the fog, it was difficult, or in terrible, terrible weather.", "As a child, I used to enjoy summer vacation, getting into a little dory with my grandfather and jigging codfish or jigging squid. I remember one time we filled the little dory right up to the gunnels with squid. Nobody of his generation ate squid; they used it as a bait to put on the hook to catch cod. But those were the days where I had a great appreciation of nature, of water and of fish, so when I came up here to the Great Lakes—I get nervous when people talk about invasive species and how invasive species, if you allow them in, can take right over. We’ve seen, as you know, on the east coast, the decimation of the cod industry, where now in Newfoundland, you normally get out once in the spring and once in the fall for a couple of weeks to actually do what we used to do every day down there, just go out and catch your dinner.", "When we talk about the importance of invasive species, I think we really—no matter where we live in this great province. Wherever we live, be it in the Far North or, where I am, in the deep south, east or west, you have to take seriously any threat of the species. If you have invasive species coming in, be it in the water, be it in the air, be it in the trees, we have to take it very seriously.", "This bill is a good step in a lot of those directions. I think we have to do what we can to protect what we have, and this bill does that, although it doesn’t go all that far enough. There isn’t enough money in there to do everything that it purports to do. As the member from Timiskaming–Cochrane was talking about, the accreditation of the inspectors that are needed—we haven’t really nailed that one down yet.", "I just think we have to do more. I think the bill is worth supporting, especially when you look at some of the fines that may be imposed—a maximum fine of $250,000 for individuals and imprisonment of up to a year, and actually for corporations it could be $1 million. If you have a fish store and you’re bringing in Asian carp and you get caught, you could be facing $1 million. I think that would put most of us out of business.", "I will say, if we haven’t already talked about it, that the bill does have the support of the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters, the Ontario Forest Industry Association and the Ontario Invasive Plants Council, but some of those agencies do say that more funding is needed.", "Thank you for your time this afternoon. I hope all members of this House will take this very seriously, and the bill is certainly worth supporting." ],

I’m looking forward to working with her through my provincial office. I know she’ll do an excellent job for the electors and for the constituents of Sarnia–Lambton.", "With that out of the way, I’m also pleased to rise and speak to Bill 37, the Invasive Species Act. We understand the impact that invasive species can have on our environment, whether it’s our lakes, our wetlands or our forests. We also understand how difficult they are to control, when they can enter the province through so many different methods and in so many locations: through lakes and rivers, like the Asian carp; through the air; through boating; through the transportation of raw wood and other forest products; through importing products made from animals. There are plants, fish and insects, such as the emerald ash borer beetle and the Asian long-horned beetle.", "It is a complicated issue that should have had extensive debate and committee hearings. That’s why when I spoke to this bill on second reading, I asked the government to hold committee hearings in different parts of the province to ensure that we were hearing from everyone who had a role to play in protecting Ontario from invasive species, and to hold a committee meeting in the north to make sure that we were hearing from the forest industry.", "In 2014, the port of Hamilton handled more than 10.5 million tonnes of liquid, dry and break bulk cargo. Shouldn’t the committee have gone there to hear from them? The Windsor-Detroit gateway is Canada’s busiest land border crossing. Shouldn’t the committee have gone to hear from them? And Sarnia–Lambton as well—the second-busiest border crossing. In fact, when they spoke at the hearing, the Ontario Invasive Plants Council recommended developing six to 10 regional plans to prevent invasive species from entering this great province. Shouldn’t people in those regions have had an opportunity for input?", "Instead, last June, the government moved a motion which limited committee hearings to two days, and with the way in which they structured the motion, it forced both of those hearings to be here in Toronto. So instead of travelling to hear from the people who should be part of the fight against invasive species and who will be impacted by this bill, the committee listened to the people of Toronto.", "In fact, Robert Whiteside from the Current River Hydro Partnership tried to have his voice heard and to present to the committee by telephone, but the connection was so bad that he asked my colleague the member for Carleton–Mississippi Mills to deliver a letter to the committee later on his behalf. He had concerns with the definition of invasive species, but by that point, the government’s time allocation motion wouldn’t allow any more amendments. Some organizations were so limited on time and had so much more to say that the members on the committee gave up their time to allow these organizations to speak.", "Limiting debate and opportunities for these organizations to participate is not listening as the people of Ontario are having conversations, as this government promised. Instead of advertising in regional papers to ensure that different organizations and people had a chance to provide input and make this bill better, the government limited notice to the Ontario parliamentary channel, the Legislative Assembly’s website and Canada NewsWire. And instead of allowing all parties to work together in committee to create the best of amendments, the government prohibited new amendments during clause-by-clause.", "The Ontario Invasive Plant Council said during committee hearings that “the act does little to engage the majority of Ontario’s organizations that have direct interest in control of invasive species, and does little to provide tools that will control unlisted species or tie together a collaborative, integrated approach.” They also asked to have municipalities more involved.", "In their presentation, Forests Ontario said that “efforts must be made to develop collaborations to assist in the implementation of invasive species programs.”", "We put forward amendments that would have made this bill more collaborative, so that it was working with the owners of the land rather than punishing them. We put forward an amendment to try to make decisions more science- or evidence-based, which the government blocked. We put forward an amendment to prevent warrantless entry—which the member for Carleton–Mississippi Mills spoke about earlier, and the member from the third party—which, again, the government blocked.", "I know that there are many people in the Legislature who don’t understand the unintended impact of this clause on things like biosecurity on our farms. Our livestock is impacted by diseases that travel across borders, just like invasive species. I want to commend the farmers on the steps that they take to reduce the spread of these diseases and to protect their livestock. Over the last couple of years, farmers in my area of southwestern Ontario have dealt with PED and H5N2 avian influenza. One of the ways that these diseases spread is on the clothing, footwear and vehicles of visitors to the farms. An employee from the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry travelling farm to farm to look for an invasive species could accidentally contribute to the spread of these diseases if they don’t follow the biosecurity protocols.", "Farmers themselves are taking preventative measures to prevent diseases from spreading, such as building truck washes, but in order to be successful, they also need control over who visits their property. That’s why it’s important that no one is simply granted access to private property; instead, they should have to get permission, so there’s an opportunity to have that conversation, an opportunity for the farmer to explain why it’s important to change his footwear, or for the farmer to prevent the employee from visiting after being on an infected farm.", "We made this point during second reading debate, and it appears that the government chose not to listen. This is a government that once boasted about having conversations, but now, our entire third reading conversation on this complex issue is limited to two—count them; two—hours divided among three parties. The government time-allocated this bill after only three days of debate: one day per month, March, April and May. Let’s put that in context. The government reintroduced this bill last December, so in six months, they only chose to call the bill for three days, and then felt it was necessary to time-allocate it to get it through.", "The timing of that motion meant that the government couldn’t call the bill until this September, some nine months after it was first introduced. They didn’t make it a priority to debate the bill, and then forced it through, with limited committee hearings and debate. If they had chosen to call it for additional days of second reading last spring, maybe they could have spent time travelling last summer to hear from the people who have been impacted or will be impacted. They could have gone to the north to listen to the forestry industry. They could have gone to border cities like Windsor, Niagara, Sarnia and Cornwall. They could have given those organizations more time to express their concerns.", "The people who will be impacted by this bill deserve better. The people who are impacted by invasive species deserve better. Our environment deserves better. It’s something that we often hear from stakeholders: that they want to be part of the solution. They want an opportunity to share their concerns and they want government to listen. We’ve heard from stakeholders who say they used to have those opportunities, but now they don’t. We’ve heard from stakeholders who are frustrated that the government seems to charge ahead without giving people and organizations that will be impacted the opportunity to have meaningful input.", "Even though they’re forcing this bill through, I hope the government will take the time to reach out to those stakeholders as they implement the bill to make sure it works. For the future, I hope the government will the importance of hearing from people outside Toronto: people from Oxford, people from Sarnia–Lambton, Niagara, London, Windsor, Ottawa, Cornwall—both from MPPs who represent those areas and, through travelling committees, from the people directly." ],

  "text" : [ "I’m glad to have a few minutes to talk about Bill 37, An Act respecting Invasive Species.", "As you know, Speaker, I represent a northern rural riding, the riding of Nickel Belt. I can tell you that, throughout my riding, forestry was a great industry. When you talk about invasive species, the first thing that comes to mind, the one that all Canadians have followed, had to do with the mountain pine beetle and the damage that it did to the forest industry in British Columbia.", "Of course, you can find those invasive species—the mountain pine beetle could easily have been found in the boreal forests of Nickel Belt, so it is extremely important that we have a monitoring system in place, that we have a good preventative system in place in order that the devastation that has happened in British Columbia does not repeat itself in Nickel Belt, or anywhere else in Ontario, for that matter. The boreal forest is something for all of us to share, and we know that an invasive species can destroy a great part of a boreal forest in no time flat.", "I, like both of my colleagues who have spoken before me, am worried that there are no resources attached to this bill. In order for people on the ground, boots on the ground, to do the monitoring, to do the science, to do the inspection, you need to have people on the ground. Those people are going to be part of MNR, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry.", "Let me tell you, Speaker: During constituency week, I had the pleasure to meet with a representative of MNR in my riding, like I do on a regular basis. The first thing we talked about was trapping minnows. Lots of people in my riding make a living with a bait-and-tackle shop. They trap minnows and sell them to anglers and fishermen, and they make a good small business out of it. Well, the way it works is that you get a township, you get an area, where you’re allowed to trap minnows. MNR gives you the permit to trap minnows in an area. But the MNR is so backlogged—when you don’t use your township any more, when you don’t trap minnows any more, it is supposed to go back to MNR and be auctioned off. Now you can go on Google any time of the day, Speaker, and you will see that people who hold those licences are actually selling them to other people. That’s not right. That’s actually illegal, because the township—the right to harvest minnows is something that belongs to the crown, is something that is governed by MNR, but MNR is so under-resourced that they don’t have time to make the system work the way it is. People have found out about it, and some people are making money doing things that shouldn’t be happening, but MNR doesn’t have the resources to stop them.", "I talked to them about selling crown land. I mean, I’ve been an MPP for eight years, Speaker. Did you know that there are people who came and saw me the first week I was elected to tell me about the problem of buying crown land? They have a land use permit with the MNR. Their neighbours to the right and their neighbours to the left got to buy crown land. They’re smack in the middle, and eight years later, Speaker, we still do not have a deal. Why? Because MNR does not have the resources to do its work, to seek the market value of the land that they’re supposed to sell.", "Why am I talking about this, Speaker? Because the connection is direct: Do I want my province, my forests, to be protected from invasive species? Of course. Everybody does. We want our lakes to be healthy, we want our forests to be healthy, we want our environment to be healthy, but in order for that to happen you need to have boots on the ground. You need to have resources within the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry for this to happen, but right now, they don’t have the resources to do the job that’s already on their docket.", "Let’s talk about bears. I come from Nickel Belt. We had over 2,000 complaints against bears last summer. Most of them, the great majority of them, came from Nickel Belt. When I sit down with the people from MNRF, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, it is clear that some of the decisions that were made back in 2009 when changes were brought in were directly linked to a lack of resources. As the resources from MNR—it wasn’t MNRF at the time, it was just MNR—were squeezed out, they made decisions that have a direct impact as to the thousands of bear complaints that we’ve had in our community.", "What could ever lead us to believe—lead me to have confidence—that MNR suddenly will find, within their own resources, boots on the ground to make sure that Bill 37 is actually carried out? Because right now, for me, Bill 37 is wishful thinking. It is motherhood and apple pie. Do we want to protect ourselves against invasive species? I don’t know too many people who would say, “Oh, no, Speaker. We don’t want to protect ourselves against invasive species.” Of course we do. The support is there. It could have been done way better, and my colleagues have talked about this, and certainly colleagues from the PC Party have also talked about how we could be more sensitive to protecting private landowners from those measures. But none of this is possible if there are no resources.", "I’m here at Queen’s Park. I look at what kind of resources were allocated in the budget in order to carry out this new bill that everybody thinks is a great idea. Well, the response is not only do we have zero allocation of new resources, we actually have a cut to that ministry. So that ministry that cannot do a good job with the township allocation for minnow trapping, this ministry that cannot do a good job at selling crown land because they don’t have the resources, this ministry that cannot do a good job at handling bear complaints when it comes to the safety of our residents is going to be tasked with even more responsibility.", "Speaker, this being the fall season—one of my favourite seasons, right after winter—it’s hunting season. If you come from Nickel Belt, it doesn’t matter where you go in Nickel Belt, everybody is with the NDP. No, not really; they’re wearing orange because they’re hunting, but it looks like they’re with the NDP, doesn’t it? It does. Everywhere you go, people are wearing orange. If it’s not the hat, it’s the jacket, the pants, the whole—it’s because they’re hunters.", "There are hunters throughout my riding, Speaker, and, if you look, the story is pretty sad. There were very few moose tags allocated in Nickel Belt this year for reasons based on science, and all of that was explained to me. But look at the scenario here, Speaker. You have people who have paid to be in a draw for 30 years in a row, 25 years in a row, 20 years in a row, and never got a tag. They have entire hunting parties that have no tags for moose. A tag is what you need to be able to go hunting for a moose, and it will tell you if you can harvest a cow, if you can harvest a bull or if you can harvest a baby moose. But if you have no tag, you can’t. For all the areas around Gogama, which right now has more NDP-like, but really, hunters dressed in orange per square mile than you can shake a stick at, there is one conservation officer. So you’re talking hundreds of hunters with all sorts of different calibre rifles walking through the forests, some of them bird hunting, some of them hunting rabbits—it’s kind of cute right now, because we have no snow on the ground. We had a little bit, but not much snow on the ground in Nickel Belt, but the rabbits have already shed their fur, so they’re already kind of in the process of going from brown to white. They’re pretty easy to see when they’re wearing that white fur coat because the temperature has changed and their coat has changed, but there is no snow on the ground. They make easy targets.", "All this to say that I have a lot of hunters throughout Nickel Belt going about their business, some of them are really unhappy that they did not get a tag for a moose or a deer, and are not able to go hunting. Then they look at it and say, “Really, what is my chance of being caught? We only have one—a very good one, don’t get me wrong—conservation officer. We have hundreds of kilometres of forest. What if I take a chance?”", "Then poachers start. We have those great posters that say, “Report a poacher.” What does that mean? That means that we haven’t got enough conservation officers within MNR to do their job, to make sure that the hunters are respectful of the tags you’ve given them and of the different laws.", "Here’s another law that I will support and everybody else in my caucus will support. This responsibility will fall on the shoulders of the MNR, and MNR is already—how I can say it?—under-resourced to the point where it is really hard for them to discharge their responsibility successfully. People know that. They know this, and it’s a real shame.", "So I’m all in support for Bill 37, but right now all it is is words on paper." ],

I want to bring forward a number of comments on behalf of colleagues, both from our party, but more importantly from my constituents from the great riding of Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound. I want to start off by acknowledging the efforts of my caucus colleague and the member for Haldimand–Norfolk, Toby “The Duke” Barrett, who has been an advocate—and a very vocal advocate—on this file for many years.", "In fact, I think Toby was probably the first to identify the Asian carp issue. He has been consistent, persuasive and determined to bring the threat of Asian carp forward to this government’s attention and to seek immediate action to stop it from invading our waters. It is a very big threat and we need to be all eyes, all hands on deck, pardon the pun—paying attention.", "I also want to congratulate my colleague from Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound Larry Miller on his re-election. Larry brought out a bill—although not invasive species—called C-383, the Transboundary Waters Protection Act. Again, all about water: We are surrounded in our great riding of Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound by the Great Lakes, so obviously, anything to do with water is of paramount concern to us and to the livelihoods and, most importantly, the health of our constituents going forward.", "As I have shared, my constituency is part of the Great Lakes communities, and we see first-hand the damage our waters sustain and the threats to our lifestyle as a result of those concerns. From invasive species to falling water levels, all of these can seriously hurt local businesses and tourism.", "Just a couple of things: the 28th Salmon Spectacular fishing derby, organized by the Sydenham Sportsmen’s Association and the Bruce Peninsula Sportsmen’s Association. It’s a huge, huge event that brings thousands of people to our community, and it’s a great opportunity for people to be able to go out and fish and enjoy the Great Lakes waters in our backyard. The 31st Chantry Chinook classic fishing derby: again, a great fishing derby right in our backyards, closer to my colleague Lisa Thompson from Huron–Bruce, but again, it provides a lot of economic spinoff, a lot of great enjoyment, and brings a lot of people back to the waters to be able to enjoy their time.", "Last year, falling lake levels grounded the Chi-Cheemaun ferry for a period of time. Again, a whole different challenge with our waters, but I’d like to actually extend appreciation to my colleague from Algoma–Manitoulin, Michael Mantha, and the current cabinet Minister of Northern Development and Mines, Michael Gravelle, who then was in MNR. We worked collaboratively and we were able to work on that to get some challenges taken care of that allowed the Chi-Cheemaun to sail, which again has huge economic impact on my riding certainly and that of Algoma–Manitoulin, on Manitoulin Island.", "Just as that one came back—the levels have come back to a more normal level—now, of course, one of the biggest concerns we have is the threat of invasive species like phragmites—a big, big concern. In 2014, I was involved with the Stop the Drop campaign with Colin Dobell. As I mentioned, now they’ve turned their attention as an organization to the phragmites. If you drive virtually anywhere in the province, you’re seeing it. It’s very invasive. It starts here and it actually starts choking out any other plant life around it. You really have to get down—I was fortunate enough to go to an overview from the national parks staff from the peninsula and they shared this: that you really have to go right down and tear these things out by the roots to be able to get these out of there. It’s very challenging, and very much they encroach and take over all other plant life.", "We need to encourage the public to take action to protect our shoreline from the phragmites invasion—they are like Asian carp—they just have roots and are very challenging to get rid of. They grow up to five metres tall and can grow even through asphalt. There is no doubt that invasive species present ecological and economic threats.", "We also have threats from the emerald ash borer, an invasive species that has killed thousands of ash trees throughout southern Ontario. Again, it’s one of these things where people may inadvertently grab some of that wood in more southern areas, like yours in Essex, and drive up to the beautiful Bruce Peninsula, bringing that wood that actually has the emerald ash borer. It very quickly spreads and is a challenge in all of those areas.", "In our riding, Saugeen conservation provides landowners, businesses or municipalities an inoculation treatment. For $500, you can buy a biological agent called TreeAzin to combat the emerald ash borer. It’s estimated that this emerald ash borer will cost us over $2 billion over a 30-year period. And we have yet to determine the ripple effects, which are the ecological impacts of ash tree mortality on aquatic organisms, birds and understory vegetation.", "In Canada, invasive plants alone cost the farming and forest industries an estimated $7.3 billion per year. As such, my constituents—there are people who are actually going to pay the freight and be most impacted by these types of bills. They’re paying very close attention to this legislation and they’ve provided important feedback. While they applaud the government’s efforts, they remain concerned with the manner in which some of these plans may be executed.", "Number one, the bill does not outline a science-based approach to risk assessment and decision-making. One of the things I try to do when I come here is stick with policy but based on scientific fact. We’ve tried to do that with a number of things: through the environment, through neonics, through certainly the Green Energy Act. We try to rely on science to ensure that we’re getting the best information we can from those experts, the scientific facts, and then make the policy decisions based on that.", "Inspection powers: The bill is punitive—warrantless entries—and presents fairness issues. Again, we want to just ensure that, while good in intent, it’s not allowing a heavy-handed person to go in and take actions that are not acceptable, particularly to the landowner, who may have inherited one of these invasive species with no real recourse at their end.", "The act downloads responsibility of implementation to landowners, leaving little incentive for landowners to act. One of the concerns I’ve heard, particularly from farmers, is that if something happens—you know, a lot of these are small farming operations. If that invasive species ends up on their very specific piece of land and the government comes along and says, “You shall mitigate in this manner,” many of those people don’t have the resources, they don’t have the ability, financial or otherwise, to be able to truly combat that and adhere to what the government’s saying, even though they may want to do that. Again, most landowners, particularly farmers living on the water, living off the land, are stewards of the land, and they want to do what’s right because it’s their family, first and foremost, that they’re worried about. They want to have the safest environment possible, but at the end of the day, if something comes onto their land and they have no ability to mitigate that and the government comes along, it can be very, very onerous, very stressful, and puts a lot of undue stress on them and their families. And what happens to the potential down the road for the younger children, the next generation to take over the family farm?", "Number three, Ontario’s enforcement officers are already under-equipped to adequately deal with existing legislation. Many, many cuts to the MNR—for example, the MNR upended the long-time bear management program and downloaded this responsibility to police who are not trained in wildlife management. Again, I’ve heard lots of concerns of that in my riding. The bears have become an issue at certain times. OPP police officers go out and they’re saying, “This isn’t our area of expertise. This should really be the MNR.”", "We’ve had a lot of MNR conservation officers in our area—we used to have five or six. When I was a young man starting actually to hunt in the Bruce Peninsula, there were five or six just in our area of Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound. Now you’re lucky to see one, Mr. Speaker. I know a retired conservation officer, Joel Tost, who fought this when he was still an officer. He was very concerned about the stewardship, the ability for him to truly do a good job, to enforce and ensure that the long-term sustainability of our fisheries, of our deer population, of all of our wildlife resources was going to be taken care of, but they continued to decline. People—I think my colleague from the north, France, said—" ],

It’s a first step in tackling the invasive species threat and helping to benefit the health of our waters.", "I just want to share a couple of other things in my last couple of minutes.

It’s not just me in the beautiful Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound area—I encourage anyone out there who has never visited us to come.

We want to ensure that there isn’t a heavy-handed scheme that is going to put undue challenges on innocent persons—again, someone who actually just happens to be the landowner. This invasive species ends up on their property, and they have the whole responsibility to mitigate that. That’s a challenge, and government needs to help support those and not totally download all of those costs on them.", "The bill seems a bit rushed. I think one of my colleagues from Sarnia–Lambton—a very esteemed member, again—suggested that there was limited time for debate for this. They are rushing it through the House. I’m not certain the exact term that he used—really, they were shutting down debate or rushing debate through. We want to make sure these things, when may have such a significant impact on our whole province—our whole country, in fact—are actually done logically, thoroughly and with that scientific community involved.", "There are not a lot of precautionary, preventive actions oriented with this bill; it’s more reactive, after something gets in. Like health care, we want to be more proactive; we want to keep people healthy as opposed to always trying to fix them afterwards. No different here: We don’t want to try to fix it once we allow Asian carp into our waters. We want to put regulations in place that absolutely ensures that Asian carp will not get in and decimate our great fishery.", "We want to ensure that there are enough resources to handle the inspections. It’s one thing to have a piece of legislation that says “you shall and you will,” but if there aren’t the boots on the ground to actually enforce and ensure the people are engaged and actually working collaboratively with you, then, again, it’s really just a piece of paper. We want to ensure that it does not remove property rights from landowners. Actually, it inversely prevents the landowner from proactively dealing with invasive species.", "We really, truly want to be able to support this, Mr. Speaker.

I think we see the Provincial Offences Act, the Executive Council Act, the legislative act, the Provincial Parks and Conservation Reserves Act, the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act, the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act—that’s an interesting one, because freedom of information is very difficult, with this government, to secure for the people, let alone the members of the Legislature—the Public Service of Ontario Act, the Proceedings Against the Crown Act, and the Ministry of Natural Resources and, I think, the Ministry of Transportation. So it’s a caretaker bill. It’s meant to clean up a number of issues. It touches health care, but I don’t see in the bill where it’s actually improving health care.

We applied again, got a consultant in; we were successful in the second round. It’s an important thing in our riding because there are many, many people with no doctors. We had an instance of one doctor who had retired due to health reasons and had well over 2,000 patients. They had no place to go. So the clinic, although late, was certainly important in our riding, and it was something that I think was well needed.", "When we look through how the project was funded, it was fully funded by the province, and one would think, with the urgency—especially with one doctor for 2,000 patients, but, of course, many more residents in my riding with no doctor—that this would be an urgent process to move through. But it certainly was anything but a smooth process. Actually, it was almost like a circus. You take one step, you wait for approval, and you wait and you wait. The next step comes, and you wait again. The process was extremely long.", "Of course, Ontario is a big province, but there’s no question that common groups like these nurse practitioner clinics were all on the same—the first round was under way when the second one started, so you had about 20 of these that were under way. There was a lot of collaboration between them—“How are things going?”—and unfortunately, none of them were going well. So we would issue plans and wait.", "It was interesting, because we had hired somebody in our riding who I guess was well suited to deal with the government—because it was quickly realized that most of the municipalities had provided seed money. Of course, the government knew that, so they were $100,000, $200,000 or $300,000 in the hole, money they weren’t supposed to provide, but there was no question that people wanted these clinics. That was just part of the strategy.", "In our case, when you’d be waiting for approval, she would call up and say, “We’re out of money. We’ll wait until you approve it, but this is my last day of work.” Of course, the ministry, knowing that it would be a problem bringing things back up, knowing that the township was not going to fund more construction, would say, “Well, give us a day or two.” And lo and behold, money would appear.", "Look at the time and the waste and the energy of building these clinics that, of course, the government was very much promoting as being in a rush to put up. It took about a year and a half. In our case, we were the second clinic in Ontario, I believe, to be opened. When you consider that there were 10 that started the year before us, you can imagine the waste and the time put into this.", "But one of the things we had to deal with was the choosing of electronic records. The province gave us a list of 10 or 15. We had to go out and hire a consultant to evaluate them, to choose them. One would think there would be a standardized system. But $10,000 or $15,000 later, the consultant comes back with his recommendation, which was required for the funding. We go and we put the system in place, and six months later, the company is bankrupt and we have to start all over again.", "You can imagine the number of institutions in this province that were using the same eHealth records and had to start from scratch again, go out and purchase new software, put it in and do the training. That’s just an example of when you don’t have an integrated eHealth system. That’s good governance, and we just don’t see that here, and it’s just money that’s wasted and gone.", "In my riding of Stormont–Dundas–South Glengarry, that’s the biggest issue that we have. We want good governance, and good governance is efficient government that gets serious results for the money they put in. This is hard-earned money.", "We have a rural area with farmers who are depending on the weather. They don’t know what they’re going to have from year to year. But they believe that a government should be able to have a procedure that’s well documented so that they know what’s happening. They’re not dealing with the weather here. Putting records in, getting software development and IT—I mean, we just saw it with children’s aid—another fiasco when it comes to IT—and it’s just not showing a government that is showing much in the way of good governance.", "When you go through this, it’s just examples of waste with electronic records. BC has got a system, and they got it from the pharmacists. My understanding is that it was relatively free. So there are ways around it. There is off-the-shelf software. You don’t have to build everything from scratch. I mean, if you look at project after project when it comes to IT, it’s a failure with this government. So I don’t think we want to get involved with anything to do with IT, because they just can’t handle the projects.", "I talked about my nurse practitioner clinic. Just after being elected here, back in 2012, we were called back because, if everybody remembers, in the summer we were having trouble with the teachers.", "When I was on the board at the clinic, we had somewhere around 2,000 patients and a waiting list of about 800. There’s still a waiting list today for our nurse practitioner clinic.", "I got a call from an agency in my riding saying that they were having problems with the clinic—“You better give them a call.” Now, one would wonder why it would come through an outside agent and not the clinic itself, but of course there’s that fear with our institutions—" ],

They hadn’t received any funding since March 31—approved budget; bank account was empty. They were in the process of having to lay people off. They didn’t want to do that because that would be very disruptive. When I talked to the executive director, he said, “We haven’t paid our hydro bills. We haven’t paid everything—we can’t pay, but we have to pay our wages. We consulted a lawyer, and if we don’t pay them, the board is responsible.”", "So I was on my way to question period and I sent a note across saying, “How could this be?” I understand half the clinics in Ontario are in the same boat, if you can believe it. This is a bill to deal with good governance, and I don’t see anything about this. So the minister comes over and says, “What’s the problem?” I said, “They’re out of money and they’re issuing layoff notices and I don’t think you’re going to want that because it’s going to be in the papers.” So the comment was, “Well, it’s probably their fault.” And I said, “Well, maybe it is, but it’s going to be in the papers.” Ten minutes later, they’re back: “The cheque is in the mail.”", "You can imagine the amount of money—there are probably 15 or 20 people there—that was tied up for six months. Why wouldn’t it be flowing with an approved budget? To think the information was that half the clinics in Ontario are in the same boat, and it’s something that nobody wants to talk about because if they bring it up, there is that culture of fear, as our member from Nipissing says. That’s what we see in this government. People are afraid to say anything because they are told that it could be worse next year.", "To go back to our meeting with Jim Wilson, the member from Simcoe–Grey, last year, that was something that the various agencies told us. They were warned. That doesn’t seem like good governance. I don’t think that would be something that our government would be very proud of, and I’m sure the official opposition would be in the same boat, but we hear that time and time again.", "But you look at the various issues they’ve had with this government—the gas plant cancellation. Billions of dollars wasted and all about—I mean the first comments were a mere few million dollars, as if a few million dollars is not a big deal. It only became apparent through our committee work after filibustering. I sit on a committee, where I sat just in June, where this government filibustered so we couldn’t receive our subcommittee meeting minutes, because they didn’t want us to question Hydro One. Now, I’m not sure what was so important to our committee. My colleague here, Mr. Pettapiece, sits with us; they didn’t want us asking questions, so they filibustered and we ran out of time. What were they trying to hide? Is that good governance? I don’t think so.", "The same thing happened through the gas plants, where a deal over the budget allowed summer hearings. It’s funny; you can’t filibuster for eight hours. The committee was able to request these records, and we see the results. We’re not sure really what was in these records. We got many records, no question, but the question is, what records didn’t we get? When you look at how important it was for this government to ensure we didn’t get this information—they prorogued the House, resignations; this was serious stuff. With a new leader in place, the first actions we see are more records deleted, more police investigations.", "When we talk about good governance, I see a bill here and I really wonder what it’s all about. It’s another name. It’s like two weeks ago when we were discussing the cessation of coal in power stations. We’re not burning coal anymore. Have we not got more important legislation? We have 300,000 manufacturing jobs that have left this province and we’re dealing with legislation that obviously is more around the title than it is the substance, unless there’s legislation we don’t know about that is going to burn more coal. That’s something that we see all the time. It’s all about substance, but we really don’t see, in the end, anything that’s really going to improve the situation in this province.", "I look forward to more debate on this bill." ],

How can anyone quibble with legislation that really is housekeeping changes that bring existing statutes into line, if you will, and some of the—when I look at this bill, Speaker, some of the details include things like amendments to the Family Law Act that will ensure that the new administrative child support service is as effective as possible in assisting children to receive appropriate levels of financial support from their parents.

A government that tries to—I can’t use the word “mislead” in this House, but it seems to me that when you talk about projects that are $40 million but they’re turning out to be billions, that’s not transparent." ],

The fund is intended to help ensure that, over the next six months, retirees have support to address critical health needs and to help them transition to available programs, such as the Trillium Drug Program. The fund is administered with the support of both US Steel Canada and representatives of the union and salaried employees.", "I’ve also been told that information sessions for retirees and their dependents will be organized to assist those who may qualify for the Trillium Drug Program. I will point out—I was given information—they don’t need to wait for these information sessions. There’s a 1-800 number that I’ve been giving out to a lot of former Stelco-US Steel people I’ve been speaking with. I’ll read it into the record: 1-800-575-5386. If they have more questions, I have also been passing on the email: trillium@ontariodrugbenefit.ca.", "Ontario has announced a $3-million transitional health benefit fund. However, across Haldimand-Norfolk, Niagara and the Hamilton area, we have something like 20,000 vulnerable retirees who are struggling with the grim reality that over the years they were asked to take pensions and pension increases in place of wage increases. As we collaborate on how best to support 20,000 US Steel Canada retirees, we can take a look at what this government has done before: Think of the auto industry. As a result of the 2009 recession, we all worked to support the auto industry. The Ontario government provided $4.6 billion to bail out both GM and Chrysler and their pensioners. The federal government contributed $9 billion; the US government contributed $66 billion.", "As I asked this morning, apart from supporting US Steel Canada’s restructuring process and apart from the transition fund, what specifically will this government be offering to pensioners at US Steel Canada? And we know that in his answer, Minister Sousa threw blame at the federal government for not releasing details of the agreement.", "Speaker, the reason I asked for this late show debate was to facilitate a more fulsome discussion of my supplementary question this morning; namely, just what are the plans and action steps being actively pursued in conjunction with this government’s strategy to support Ontario’s steel industry, more specifically the restructuring of US Steel?", "Obviously, much uncertainty remains with respect to future courses of action. As I indicated this morning, Lake Erie Works employees are vigorously pursuing new orders, rooting out waste and inefficiency. The assets are in play: land, plant, equipment, in whole or in part for any available investment, for any bidders—valuable assets. The coke oven, hot strip mill, galvanizing line and large acreages at both Hamilton and Lake Erie Works are all worthy of investment: at US Steel Hamilton, something like 800 acres; there are thousands of acres down at the Lake Erie Works. They’re in an excellent position geographically on the seaway—proximity to Toronto.", "We know that bankruptcy proceedings are complete; the process can begin. We understand that some companies could be interested. Again the question: What is this government doing to expedite the process? I refer specifically to the opportunities for restructuring." ],

As he knows, although the court proceedings are still ongoing, our government remains committed to working with all stakeholders. Our goal is to achieve long-term viability of the Canadian operations, but more importantly to ensure the best possible outcome for employees, retirees, suppliers, customers and all interested parties in this matter.", "While this effort is still ongoing, our government wants to ensure that over the next six months the retirees that the member from Haldimand-Norfolk spoke about have the support that they need to address critical health needs and to help them transition to available programs such as the Trillium Drug Program.

The fund is intended to help ensure that, over the next six months, the retirees have this critical support, especially towards their health needs.", "Details of the fund will be made available shortly. However, the province is working closely with representatives of the union and salaried employees, on behalf of the retirees, the company and the monitor, to develop the program’s parameters. As the restructuring continues, it is important to remember that the company is still operating and retirees are still receiving their pensions.", "We are pleased with the developments that have taken place in the Court of Appeal with respect to the decision for the court to hear arguments on unsealing the federal government’s secret agreement with US Steel. Throughout this process, our government has been at the table, working to help ensure the best possible outcome for the community and for all Ontarians. Our government’s top concern—I repeat: top concern—has always been and continues to be for all employees, retirees and families who are affected by this situation." ],

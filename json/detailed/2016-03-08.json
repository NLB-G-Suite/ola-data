Elliana is doing great, and Christine is recovering very well, as well. Rafi, our almost four-year-old son is in love with his sister, Elli. There’s an incredible bond that is being developed between the two. It was an amazing two weeks to be home with the family—with Rafi, Elli and Christine. It was tough to leave the family at home this morning to be here with all of you, my good friends.", "I do want to take a moment to speak on this important motion. I had the opportunity to view the budget from home on the parliamentary channel around 1 o’clock in the morning when I was looking after my daughter—that was a perfect time to watch the speech. I felt very strongly that the bill associated with the budget is an important piece of legislation. It really continues with the government’s plan to create jobs and grow our economy in Ontario.", "As you know, we previously committed to investing more than $134 billion over 10 years in priority projects such as roads and bridges, public transit, hospitals and schools. We are building on this plan; we are building Ontario up with an additional $3-billion commitment, bringing the government’s total infrastructure investment to more than $137 billion over the next 10 years. That is an unprecedented investment in our communities in every single part of our province, to make sure we are building a province that is modern and ready for 21st-century challenges.", "That kind of investment will result in about $160 billion over 12 years starting in 2014-15, which, as I said, is the largest-ever investment in public infrastructure in Ontario’s history. These planned investments will support, on average, more than 110,000 jobs each year, again benefiting people in all our respective communities across the province.", "In the 2016 budget, our government is proposing to modernize student financial assistance to make post-secondary education more accessible and affordable. Speaker, this is an important element. I have the great honour of representing Carleton University, as part of Ottawa Centre, where I speak to students all the time, and I can tell you that following the budget, there has been wide support for this important initiative that was announced in the budget. Under the proposed system, average tuition will be free for students with financial need from families with incomes of $50,000 or lower.", "These are just a few of the changes proposed in Bill 173, the Jobs for Today and Tomorrow Act (Budget Measures), 2016. This bill continues the government’s plan to build Ontario up and deliver on its number one priority, which is growing the economy and creating jobs across the province. This bill ensures that we continue to build Ontario up by investing in our future. It is important that we move forward with Bill 173 and bring it before the committee. In the last Parliament, this Legislature was ground to a halt and was unable to move forward on a lot of important bills, such as budget bills. Only 39% of government bills were passed in the last minority government; that’s compared to more than three quarters of bills that were passed going back to 1990.", "Voters of Ontario have sent us a clear message in 2014: They want our government, the legislators, to get on with the business of governing in their best interests. It is time that we end second reading and refer the bill to the committee. In committee, stakeholders will present their views, members of the communities will have an opportunity to contribute further to the bill and we will be able to hear directly from the public on their thoughts about this important piece of legislation. In committee, members will also have an opportunity to move amendments to the bill, which is an important part of the process of our parliamentary democracy.", "At the same time, this House can move to substantive debate on other important matters that are also before the House. There are a number of important pieces of legislation that have already been introduced which the government would like to debate in the House and move through the legislative process. I’ll give you three examples: Bill 100, Supporting Ontario’s Trails Act; Bill 151, the Waste-Free Ontario Act; and Bill 172, the Climate Change Mitigation and Low-carbon Economy Act, another very important piece of legislation.", "We would like to spend time debating some of these other important pieces of legislation currently before the House, but we cannot until Bill 173 is dealt with. Therefore, I very much urge all members in this House to support this motion and Bill 173 and help pass this bill as soon as possible." ],

  "text" : [ "I appreciate the opportunity to talk about this time allocation motion. This is something that we’ve seen, literally, time and time again from the Liberal government. They say one thing, but they really mean the exact opposite. They say they want to be open and transparent, but shutting off debate about this budget is exactly the opposite of that, so why would they want to do that? It’s because life just got more unaffordable for everybody in the province of Ontario, and this government wants to limit the amount of time that we here in the Legislature can talk about this. That’s the purpose of what they’re doing; let’s make that very clear. They do not want us standing here, in the Legislature, to put a microscope on this budget and be able to talk about the things that have indeed made life more expensive here in Ontario.", "The tax credits that had helped children, students, seniors and families are being eliminated. In fact, the vast majority of seniors will see the price of their prescription drugs double; 92% of seniors will see their prescription price double. That’s just a fact; it’s an indisputable fact.", "Speaker, we also have very serious concerns about anything this government tells us. They have lost all credibility, and I’ll go through some of the reasons why that has happened. The budget has now confirmed that the government is indeed using one-time money from the sale of Hydro, as well as contingency funds, to make their deficit appear smaller. Only a couple of months ago, they were bragging that the deficit forecast went from $8.5 billion to $7.5 billion. But if you look at page 100 in the fall economic statement, it tells you how. They used sale of Hydro money and plunked that into revenue. It’s one-time money; it’s not going to happen again and again and again. That tells us we have a structural deficit in the province. It means that our spending is higher than the money we take in. If you bring in one-time money to appear to balance, that solves the dilemma that day but not the issue that spending is higher than revenue.", "In a couple of years, after this one-time revenue runs out—of course, a couple of years brings us just to the 2018 election, when the one-time revenue will run out—you are going to see an all-out assault on our budget, Speaker. You are going to see a deficit balloon all over again, because it has been masked. In fact, the Financial Accountability Officer referred to the Liberal budget as vague and uncertain. He went on to say, “Maintaining balanced budgets beyond 2017-18 will likely prove challenging.” Why? Again, they are using one-time money. By that we mean from the sale of assets: the sale of Hydro One, the sale of LCBO headquarters and quite possibly the sale of 250 LCBO stores, unless we thwarted it yesterday, and the sale of the OPG headquarters across the street. Those are one-time assets that are going to be sold by this government.", "Bank of Montreal BMO Capital Markets described it this way: “Asset sales of $5.7 billion ... are one-time in nature, and don’t address any underlying structural deficit.” Speaker, that sounds kind of familiar. We’ve been saying that on this side of the aisle for two years, and now we have not only the Financial Accountability Officer coming out and acknowledging that but we have BMO Capital Markets using almost the exact wording that we have been using here for two years.", "Further, Speaker, Bryne Purchase, Ontario’s former chief economist and deputy minister at many ministries, stated, “The added revenue from cap-and-trade and the Hydro One sale helped to make the provincial numbers look better.” Everyone understands; we’ve all seen through this charade now. We understand what they’re doing: They’re taking one-time sales and propping up their revenue number. This is fake math; it’s voodoo math, and it’s a shell game with taxpayers’ money. That’s the biggest part of what they don’t want us standing here talking about. That’s why they’re time-allocating this: to get us out of here and not let us talk anymore about this budget and what it’s doing to families.", "Let me take a few minutes, Speaker, and tell you what it’s doing to families, because life is getting more expensive for the people of Ontario, thanks to this 2016 budget. Of course you’ve got the obligatory sin taxes on alcohol and tobacco; they’re going up. Wine prices will increase by 4%, and there will be a minimum price put on alcoholic ciders. The government talks about increased availability of wine, but their plan won’t be fully implemented for nine years—except the price goes up today.", "When we talk about cap-and-trade, that’s something they really don’t want to hear. I want to stop for a moment and commend our member from Huron–Bruce, who has done an exceptional job on this cap-and-trade file. She has shown us exactly what is going to happen to the pocketbooks of those in Ontario and what won’t be happening to the greenhouse gas emissions, thanks to this Liberal design of cap-and-trade. So I thank you very, very much.", "Look, climate change is a very serious challenge; nobody is going to argue that. The government needs a credible plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but you’ve also got to protect taxpayers and our economy. What we’ve seen now is that this government is taking advantage. They’re preying on the goodwill the people of Ontario have towards climate change. We want to see something done. This government is preying on that goodwill and using it as a tax grab. We’ve seen that from all of the financial services, who have said that this cap-and-trade is one time.", "You would have heard the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change stand up and say, “No, no. It’s protected by law. That money must go into”—X projects. Well, if you look at the projects—and it’s interesting: They did exactly the same thing with Hydro One. They told us that the money had to go specifically into transit and infrastructure, and ostensibly, it did. It went into transit and infrastructure, but that money was already budgeted. So they took the already budgeted money out of the bottom end of that and used it to lower their deficit. The transit and infrastructure fund did not change with that influx of money from Hydro One. It didn’t change the amount they spent. They just took that money and used it to artificially lower their deficit.", "Now they’re doing exactly the same thing with the cap-and-trade money. They talk about how it must be used for the various projects. Transit is one of them. So here we go again. They’re going to put that cap-and-trade money—now, we’re talking big money here, Speaker. This is $1.9 billion annually. We’re talking about putting that money, yes, into transit. They’ll tie a green ribbon around every project you can imagine and say, “This was thanks to the cap-and-trade money.” But all that money that was already budgeted, they’ll be carving that out of the bottom and stuffing it into the deficit. That’s exactly how they plan to lower the deficit, and it’s all imaginary, Speaker. There’s nothing new to be done about climate change with their budget. It’s a shame, and it’s a sham. I want that very, very clear.", "This $1.9 billion will raise the price of gasoline 4.3 cents a litre, and that’s before tax, of course. You’ll be paying about $400 a year, Speaker, in new gasoline taxes at the pump. Natural gas: The experts tell us that in only a few years from now, this will add about $475 to the average family’s natural gas bill, once this program is up and running. This is already on top of the skyrocketing hydro bills that families we all hear from just cannot afford to pay." ],

It’s about a $1,000 hit, just on those items alone, from cap-and-trade.", "The Premier, before the budget, said, “Oh, great news coming in the budget: We’re going to help you lower your hydro bills.” It was insulting to read just about the only line in that almost-400-page budget, the only line about the seniors and families who cannot afford their hydro bills. The only line was: “We’ve got something for you. From cap-and-trade, we’re going to give you $2 a month off your hydro bill.” Well, thank you very much, considering that in January alone your hydro bill went up $100. So thanks for the toonie, but you’re not solving the problem.", "There are families in Ontario—and these members here on the Liberal side were with us as we sat in the pre-budget hearing in Ottawa last year, and we heard from Jennifer, who said that because her hydro bill is so high, she has to decide whether to heat or eat.", "That is the Ontario that this Liberal Party has created. That is the Ontario that is seeing all aspects deteriorating, from businesses to the families who cannot afford to pay their bills. This budget is an assault on families, students, seniors and children.", "Here’s an example: seniors’ drug costs. According to Kathleen Wynne, if you’re a wealthy senior who earns more than $19,300—if you’re that wealthy—you can now afford to have the cost of your drugs double. The ODB, the drug benefit, will go from $100 to $170 and for every prescription they get they have to pay an additional dollar. That’s double. That’s the assault that this government is putting on seniors.", "If you participated in the home renovation tax credit—if you needed a wheelchair ramp, if you needed other things to help you in your home—that’s all gone now. They didn’t mention that in the budget speech. The budget speech was all aspiration but no operation.", "This is what’s happening on the ground: Families are struggling. If you have kids, you would have used the children’s activity tax credit. That’s to help your kids with soccer, hockey, and all of the sports and activities. That was a great tax credit, which is gone today. This is an assault on children and their parents. This is an assault on students, an assault on seniors and it’s an assault on families.", "If you wanted to enjoy hiking, camping, hunting or fishing, or decided to get a liquor licence, an event permit or a court application, every single one of those, despite what we’ve heard from the Minister of Natural Resources over and over, where he continues to either not understand his file or never to have read the budget—pages 190 and 191 are very clear. They tell us that service fees are going up, and they list all the fees, including hunting and fishing licences and parks. It’s very clear, and this minister and this government keep denying that that occurred.", "Pages 190 and 191 appeared in my budget. I don’t know why they can’t see it in their budget. There’s something really wrong when the government not only does this to the taxpayers of Ontario—puts this punitive financial strain on them—but then denies it as well. That’s more heinous.", "I want to have some fun with numbers. I like numbers; I enjoy that. I’ve said earlier, we have a structural deficit in Ontario and it’s masked by all of these one-time supplements. The government’s revenue projections for 2017-18 are $4 billion higher than the Financial Accountability Officer’s best-case scenario for Ontario. In the fall, he came out with a report and he said, “If all of our revenues magically hit this number here and our expenses magically are reduced to this number here, we’re still going to have a deficit of $3.5 billion in 2017-18.” That’s what he told this Legislature. Yet somehow this government has propped up the revenues and made that deficit appear that it’s going to disappear.", "I trust the Financial Accountability Officer and his staff; I trust their numbers. They’ve got a book they put out that shows how they got to that. The best-case scenario says we cannot balance. If everything goes perfectly, we cannot balance. Those are his numbers. Yet the government’s numbers—of course, when you just pluck numbers from thin air and you pluck in these revenue numbers that they’ve made up, that’s the problem. They’ve used these one-time revenues.", "A couple of other things the government did this year to artificially reduce their deficit: They removed $850 million from the contingency fund. That’s always a great way to appear to balance. They applied—this is my favourite. Just think about it, Speaker. In the fall the government came out with a budget—remember, I said earlier that they dropped their deficit from an $8.5-billion forecast to $7.5 billion? Magically, only a couple of months later, they came in at $5.7 billion and patted themselves on the back.", "What they failed to tell all of the people of Ontario is that they took a one-time—it’s called a departure tax that Hydro had to pay. It’s a grant or a payment in lieu of taxes. In the municipal world, the former mayor of Brockville and I would have called that PILT, payment in lieu of taxes.", "So they had to come up with a payment because they are no longer going to be a tax-free government-owned agency; they’re going to be an independent corporation. They had to pay $2.6 billion. That’s a one-time fee. They’re never going to get that tomorrow, the next year or the year after that. They took $2.6 billion and dropped it into their revenue, into one-time revenue, which magically lowered their deficit forecast from $7.5 billion down to $5.7 billion. It is unbelievable, Speaker, that they would do that, that they would artificially reduce their deficit. That didn’t lower the spending. The deficit is still there; it’s just artificially masked by this one-time payment. Of course, they also used, to get from $8.5 billion to $7.5 billion, the Hydro One sale.", "The government says they’re on track to balance, but here are some of the things, again, that they forgot to tell you they’ve included in the budget:", "—Crossing their fingers and maybe their toes, they are planning on getting an extra $1.8 billion from the federal government. That’s how they plan on balancing.", "—Next year, they’re going to carve out $1.9 billion more in personal income tax. I didn’t hear the finance minister tell us, “By the way, I’m raising your taxes.” He didn’t tell us that in his budget, but it’s $1.9 billion in new income taxes. It’s in their budget. If you get into the back, past the aspirational stuff, and get into the real facts, you can see where it is.", "—They’re also forecasting $500 million in sales tax increases.", "—They are forecasting $700 million in corporate income tax revenue and, of course, a further $500 million more than their original forecast from the cr—cap-and-trade. I almost said the same thing as the Premier. Caught myself there.", "The debt is projected to be $308 billion this year. That’s up from $296.1 billion. We are going to add $12 billion to our debt. Speaker, that means that we are the largest subnational debtor on the entire planet. That’s what we are number one in.", "The member from Parry Sound and I are both a couple of northern guys. We like to remember back to the good old days when we were number one. We were the number one mining jurisdiction in the world. Today, we’ve fallen to number 23. Well, they have replaced it by being the number one debtor in all the world. That’s quite an accomplishment.", "Debt is going to continue to grow. This budget projects that the debt will grow by $40 billion by 2018-19. Forty billion more dollars of debt will be added.", "I could go on and on and on, but I think you get the spirit of what I’m speaking about, that this government doesn’t want us here talking about this budget, and that’s why they are time-allocating this." ],

I think there’s maybe about five of us that were here at the time, before time allocation was introduced. But governments for over 100 years introduced budgets into this House, introduced all kinds of bills, and didn’t need time allocation to move them through the process. The parties would sit down and they would say, “Okay, which bill is it that I want to have more time on, or more committee time?” It was a bit of a back-and-forth between the House leaders to decide which bills were going to get more committee time and which bills were going to get more time in the House. Those that were non-contentious got through the House pretty quickly.", "If you’ll notice this order paper that we currently have, there’s a bunch of bills that we’ve all agreed on: the bill in regard to sexual assault, the bill in regard to stress in the workplace. There are all kinds of bills that we, quite frankly, were quite okay with and that we would have been able to limit—not limit, but not have as much debate, in order to have a bit of time in committee. Those bills that were more weighty, more substantive, that really had some issues that we needed to deal with, would have had more time in the House, such as this budget bill, possibly, and certainly when it comes to hearings in committee.", "But, no, the government has decided that it knows best. It’s going to time-allocate everything from now until the end of the session. It’s pretty clear, since we’ve been back in the spring session, that the government has moved time allocation on almost every bill for the last couple of weeks. I think that is, quite frankly, a disservice to the people of Ontario.", "This Legislature is about a couple of things. Aside from the powers that we have as legislators to do what it is that we do, this Legislature is here for members, who were elected by the people to come to this House and express the views of themselves and the people they represent on issues at hand. That’s what debate is all about. But it’s also for government ministers to listen to that debate, to say, “Okay. Well, you know, that’s not a bad point. Maybe when the bill goes into committee, we’ll think about having an amendment along that line.”", "But the big thing, and the most important thing, I think, that this House does is the committee process. That is to allow bills to go into committee, so that the public can have their shot at expressing themselves—either their favour or disfavour—as to any bill before this House. I would argue, up until the time before time allocation but even before the time of this government, the public had more of an opportunity to do so. Now the government has very much limited the amount of time we have at committee, using time allocation. I will argue that even the Conservatives, when they used time allocation in the time that they were in government, allowed more time in committee than this government does.", "The process by which committee was structured, as far as who can present, and when you had to apply and how we picked our people who were going to depute, was much more organized under the NDP and the Conservatives utilizing time allocation than this government.", "For example, last week, under time allocation, the government brought—the stress one.

Well, how in heck does that give the opportunity for the public to have any say about what goes on in that bill?", "There’s a bill where most people were in support, but quite frankly, people wanted to have amendments to the bill and wanted to explain the reasons why. But I think the secret in the way that the government wrote their time allocation motion—and that is related to this one—is that they really didn’t want to hear what the public had to say in any real way, because they weren’t about to amend the bill, based on what the public wanted.", "So it was a bit of a sham, Speaker, that the government used time allocation in such a way that, first of all, it limited the ability for you to apply to get to committee to appear, and then really limited your ability to say something in committee that would have any meaningful outcome when it came to any amendments.", "In this particular time allocation motion, the government says, “Oh, well, this thing will be voted on probably today,” depending if the government takes any time off the clock, “or tomorrow.” The government says, “Oh, well, look at this. You’re going to have until next Wednesday”—or Thursday; I think it’s Thursday—“next Thursday to be able to apply for application to appear before committee.”", "The only reason they put next Thursday is that next week is a constituency break, and the committee doesn’t sit until the week after. So only by virtue of a constituency break does the public have an extra few days to apply to stand before committee and have their say on this budget, a budget that’s going to increase costs to seniors when it comes to drug care; a budget by which we’re shifting the way that we run student tuition to where, yes, we make it simple, and some people will benefit at the front end. But there are a lot of people who used to qualify for the tax credits who will no longer get them because they’re no longer existent, and they will be losers.", "There are all kinds of user fees, as we know. There’s more privatization. There’s more austerity in this budget than Tim Hudak had in his last election. Let me say that again: Kathleen Wynne in this budget has more austerity than Tim Hudak proposed in the last election, if you really read through this budget.", "The public should have the right to have their say. I’ve got to say, this is not a service to the people of Ontario. A government has to be able to listen to what the people have to say, and the best way to do that in our system of Parliament is to allow committees to sit and for people to be able to come before committee to present.", "I propose that what the government should be doing is, first of all, not doing time allocation, but if they’re going to time-allocate, at least give the public a week or two—I would argue a couple of weeks—to be able to apply to stand before committee. Because here’s the thing: How many people are watching the television broadcast of this debate this morning? I would argue that the majority of Ontarians—I know you’ll be surprised, Mr. Speaker—aren’t watching this show. They’re doing something else. They’re probably watching the Republican primaries and the Democrat primaries on CNN or the Justin Trudeau show on the CBC." ],

So we’re very much limiting the ability of the public to have their say by having time allocation written in the way that it is.", "I would argue that if the government is going to time-allocate, there should be at least a couple of weeks so that the public is able to see the advertising, look at it and say, “What’s that all about?”; that they’re able to figure out how to contact the Clerk and get themselves on a list. It takes a couple of weeks for that to happen.", "I know the government House leader might find this a bit of a surprise, but Ontario is bigger than Toronto. I love Toronto. Toronto is a great city, a world-class city. But you know what? There are other places across this province that are going to be affected by this budget, and will be affected by all kinds of other bills that this government puts through. This government has an opposition to travelling government bills on committee to other communities in the province like no other government I’ve ever seen before. When the New Democrats were in power, when David Peterson was in power and when Mike Harris was in power, we used to travel our bills—government bills—across the province in order to be able to hear what the public had to say so that it wasn’t just the view of one group of people in one region of the province. It was travelled to various parts of the province for a reason.", "That’s the other thing that the government should be doing: allowing bills such as this sufficient time to be able to travel. It doesn’t mean to say that it’s a tactic to slow the bill down; it’s a tactic to give the bill greater hearing so that the government can hear what the public has to say and make any amendments necessary. For example, the government says that they don’t think they got the threshold right when it comes to the seniors’ drug program. You’d probably learn more listening to people around this province about what the threshold should be if you did travel this bill.", "In the little bit of time that I have left, I just have to say that the government should (a) allow more time for people to be able to apply to be on committee, to depute; and (b) allow enough time in committee, more days, so that the public has its say and has the ability to travel to those committees.", "The other thing that really needs to be addressed as well is the issue of how we get selected to be on committee. The government says, by way of all their time allocation motions now, first come, first served. You know what? On the surface, that sounds like a great idea. But what happens if the government has already got a list of people who they want to apply? They say we’ve got three days of hearings that equals so many spots. Theoretically, the government, or an opposition party, could flood the submissions to the Clerk’s office so that it’s a bit of a skewed presentation from the public. What we used to do, even under time allocation with other parties, is say that everybody who wants to apply applies and gets on the list. They have until a certain date and then the list is closed.", "Then what happens, if there are more people who apply than there are spots in the committee to appear, is that each of the parties gets an equal number of people they get to pick. That allows for a good cross-section of people who apply to be before the committee, because the government may know that a particular witness is hostile to a particular initiative in the bill and they don’t want that person to go in, and that’s why they flood the application process; it’s something that they can do. At the very least, what we should be able to do is have a system where you apply, and if we don’t fill all the spots then everybody, from each of the caucuses, gets to pick an equal number of people. That way, we at least make who is presenting at the committee a little bit fairer.", "Those are my comments. I know our other member from your House team wants to speak, so I’ll let them do so. But Mr. Speaker, we will vote against this time allocation motion. It’s a bad idea just generally, but if you read this time allocation motion, it is really about selling the public short on their ability to have their say." ],

We’ve had 13 years of reckless spending. The government is spending about $1 billion every month just on paying off the debt, a debt which has doubled since the Liberal government was first elected in 2003. In fact, the Premier, Kathleen Wynne, has the worst fiscal record of any sitting Premier. What does that debt mean? It’s $22,000 in debt for every person in Ontario. Even the House leader’s new baby girl, that we’re all congratulating him on, was just born into the world with a $22,000 debt already.", "This is the third-largest budget item. It’s $11 billion a year just to pay the interest on that debt. That could have been money that was spent to support our health care system, our aging population; money that could be going to long-term care, hospice and palliative care. You know what? Our seniors—which is a growing number, and the Liberal government has seen that demographic coming: the number of seniors that are in the province of Ontario—are very vulnerable. They need a hand up, but they’re being left behind by this government.", "We believed that this budget might be a chance for the government to show the people of Ontario that they were listening, but they didn’t listen to any of the consultations that went on. In fact, they had this written before they even had consultations. Just the sale of the LCBO stores that was uncovered yesterday by our critic for finance, the member from Nipissing—who has done an excellent job—brought that out." ],

It’s $1 billion a month. Ontario has the highest debt in Canada.", "When the government always talks about its plans for infrastructure investments, having such a deficit and ballooning debt takes money away from what we actually need. We need to foster the right conditions in this province for our economy to succeed, but we are hampered by financial incompetence and mismanagement by this Liberal government. Our essential services are being stretched thin. Whenever I highlight the underfunded areas for our probation officers and parole officers, especially in light of what happened in Renfrew county and the triple homicides, or the fact that the budget contains no new funding to effectively combat human trafficking, no credible plan to manage the rising energy costs, or more funding to build long-term-care beds—how can we support such a budget? Where is the money for those things that we so desperately need? It’s a blatant lack of compassion, and they’re not looking out for the best interests of Ontarians.", "There are so many topics and so little time, Mr. Speaker.

I’ll try and get to some of what I’ve definitely heard in the riding of Haliburton–Kawartha Lakes–Brock.", "The government has no credible plan to address Ontario’s unaffordable hydro rates and energy prices, which continue to rise and will hurt ratepayers right across the province. It continues to be the number one issue that my constituency office deals with.", "The big picture is that Ontario has the highest energy rates in North America. Hydro rates have increased by more than $1,000 a year for the average family since 2003, and it’s only going to continue to rise.", "Every time this Liberal government makes a decision for political reasons, Ontario families pay. What’s worse is that this government seems to be perfectly happy to continue with the sale of Hydro One, without any assurances that the sale will not result in even more hydro increases.", "What were the polls? Over 80% of the people didn’t want Hydro One to be sold. Did the government listen? No. It’s a one-time sale, to try to balance their books. It’s a desperate move by the Liberal government. The people of Ontario were opposed to it. Municipal councils—all my municipal councils—were against the sale and wrote to the government on that, but they didn’t listen.", "Hydro One is the tipping point for people who are on fixed income or in marginal categories in my riding. They have put them into poverty. I have said time and time again in this Legislature that I have more people in poverty than I did 13 years ago, when this government took power. It’s real. They tell me these stories. They’re being pushed out of their homes, if they had homes to stay in. They are trying to pay their hydro. But the cycle goes that you get them on a payment plan, but in reality, it’s so large that they eventually can’t make the payment plan. They don’t pay the property taxes. They go to the food banks.", "In Haliburton county, at the chamber of commerce, there were three awards won by Fuel for Warmth, which is a fuel bank. That’s how desperate people are. There are actually fuel banks, because they can’t afford to heat their homes and feed themselves. That is a sign of the times.", "I see more people hitchhiking on the side of the roads in my area, because they can’t afford the cars, the insurance, the hydro bills. The cost of everything is going up, and they can’t afford it. It is tragic to see.", "We asked the government to bring forward a plan that’s affordable. Even if they just stopped signing those unaffordable, intrusive and, in my case, subsidized industrial wind turbines that are going up and being forced down the throats of all of us in rural Ontario—and the people and the councils that have fought against this government, to stop industrial wind turbines, are appealing. They’re raising money to appeal this ridiculous plan.", "The industrial wind turbines in my area are predominantly in the Oak Ridges moraine, a supposedly protected environmental jewel in the province of Ontario. There is no reason that industrial wind turbines should be erected there. It’s a failed government policy. They overrode the municipal councils. They overrode the communities—bullying at its finest, actually. It’s just unacceptable.", "I commend them for fighting these industrial wind turbines. For years, this fight has gone on.

This time allocation doesn’t allow for us to express this in a wholesome way.", "When we’re elected as members, we have a duty to speak to each of our constituents and to bring their voices to this Legislature, so that legislation can actually respond to their needs, so that we can let this government know what amendments are required.", "I’ll give you an example, Speaker. Here’s another miscommunication, I think, in a lot of ways, when it came to legislation.", "When I first got elected—it was a minority government—there was the home renovation tax credit for seniors who wanted to remain in their homes. If you had a renovation, like in a bathroom which was going to be accessible—ramps, all kinds of accessible devices that you might need, or construction you might need to do in your home—they were going to give you a tax credit. If you spent roughly $10,000, you’d get a $1,400 tax credit. We sat in this House and we explained that this legislation, though it had a purpose, was not going to be effective and actually reach the market that this government was trying to capture, which would be a tax credit for seniors, to remain in their home. What has happened because of that legislation? That has been repealed. In the government’s own words, “There wasn’t enough uptake.”", "Now we’re talking about seniors and a drug prescription costs increase. We’re letting you know this is the wrong decision. Seniors will not be filling their prescriptions. Seniors take an average of about eight medications a year. If you’re a senior who makes $19,500, and you’ve got to pay an extra $70, and an extra co-payment fee, are you going to put that $70 out? Can you afford to put that $70 out?", "Speaker, seniors are going to go without medication. Their health is going to deteriorate. Their health is deteriorating under the fact that this government is increasing the cost of the prescription drugs deductible by $70.", "This is a reality, Speaker. In the last election, in 2014, when I was knocking on doors, I had a home care worker tell me that when she goes out to see her clients in their homes—seniors specifically—do you know what their diet consisted of? She was very worried. Their diet consisted of tea with toast and marmalade. That’s what they had for dinner.", "This is a reality that seniors are facing. They are struggling financially. They can’t afford this government’s $70 increase on prescription drugs. They can’t afford higher hydro rates.", "The other part of that is, when they’re looking to downsize from their home, if they have to for financial reasons or perhaps health reasons—they can’t maintain the outside of their home—there is no affordable housing. There are not a lot of affordable apartments for seniors. I hear that a lot.", "The other part of this budget consultation that happened—yes, they travelled the budget, Speaker, but this budget was written before we had an opportunity to actually consult with constituents and the committee. Our finance critic said that, and I believe her. I believe there is that speculation that this budget was written before consultations started. That’s a sad message that follows this government, that decisions are already made before consultation is put out there.", "The Robarts school and the Amethyst Demonstration School, in my riding: The government is doing consultations.

It is interesting that there have only been three other Pickering mayors, and we are glad, as I mentioned, to have Mayor Ryan join us today.", "George served as mayor until he was elected to this Legislature for the riding of Durham West in 1977.

He later served as Minister of Government Services. He served as Minister of Energy and Chair of the Management Board in Frank Miller’s cabinet.", "George Ashe was not a politician who sought the limelight. He was hard-working and was a quiet type of guy. He didn’t hold the flashy cabinet portfolios, but he committed himself to them, recognizing how important they were to the efficient running of government.", "George served as a member of a minority, then majority government and also as an opposition member. I understand that he preferred being on the government benches. George served the people of Durham West here in this Legislature until 1987, but his public service didn’t stop there. George served as a Catholic school trustee in Clarington and did that for a term.", "George was a resident of Durham for almost 50 years and must have seen so much change, grow and develop in that time. He clearly also saw opportunities to be a part of that development through the various avenues of service he pursued.", "Later in George’s life, he battled Parkinson’s disease, but even in that lengthy struggle he continued to contribute to the broader community. He and his wife, Margo, and daughter, Cheryl, became significant fundraisers for Parkinson research and participated annually in the Parkinson SuperWalk.", "George Ashe didn’t only leave behind a lifetime of service and commitment; he evidently has left a clear legacy of work ethic and service. As many in public service know, it can be a tremendous sacrifice being away from home and family life. George’s commitment to his community was something that his children grew up with. He was always involved, and whether he meant to or not, he led by example. We all learn from our parents. Sometimes we learn what to do and sometimes we learn what not to do. But it is a testament to George’s commitment and convictions that he was not only a model for others to follow, he was a model that others have followed.", "I was pleased to welcome George’s family earlier, but I would like to specifically point out that George’s son Steven is here, and we appreciate his service and involvement at the Ontario Regiment in Oshawa. Steve is a retired corporal with the Ontario Regiment reserves. Also, George’s son Kevin Ashe has chosen to serve and is a Pickering city and regional councillor, and was a trustee before that. I will say that perhaps the apples didn’t fall far from the tree.", "Something pretty interesting, actually, is that back in 1974, George was the very first chairman of the finance committee at the new region, and Kevin serves on that same committee at the region now.", "George Ashe was a proud Conservative, an avid Blue Jays fan and a remarkable husband, brother, father, grandfather and great-grandfather, or “Grumpy.” He leaves a lifetime and a legacy of public and community service. Durham region is a dynamic and wonderful region, and as it grows and strengthens, it does so on a community framework and foundation made stronger by George Ashe and his lifelong dedication to public service." ],

This happens with all of us who are elected at the same time: It’s the class of that particular year, and so you have special memories of those people who joined the Legislature on the same date that you did.", "George also recognized something very important. Although it’s not a necessity, there’s a great advantage to having served in municipal government before advanceing—if you can say “advancing,” because some people say municipal government is more important—before changing and coming to the provincial level of government. George recognized that. You can tell by his early days in politics, his service to his community and the separate school board and as a municipal councillor. He always had the community at heart. That’s exceedingly important.", "I’m going to quote, in a couple of minutes, some of George’s own words, because they’re rather revealing. There was a great interview that took place with George where, in his words, he talks about his time in the Legislature. Things keep coming through my mind. He was not a person who suffered fools easily, and I remember—I’m not saying the person is a fool; please don’t get me wrong—that one of his own members one day mentioned something about the nuclear industry, which of course is very important to George’s part of the province, and I could hear him addressing the person at that particular time. I was glad Hansard didn’t pick it up; it would have been unparliamentary language. But he did make certain reference to another member of his own party who had said something that didn’t fit with his constituency. It goes back to the theme that his constituency was most important to him. He, of course, had a private sector career in the insurance industry, so he met a lot of people through that and was involved in community organizations.", "The portfolios he served in have been mentioned. They’re significant portfolios. It’s quite right to say that they’re not the glamorous or high-profile portfolios, but it’s exceedingly important in government to have those portfolios and to have a competent person there. You can say that George always knew where the bottom line was, and he was very careful about that, both at the municipal level and at the provincial level of government.", "They asked him, “Politicians: Why do they do it?” An interesting answer: “One has to be a bit of a masochist.", "“Of course, there’s that initial appeal of wanting to do something either because you feel you have something to contribute or you’re not happy with the way someone else is doing it. You know, it’s easy to be critical. But it’s quite another thing to say I can do better and actually do something about it.", "“The masochism, though, I think that comes into it because so often you’re in a ‘no-win’ situation. If you do a good job there’s often not much in the way of gratitude or thank-yous. But if you’re perceived to have done wrong, you take a lot of flak for it. You become a problem solver for your constituents but you weigh all these things and they’re simply offset by the love of the job, the sense of involvement and the challenge of being here.”", "I thought he really captured why he came to the Legislature.", "He talked about majority government. Remember, there had been a minority government from 1977 to 1981, and they said, “Okay, we’re now coming into majority government.” “Certainly, too, I think we all have to avoid the impression that we’re the big ‘fat cat,’ unconcerned majority and that we’re not going to listen to anyone. We’re going to have to bend over backwards to make sure that impression’s not there.” So he recognized in the transition how important it was to be able to respond to the Legislature as a whole.", "When he talks about constituency versus ministry—and this is exceedingly important, because it’s a difficult decision when you have a ministry. “My constituency work comes first, it’s as simple as that. I’ve conveyed this philosophy to my staff both here and in my riding and they know how strongly I feel about this. Obviously, if I don’t satisfy to some appreciable degree, the needs, expectations and desires of electorate of Durham West, I won’t be here later on.... That’s a reality no politician should ever forget.”", "George never did forget that. He was an excellent constituency person—a person I grew to find very interesting and a likable person to deal with. He was a solid Conservative, I assure you of that, a solid Progressive Conservative, a partisan, as all of us are in the House, but he was more interested in getting things done and being practical.", "The last thing I want to say to Kevin and the audience is that there was one headline that says—I’ve got to read this to you: “Liberals Fire Minister’s Son as Chauffeur.” Now, that wasn’t really the case, of course, and Kevin took it, as he always does, with the greatest of laughter and a good sense of humour. But when there’s a transition of government, he recognized—and he had been an excellent person travelling with ministers he had served with. You know that those people tend to be rather close. They hear the conversations going on. By the way, there were no telephones in the car in the early days, so there was not those kinds of conversations, but you certainly had an insight. I think Kevin recognized that when the government changed hands, they would probably be looking for somebody else, but that didn’t keep him down. It’s in the tradition. The family has followed the tradition of George Ashe. Kevin, who I know very well out of the members of the family, knew that and has remained, in fact, a friend of all of ours.", "There’s a certain print of Queen’s Park that was in George’s office.

I’m pleased to recognize many members of George’s family and some friends who have joined us in the gallery: Steven, his son; Cheryl Hinzel and Erwin Hinzel; my good friend Kevin Ashe, with whom I served on regional council, and his partner, Karen O’Brien; Andrea Arkell and Kevin Arkell; Anika Arkell; Eric Hinzel and Matt Hinzel; Krista Barnsley; His Worship Mayor Dave Ryan from the city of Pickering; my colleague from regional council David Pickles; and George’s son Brian is watching from his home in North Carolina. I’d also be remiss if I didn’t acknowledge Doug Moffatt, who was a former member of Parliament here as well.", "As Kevin has told me, his father was not an ostentatious man. He was very conservative in nature, a man of dedication and purpose, an extremely hard worker, as my colleague indicated earlier in her comments, whose roles in the Legislature reflected the character of the man. George was always very comfortable as he participated in the business of the Legislature, but he never felt it necessary to seek the limelight.", "I read an interview George gave in 1981 after his appointment as the Minister of Revenue. He was so proud of that appointment because he had served as a parliamentary assistant for three previous ministers. It really paralleled what Kevin had told me about his dad. George said that an effective politician “is a good listener, an excellent listener, that’s the main thing.” Isn’t that true? “And then of prime importance too, the best politicians must never be afraid to admit they don’t know everything. They must tell the person this and get out there and find the right answers.”", "George Ashe was a very decent man and never tried to be something that he wasn’t. He played to his strengths. He said, “I’ve always been known as a hard worker. I put in a lot of time and effort and I think this has been well recognized.” And it was, in his riding and other parts of Durham region. “As well, I’ve always tried to be available and to assist my associates wherever and whenever possible....”", "Predeceased by his wife, Margo, who was a key partner in what George accomplished, George passed away peacefully at the Village of Taunton Mills in Whitby on August 3, 2014.", "Mr. Speaker, many of us here could learn a great deal from the character of George Ashe. He believed in helping people who could not help themselves or who have suffered misfortune. He especially believed in a hand up for those who need it but only lacked an opportunity, all part of his deep humanity and decency. He gave his all to serve his riding and the province that he loved." ],

Walking Together lays out how Ontario and indigenous communities are coming together to end the cycle of violence and ensure future generations of indigenous women can live the way they deserve, with safety and respect.", "We are also increasing empowerment through our Leading Women/Leading Girls Building Communities Recognition Program. This program encourages MPPs to recognize outstanding females who have made a positive difference in their communities. I want to say thank you to all the MPPs who participated in this program, and I hope you have a great local event celebrating your leading women and leading girls.", "I also want to mention I’m proud that this province has taken action to increase the number of women in high-ranking leadership positions, including on corporate boards of directors. Ontario was the first jurisdiction in Canada to develop the comply-or-explain regulation. Since the introduction of regulations in December 2014, several other provinces have followed our lead.", "Speaker, this province has other supports and programs to empower women—too many to list here in my allotted time today. Although Ontario has accomplished a lot more for women than a number of other jurisdictions, I know that we still have a long way to go before we reach our goal of full gender equality.", "That is why we must continue to work together to reduce poverty among women, close the gender wage gap, broaden gender diversity in positions of leadership, and make sure that no woman or girl is in fear or experiences violence.", "I encourage everyone in Ontario to support equality for women and the empowerment of women on this International Women’s Day and every day." ],

  "text" : [ "Today, I am pleased to speak on behalf of our leader, Patrick Brown, and our entire PC caucus in recognizing International Women’s Day. It is the 108th anniversary, and in particular, the United Nations theme for 2016 is “Planet 50-50 by 2030: Step It Up for Gender Equality.” The UN’s Step It Up initiative is a commitment to gender equality and that governments across the globe will address the challenges that are holding women and girls back from reaching their full potential.", "Although we have made great strides, further progress is needed. The World Economic Forum produced a report saying that it would take until 2133 to achieve global gender parity—far too long, Mr. Speaker. There are steps that we can take now to help women and girls achieve their ambitions, to respect and value differences, and to develop more inclusive cultures.", "The first International Women’s Day was observed in March 1911. At that time, the right to vote, marital or property rights, and even the basic dignity to be recognized as a person were not afforded to women. Even now, in 2016, the struggle for equality is still a distant dream for many parts of the world.", "Equality is about making sure that women, just as much as men, are afforded the same respect and opportunities. My female colleagues here in the Legislature, on all sides, serve as great examples of the strides our society has made on all the possibilities that women can make. Women have real choices and real opportunities.", "In Canada and in this province, the progress of women in education, business, sports, government and the arts has shaped so much of who we are. Having the choice to pursue an education is so powerful, as it paves the way to a brighter and better tomorrow. Girls are more likely to earn their high school diplomas on time and are less likely to drop out.", "A year ago, I said that I was optimistic and hopeful that we would see significant progress on a number of fronts on gender equality. Unfortunately, there is still a pervasive culture that is deeply rooted in misogyny and, quite simply, a lack of respect for women.", "But I do want to recognize the progress we have made in the Legislature when it comes to dealing with sexual violence and harassment. Today we unanimously passed Bill 132, the Sexual Violence and Harassment Action Plan Act. It will receive royal assent this afternoon. Along with the #ItsNeverOkay campaign and #WhoWillYouHelp, these are positive steps forward, and I’m glad that we are dealing with this issue, because for far too long the stigma has made victims and survivors feel embarrassed, ashamed or, worse, guilty.", "Since last year, the Select Committee on Sexual Violence and Harassment, which I was honoured to co-chair, produced a report that had input from survivors, family members, advocates and workers in health care, justice and social support.", "As we commemorate International Women’s Day, it is also important to bring human trafficking out of the dark. It is an underground and fast-growing crime that disproportionately targets girls averaging the age of 14. It is time to say that enough is enough; our girls are not for sale.", "While I am disappointed that budget 2016 did not provide specific funding to tackle human trafficking right across this province, I call on the government to do what is right and act now to create a multi-jurisdictional task force of law enforcement agencies, crown prosecutors, judges, victims’ services and front-line agencies to coordinate and help these survivors.", "We must also pass Bill 158, the Saving the Girl Next Door Act, and say confidently that human trafficking will not be tolerated in this province. We all acknowledge that the crime is a crisis, not only in our province but in our communities and our neighbourhoods, and that combatting it is a priority. So while we wait for the government’s strategy on human trafficking, these are steps that could be taken right now.", "I want to conclude by congratulating all the female trailblazers for their dedication and commitment to advancing women’s rights and equality. While we commemorate these efforts today and celebrate the progress we have made, International Women’s Day is also a call for a commitment to see a better tomorrow." ],

My colleagues actually have talked about some of those initiatives. But it’s also an important time and an important opportunity to recognize how much more there is to be done towards building a province where everyone can truly share in the opportunities that we create.", "As women, we need to stand in solidarity and recommit to achieving positive social change: change so that women are no longer blamed for the gender-based violence perpetrated against them; change so that women are no longer shamed and doubted when they come forward against their abusers; change so that the legal system actually protects women and doesn’t revictimize them.", "In Ontario in 2016, women still earn 71% of what men earn, and women are more likely to be precariously employed in this province. This inequity is disproportionately borne by racialized, indigenous and immigrant women—in 2016, Speaker.", "We should never accept that any woman in Ontario has to lead her life in fear or accept fewer opportunities because of her gender. We should never accept that any woman in Ontario has to work three jobs for wages that still leave her family struggling to make ends meet. We should never accept that real action to improve the lives of women can be delayed any longer, put off for another day, another decade, another generation.", "When Ontario’s women succeed, we all succeed. When women and girls flourish, so do our communities. Together, we can build a province that improves the lives of women.", "But the Liberal government must stop the cuts to programs like the Partner Assault Response program. They must stop ignoring the crisis of accessibility in child care, which keeps women at home and out of the workplace. They must invest in affordable, licensed child care for Ontario families. This would help women enormously, Speaker.", "We can take real action on pay and employment equity if the Liberal government is willing to make it a priority. We can take real action to end precarious work. We can invest in shelters, affordable housing, transitional housing and supports for women fleeing violence. But it takes a government that’s committed and willing to take real action.", "We can recommit ourselves—women and men—to speak up and act to end violence against all women: straight, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, queer or two-spirited.", "By going beyond an inquiry, we can tackle the root causes of Canada’s national crisis of murdered and missing indigenous women. We know what’s happening with indigenous peoples in our country and in our province. We know how many communities are on boil-water alerts; we know the lack of health care that occurs on reserves; we know the lack of quality housing that exists on reserves; we know the inability of people to provide the level of education that other children receive in this province on the reserve; and we know the challenges facing urban indigenous peoples as well. First Nations, Métis and Inuit people have not been treated well in Canada or in Ontario. Speaker, we can only change the outcomes if we change the root causes of those outcomes.", "I believe that’s how best to celebrate International Women’s Day. We celebrate our victories and we celebrate the women upon whose shoulders we stand, while we strengthen our resolve to continue their work and achieve the dignity, safety and equality of all women.", "On behalf of Ontario’s New Democratic caucus, all the very best for an inspiring International Women’s Day." ],

I can assure you, Speaker, that on the budget motion—on the budget bill; I’ve only been here four years, and sometimes I get motions and bills confused. But I can assure you that on the budget, every one of my caucus colleagues, including the member from Nickel Belt, wanted the chance to have a full discussion—and not for their own purposes. Each one of us in my caucus—and, I’m assuming, the other caucuses as well—the caucus members go back to our ridings and we talk to people. We listen to their issues.

The way it’s supposed to work is that you identify where you can agree, you identify where you disagree, and, hopefully, you can make things work a bit better. But if you refuse to listen to the people of the province by saying, “The members can only speak for X amount of hours,” you are—again the guillotine. You’re saying, “That’s it.”", "Again, we mention the way that the motion is structured. The PC amendment is structured a bit differently. But the way the government’s motion is structured, it allows very little time for members of the public to make any comment in the committee process. The committee process is actually a very important process, if it’s used correctly, because it gives the members of the public a chance, after they have had a chance to look at the bill, to make some informed comments. Hopefully, some of those informed comments could be put forward as amendments and the bill could be improved.", "But what this government has chosen to do with the last few time allocation motions, and particularly the last one previous to this with the PTSD bill—I forget what number it was, but a very, very important bill for those first responders and others who could be impacted by PTSD. The bill was structured so that the time when the motion was put forward to the time that you had to get on the list to be a deputant was so short that it was impossible for an Ontarian who isn’t connected to a paid lobby group or deeply connected to the government to actually get on the list. That is not democracy, when there is so little time.", "The way it should work, particularly on something like the PTSD bill, is that you want people in the public to be able to come forward and make a deputation. Even in this House sometimes you’ll hear—obviously, you can see I’m not using speaking notes today, but a lot of people here read from speaking notes, and sometimes people will relate a life experience that they themselves have experienced. Those are actually the best ways to move policy. That’s what committee hearings are for: to bring forward people who actually have had a life experience in something that is included in the bill and you think, “Wow. We never thought of that.” There’s no crime in not thinking of something. That’s why the committee process was created. It has taken a lot of years to create our system, but that’s why it was created.", "It’s the same with this budget process. Now that we’ve seen the budget, the way it should work is that there should be a fulsome debate in this House. There has always been time allocation since I’ve been here. I haven’t been here very long, but I have been told that this House used to work without time allocation and actually the parties worked together. Sure, it was partisan, but the parties worked together. And you know what? Laws got passed, because this is a pretty great province. But no; the way it works now is that the government gets sick of constructive criticism so they just shut it off." ],

But if we hadn’t had, by the luck of the draw—and that’s all it was, the luck of the draw—a constituency week in between, it would have been the same MO: time allocation; mere hours to get on the deputant list; first-come, first-served.", "The idea of first-come, first-served is also a big problem. To the people on the outside, you think, “First-come, first-served: That’s the best way to do it.” No. And why specifically with time allocation? Who here knows when a time allocation is coming? The government. When the government is the only one who really knows when the time allocation is coming and they put such a short window on when you can apply to be a deputant, then first-come, first-served means that, conceivably, the government can have the list packed of all the people who are in favour of whatever they are proposing." ],

Really.", "With the gas company, they’ll get a little flyer with their bill: “Here’s the program.” Enbridge doesn’t have the oil customers in their database.

The first announcement of this program is, I believe, 4.3 cents on gas, 4.7 cents on diesel, some on natural and, I’m sure, on propane. Okay. That builds up a fund. But it’s also a deterrent to use gas. That’s part of the program." ],

Again, we weren’t talking about carbon four years ago, about that debate, but this government should have been thinking about it because they passed the first one eight years ago, I believe—the first cap-and-trade initiative. As bus routes are cancelled, you’re giving people in rural Ontario, and specifically in the riding of the member from Timmins–James Bay, my riding and other areas, less options. You’re talking about reducing carbon, but you’re cancelling transit in parts of the province. That just doesn’t make sense.

It has been recognized for years at the international level that deep cuts in global emissions are required to prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. The environmental impact of our economic actions needs to be properly accounted for and reflected in the production process.", "I am proud of Ontario’s leadership in the fight against climate change and the move toward a low-carbon economy. Electricity and heat generation, or stationary energy, as it’s known, is the largest source of Canada’s greenhouse gas emissions, making up nearly half at 46%. Recognizing this, Ontario took a bold step to completely eliminate smog-producing coal as an energy source. This has been the single largest climate action change in North America, and it has resulted in cleaner air for Ontarians and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions to historically low levels. This action is the equivalent of taking the emissions of approximately seven million cars off our roads and saving $4 billion in annual health care and environmental costs, preventing 668 premature deaths per year.", "The recent landmark Paris agreement means that economies everywhere are now scrambling to catch up with us. As other jurisdictions work to eliminate their coal dependence and look at the renewable technologies Ontario businesses are pioneering, we are taking the next steps by introducing a cap-and-trade program that will reduce greenhouse gas pollution and foster a more innovative and dynamic economy. Simply put, a green, low-carbon economy is the future, and we need to act to take strategic and innovative actions and continue to lead the process.", "In the past few years, there has been a significant adoption of carbon pricing in other jurisdictions. According to the World Bank’s 2015 State and Trends of Carbon Pricing report, approximately 40 nations and 23 other jurisdictions have now implemented or have scheduled prices on carbon. These systems cover 12% of annual greenhouse gas emissions, a threefold increase over the past decade, and have a value of just under US$50 billion in 2015, $34 billion of which is from emissions trading systems.

If we want the next generation to inherit a safe and healthy Ontario, then we have to act now.", "Let’s talk a little bit about the effects of climate change. The effects of climate change are far-reaching. It affects our personal health. It affects our water resources, our wildlife and ecosystems. It affects our life, the lives of our friends and neighbours, and the lives of our children.", "In my riding of Halton, I’m proud to say that we have many businesses and community leaders who understand the importance of tackling climate change. Halton is agriculturally diverse, and we must take the necessary steps to protect and maintain it. For example, the Halton Environmental Network highlights green businesses and organizations in and around my riding, and makes sensible decisions and encourages those decisions with our planet’s future in mind. Organizations such as MiltonGreen focus their time on encouraging companies and individuals to think of the environment first. In fact, both groups have spoken to me about climate change.", "While groups such as these are already doing important work, it is crucial that we do our part. The world’s leading scientists are urging governments to act quickly to limit global warming, and our government is listening. In fact, our position has always been clear. There has been no flip-flopping on this side of the House.", "Bill 172 sets a long-term framework for climate action. It helps fight against climate change by giving polluters an important incentive to cut greenhouse gas emissions. This bill would implement a cap-and-trade system then reinvest the proceeds into green projects and initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas pollution. In this new carbon market, companies would have real incentive to reduce harmful emissions and invest in cleaner technologies. By capping the amount of allowable emissions, companies would either have to lower their output or buy carbon credits from someone who did. As more and more businesses move toward cleaner production, the cap on emissions would be reduced each year; just think about that.", "Why are we doing this? Because everyone wins. The result would be a cleaner environment and increased investment in clean technology, innovation and jobs, and a stronger future for our children. This bill takes an approach to tackling climate change that has been proven in both California and Quebec. The approach is one that we know is winning there. The province is working closely with these jurisdictions to link our carbon market with theirs. By doing so, Ontario will gain access to the largest carbon market in North America; there is no doubt in my mind that this will be an asset to our province.", "In addition to implementing the cap-and-trade program, this bill reinforces the government’s existing climate change action plan.", "Bill 172 will reaffirm emission reduction targets and provide accountability by publishing action plans and progress reports. This bill ensures that our government has a well-thought-out plan.", "Mr. Speaker, good climate policy is good economic policy and good people policy. The time to act is now. The future of our children depends on it." ],

This is not something we can put off for another year or another 10 years. The time is now to take some pretty drastic and some pretty important steps to begin to address the major concerns.

I believe it was in Vancouver, actually. The first half of his discussion is the usual introduction to greenhouse gas issues and carbon issues and the dire consequences if we don’t act, but what’s interesting is the second half of his documentary. It’s very positive. Al Gore now believes we can beat this. We have to work at it, and there will be some major issues that we deal with, but we can now beat this. He looks, for example, at the implementation of modern technology like the uptake of LED lighting and the number of coal-fired plants around the world that are being cancelled—new ones being cancelled; old ones being shuttered.", "It’s a very optimistic, or far more optimistic, view about the world than he had 10 years ago. I would commend anyone who is feeling a bit burned out and overwhelmed to see what Al Gore has to say, and they’ll feel a lot more positive.", "When it comes to our piece of legislation, I’m hearing wonderful agreement about the need to deal with carbon and greenhouse gas emissions, and that’s absolutely wonderful. It’s wonderful to hear about the conversion on the road to Damascus from a few members opposite, that they’re now on board and agreeing that it is a problem.", "We have to talk about solutions. When I first looked at possible solutions, I heard what our minister had to say, I heard what others had to say and, frankly, I did a lot of my own research and my own reading, and talked to a lot of the experts I know who live in my riding. I agree with our government’s position that cap-and-trade really offers a very exciting opportunity for business and for individuals. This is an opportunity like we haven’t seen before to not only do the right thing but to build a green economy.", "I know there are concerns, and I was glad to see in legislation that all of those funds collected must be spent on projects that reduce our carbon footprint. I was very happy to see that. But what happened when we started talking about cap-and-trade in my riding was the number of companies that came to see me. Some of them are start-ups; some of them are multi-billion-dollar institutions right now. All of them are working on solutions that would really benefit from cap-and-trade. Not only are they doing the right thing for the right reasons; they’re also doing things that create jobs and create investments in my riding and in Ontario. I think they are the embodiment of some of the positive things that will happen as we move into cap-and-trade and use that system to stimulate a green economy and to make sure that not only do we fix the problem, but, at the end of the day, that Ontario’s economy is much stronger.", "I know there are a lot of things that the province will be doing. My time has pretty much run out. I just wanted to leave us on a more optimistic perspective in terms of good things that are being done, and there are more things coming.", "I will turn the floor over to the member from Glengarry–Prescott–Russell to finish up on our side." ],

At that time, during my 12-minute presentation, I had a quote from David Suzuki from his website. He stated, “The debate is over about whether or not climate change is real.” That proved to be the case, as the entire House here actually supported the motion that I put forward. I had the privilege of having a press conference with the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change that morning, which went very well.", "I wanted to bring up some comments, perhaps, that the critic of the environment portfolio from the opposition had stated in her response. She said, “I have to be clear in stating that implementing a carbon tax does not achieve” the goals related to carbon reduction. All of a sudden, we hear that the Leader of the Opposition now is saying, “We have to do something about it, and that something includes putting a price on carbon.” So there has been a change of heart on the other side. That’s why I put forward the motion, to begin talking about this important issue, and it’s good to see that all members of the House specifically speak in favour of what we’re attempting to do.", "I can understand the concerns that the member from Timiskaming–Cochrane mentioned in his address. He’s concerned about transparency. I think we’ve pretty well made it clear; the Minister of the Environment will speak on this some more, I’m sure. It’s right in our budget, on page 27, what we’re going to be doing and what the impacts are going to be. We’re saying that there is going to be an impact on the cost of gas across the province of about 4.3 cents per litre. We know that there’s going to be an impact on natural gas of about $5 per household. It’s right there. That’s transparent.", "We’ve also committed to reinvesting some of the funds that we’re going to receive into my favourite, the $100-million retrofit program for homeowners. We’ll be able to take advantage of a program that they’ve been asking for for years, that I could have benefited from, that people I know could have benefited from over the years had our government of the day taken this initiative.", "I’m very proud that our government and our minister have taken leadership on this particular file. It’s not easy, Speaker. Nobody wants to pay more for gas. Nobody wants to pay more for natural gas. That’s just normal. But it’s great to see there is a consensus here that we have to do something, that the people of Ontario respect the fact that we’re all going to have to contribute in doing our part and showing that leadership in reducing the impacts of climate change that I know are going to impact rural Ontario, our agricultural community and our business community to an extent that we don’t really comprehend at this particular point.", "I want to thank you for the privilege of speaking today." ],

I’ve been around here long enough, Speaker, to realize that the first budget that this government—under a different leader, but this government—came out with, they were going to collect a health tax and they were going to put it all into health care. But where did it go? The first thing we heard, it was grants given to infrastructure. When they were questioned about, “Well, how do you put a health tax into building infrastructure?”, they were very clear about it: “Of course, clean water is important for good health, so that money is going to health care.”", "This is the type of thing that I think we, on this side of the House, worry about: $1.9 billion a year that they’re going to put in the kitty. They’re going to, as we just heard from the member opposite, put some of that into trying to reduce carbon. The rest of it is going into the slush fund that they’re going to spend on whatever they see fit, and I think that’s wrong.", "Now, the other part about reducing the carbon footprint: I know the people in my riding now are not purchasing gas because they want to go places; they’re purchasing gas because they have to go places. Do you believe, Mr. Speaker, that they’re going to purchase less gas because they have to pay another 4.3 cents on that litre? No, they’re not going to purchase less gas. They’re going to purchase less of other things, things they can’t pay for anymore because of the high hydro rates and the extra money they have to pay on gas. None of that will help the carbon footprint that we have. That’s what I think is wrong with this bill." ],

We pay to have that cleaned and put into the water. But we think that we have a free ride when we put pollution in the form of carbon into the atmosphere, something that we all breathe. It’s about time, Mr. Speaker, and the time has arrived, that we understand that that form of pollution, carbon pollution, is one that we have to deal with, and deal with right now.", "But I just wanted to talk about the economy and cap-and-trade for a second. I had an interesting conversation with an economist from California who talked about the pace of growth of the California economy when their cap-and-trade was put in place, and it has exceeded the growth across the United States. It’s phenomenal, and it is directly tied to the beginnings of cap-and-trade. In fact, the number of jobs in California grew by 3.3% when the national average was only 2.5%.

This stealth camouflage of their true purpose with this environmental language—Speaker, I don’t buy it. It’s not a cap-and-trade; as I said at the beginning, it’s a cap-and-take—cap-and-take and very, very little. I’m sure in a year or two or three from now, we’ll be looking at the public accounts once again, and everybody will be aghast and astonished that all this money that was taken from people didn’t buy us one new bus, didn’t buy us one new LRT, didn’t do anything other than curry favour with some business partners and friends who can spend $5,000 or $6,000 to go to the Hyatt hotel and have dinner with the Minister of Energy and the Premier. That’s where we see the real actions of this government." ],

  "text" : [ "It’s also my pleasure to speak to this extremely important bill. New Democrats have been waiting for a cap-and-trade discussion, I would say, since I was elected. I had the pleasure to sit beside my colleague from Toronto–Danforth, who talks about green energy, I think, in his dreams. He loves this topic and certainly has been talking to our caucus about this for years and years. So am I happy that we finally have a serious, adult discussion about this bill? Absolutely. I’m really happy that I have a chance to put a few things on the record so that we get it right.", "Getting it right is quite simple. It means that we will reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It’s as simple as this. The entire exercise is focused on one thing: How do we reduce greenhouse gas emissions?", "One of the ways to do this is through the introduction of this bill, which will introduce a cap-and-trade system. A cap-and-trade system is already in use in other jurisdictions, and it is part of their efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In Ontario, our entire effort will be focused on that. It’s a little bit worrisome. That means that it’s even more important that we get it right.", "How will we know that we have gotten it right? We will know that we have gotten it right because we will be able to measure a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions. We will be able to have a fair, effective and transparent process to look at how much money is being collected, who do we collect this money from and where we are investing it. This is where the fair, the transparent and the effective all come into play.", "When we talk about effective, at the end of the day, we have seen other provinces. We don’t have to look very far. Let’s just look to Quebec right next to us and see how they did. Quebec introduced their own cap-and-trade, which is often mentioned by the Liberal government as an inspiration for what we’re doing now. But if you look at what really happened, in 2006, 10 years ago, the Quebec government went on with their action plan. They spent close to $1.6 billion to cut greenhouse gas emissions, and they had given themselves a target. Unfortunately, although the money was collected and the money was spent, they only reached 10% of the original goal that they had given themselves. They had given themselves a specific goal for transportation of merchandise. In that, they reached 8% of their goal. They had given themselves a specific goal for agriculture and food production, forestry, and municipalities, and in those, they reached 1% of the goal that they had given themselves.", "So it’s not because you gathered money from cap-and-trade and it’s not because you invest that money that you are necessarily effective. We will know we are effective when the greenhouse gas emissions go down. This exercise of collecting money from people who produce greenhouse gases and investing into projects that are supposed to reduce them—unless you actually are successful at the end, the entire exercise will be for nothing.", "I don’t want to miss the boat on this. This is too importance for us to miss the boat on this.", "L’Association québécoise de lutte contre la pollution atmosphérique, which is an organization that really looked at what Quebec had done, consider this a fiasco. Quebec failed. They did collect money, like we will, on natural gas, on gas at the pump; they did all of this. Did they invest in projects? Yes, they did. But what really happened was that the money was invested more for political gain than for the end goal. And the end goal, you have to remember, is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. So it has to be effective.", "It then has to be fair. I represent one of those big ridings in northeastern Ontario. I have no big municipalities in my riding. I have no mayors. I have no towns. I have none of this. I have 33 little communities, not one of them big enough to have a council. If you think about, “Oh, let’s switch to public transit,” who are we kidding? There is no public transit in most of the land mass of Nickel Belt. If you live close to the city of Sudbury, yes, some of them can connect to the city of Sudbury public transit. But everybody else—I live in Whitefish; there is no public transit in Whitefish. Beaver Lake, Lake Panache—you ask all the way around: It is just not an option. Will I be paying more for gas? Absolutely. Will I have the option to do something about it? No, Speaker. I’ll still have to come here to work, and everybody else who lives in my riding will still have to come to work. When I’m in Toronto, I always use public transit. I love it. It works well. Sometimes it’s a little bit busy and doesn’t always run as smoothly as I had planned, but it doesn’t matter; I use it. I have alternatives. When I’m back home, I do not.", "I do know that in northern Ontario, it is a lot colder. I go out of my House and there is four feet of snow. This is where we haven’t shovelled. Everywhere else, the snowbanks are 12 feet tall. I get down here, and if there’s four inches of snow, it’s because there used to be a snowbank there. It is a lot colder. What does that mean? That means that we need to heat our houses. That means that for people on low income, it will mean spending a larger proportion of those low incomes basically on paying for the cap-and-trade.", "Why didn’t this government do the same thing that BC has done, and that Alberta is about to do, and put in that a part of the money that is collected should be given back to the people in northern and rural communities, where they haven’t got a choice, and who are of low income? Why don’t we put aside a little bit of those revenues to make sure that people who don’t have a choice to take public transit, who live in northern Ontario, where we will spend more on heating because I have four feet of snow in my front yard and you guys have none—why don’t we take that into account? That would bring fairness into the equation.", "The last part is transparency. This is something that has to happen. My colleague from Essex quoted some of this. Basically, if you have no independent access to these funds, it doesn’t matter if you do the best job possible; there will be people who will doubt. If you don’t have the facts and figures in front of everybody so they can see where the money went, some people will doubt it.", "We cannot afford to fail on this program, Speaker. Too much is on the line. We have to be successful. We have to have a cap-and-trade system that will bring down the greenhouse gases. It has to succeed. In order for this to succeed, it has to be transparent. We have to see the money coming in, we have to see the money going out and we have to be able to measure that we actually decreased the amount of greenhouse gases.", "In other jurisdictions, and I will refer to Quebec again, Clean Energy Canada summarized their findings by saying that they question the transparency of the green fund expenditures, noting that this money often serves “highly political objectives.” I don’t want a report in Ontario that says the same thing. I want to prevent this. How do we prevent this? We use the officers of this Legislature to give us transparency into what happened." ],

What keeps me up at night is that we have 30 years, if you look at the work that came out of the IPCC last week that says we’re already at the guardrail: It’s not even 1.5 degrees really; we have less than one degree left. That’s no flexibility.", "If you look at the momentum of the carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere, we’re now dealing with impacts from before I was born. We have momentum for 50 or 60 years of impacts. Ontario in the south will already be four degrees warmer; in the north, in your communities, it’ll be eight degrees Celsius warmer. We’re not sure we can even survive that.", "I don’t think the enormity of this challenge has been fully internalized yet by this Legislature. But I want to thank you because I think you’re speaking to all of us in the terms of the reality and the soberness we need.", "Mr. Speaker, I want to deal with some of the issues—I’ve talked before about this—about why a cap-and-trade system and what our disagreement is with the opposition. A carbon-pricing system, as the Leader of the Opposition would suggest, that does not have a cap and does not have the market mechanisms—the member for Simcoe–Grey is here. The $160 a tonne is Mark Jaccard’s number. It was a study done from a policy journal that said that to get to 14% below 1990 levels, which is the federal target, that would be the price per tonne, and it would have to jump over a period of time by $10 a year.", "Our target in Ontario—we’re already at about 7%—is 37%. We chose a cap-and-trade system because we all need to understand the differences here. We’re debating two visions. The Tory vision and the Liberal vision are very different, and I think that probably the New Democratic vision and ours are much more aligned.", "A capped decline rate guarantees your reductions. We will, if we pass this bill, meet our 2020 targets, a 4.17% decline rate. We’re not relying on price. That’s why, at a market level in a bigger market with California and Quebec, which is the fifth-largest economy in the world, that large stable market and capped decline rate keep the price down, right? So the price at the pump will be much lower than if you had to do it with the BC model that some people talk about, a revenue-neutral tax. Our emissions have been going down in Ontario because we had another, what’s called, implicit fee, which was the coal plant closures. You can’t do them again. There aren’t any more coal plants to close. It’s now about cars and it’s now about houses because our industry is coming down.", "Why allowances? Why that kind of system? Well, if you work at Essar Steel or you’re working at Vale Inco or you’re working in Sarnia at any one of the fuel centres, there is a limited amount of technology that’s available. Again, if we did what the Leader of the Opposition suggested and that kind of model, we’d end up with what happened in BC where the cement plants left and those people lost their jobs. BC now imports its cement, with a huge carbon footprint, from China.", "The British government does something called dematerialization of their economy. I hope the member from Simcoe–Grey is listening, because I don’t understand how a Conservative in Canada would disagree with a Conservative in the UK. Under their system, they actually dematerialized their economy. They lost all 17 steel mills. We are not prepared to lose industry over this.", "While every industry in some way is paying, and a small minority of the heavy emitters get transitional allowances, that’s to protect the jobs. We’re not just doing this for big business. Who’s out advocating for this? Not just the industry associations but Unifor and the people who represent the workers in that plant. Does that mean that they’re going to be reduced? Absolutely, but Michigan and Illinois are not in a carbon pricing system yet. We cannot disadvantage our workers and our economy around that. At the same time, we have to achieve our reductions. We think the cap-and-trade system does it.", "Again, where I think we would probably agree with the NDP and disagree with the Conservatives is I think there’s nothing more insane than a revenue-neutral carbon pricing system. Why? The member from Renfrew–Nipissing–Pembroke attacked the government this morning. He said, “If you don’t extend these programs to subsidize retrofits, you’re abandoning rural Ontario,” and he threw his papers down on the desk with great drama, as he often does. Where does he think the money is coming from for the existing retrofit programs for natural gas and oil and propane? The exact point of the member from Nickel Belt: We can’t expect my Aunt Anne in Wanup, who is 96 years old on a fixed income, to change out her fossil fuel heating system. She’s a constituent. My Aunt Anne is going to need several thousand dollars in a grant program for the same reason we heard the drama from the member from Renfrew–Nipissing–Pembroke. Why? Because we have to take the money from the polluters—which is why it’s a regulatory fee—and give it to those constituents, working- and middle-class families, who can’t do it.", "Why do we have $14,000 subsidies on electric vehicles? Because if you’re buying the crossover and if you have to drive one of those big Fords or one of those big Tahoes, there is now technology that is comparative. Within a year or two, we will see major new technologies, hopefully being made in Windsor, if we’re lucky, because we’re pushing very hard and we have an advantage now with this. You need a $14,000 subsidy if you live in northern Ontario for that big truck, so you need the $1.9 billion.", "I am totally confused by the Leader of the Opposition, whose critic on Thursday attacked the government and said, “Do not have any kind of carbon tax; do not put a price on carbon.” I have her entire speech here. Her leadoff speech was, “Don’t support this bill. Don’t support a price on carbon.”", "I can tell you that the only thing that’s changed since last week was the polls. They figured out what the New Democrats and the Liberals know, which is that you can’t form a government in Ontario unless you’re on the right side of the carbon pricing issue. That’s the only thing that’s changed.", "How do you attack Stéphane Dion? How do you run in elections after elections? Do you know the speeches I’ve gotten from the member from Nipissing, from Huron–Bruce and the way through the caucus? They weren’t even neutral. I have pamphlets that were put out after I got elected in 2005 because I wrote columns for years in the Toronto Star saying that a carbon price was essential. The Tory’s election literature against me was recirculating my columns from the Star in my constituency. This is how rabidly anti-carbon pricing you were.", "If we’re a little askance or concerned—I don’t know whether you’re going to come out for the nationalization of banks next.

We are actually holding ourselves to a higher standard. We have a specific line.

We cannot use this money to subsidize it, but we do have to absorb all of the other costs of climate change from our other sources of revenue. When we lost eight metres of GO track, it cost us $600 million. When Burlington’s stormwater system, because of new precipitation levels––a lot more rain, a shorter amount of rain but greater volume, destroyed their sewer system, three times destroyed our operating rooms.

In 1910, at the International Conference of Working Women, a German woman named Clara Zetkin put forward the idea of an international day for women. Her idea was that every year in every country there should be a day for women to advocate for each other.", "According to the United Nations, Clara’s idea was endorsed by over 100 women from 17 countries who were attending the conference. A year later, the first International Women’s Day was held in 1911 on March 19. More than one million women and men participated in rallies campaigning for women’s right to work, to hold public office and to vote.", "Today, every year on March 8, thousands of events are held throughout the world to inspire women, celebrate our achievements and build momentum for the work we need to do to increase gender equality here in Ontario and all around the world, because we all know that more work needs to be done. More work needs to be done because in 2015 there are still too many women who are told that their opinions don’t count. There are still too many women who are intimidated, marginalized and discounted for the simple fact that they’re women. They’re told that they have no real influence. They’re told that they will never achieve their goals. They’re told that they will never be equal. And so more work needs to be done to build a better world for women and to build a fairer, more equal society for all, because I believe, Mr. Speaker, that those two go hand in hand.", "As a woman, as a mother, as a grandmother and as the first female Premier of Ontario, I’m committed to doing more.", "En tant que femme, mère, grand-mère, et en tant que la première femme première ministre de l’Ontario, je me suis engagée à faire plus.", "Because when you empower women, when you address issues that disproportionately affect women, you will strengthen and build up society so it becomes more fair and inclusive for everyone.", "I’m very proud to see the efforts reflected in Ontario. I’m proud that we have the most women elected to this Legislature than at any time in our history: 38 women. I’m proud, personally, to have seven women around the cabinet table and 12 more women in our caucus, and I’m proud of the efforts that our government continues to make.", "Our government has brought in wage increases for early childhood educators and personal support workers, the majority of whom are women. We have increased the minimum wage to $11 an hour and indexed it to inflation, helping low-income women, who are the majority of minimum wage earners in Ontario.", "We’re also supporting parents through Ontario’s full-day kindergarten program. In September 2014, full-day kindergarten was fully implemented and is now benefiting approximately 265,000 children across Ontario. Since 2003-04, we’ve increased the capacity of licensed centre-based child care programs by 57%, and we’ve increased the Ontario Child Benefit to a maximum of $1,310 per child per year. Through the Poverty Reduction Strategy, the child poverty rate in single-mother-led families in Ontario has dropped from 43% to 36%. The Ontario Women’s Directorate is providing low-income women with the training that they need to get better paying jobs. The Microlending for Women in Ontario program is helping low-income women build and grow their businesses.", "Women make up an integral part of Ontario’s economy and society, but on average they still do not earn as much as men, which is why our government is committed to leading the development of a wage gap strategy. Recently, Ontario became the first jurisdiction in Canada to require companies listed on the TSX to report publicly on their approach to increasing the number of women on their boards, because that glass ceiling may be cracking, but it is still in place, Mr. Speaker.", "We’ll continue to call on the federal government to take meaningful action to address the issue of missing and murdered aboriginal women and girls. I want to acknowledge the important work that is being done by the minister responsible for women’s issues, who is at the United Nations today as part of the Canadian delegation on the status of women.", "Applause." ],

The plan will raise public awareness of sexual violence and harassment in Ontario. It will help survivors so that they’re better supported when they reach out for the help that they need. It will strengthen our laws to help ensure that workplaces are free from sexual violence and harassment. Above all, it will challenge the deep-rooted attitudes and behaviours that contribute to sexual violence and harassment in the first place—I’m talking about misogyny and how it is never okay.", "This year’s theme for International Women’s Day is “Make It Happen.” I believe that, as a government, we are taking this call to action to heart. We are taking a different approach to government.", "Je me suis engagée à adopter une nouvelle approche de gouvernance, et une partie de cela est grâce à la perspective que j’apporte en tant que la première femme première ministre de l’Ontario.", "It’s a perspective that’s focused on people, investing in their skills, their ideas, their capacity for greatness.", "In closing, I want to quote from Nellie McClung, a woman in politics and a personal hero of mine. She said, “The women who have achieved success in the various fields of labour have won victory for us, but unless we all follow up and press onward the advantage will be lost. Yesterday’s success will not do for today.”", "Though those words were spoken 100 years ago, I believe they’re still important, Mr. Speaker.

This year, the Honourable Dr. Kellie Leitch, Minister of Labour and Minister of Status of Women, is focusing on strength with the tagline, “Strong Women, Strong World: Improving Economic Opportunities For All.” The theme for International Women’s Day, which was proclaimed by the United Nations is, “Empowering Women, Empowering Humanity: Picture it!”", "These two themes complement each other. When we look at the inequalities and injustice which many women still face today in our country and around the world, these themes seem very appropriate.", "International Women’s Day is an opportunity for Canadians to celebrate the great progress which has been made in Canada towards women’s equality, but also to recognize the disgraceful treatment of women and the suppression of women’s right in far too many other countries around the world. It is disturbing to note just how slow this progress has been.", "While collectively society might think this is a relatively new initiative, the first International Women’s Day was observed on March 19 in 1911 in Austria, Denmark, Germany and Switzerland.", "Some of the basic inequalities which were prevalent in 1911, such as women’s suffrage, property and marital rights and even to be legally recognized as a “person” under the law, are still distant dreams in much of the world.", "The plight of women in terms of equality are the worst in some of the poorest and most suppressive countries in the world.", "The implication of this year’s themes is that through the equality and empowerment of 50% of the population, not only would individual women prosper and grow but so would their societies and their countries in general.", "In Canada, the progress of women in education, business, government, politics, sports and the arts has benefited the entire country. Much of our prosperity today can be attributed to the ever-increasing roles which women have played in our society. I only have to look in this chamber to see the success that women can now have in politics. Even the Olympics would have been nowhere near as successful for Canada had it not been for our female athletes who, in many cases, outshone their male counterparts.", "However, with every shining light there are unfortunately shadows of darkness. It is impossible to discuss International Women’s Day and the status of women without acknowledging one of the most hideous scars on our society. Of course I’m referring to the ongoing sexual violence and harassment against women.", "In recent years, the degree of this problem has been brought into our living room through a series of tragic incidents. Last November, I raised this serious issue with the Premier on several occasions during question period, asking for the establishment of an all-party select committee to thoroughly investigate the issue of sexual harassment and violence in the workplace.", "After a number of weeks, the government agreed to the creation of the committee. Last week, the Premier appears to have pre-empted the work of the committee by announcing a significant program with funding for addressing the issue.", "I laud the Premier’s actions from last week, but I’m somewhat disappointed that she chose to make this a political announcement rather than fully utilize the work and commitment of the all-party select committee. The method by which this program was announced did put somewhat of a pall over its intent, which is unfortunate. However, regardless of the strategy that was employed, it was a positive step that I fully support.", "I want to conclude by congratulating all the female trailblazers for their dedication and commitment to advancing women’s rights and equality. International Women’s Day provides us with an opportunity to commemorate these efforts, celebrate progress and call for a commitment to continue the push for women’s equality.", "Next year, we will again offer remarks on the 2016 International Women’s Day. I am optimistic enough to hope that, over the next year, we will see significant progress on a number of fronts in both Canada and the rest of the world. However, I am also enough of a realist to be under no illusions that for millions of women, their lot in life will be no better. Consequently, this is not a subject that will ever allow us to let down our guard or bask in our victory in progress. There is much to be done now and in the years ahead.", "Thank you for the opportunity to speak." ],

This International Women’s Day, we, as a province, have a lot to reflect on as we look at the year that was. It was a year when horrible realities that so many women have faced in their everyday lives were pushed into the public eye.", "We have seen the culture of fear and secrecy that exists in workplaces where powerful men are allowed to act with impunity. We have seen how many women’s voices can be silenced by a single male voice, especially when they are backed by institutions that are willing to protect them.", "We have seen a culture of misogyny on campus, where young minds are being shaped and future professionals are obtaining their credentials. We have seen the explosion of precarious work and part-time work, where women—particularly immigrant women—are over-represented.", "We’ve seen the harassment and stalking that women face online.", "We have seen doctors still allowed to practise medicine even after being found to have perpetuated sexual assaults on women patients, and a regulatory body that is not required to immediately involve the police when they learn of these crimes.", "We continue to see women with no choices but to return to abusive partners. Women are still dying, and their children are still being traumatized.", "We continue to see women paid, on average, 30% less than their male counterparts.", "We continue to learn of aboriginal women across our nation who are missing or have been murdered, but we do not see justice for them or their families.", "The face of poverty is still a woman’s face; disproportionately, an immigrant woman’s face.", "In the face of all this, it is clear how far we still have to go before we have a just, safe and equal province. We should be addressing the systemic issues that marginalize women. Instead, we have a government that continues to impose deep cuts to services in Ontario.", "We know that it is women who disproportionately bear the brunt of these cuts. Across the province, closures of obstetrics wards, support centres for women in crisis and child care centres are leaving women vulnerable. The fragmented and inadequate home-care and long-term-care systems are hurting women, and the explosion of precarious work and unpaid work under this government is pushing more and more women to the margins. So many of the public sector workers already on the picket lines in this year, 2015, are women workers: nurses, educational workers and women who deliver Ontario’s public services.", "We must do better, and we can do better. New Democrats actually have been demonstrating how we will do better. In fact, we have a caucus now that is 50% women—the only caucus in Ontario and the only caucus in the country that has ever achieved that goal. I can tell you, as the leader of this caucus, and I think all of my caucus members would agree, particularly those who were around when it wasn’t a situation of 50% women in our caucus, that it makes a difference. It makes a difference in the tone that we address ourselves with; it makes a difference in the way that we approach the work that we do here; it makes a very, very positive difference. I think the MPPs who make up the NDP caucus would agree with me in that regard.", "This was a year where women refused to stay silent in the face of rape, harassment and assault. We must thank those women for their courage and take pride in the public discourse that it has spurred. As women, we must continue to take up our space, to continue to stand up and speak with our equal voices proudly, anywhere, anytime.", "All of us, women and men, must recommit ourselves to speak up and act with women and for women. That’s how we can truly celebrate International Women’s Day. Thank you." ],

Firstly, the spending authority is temporary. It would cover a period of six months from April 1, 2015, through September 30, 2015. This temporary spending authority is necessary to allow the government to operate while the Legislature conducts its review of the government’s detailed spending plans through the work of the Standing Committee on Estimates. All expenditures incurred under the authority of this motion would be consistent with the upcoming 2015 budget and 2015-16 estimates, and these expenses would eventually be authorized in the Supply Act for the 2015-16 fiscal year.", "The interim supply motion means that government would be able to keep our long-term-care homes, hospitals and schools running. In short, it means the government would be able to continue to provide essential public services province-wide and support the quality of life of all Ontarians, who we work for every single day.", "I look forward to hearing from my colleague the parliamentary assistant for the Treasury Board secretariat, the member from Etobicoke Centre, as well as from members of the opposition on this important, yet administrative, matter." ],

  "text" : [ "I want to speak for the next 10 minutes on this chapter. I’m going to start with the Ontario Chamber of Commerce because they have released two papers. The first is called A Straightforward Guide to Ontario’s Debt and Deficit. It’s called How Bad Is It? That’s the title of the Ontario Chamber of Commerce document. The fact that they’ve had to entitle a document How Bad Is It? should quickly tell you: It’s bad.", "Ontario’s current fiscal situation is revealed in this document that talks about how the province ended up so deep in debt. It starts off by saying in the last fiscal year, “the government of Ontario spent $10.5 billion more than it collected in revenue.” Speaker, that’s up from $9.2 billion the year before and it’s going to be surpassed in this year’s budget. “This deficit will increase the province’s net debt to $267.2 billion. To service this debt, Ontario will pay $10.6 billion in interest payments,” or interest on the debt.", "We have the highest net debt of any province in Canada. The Auditor General told us recently that the individual amount of money that each Ontarian owes is over $20,000 and it will hit $24,000 in the next two years.", "The chamber of commerce not only produced a document called How Bad Is It?; they only recently came out with their annual Emerging Stronger document to talk about Ontario’s path from recovery to growth. But our path has veered in a terrible trajectory this year.", "In a global context, their 60,000 members were asked, “Do you believe the Ontario economy is going in the right direction or the wrong direction?” Here is how many thought the economy was going in the right direction: In 2012, it was 41%; in 2013, it grew to 42%; but last year, it tumbled to 29%. That’s how many people in the chamber of commerce membership think the economy is headed in the right direction.", "The next question they asked was, “How confident are you in the Ontario economy right now?” Again, three years ago, it was 44%; two years ago, it grew to 48%; and this year it tumbled. The business community’s confidence tumbled again, from 48% to 29%. It is very, very serious, when you’ve got these kinds of numbers coming out from the job creators in Ontario.", "Now, sadly, there were 2,700 fewer businesses in Ontario last year than the year before, and we can look directly to a couple of areas why. Number one, we have the highest industrial power rates in all of North America. Number two, we have the highest payroll taxes in Canada. Nobody disputes that; those are facts.", "Let’s look at some of the statistics from the Canadian Federation of Independent Business and what they’re talking about in terms of, “How supportive are you of the commitments that political party leaders make during the election campaigns?” What they’re asking them is, “What are the most important issues to you right now?” The number one issue for the Canadian Federation of Independent Business was red tape. Of their members, 94% believe that red tape is the number one issue.", "The number two issue—at 93%, a close second—was energy costs. No surprise when you’ve got 2,700 fewer businesses: companies like Wrigley, General Mills, Kellogg’s, Caterpillar and Heinz all leaving Ontario. They still make chewing gum, they still make baking products, they still make cereal, they still make earthmoving equipment, they still make ketchup—just not necessarily here.", "The third most important issue was balancing the budget by 2017-18, at 91%; paying down government debt, 91%. The list from the Canadian Federation of Independent Business goes on and on.", "With respect to the main cost pressures on business, they’re asked, “What input costs are causing difficulties for your business?” Here again, tax and regulatory costs are the number one issue—red tape. The number two issue, closely behind, is fuel and energy costs. No surprise. These are key issues that are not being tackled by this government.", "Part of the problem with this government is that they’re in denial about the facts. You can hear the Minister of Economic Development continually talk about the jobs that have been created. However, of critical importance, cabinet was told in a confidential pre-budget document just last year, “The economy has not yet regained the strength of pre-2008,” the recession.", "This is from the Ministry of Finance: “[There are] fewer jobs relative to the population and more unemployed. Per capita output of the economy remains below its pre-recession benchmark.” So when the minister says to us, “We created X thousands of jobs last month or last year,” they may be cherry picking a correct number, but our population has increased so largely that there are fewer jobs relative to our population. That’s from the Ministry of Finance.", "So part of the problem, we understand, again from the Ministry of Finance confidential advice to cabinet—the new members of the Liberal caucus especially should be going through those controversial files; I’d be happy to turn them over to you anytime.", "Here’s what the Ministry of Finance said to cabinet. These are quotes: “Changes since the 2012 budget show a deterioration in the fiscal outlook beyond 2013-14.” This is really disturbing because they want to go ahead and spend this money, but they have no idea where it’s coming from.", "This is from the Ministry of Finance: “Over the medium term, we have notional targets by sector that add up to the deficit numbers, but not yet plans to deliver them.” So what they’re saying here is, “Yup, we know that we have to, but we don’t know how.”", "This is their own ministry: “For the extended look, neither targets nor plans yet exist.” So tomorrow, we know where we’ve got to be better than where we are today, but we don’t know how to get there. For the day after tomorrow, we don’t even know where we need to be, let alone how to get there.", "This is their own Ministry of Finance, which provided these documents to cabinet to give an awareness, an awakening, a sense of urgency to the Liberal government that all is not well. They didn’t seem to remember last May when Moody’s downgraded their outlook. That didn’t help. It was, “Damn the torpedoes. Full steam ahead!” They didn’t seem to react adversely when Fitch downgraded our credit rating. They did not seem to react with any changes whatsoever when Moody’s had a negative outlook only a few weeks ago.", "This followed very shortly after the Auditor General said, in December 2014, “Folks, you’ve got to change the way you’re headed.” Your deficit is growing. Your debt is the highest it has ever been. In fact, it has doubled in the 11 years the Liberals have been in power. You’ve got to take drastic action and change the direction you’re headed. The Auditor General, the Bank of Canada, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, the Ontario Chamber of Commerce, their own Ministry of Finance: All of these organizations are telling the government, “You’ve got to stop what you’re doing, turn the ship around and head in the right direction.” Sadly, we haven’t seen any change in direction from this government." ],

Actually, some of my comments may complement the PC finance critic because we are all concerned about jobs.", "Today in this Legislature, the Canadian Federation of Students is here. They are lobbying for equal access to education. I think that all of us in this House know that we will never address the failing economy, the drag on the economy and the lack of productivity unless we seriously address the inequities in access to post-secondary education and colleges. I think they’ve made a very compelling case here. They have a report that I’m sure all MPPs will be getting. It’s called Turning the Page: A New Chapter for Ontario’s Post-Secondary Students.", "From my riding, we have the Wilfrid Laurier University Graduate Students’ Association, but from my alma mater—I’m a proud Carleton graduate—the Carleton University Students’ Association and the Carleton University Graduate Students’ Association are here, and they make what I would consider a compelling case.", "Before, when the House leader stood up, he said that this motion will allow us, as a Legislature, to address our priorities of health care, of education, of economic development, of jobs and of the economy. Unless we take a serious step back and look at the funding priorities of this government, the Liberal government of Ontario will be spending a good deal of its time trying to bite its own neck, because you will not be able to address those priorities in this province unless you look at where the money is going.", "I’m new to the finance critic portfolio, but I really like it. I want to tell you why—and you have no choice; I’m going to tell you anyway. It’s because it’s not about ideology. It’s about where the money is going, where the investments are going, and what is making a difference in the province.", "Clearly, the Canadian Federation of Students is addressing long-term, systemic issues around post-secondary education, which obviously has a direct impact on jobs and the economy. They have called on this government to develop a long-term strategy for the progressive reduction of tuition fees in the province. They’ve presented a plan: a one-year plan, a three-year plan. The three-year plan has zero in year one but a 16.3% reduction through a reallocation of funds from the Ontario tuition grant, which is not really working despite what we hear, and the provincial education tax credits, and then $500 million in years two and three, which would result in an 8.3% reduction per year. This would be a total cost of $134 million, but they make the financial case for increased access, increased jobs, increased productivity, and one of those core priorities that the House leader says this government cares about, which is education.", "I’d like to remind people in this House that in an economy where over 75% of newly posted jobs require the completion of college or university, it is not surprising that an increasing number of students and their families view higher education as less of an option and more of a necessity. We share this view completely. But let’s also remember that tuition fees climbed from an average of $1,464 in 1990 to a staggering $7,235 in 2013, with no sign of stopping soon. So this is a crisis of affordability.", "As we discuss this motion in the House today, we have to be really clear that post-secondary education—those doors are slamming shut in the faces of youth in this province of Ontario. At the same time, we have to consider the way that those educational services are delivered. I think my colleague from London West has presented a private member’s bill around integrated work opportunities, learning and work opportunities, and addressing the scourge, the growing issue in this province, of unpaid and illegal internships.", "This group obviously has put into context the rhetoric of what we have heard about post-secondary education and the reality. I think that’s the valuable part of groups coming here and actually lobbying us.", "There was a freeze, though. There was a moment of hope, and I want to give the government from 2004 to 2006 credit for that freeze. But then that was abruptly lifted and tuition fees have been on track to double under the Liberal government. Instead of addressing the core issues affecting post-secondary education in Ontario—increasingly cumbersome upfront costs, deteriorating quality and crumbling infrastructure—decision-makers have thrown students’ finances and futures around like a ball to score political points.", "We share their concerns in this regard, and we think that affordable and accessible education is one of those key priorities that we could work on together. But, unfortunately, in 2013, the provincial government introduced a new four-year tuition fee framework, and under this tuition fee framework they can increase by 3% for most programs and 5% for graduate and professional programs. So there’s definitely a disconnect between talking about valuing post-secondary education and stating that those doors need to stay open for the growing income inequality in this province to be addressed—I think it’s important for us to know that, by 2016-17, tuition fees will have increased by up to 108% since the Liberals took office in 2003. It’s worse for professional programs, and we know that professional programs are a major obstacle for this province. We need those professional jobs—engineers. China, India—engineers are coming out of those countries, besides being disproportionate to population, like you wouldn’t believe. It’s incredible. We need the engineers, we need the doctors and we need the professions that are going to help us get climate change on track, help us make for a fairer justice system.", "I think the Canadian Federation of Students has made a very compelling case for this government to seriously look at where you’re investing and look at the return on investment for education. Education is always worth fighting for, Mr. Speaker, and it’s a pleasure to bring that point to this Legislature.", "The second issue is health care, which the House leader also raised. The finance committee got to travel around the province—six Liberals, two Conservatives and me. It was a great deal of fun, I must tell you. We were able to address and listen to, first-hand, not the press releases, not the ribbon cuttings, but the lived experiences of people in this province, who we work for, who we are supposed to be accountable to. There was one woman in particular, up in Sudbury, who told a story of her 93-year-old grandmother who was in the hallway for three days. Medical procedures were being done on this poor woman. It’s definitely an issue of integrity. The nurses of Ontario have raised the new phenomenon of hallway nursing. This is the new norm. One of the members from the committee said, “Well, wasn’t she getting care?” We need to set the benchmark higher than medical procedures being performed in hallways in hospitals in the province of Ontario. That can be addressed by finding that balance between the community health teams and the hospital budgets.", "Those hospitals are being inundated because this government has not acted on their promise of funding those LHINs accordingly. All that’s happening in our communities is that those local health agencies are competing for the same pots of money. There’s that saying: When the water hole gets lower and lower and lower, the animals start looking at each other a little differently. It’s a crisis in health care right now.", "We’re big proponents of early intervention and prevention because it’s a smart place to invest money—upstream, not downstream. It’s more ethical. It’s a principle that this entire province was built on: that when you go to a hospital or a doctor, you have equal access to that health care system. It’s the same principle in education, which is why, when the House leader stood up and said that today’s motion has to do with the priorities of this government, we should be adhering to those priorities. The government should be acting on the promises that they made, and they should be doing so in a financial way. We’ve called on ending the freeze on hospital-based operating budgets in order to stop the bed closures and front-line staffing cuts that obviously negatively impact patient care. We have called on this government—and our health critic, France Gélinas, who’s dealing with a tragedy in her community and can’t be here today, has raised the issue of the need for dental coverage for children. This is something that should totally be a non-partisan issue. The consolidation of those six agencies to deliver health care—and she has talked to those front-line people, and they have said that this will reduce access for children to preventive dental care, which in turn leads to long-standing issues, health care system issues, missing school. Everybody in this House has experienced dental pain. Why would we not be proactive and “progressive”? Why should we not be talking about the importance of early intervention and prevention on dental care? It makes sense. So we’ve called on this government to cancel its plans to reduce preventive dental coverage for children and to maintain preventive dental care in Ontario, public health standards, and maintain full funding for Children in Need of Treatment, the CINOT program. We fear, as has already been revealed through our health critic, that these changes will reduce access, and all of us in this House should have a concern about that.", "The last issue on health care—I know that when the House leader brought up this issue, he identified it as a priority. We’ve heard a lot about shifting the culture of wellness in this province, which indicates that this government is looking at early intervention and prevention, and yet we have seniors who end up in emergency room facilities because there is such a crisis in underfunding of home care services and long-term care. It costs more. That’s the message: It costs more.", "On public education, though, what I forgot to mention is that we have enough data now—we have enough reports, going back 15, 17 years to the Rozanski report, which highlighted the $2 billion in cuts. This government continually points to increases in education, but you’ve got to follow the money, because that money has gone to new programs, like the full-day kindergarten, for instance. I have nothing against it. I only wish that you had actually followed through on the original report, With Our Best Future in Mind, by Charles Pascal. If you had done that, you would see a huge increase in school-based child care, and you could have transferred that money to community-based child care instead of closing 18 centres across the province.", "This is about policy and legislation affecting the bottom line. This is about where money is going in the province. Actually, Hugh Mackenzie just came out with a report and highlighted the new spending priorities and that traditional, systemic underfunding in issues like special education, for instance—those systemic gaps in funding still exist, and you can’t deny it. You can point to the big number over here, but it’s going to new spending priorities; it’s not going to where the front-line services are.", "If there’s a smart place to invest in education, again, it’s earlier. If you get to a learning disability earlier in the life of a child, that child will see huge positive returns in that their educational experience will be better; it will be more positive. That has a financial positive at the end of it as well.", "Finally, the issue of economic development, employment and infrastructure: I have to tell you, Mr. Speaker, on this file, when I look at where the money is going in this province, and where the Auditor General flagged where the funding is going, I think we should have a full stop right now on how infrastructure is being invested, because it is going to places which are not benefitting the people of this province. We all have some understanding of how big that infrastructure gap is, and it’s growing.", "The Auditor General made some recommendations, and because we are talking about funding, I need to address some of those. The Auditor General says, “Infrastructure Ontario should, in conjunction with the Ministry of Economic Development, Employment and Infrastructure, gather data on actual cost experience from recent public-sector infrastructure procurements and alternative financing and procurements (AFPs) and revise its” value-for-money “assessment methodology to ensure that the valuation of risks assumed to be retained under both the AFP and public-sector delivery models are well justified.”", "What have we heard from this minister? It is the sound of silence. If I was the minister, I would be going right now to Infrastructure Ontario, as was recommended by the Auditor General, to review this practice. I would look at who is doing the value-for-money assessments and who is benefitting from doing the value-for-money assessments. If I was this government, I would be looking for money to meet the priorities that you talk about, like climate change, like education, like health care.", "The Auditor General points out that the financing cost for AFPs was $6.5 billion. We spent $6.5 billion more on financing for P3 projects than we needed to. This isn’t about ideology; it’s about where the money is going. How much more infrastructure can we build for $6.5 billion? How many more hospitals and front-line health care can we ensure people have access to with $6.5 billion?", "This report that the Auditor General shared with this government essentially puts all the other scandals to shame. Ornge was $1 billion; eHealth was $1 billion; the gas plants were $1.1 billion, originally predicted at $40 million. This is $8.2 billion. It warrants the attention of this government.", "It defies all logic, Mr. Speaker, that the rhetoric we hear back from this government is that P3s are more efficient, which is not true, and that they’re less costly, which is not true. They build in a cost overrun right at the beginning. They say that the risk is actually being transferred. But at the end of the day, it’s our money, so what risk is being transferred? We’re still on the line for the costs. We have to take a good, hard look to dispel the myths around publicly funded infrastructure projects, and then we have to counter with those P3 projects, of course, that have cost overruns.", "Just in the newspaper over the weekend, the consortium Ontario Sports Solutions—and this is Hamilton’s Pan Am Games stadium. “Subcontractors on the project say they haven’t been paid in full.” You know what actually happens—I know you don’t like to hear it, but the transfer gets passed down to the smaller and smaller and smaller subcontractors, and they don’t get paid. At the very top, everyone’s got their share. They’ve got their millions of dollars.", "I just want to remind people in this House, when you talk broadly about projects, about AFPs, that this P3 project, Hamilton’s Pan Am Games stadium, was supposed to be completed last June. So it’s not on time. The senior consortium partner, a French-owned company, Bouygues Building Canada, is in a financial stand-off right now.", "“‘A much larger entity is taking advantage of the sub trades in our opinion,’ said Scott MacKenzie of Brascon, which says it is owed $133,000.” The dispute, of course, now has been—they end up back at Infrastructure Ontario, the government agency, as we all know, that awarded contracts to Ontario Sports Solutions for building the Hamilton stadium under what is known, obviously, as an AFP.", "We hear lots of information about how efficient, how less costly, how innovative these P3 projects can be, when we’ve seen example after example that that’s not a consistent truth in this province of Ontario.", "If I were the government and I had this Auditor General’s report in front of me, and she identified with great clarity where this province could save money and where that money could then be syphoned or directed to the priorities that this government says that they value, that would be very, I think, beneficial.", "The government is probably going to come back with the Spadina extension. That Spadina extension—that’s a cursed project, I think. It has been overseen by every single government for years now. It is not the project that you hold up as, obviously, the best project in the province of Ontario. I can tell you that much.", "But we know better today. We know better. Finally someone, the Auditor General, the independent officer of this Legislature, highlighted the fact that private project managers also tend to charge higher legal and management fees, which are more costly. As well—and this is the big part—they must return profits to their owners. So profit is still the driving factor in AFPs. Those who really like public-private partnerships insist that while all of this may be true, privately managed projects are far more likely to come in on time and under budget. Well, if you build a 30% buffer on any project—any contractor in the province of Ontario is going to say, “If you build in a 28% profit margin, I could get that done on time.” That’s just what they’ll say to you. It’s ridiculous.", "The minister without portfolio, who is not here today, likes to say, “Bob Rae and the 407—he used a public-private partnership.” Yet in the end, the Rae government had to borrow the $1 billion itself and then pass it on to the consortium. The private sector partners just couldn’t raise cash as cheaply.", "If I leave you with anything, it is this: Why is this government borrowing money for infrastructure at credit card rates when the government can get the best interest rate in the province of Ontario? Why is that money going to those lawyers and those consultants and those financial companies when we know better in 2015? There is a moral imperative, never mind an economic imperative, to ensure that we invest in infrastructure so that it benefits the people of this province, that we invest in infrastructure so it strengthens the economy and that we invest in infrastructure in a fiscally responsible manner. The Auditor General has called into question the way that AFPs are determined, who is doing the value-for-money assessments and the modelling of those value assessments.", "If I was the government, I would be taking this report, I would be going down to Infrastructure Ontario and I would be following up and making sure that some better practices, more transparent and more accountable practices, are put into place so the people of this province are better served through infrastructure investment. I would just like to leave you with that, Mr. Speaker.", "Health care, education, economic development, infrastructure: This province will not recover in an economic manner without addressing these key issues of where taxpayer money is invested, and we will spend the next three and a half years watching this government bite its own neck." ],

For six months, the government will have the absolute authority to spend money even before the budget has been introduced, let alone passed, without any oversight or any transparency.

I don’t have to repeat the names; we all know the names of these financial scandals. But I do want the members in this House and the people listening today to understand why it is that Ontario always finds itself mired in scandal. It is a simple reason: Our process and our standing orders actually prevent this Legislature from evaluating and examining the financial transactions of the government.", "I’ll start off with a couple of things. In estimates committee—a lot of people may not understand this—this year, we got to examine six ministries, the expenditures of six ministries, and that’s all we were allowed to look at.

There’s 27 ministries; we got to look at six of them.", "A number of the expenditures of the House, all those offices that show up in the estimates volume 2, are prevented from being examined by this Legislative Assembly.

We are the only province and the only Parliament in the country that has this process that limits the number of ministries that we’re allowed examine, but also then deems all others to be passed. We’re the only such Parliament in this country.", "Even the House of Commons is limited to seeking interim supply for a three-month period.

Our standing orders.", "Let me give you a couple of other examples for members in this House.", "In Newfoundland, estimates not examined by the estimates committee are moved to the Committee of the Whole on supply.", "In Nova Scotia, they’re limited to five ministries to be examined by estimates, but then all other ministries are referred to Committee of the Whole.", "Alberta has no limits on the amount of ministries or agencies that come before public accounts. This year, Alberta brought 15 agencies and ministries before their estimates committee; we were allowed to examine six.", "BC also has no limit on the amount of ministries or agencies under review.", "Saskatchewan is probably one of the best Legislatures in this country for allowing examination of financial transactions, and I say that to give you a bit of a rundown on just how the standing orders of this House prevent and restrict financial oversight.", "As I mentioned, expenditures that show up in volume 2 of the estimates cannot be looked at.", "I would say, as I’m talking to everybody in this House today: How many people here have actually gone through and looked at the public accounts of the province?" ],

We do have that responsibility to ensure to our constituents that we have examined government expenditures. It’s not just the role of the opposition. It is the role of every backbencher in the Liberal Party to examine the expenditures of government. It is the role of every minister to examine the expenditures of their ministries. It is a job for all of us that we ought to take seriously. But we can’t take it seriously if there are going to be only one or two of us in this House who actually look at the public accounts; if there are only one or two of us who actually read the estimates; if there are, indeed, whole ministries and offices of Parliament where we are prevented from examining their expenditures.", "Speaker, my call-out to the Liberal government is that they will get this interim supply, but it’s time that we all stand up and do our job, represent our constituents well and start examining the financial transactions and ending the financial mismanagement that this Liberal government consistently always gets this province into." ],

In this Legislature, every day, we debate a range of issues that are important to our constituents because we believe they will improve the quality of life for people in our constituencies and across our province. Today, I speak to a motion that is important to ensuring that we continue to make those investments to preserve the services that Ontarians rely on every day, to support the quality of life that we all enjoy.", "As mentioned by the government House leader earlier today, this motion is fairly routine but it is important. It is an important part of the fiscal cycle. It provides the government with temporary spending authority in order for the government to continue to fund important programs and services during the beginning of the new fiscal year which starts on April 1, 2015.", "Specifically, this would ensure that we can continue to implement the government’s plan to support a stronger Ontario. The plan, of course, is built around a number of pillars: investing in people, building modern infrastructure, supporting a strong and innovative business climate—but all of this on a foundation of fiscal responsibility. As the PA to Minister Matthews at Treasury Board, I can vouch for the fact that that’s exactly what we’re doing, that we’re trying to invest while on a foundation of fiscal responsibility.", "We are committed to responsible fiscal management, making sure that every dollar counts as we work towards balancing the budget. That’s one of the things that I heard from my constituents when I was out in the community during the election campaign. I’ve heard it a lot since, and I hear it in my constituency office. They’re asking me and they’re asking all of us here to make sure that we’re getting maximum value for the dollars that we invest on behalf of the people of Ontario, whether that be in education or in health care or anywhere else. I know Minister Matthews and all the ministers who are here today, and those who aren’t present at this moment, are working towards that objective.", "We know that the road ahead won’t always be easy. There will be challenges along the way. But I think we have a plan that we can be proud of, a plan that invests in the people of this province and the programs and services that they rely on.", "What I want to do in the few minutes that I have is just talk about some of the highlights of the plan for fiscal 2015-16 and beyond. The government has made substantial progress on its plan to build Ontario up and to create a fairer and more prosperous province. We’re committed to building opportunity, creating jobs and ensuring long-term security for people across the province, again by investing in people’s talents, by investing not only in the present but also in the future. We talk about investments for the future. We’re talking about things like infrastructure—like roads, like transit—and also creating a dynamic and supportive environment for business. That’s critical, because that’s what allows us to create jobs in this province—to preserve jobs, to create jobs—and to provide for and support the prosperity that Ontarians deserve.", "Ontario’s economic performance has demonstrated that many of these policies are bearing fruit. For example, Ontario saw an increase of about 1,300 jobs in the month of January alone. Since the low point of the recession, in June 2009, we’ve added 508,700 jobs, and almost 348,000 of these jobs were in the private sector; so, a lot of jobs, a lot of growth since the recession. I think this is a reflection of the hard work of Ontario and the hard work of this government, which is implementing policies to support that recovery and economic growth. Unemployment is down to 6.9% from a high of 9.5% in June 2009.", "This is good progress, but there’s more work to be done. In that vein, I just want provide a few highlights of the work that is being done.", "In 2014, the Premier led a trade mission to China, and secured almost $1 billion in new investment. This will create more than 1,800 jobs in communities across our province. The Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and International Trade and the Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs will be leading a mission to China next month to help small and medium-sized Ontario businesses engage successfully with the Chinese market.", "I talked earlier about the importance of not only investing in the present but investing in the future. To help with increasing population growth and demands on infrastructure and services, we’re also investing $130 billion in public infrastructure over the next 10 years, including $29 billion for transportation. This is important, because it will ease congestion across the GTA and Hamilton area and support the building and maintenance of roads, bridges and other critical infrastructure.", "This supply motion supports the continued funding of this plan that provides these critical supports to our economy and to our infrastructure and services across Ontario. Just these investments alone that I talked about, particularly the ones in infrastructure, will create more than 110,000 jobs this year.", "When I think about the priorities of the people of my riding—the people of Etobicoke Centre—and all across Ontario, I also think about our health care and education. Our government has committed to invest in hospitals but also to expand funding to home care, something that is so important in so many of our ridings but particularly in my riding, where we have one of the highest proportions of seniors of any riding in the country.", "We’ve also committed to continuing to strengthen the quality of our education system here in Ontario. Our Minister of Education is here with us today, and I know she’s doing excellent work on that front.", "We’re going to do all these things while continuing to work to eliminate the deficit, knocking it down to a forecasted $8.9 billion on our way toward a balanced budget in 2017-18. But we’re going to do that responsibly.", "The Premier’s Advisory Council on Government Assets was asked to find ways to increase efficiencies and unlock the value of government assets, and we look forward to receiving the council’s findings, which will inform our decisions to increase revenue and reinvest in priority infrastructure projects.", "The supply motion we’re talking about today allows us to continue forward with this plan. That supply motion and that plan will not sacrifice important public services with across-the-board cuts. At the same time, we do recognize the importance of spending restraint. Due to the government’s efforts, program spending is projected to grow at an average rate of 0.8% through to 2017-18.", "Ontario continues to have the lowest per capita program spending among provinces, and the lowest total government revenue per person among the provinces, including funding for federal transfers. I think this is a sign of the work this government is doing.", "In addition, we’ll continue to make every dollar count, ensuring that Ontarians get value for money. The program review, renewal and transformation initiative that Minister Matthews is leading will look at how every dollar across government is spent. We’re going to use evidence to inform our decisions and improve outcomes for people. We’re working across government to find the best way to deliver programs and services, again, always seeking the best value for the people of Ontario.", "The program review is building on previous action taken by our government, including the implementation of recommendations from the Drummond commission. We’re also going to take a strong but fair approach to managing public sector compensation and benefit costs.", "Speaker, on a personal note, I am honoured to be working with Minister Matthews and Treasury Board to protect important services by working toward a balanced budget and ensuring that we maximize value for taxpayers’ dollars.", "Mr. Speaker, I started by speaking to the fact that we’re here to improve the quality of life of Ontarians. I think that we are. To do so, we need to continue to support the government’s plan that I just spoke of and support the key services that Ontarians rely on every single day. That is why this interim supply motion is so important. The supply motion would give our government the necessary spending authority to finance important public services that Ontarians rely on.", "I encourage all members to support this motion so that we can continue to provide the best and most dependable public service possible and to continue to improve the quality of life of all Ontarians." ],

We keep hearing about how the government is, in their own words, overachieving. They make budgets and then they do better than their budgets. They talk about how prudent they are and how wonderful everything is. But if you actually look at the numbers after things have passed, we seem to be going in the wrong direction. This year the budget deficit is forecast to be $12.5 billion. This year it’s more than all the other provinces put together, and it has gone up in the past three years, so we’re trending in the wrong direction.", "I recommend to everyone the Auditor General’s annual report, which comes out in December each year. It’s a pretty thick document. There’s certainly good information in it. The Auditor General, Bonnie Lysyk, takes the unusual step of talking a fair amount about the growing debt of the province of Ontario and the concerns with the affordability of that debt. I think that is certainly noteworthy. In round numbers, she said that the debt is on its way to being some $340 billion, I believe, by the time the government predicts it may balance its budget, in 2017-18. But really, it’s how you measure whether you can afford that debt that I think is key. The measure that’s usually used is net debt as a percentage of the gross domestic product of the whole economy of the province of Ontario. Back when the current government was elected in 2003, that was about 27% of the gross domestic product; the debt was 27% of the gross domestic product.", "In the auditor’s report, she goes on, and I’ll maybe just read this so I get it exactly correct. She says, “Our key commentary in chapter 2 is on Ontario’s growing debt burden. Although the focus on eliminating Ontario’s annual deficit is important, we think that government should provide more information on how it plans to achieve its longer-term objective of reducing its net debt-to-GDP ratio to its pre-recession level of 27%. Ontario’s net debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to reach a high of 40.5% in 2015-16, after which the government expects it to decline. The net debt-to-GDP ratio is a key indicator of the government’s financial ability to carry its debt relative to the size of the economy.”", "She goes on: “In fact, net debt (the difference between the government’s liabilities and its total assets) and total debt (the total amount of borrowed money the government owes to external parties) are both expected to continue growing in absolute terms even after the province starts to run annual budget surpluses”—and that’s a big “if”; I’m putting in some commentary there. “This important fact should not go unnoticed by the members of the Legislature and the public. We estimate that total debt will exceed $340 billion by 2017-18 (it was at $295.8 billion on March 31, 2014).", "“By 2017-18, the year the government projects it will achieve an annual surplus, Ontario’s net debt will have more than doubled over a 10-year period, from $156.6 billion in 2007-08 to over $325 billion by 2017-18. To put this in perspective, to eliminate Ontario’s 2017-18 estimated net debt, every man, woman and child in Ontario would need to contribute $23,000 to the provincial coffers. We recommended that the government provide information on how it plans to achieve its target of reducing its net debt-to-GDP ratio to a prerecession level of 27%.”", "In the auditor’s own words, that’s something that is of real concern to me. Again, I think we need to highlight that as often as we can.", "I also want to briefly talk about other issues that have been raised. I note the member from Nipissing went through the Canadian Federation of Independent Business’ survey, which is always a useful tool. They’re surveying people who are in business to see what their big concerns are. The number one concern was red tape. I believe he said that 94% of those voting said that was their number one issue: the time, if you’re in business, you spend trying to comply with the various regulations that we come up with in this place.", "But the number two concern was energy costs: 93% of the people were concerned with energy costs. That’s certainly something that the Auditor General speaks to in her annual report as well. Particularly, there’s a whole section on smart meters and the implementation of smart meters that I would recommend people to read, where it points out that it was supposed to cost $1 billion. It actually cost $1.9 billion, and it’s not actually achieving its goal of shifting electricity demand. The big reason is because of the huge subsidies being paid for the feed-in-tariff contracts, mainly for wind and solar power, and just the huge numbers those are expected to be.", "In her own words, talking about the global adjustment, she states that it “now accounts for 70%” of electricity rates and people don’t see that on their average bill. They just see their electricity rates going up. They don’t actually know that 70% of it is the global adjustment. The global adjustment was 0.4 cents per kilowatt hour. The global adjustment is now 5.5 cents per kilowatt hour. It’s gone up some 1,200%. When you look at the absolute numbers, they are huge numbers. It was $8.5 billion that people were paying on their hydro bills in 2014 for the global adjustment, $9.4 billion in 2015, and predicted to be, for 2006-15, $50 billion—huge numbers that people are paying on their hydro bills. That’s just a very big concern when you see from the Canadian Federation of Independent Business that energy cost is one of their biggest concerns.", "You look at the fact that in Ontario we’ve lost companies like Xstrata in Timmins, where there was a smelter, and the 700 jobs moved across the border to Quebec. You have to ask yourself, with the Ring of Fire, whether there’s ever going to be a smelter in Ontario with these high energy costs. I have in my own riding Kimberly-Clark in Huntsville, a tissue mill, and their number one issue is cost of energy and reliability of energy. It’s a very big issue that affects creating jobs here in the province of Ontario.", "I just have a minute left and I wanted to briefly mention, as a critic for mining, that the Fraser Institute’s report on mining came out recently and, unfortunately, it’s not good news for the province of Ontario. They have a measure that is called the investment attractiveness index that gets feedback from all over the world on the mineral potential, the geology and also the policy perception, to look at the policies of the government and how they’re affecting investment in mining. Ontario, last year, was 14th, which wasn’t that great, but the bad news is, from last year to this year we’ve gone from 14th up nine spots to 23rd. We’re absolutely going in the wrong direction, and we see very little activity happening on the Ring of Fire. The bad news there, of course, is that Cliffs Natural Resources has pretty much got their operations for sale and essentially—", "Interjection." ],

There are two issues I’d like to highlight to the House and my fellow members.", "The first one is around GO train services to Niagara Falls. I’ve raised this issue in the House a number of times. I’m going to speak to it again. The Niagara region is united—the keyword there is “united”—in its ask to the province to provide daily two-way GO service all the way to Niagara Falls.", "Make no mistake about it: GO is a game-changer for Niagara. We have thousands and thousands of people commuting from Niagara to Toronto every single day—50,000 every day. Our highways are clogged, and the commutes are terrible. I drive the same route from Queen’s Park back to Niagara Falls. What used to take an hour now takes three. We have workers in Niagara who need to leave three hours early just to be able to get to work.", "I look across the floor here—I see everybody listening intently on this issue—and it was one of your Liberal members from St. Catharines who was here with me last Friday. We left at 3:10 and 3:15, almost the same time. It took us over three hours to get to St. Catharines. That’s your member. So nobody can say that this isn’t happening when people are trying to get to Toronto to work.", "Think about this: We have one of the highest unemployment rates, and it makes no sense. When you’re trying to make sure that you’re going to get rid of the deficit, what better way to do it than to put people back to work? We can do that in Niagara through tourism. The wine industry is growing by leaps and bounds. Craft brewers are growing.", "Take a look at what has happened to our dollar over the last little while. Our dollar was at $1.10; it’s now down to 80 cents, 78 cents. What is that doing to the auto industry? In Niagara, we have General Motors, where they still have 2,500 people working right in the plant, and that’s not counting the other spinoff jobs that are in the community. So now you’re talking 10,000 or 12,000 jobs. That’s what can happen if we can bring GO to Niagara.", "Daily two-way GO service is the economic boost our region needs, but, quite frankly, it’s the economic boost that Ontario needs. It’s something that can make Niagara the economic driver of all Ontario. It will connect Niagara with the GTA. People can travel to Toronto to work, tourists can come and see Niagara, and we’ll take them off our highways. Wouldn’t that be nice? Think about it.", "I’ve listened to the other side over the last few weeks with Bill 31. They talk about improving the environment. What better way to improve the environment than getting people out of their cars and into GO trains?", "The Premier—not Wayne Gates—said during the election that the GO train to Niagara was a “very high priority.” The chair of her caucus, again, from St. Catharines, said he could see it coming to Niagara in 2015. Well, it’s 2015.", "I’d like to let the Premier and all the members of this House know that there’s going to be a rally in Niagara Falls this Friday. It begins at 11:30 a.m., and you’re all welcome to come, all three parties. It’s going to kick off our public campaign to bring GO to Niagara. Here’s what’s important on this: All the mayors—it doesn’t matter if they’re in St. Catharines, Niagara Falls, Thorold, Welland, Grimsby, Wainfleet, Port Colborne—will be there. Their elected regional councillors will be there. The city councillors of all those communities are going to be there. And they’ll all be there to show support for what? For GO. Because they know it’s a game-changer for us. We’re hoping that the Premier will see this rally and follow through on what her party said they would do during the last election.", "This is not something that can wait 10 years. Quite frankly, the economy of Ontario can’t wait 10 years. It needs to happen now, just like they said: 2015.", "Bringing the GO train to Niagara can create good-paying jobs right here in Ontario. It can create economic activity. It can allow smart—I’m going to say that again: It can allow smart and talented young people to work in Toronto and live in their home communities. It can allow people from Toronto to visit our excellent wineries that we have in Niagara-on-the-Lake and the amazing sites that we have in Niagara Falls—unfortunately, the agriculture minister probably just left—and the race track in Fort Erie, where we need more racing dates—" ],

I’d also like to touch on Parliament Oak Public School in Niagara-on-the-Lake. As many of you know, the community group there, Citizens for Accountable and Responsible Education, also known as CARE, is trying to preserve their access to education and now have to go to court to try to save their school. Parliament Oak is the heart of the old town. The community there wants the school to stay open. It will attract young families to settle in Niagara-on-the-Lake and make sure the town keeps growing. Yet the CARE group continues to have to fight to make sure their kids can go to school somewhere close to home.", "At first, there were some who were hoping this issue would die in a courtroom. They were hoping that by the time the parents and the community of Niagara-on-the-Lake got their turn to speak in court, the school would already be closed.", "This, however, didn’t happen. The CARE group won an expedited trial and have a tentative date set for March. While all this is going on, the board continues to be indifferent to the concerns of the parents.", "This isn’t just parents from Niagara-on-the-Lake anymore; it’s parents from small communities across the province of Ontario, communities that don’t want to see their schools closed and their education taken away from them. On top of that, we’re now hearing that the Minister of Education has not given enough funding to the Crossroads Public School to build the original four classrooms requested by DSBN. Now, they have even less space to deal with even more kids if the school closure happens.", "Mr. Speaker, the parents and the children in Niagara-on-the-Lake have been clear: They want to keep Parliament Oak school open. I call on this government to support them and to support education in all the small communities right across the province. We need a fund to keep schools open, not a fund to close them. Schools are the heart of the communities, the heart of the families who go to these schools. Let’s keep rural schools open in the province of Ontario.", "I’m not sure how much time I have left, but I’m going to talk about one more issue: the hospital in Niagara Falls. In Niagara Falls we’re going to have a new hospital. When I was running in a by-election almost a year ago to the day now, I guess a year and a month—I think I’ve been here a year and a month; time goes quickly when you’re having fun." ],

So I’m saying to this government: Let’s build a hospital in Niagara Falls, let’s get it done, but let’s build it as a publicly funded, publicly delivered hospital, where you can borrow money at the cheaper rate.", "And think about what they did in Peterborough. They built a hospital similar to St. Catharines. St. Catharines was a billion dollars, give or take a couple of dollars. The same hospital, very close to the same size—a few beds less—was built in Peterborough for about $340 million. So, if you use the same type of thing, imagine what we could do if we build it as a publicly delivered hospital and take the $600 million or $700 million you’re going to save and reinvest that back into front-line health care for our seniors and for long-term care. Now, wouldn’t that make sense to people? That’s how the hospitals should be done.", "The last thing I’m going to say—because I talked about this very early when I got up here and talked—we have one of the highest unemployment rates in the province of Ontario. There’s no need for it, absolutely none. We’re going to have an opportunity to build that hospital. Why don’t we, when we build a hospital, build it with local workers, local architects, local engineers, local skilled tradespeople, and put those people back to work using our own tax dollars—our own tax dollars putting people to work. Guess what happens when you put them back to work? They pay taxes. How does that help the deficit? They start paying taxes to reduce the deficit. It works. It’s how the cycle should work.", "So two things on the hospital: Let’s build it publicly funded, publicly delivered, and let’s utilize the $600 million or $700 million dollars we may save by putting it back into front-line care. And let’s put Ontarians, let’s put people living in the Niagara region back to work and get our unemployment rate down. Thank you very much for the few minutes." ],

I do wish to remind the members of this Parliament that Ontario’s Auditor General, Bonnie Lysyk, has put out a challenge to all of us—to legislators, to this government and to people in Ontario. She presented this during her annual report at the end of last year, and she has asked all of us to start thinking about the debt.", "There has been so much conversation about the deficit, the ongoing, to-and-fro debate about the deficit. The government’s projections for the deficit are never accurate. They always are out by several billion dollars. Our Auditor General has indicated to us that it is essentially time to cut to the chase, take a look at that debt and give serious consideration to how we can start paying down that debt, a debt that, year by year, continues to grow.", "Why has she put this out? She gave as her primary reason the fact that interest rates, believe it or not in the present climate, will eventually rise, meaning that the interest cost to service Ontario’s debt will rise dramatically. Again, this is the main message from Ontario’s Auditor General with respect to the finances of the province of Ontario.", "There’s an example that I use with respect to those of us who have credit cards. I’m sure most of us try to pay them off month by month. You keep in mind, when you do get behind—and so many people do, regrettably—interest compounds quickly. When you miss a payment, or when you only make a minimum payment, unpaid interest, obviously, is added to your debt. For many, this has become an almost impossible cycle to break. The same can be said for governmental jurisdictions right around the world, really, and certainly including the province of Ontario.", "For the past few years, much of this present government’s spending has been with borrowed money. They’re spending it when we do not have the money, in spite of the fact that in my view, and I hope to talk about this a little later, we don’t have a revenue problem.", "So the latest figures: Ontario is scheduled to go another $12.5 billion in the hole this year—that’s more than the deficits of all the other provinces combined—and is scheduled to boost the total debt to over $340 billion by the time the books are promised to be balanced by 2017-18.", "There are others who paint an even more dismal picture. This government’s hand-picked economist, Don Drummond, brought out his report in 2012 and projected that the deficit in 2017-18 will not be zero, as Kathleen Wynne has promised. He has indicated that in 2017-18, it won’t be zero; we’re going to be $30.2 billion in the red, with the way we’re going now. Drummond also projected the 2017-18 debt coming in at a whopping $411.4 billion, not the $340 billion that has been bandied about this winter.", "We all know that Dalton McGuinty doubled the debt during his tenure and has that moniker—down my way, he’s known as Dalton the Debt Doubler. He earned that mantle honestly. Kathleen Wynne herself will see a doubling of the debt by 2017-18 from that recession level of $156.6 billion.", "Speaker, as we debate Minister Matthews’s motion, I ask everyone here to consider the Auditor General’s past three annual reports. She commented on the growing debt; she highlighted a number of points. Debt servicing costs reduce funding for other programs, obviously, with potentially reduced funding to pay civil servant salaries—the interim motion we’re debating this afternoon. Her second point, as I’ve mentioned, is greater vulnerability to interest rate increases. Third—I know that our finance critic made mention of that this afternoon—are potential and ongoing credit rating downgrades. These increase borrowing costs, the most recent example being the concern from the investor credit rating organization Moody’s.", "Speaker, as debt grows, so does the amount of cash needed to pay the interest on the debt. Ontario now spends more on debt interest than it does on post-secondary education, and these interest costs continue to grow. In fact, the interest on the debt is projected to be the fastest-rising cost for this government over the next four years. To my way of thinking, down the road, this means even less money available for civil servant salaries and programs. By 2017-18, when the total debt is expected to be more than $340 billion, the government expects to have to spend nearly $1 in every $9 of revenue to service that debt. In 2007-08, only $1 of every $12 of revenue collected was required to pay the interest.", "After the provincial budget was tabled again, in July of last summer, the credit rating agencies reaffirmed their existing ratings for Ontario. However, they have indicated that a downgrade will be almost inevitable eventually, unless the province implements measures to address its higher debt level.", "Let’s go back to Moody’s. In July 2014, Moody’s changed its outlook for Ontario from stable to negative and warned of a possible downgrade. Also in July 2014, S&P—Standard and Poor’s—reaffirmed its AA-minus rating, with a negative outlook.", "DBRS confirmed its rating of AA-low but, similar to Moody’s assessment, DBRS noted that the province’s medium-term outlook has weakened.", "And—this was mentioned earlier—just before Christmas, Fitch also downgraded the province’s credit rating to AA-minus.", "All the credit rating agencies are keeping an eye on the province of Ontario. They’re watching our deliberations, the debate we’re having this afternoon, about the need to meet payroll in the coming several months.", "Ontario’s Auditor General not only put out a challenge; she put out some benchmarks for us to follow, and has recommended a long-term debt reduction plan linked to the target of reducing the net debt-to-GDP ratio to the pre-recession level of 27%. I don’t think it’s going to happen, from what I see in this House.", "I will say that many of those in the know—the Bank of Canada, the Conference Board of Canada, the credit rating agencies that I’ve mentioned—have very little confidence that this government has the ability to rein in spending.", "Moody’s, again, brought out a report very recently and noted that Ontario’s debt burden has gone up every year since 2009. They compare to it Quebec, where debt has remained stable: “Given such high levels of planned spending, it is our expectation that there will be non-significant reductions in Ontario’s debt burden for the next five to 10 years....", "“Moody’s rating for Ontario is Aa2 negative and Quebec’s Aa2 stable.” As I mentioned, “The rating firm downgraded Ontario to negative from stable in July last year, just before the budget” was brought in.", "Just to wrap up, I think it’s very important for us to dwell on this negative outlook for the province of Ontario. Very simply, in my reading—I’ve been involved in the study and in readings of the dismal science for something like 40 years now—everybody is telling this government the same thing: Stop the spending. What are we seeing? We’re seeing increases in spending.", "Here we are today debating a motion to pay the salaries of civil servants. We’re talking about paying civil servants’ salaries with money we don’t have, money we have to borrow." ],

One of the things that we would hope is that there would be policies in place that at least let francophones who are moving into the country from whatever French country it might be around the world know that northern Ontario would be put on the map when it comes to an option, because if you’re French speakers and don’t speak English as a second language, you can pretty well live in French in many of the communities that I represent, where there are third-generation and fourth-generation francophones who have a hard time being able to speak English.", "It would make some sense for us to have some say when it comes to being able to deal with the issues around immigration as they apply to the province of Ontario.

But if you think back on the recent history around the city of Toronto, for example, I think Toronto in the early 1970s was deemed to be one of the most WASPish, if I could use that word, communities that you could probably find, certainly in Ontario and perhaps in the entire country. It has only been in relatively recent history—the last 30 or 40 years—where we’ve seen a significant multicultural component come to the city of Toronto.", "Contrast that to what happened in my community of Thunder Bay: When people talked about multiculturalism, I used to say all the time, “Here in Thunder Bay—Port Arthur and Fort William before we amalgamated in 1970—we were multicultural before people were even talking about multiculturalism.” We were multicultural in Port Arthur and Fort William and then in Thunder Bay before it became an official federal policy.

I’m wondering why it’s so late to the table doing this. We’ve had issues for these last dozen years that they could have been working on.

They’ve gone through all the proper training and yet they’re years and years and years getting the equivalent here and sometimes are never able to get that. They have to leave their chosen occupation, have to not utilize the services and the skills and the expertise that they have had in their own country, bring them here—that we could be utilizing and leveraging.

That’s why, in my last speaking to the member from Scarborough–Agincourt—I’m concerned that it has been 12 years of this government, and now we’re just getting to this. It would have been great to have known that they started this 12 years ago and it was a slam dunk and we weren’t still talking about just implementing it.", "For this reason, our caucus supported the move to have all candidates assessed before they arrive in Ontario. That would mean disclosing exactly what kind of opportunities await them in Ontario and, most importantly, what kind of professional upgrades they will need to be considered as a job candidate. This is not happening right now. As I’ve mentioned, we have doctors, engineers, nurses and a multitude of other professionals who don’t realize the employment obstacles facing them until they move their family here. This is costing us.", "The Conference Board of Canada estimates that underutilizing their skills costs us between $3 billion and $4 billion in lost productivity. This is simply not fair to the applicants or to their families, and it certainly isn’t fair to us here in Ontario as well. We need to know exactly the type of people that we need to be attracting. We need to be fair and upright and straight with them, saying, “If you come and you have these qualifications, here’s what you’re going to need and here’s how long the time frame will be.” We need to ensure that those people aren’t given a false hope, move from their home to here to make a new home and we put them through that and they end up out doing a multitude of jobs that aren’t in their classification that they have to pick up.", "To their credit, a lot of them will do whatever it is because they are just so happy—and you can see the passion on their face—and privileged and fortunate to be in a country like Canada and a province like Ontario.", "But we need to do our job. We need to be fair so that it’s efficient and good for them. It’s much better for our province and our productivity, and, most importantly, it’s about them. They want to come. All of us should be able to aspire to do what we wish to do. We want them, particularly those with skills and qualifications who have spent that time and education and money and resources and the family commitment to become educated in a very specific occupation of their choice—we want to ensure that when they come here, we have an opportunity for them to practise that and, certainly, to maximize those skills and experiences.", "A very particular specific issue is the provincial nominee program—and I’ll reference it most of the day here—better known as PNP; although it will cut my word count a little, I’ll do the acronym.", "Nationally we have a yearly quota of allowing about 250,000 new permanent residents to settle in Canada. Ontario has asked for a bigger role in selecting which ones settle in Ontario and that its provincial nominee program, PNP, double its share to 5,000 from the current 2,500.", "The provincial nominee program deals with fast-tracking economic applicants. This is a step in the right direction, but we need to clarify something. The problem currently with PNP isn’t just the number of spots that Ontario has allocated—and I’ve alluded to this earlier in my address; it’s that this current government is doing a poor job of making sure that the 2,500 spots are allocated to fit our economic needs. They’re not doing a great job to ensure we’re a thriving, prosperous province so that those people have the ability to find good, prosperous jobs and remain here in Ontario.", "In other words, this government is doing a bad job of keeping the PNP applicants after a few years. People come; they’re allowed and welcomed into Ontario, but at the end of the day, particularly in the last number of years, with the way things have gone economically, with the poor decisions and the waste that we see in our government, the debt and deficit that continues to climb, people are making choices to say, “You know what? Ontario isn’t the land of prosperity,” as other provinces may be compared. So they are leaving. They’re going west. They’re going to other provinces, and there are a number of reasons for that.", "High taxes are certainly some of those—the overall cost of living in Ontario. They make other provinces that much more attractive. In this House, we’ve talked continually about the highest cost of energy in the country. In fact, in North America as a jurisdiction we’ve got the highest energy rates, and those are projected to climb three to four times again in the next four years. How enterprising is that for a family, particularly if they have to come and work in an occupation that may not be of their professional designation, where they may not be making the level of income that they were accustomed to or able to if they were in some of those professional occupations? It becomes very daunting for a family to say, “Do I stay here? Do I try to make a go of it or do I go somewhere like the west where things are more attractive, the rates are lower, in many cases, and the cost of living is lower?” And certainly, the oil sands were booming; they’re slowing down a little bit, but there’s still an awful lot of opportunity out there.", "We want to ensure that Ontario, at the end of the day, doesn’t continue to lag behind other provinces. We need to turn around some of our policy and thought processes. Certainly on this side of the House, it’s part of our job as the official opposition to be critical where critical is warranted. Sadly, there’s a lot of that; I could probably spend half the day talking about that. But we won’t go there. I’m not going to get off track today. I’m going to stick to the topic at hand. I’m going to talk about our immigration policies.", "I just want to reinforce that again, a lot of people—we have the 2,500 quantity who are allotted to come to Ontario. The question is, can we retain them? At this point, I would challenge the government to ask if 2,500 a year are definitely staying in Ontario because we are the province that they purport us to be.", "Our allocation of the provincial nominee program spaces should be higher, but before that happens, this government needs to prove that it can make effective use of the 2,500 spots it has now—make it a province where people want to say, “You know what? I’m not leaving here no matter what, because this is absolutely the best province.”", "If we can bring some of that administrative burden down, if we can bring some of our taxes down, if we, certainly, can bring energy rates down and stop demolishing, if you will, a lot of our industries—we’ve had 350,000 manufacturing jobs leave our province. They’ve decimated the horse racing industry. We’ve had fiascos like the gas plants, where we wasted a billion dollars. Those things can’t continue if we’re going to continue to attract the brightest and best immigrants, whom we want to come to our province.", "This means, generally, that we need to improve the opportunities for new Canadians in Ontario. We need an environment that is creating jobs and improving foreign credential recognition for internationally trained professionals.", "I support the idea of having a provincial registry to match employers with select workers. That’s a good idea. We need to know that we need X, Y, Z of those. If there are people applying, those people should—and I think will—get priority because they’re going to be able to walk right in, find a job and start becoming productive members of our community, of our society. Not only is that good for us, that’s good for them coming in. Everyone wants to get up in the morning with a sense of purpose—that I belong and I’m making my fair contribution—particularly those who have made that huge, monumental decision, to say, “You know what? I’m coming to make this my home. This is going to become the home of my family for generations to come.”", "I understand this registry is mostly in response to the regulations being developed by the federal government and making Ontario compliant. I’m not really caring if that’s the case. If that’s what it is and that’s what propelled them to do it, I’m okay with that, and I applaud the federal government for putting an initiative into place that’s getting them to at least jump on the bandwagon and come up with this. This is also in line with recommendations from the Ontario Chamber of Commerce.", "Ontario’s unemployment rate remains significantly high. We need to ensure that we’re bringing in people with the skills and experience that we need to match the gaps that we currently have. There’s no sense bringing in volumes of people who already have skills and qualifications in areas where we don’t need them and leaving people out, who aren’t able to access our country and our province, with skills that we need to fill those gaps.", "The last statistic was that Ontario’s unemployment rate has been above the national average for some 80 months—that’s eight-zero months, Mr. Speaker—almost seven solid years of being above the national average. That can’t be a stat that anybody in this House can accept and be happy with. This is because of the hit on our manufacturing base, which is where some of our new Canadians, certainly a lot of people coming here, look for manufacturing opportunities—there are a lot of skills in the skilled trades—and where most of the pink slips were handed out: namely, Heinz in Leamington, which was the second-largest Heinz plant in the world; Kellogg’s plant; Caterpillar’s Electro-Motive in London; General Motors; Ford; Linamar in Guelph, Canada’s second-largest auto-parts maker, whose CEO herself declared, “Tens of thousands of shop-floor jobs are disappearing.”", "The reality is that all of these companies are still producing the product that they’re famous for; they’re just not doing it in Ontario anymore—a sad state of affairs. It’s sad that they’ve moved out of those communities and moved jobs to other places. Ontario is no longer the leading car-producing province it once was.", "Once upon a time in Ontario, back to the Davis years—", "Interjections." ],

  "text" : [ "Thank you, Mr. Speaker.", "Once upon a time in Ontario—and I can hearken back to the Bill Davis era—Ontario was booming; everything was moving forward. There were lots of jobs and very low unemployment. The province was doing exceedingly well. We had shipments worth $63 billion and production units of more than 2.5 million. Seven of the world’s largest vehicle manufacturers operated 14 plants in Ontario. Sadly, that’s no longer the case. Investors aren’t creating jobs in Ontario because of high energy rates, red tape and administration, the debt and deficit—and a government that is under four OPP investigations cannot be helping. It simply is something that has to be looked at in light of a company that wants to come here or a new family that wants to come here and ask, “Is that the province?” when you see the spectrum of what we have across Canada, with all of our great provinces. We need to be the leader, we need to be the best and we need to set the bar higher. Like newcomers, they’re looking to western provinces to set up shop, and they’re doing it because of lower tax rates, a lower cost of living, less administration and just the pure fact of where they’ll have more opportunity in the future.", "In my next few minutes, I’m going to talk about co-operation with our federal counterparts. Our aging populations combined with our low birth rate means we have to rely on steady immigration to fill the gap. Ontario has expressed that it wants more control over immigrant selection. Specifically, Ontario wants 70% of its immigrants to be economic class, as in the case of most other provinces.", "I’m pleased to see that the federal government has made extensive changes to Canada’s immigration system, including the Federal Skilled Worker Program, the provincial nominee program and their termination of the provincial-territorial temporary foreign worker agreements in June 2015.", "In January 2015, the federal government planned to introduce expression-of-interest immigration reforms to make the immigration system more responsive to labour market demands. This could increase the role of the province and employers in finding qualified immigrants to fill gaps in the labour market. The federal government is encouraging provinces to develop systems that will allow them to participate in the new expression-of-interest system.", "Ontario must still jointly share that responsibility with the federal government, whether or not this legislation passes, but I’m pleased to see that the federal government is pushing it. They’ve identified it and are leading that charge. Regardless of why the current Liberal government has chosen to jump on, I’m pleased to see that it is.", "A question that arises—and our caucus, under our critic, has not been able to get the details yet—is whether this proposal is revenue-neutral, as it establishes a government bureaucracy of inspectors and investigators. Yet again another program, another sound bite that sounds good, but is the devil in the details? As we’ve asked many times in this House of the government, in estimates committee, the supply motion debate just before that—a number of my colleagues asked questions about: How can you do this? Where are the facts? Where is the plan? What’s the accountability measure that you’re putting in place? This is one of those bills, again, that sounds good at the outset, but we need to understand: Will it be revenue-neutral? Is it going to cost us more than we can afford to implement it?", "This government has mismanaged, as I said earlier, immigration policy for a decade, when it could have been working with the federal government to ensure that Ontario’s economic needs were met by new Canadians. I’m not going to say that the government is only doing it because the federal government has forced their hand with the introduction of the 2015 expression-of-interest program, but it certainly looks that way, that it could be a component of why they finally stepped up.", "It’s a small nod in the right direction, Mr. Speaker. Ontario’s inability to manage the economy and create jobs is deterring immigrants and certainly companies from coming to Ontario, necessarily, as their first choice. They are making other choices. Some are coming here, as I’ve alluded to in my earlier remarks, and they are not remaining in Ontario all the time. They’re going to other provinces because of other economic opportunities that are there.", "I talked a little bit earlier about the Regulated Health Professions Act amendment. As I say, I like this piece of it. I like that the bill amends the Regulated Health Professions Act to allow for the creation of regulations that speed up the process. There’s no reason why we can’t be talking to people and ensuring that they understand that there is a path for it, how quickly we can get them through there, and we expedite, particularly if it’s merely qualifications.", "In some of my work as deputy health critic, we’ve heard that other provinces accept the professional designation and yet Ontario puts them through more hoops and loops. That isn’t to say that we will ever water down. We want the highest standards and the most stringent requirements. But I can’t fathom that any of the other provinces are going to be thinking any less about the health and safety of their residents. So if there’s something that four, five, six or seven other provinces have studied and said, “Yes, this meets it,” why does Ontario have to continually hold back, lag behind and keep these people out of our workforce? There are wait-lists in health care that could be addressed with some of these people being able to get through the system, and we want to ensure that we do that in the most timely and effective manner possible.", "We need to ensure that as we go forward, we get this bill to committee. We need to address the long-standing problem of ensuring that highly trained immigrants are able to work in their professional field when they move to Ontario. We only need to look to the statistics—30% of Ontarians are considered new Canadians and speak neither English nor French at home—to understand how important it is that we get this bill right.", "As I stated in my opening remarks, Mr. Speaker, I am extremely proud to be a Canadian. I’m extremely proud to be an Ontarian and a Canadian in one of the most inviting cultural mosaics in the world. We are the best country in the world. We are open. We are inclusive. I’m proud that we’re a province and a country that ensures that we allow others to come and make this their home, our home, and we collaborate together to ensure that that cultural mosaic is always there. I’ll always fly the Canadian flag, as all Canadians will." ],

I think that the member from Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound had it right in terms of his focus in his remarks on labour market opportunities for newcomers when they arrive in our province. On Friday in London, I had the honour of attending the release of a labour market needs assessment that was conducted by the African Canadian Federation of London and Area. It looked at issues around the labour market integration of immigrants from African countries into London. One of the really troubling statistics they reported was that the unemployment rate among African Canadians in London is about 35%. That’s five times higher than the overall unemployment rate. This is an incredible loss of talent, skills and credentials that these newcomers are bringing into our community.", "The other thing that the member for Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound did not address, and that I think is important to keep in mind as we talk about International Women’s Day, is the disproportionate impact of the immigration process on women. When we looked at the statistics that were presented on Friday, African women had even higher unemployment rates than men in our community—40% unemployment—and African women were more likely to say they felt disconnected and excluded from their community.

Number one, on the boardwalk in the Beach, there were signs: “No Jews nor dogs.” That was at the Beach. That’s my father’s Canada and the Toronto in which he grew up. In my father’s Canada and the Toronto in which he grew up, as a semi-pro boxer and an Italian, he could walk in the back door of the Granite Club but he was not allowed in the front door.", "My father, as a Roman Catholic immigrant, witnessed the birth of the United Church of Canada—of which I am a clergy member—in 1925. The bright side: It was a uniting church that was brought into being by an order of the government of Canada—if we could imagine such a thing. The shadow side of that was that one of the reasons all the Protestant churches were uniting was to fight back against the Roman Catholic immigration that was happening from southern Europe. He experienced that first-hand.", "He also remembers the Christie Pits race riots in Toronto.", "He also remembers a time when we turned away boatloads of Jewish immigrants fleeing from the impending Holocaust in Europe. We turned them away and we sent them back to certain death.", "He also reminds me—and reminded me back then—of apartheid itself. That was, by the way, invented in Canada and exported to South Africa. They copied our system of reserves in South Africa.", "So that’s the backdrop. Whenever we speak about immigration and whenever we speak about racism in this House, I think we have to do a little mea culpa first before we continue on because that’s also the backdrop in which we speak.", "Sadly to say, as we look at what’s happening federally, we seem to be reverting a little bit back. I’m going to quote from an article that I think makes some very salient points about what is happening federally, because, after all, immigration mainly and mostly is a federal matter:", "“Today, there are over 480,000 people entering the country as temporary workers,” and these temporary workers don’t have access to the most basic benefits. “Migrant workers can now legally be paid 5% to 15% below the average wage.", "“At the same time, there are over 500,000 undocumented people without access to good jobs, health care, education, child care, housing, shelter, justice or dignity, living in Canada, most of them in the greater Toronto area.”", "I want to talk about one such family. I’m not going to mention their names, because they’re still on the run. They lived in sanctuary in one of the United churches in my riding, and they lived in hiding. Why did they live in hiding and in sanctuary? Thank goodness for the goodness of strangers. Because the Harper government was about to deport them. Why was the Harper government going to deport them? Because they were Roma, Mr. Speaker.", "One of the biggest groups that has come into south Parkdale in the last little while has been Roma immigrants. They are escaping some of the most repressive and racist laws in Europe, in the countries from which they come: Hungary, Czechoslovakia and others that have anti-Roma laws on the books. That’s what they’re escaping from. They escaped to a place they thought was going to be safe, that they thought was going to welcome them as refugees, with good refugee causes. Such was not to be the case.", "This was after we had spent almost a million dollars in my riding, recruiting those who spoke Hungarian, translators for the children at schools.", "As Harper began to deport the Roma from my riding, some 200 students from one school alone—now, think about what that means. Think about what that means, to have a place that you think is safe. You’re a child with your family, and one day you’re uprooted from school; you’re uprooted from everything you know. You’re on the run. You’re either in hiding or you’re living in a basement somewhere. You’re trying desperately not to have the immigration forces find you and deport you. That was after being welcomed in.", "That’s what happened to Roma in my neighbourhood. We lost some 200 students from one school alone. We lost teachers as a result. It totally was disruptive. For the first time, it gave folk in my neighbourhood a really lived historical experience of what it must have been like to be, say, in Germany in the 1930s or 1920s, where your neighbours just disappear and you don’t know where they’ve gone. You don’t know what has happened to them. You can’t say goodbye. They’re just missing in action, and there is no way to find them and there is no way to contact them to even find out if they’re okay.", "That’s what immigration looks like right now in Canada. That’s what it looks like right now. It’s not a pretty picture.", "The family reunification program, under the current federal government, has been modified to actually deter reunification. Currently, there is a complete moratorium on parents and grandparents getting a visa. Again, this is a dramatic change in Canada in immigration. This is a dramatic change, from what we’ve been used to, as a welcoming country, to this.", "Refugee acceptance rates have been cut each year, and halved in the last two decades alone. As of November 1, 2012, 68% of refugee applicants had been denied in the fiscal year 2012—68% of refugee applicants had been denied. So those are the stories, like the Roma stories from my riding.", "For years, immigrant rights groups have called for the establishment of a refugee appeal division, as one was created by the Liberals but in fact never, ever implemented.", "We have another galling example. Maybe we’ve forgotten this, but I’m going to remind us of it. In August 2010, nearly 500 refugee claimants arrived on the MV Sun Sea off the coast of British Columbia. Instead of allowing them access to the refugee determination process, they were jailed. Families were broken apart, and children seized by the Ministry of Family and Child Services. I mean, this is a vindictiveness; this is the arbitrariness of the refugee process at the federal level.", "The latest attack, by the way, is Bill C-31, which gives the minister the power to single out for special punishment refugees who are suspected of having fled their country by means of smugglers. Mr. Speaker, it’s not the refugees’ fault—it’s the smugglers’ fault—yet the refugees are the ones that are being targeted.", "You heard from the member from London West about the dire circumstances of those who are lucky enough to actually be settled here, to actually get jobs here. Migrants of colour, we know, earn 40% less than their white counterparts. In Toronto, the number of immigrants who are poor has grown by 125% over the past 20 years alone, and almost 60% of poor families are from racialized groups.", "Another instance we remember since I’ve been elected: In December 2009, four migrant workers fell to their deaths in Toronto while working in unsafe conditions. In September 2010, two migrant workers died while working at an apple processing facility.", "Remember, migrant workers are not allowed to bring their families. They’re forced to be alienated. They’re completely alone and completely at risk.", "If we think those immigration raids are something that we see just south of the border—not so, Mr. Speaker. We see them right here; we see them in the GTA. They happen all the time.", "I was sitting in Dufferin Mall one day and I saw a sweep. It was like something out of a movie. People came; we didn’t know who they were. It’s a place where many Portuguese gentlemen sit and have coffee and just hang out in the food mall at the Dufferin court. It’s in the middle of a very Portuguese neighbourhood. All of a sudden, strange people came. They weren’t necessarily in uniform. They were harassing these men. Nobody knew what it was about. They were asking for ID.", "That’s what a sweep looks like. It’s scary; it’s terrifying. It’s not just men; it’s women and it’s children too. This is happening, and it’s happening in our city and in our country right now. Do we have an issue? Yes, we have an issue, a real issue, with not only our image in the world vis-à-vis refugees and immigrants but the reality of that lived experience here.", "Let me tell you, the provincial government isn’t immune to the problems. One of the issues I’ve been raising since I was elected is the fact that we force newcomers to wait three months to be covered by OHIP. As far as I know, we’re the only province that does that. This is not only not compassionate; this is downright foolhardy and dangerous. We live in an era of Ebola. Imagine forcing newcomers to stay away from our hospitals, stay away from our doctors, and not give them coverage. This is ridiculous.", "In fact, meeting with the Canadian Federation of Students—as I know many of us are today—they pointed out that it’s even worse for international students. International students not only don’t have newcomer coverage, as all newcomers don’t, but they also have to pay if they’re going to have coverage at all at any point, even if they’re here for years and years. They pay through private insurance. Again, is that compassionate? It’s not the case elsewhere in Canada. It is the case here in Ontario. Why do we do that?", "Why do we charge them tuition when they create jobs? These are the same international students that tend to stay, graduate and work here, yet we’re charging them billions more for tuition.", "We’re also forcing them to get private insurance. I thought that public insurance was something that the greatest Canadian, Tommy Douglas, fought for, and I thought that all Canadians were very proud of our public health insurance. Not so for international students, who are forced to go private. That’s something we should be extremely ashamed of.", "There are other instances, and I know that others have spoken about the lack of employment opportunity, the lack of being able to get into your chosen profession, as an immigrant.", "Again, a story from my riding: this incredible gentleman, who’s a surgeon who came from Iran and very much wanted to live here. He certainly wanted his children raised here. He moved his entire family here and was working as a baker. He was working as a baker, at just slightly over minimum wage, when he was a qualified surgeon in Iran.", "He was told it would take him at least 10 years to qualify—he was already in his 40s—10 years to qualify. Of course, the qualification process was expensive. He couldn’t work to support his family and also go through the qualification process and afford it, or have the time to do it, quite frankly. He was completely misled, and there he landed, in my riding, with his family.", "We tried everything. We tried to talk to the governing bodies, with no luck. Do you know what he does now? Do you know what he does now in the province of Ontario, where we are in desperate need of doctors? What he does now is travel back to Iran for six months of the year and works, and then he travels back here to be with his family for six months of the year. That’s what we’re forcing him to do when we need doctors. Most people don’t have a GP, and yet we’re forcing this very qualified immigrant to do that.", "To the bill: Is it a step in the right direction? Yes, it is. My goodness, though, I’ve been here—I’m in my ninth year. For 10 years we’ve been waiting for something—10 years we’ve been waiting for something. For 10 years we’ve been waiting for the government to do anything on this file. Certainly, we should have a voice. My goodness, there are over 13 million people in Ontario. We are the centre for much of Canada’s immigration, and yet this government has been silent on this file until now.", "There are still some problems even with this. Recognizing that the federal government is really where immigration tends to happen, that still remains paramount. And there’s nothing that guarantees the federal government will even go along with this legislation. Again, it doesn’t address the long-standing problems of ensuring that highly trained immigrants are able to work in their professional fields.", "It certainly doesn’t say anything about the dire poverty into which many newcomers come. It doesn’t say anything about housing. It doesn’t say anything about the settlement services we have in our communities, which, by the way, never get stable funding. I know we’re very aware of this problem with settlement services in our communities, some of which do get provincial funding—it’s not all federal funding. They have to reapply and reapply and look for little loopholes and caches of money here and there because they’re not the recipients of stable funding.", "Why can we not grant stable funding, not just in the area of immigration and refugees, of course, but for all our social services? Certainly, where immigrants are concerned, it’s a huge concern. Of course, this doesn’t talk at all about non-economic-class immigrants. Again, whom do I see in my riding? I see a great many of them.", "To get back to where we started, we come from a country that is really just one generation away from incredibly repressive—one might say racist—laws about immigrants. We’re just one generation away from that. I’m the one generation away from that. We see a federal government that is reverting to the past in terms of their repressive measures around immigration. Let’s face it: We are not the friendly, welcoming country we once were. We’re not. We haven’t been since Harper has been in power. And by the way, the Liberals before him didn’t do that much either. But things are getting worse federally.", "Finally, 10 years later, the Liberal government in Ontario decides to make a small step, and that’s Bill 49. It is a good step, but it’s a small step, and it neglects many of the issues that we’ve raised, many of the issues that affect the people in my community. The surgeon who is still going back to Iran to work six months of the year, the Roma family that is in hiding—it doesn’t help them; it doesn’t help either of them. It doesn’t help the newcomers who come, possibly with diseases we don’t know about, because they’re kept out of our health care system for three months. Why is that? It’s not only not compassionate, as I’ve said; it’s downright dangerous. It’s dangerous. Because they don’t have the money to pay for the services, they’re out of the loop.", "The labour standards: Are we really looking at what our temporary workers or our migrant workers are living through and getting? I’ve had many come into our office—I’m sure many of us in the downtown core have had these stories—where they’re not being paid minimum wage, and where the labour standards are not being upheld. Why? Because they’re frightened that if they speak up about an employer who is abusing them, they’ll get deported—they’ll be sent back—or they won’t be able to get their spouse over. Something will happen.", "This is not a happy situation, this is not a healthy one and this is not, I would argue, in the spirit of the Canada we like to present to the world. It’s not a compassionate one.", "As long as those stories exist right now in my community, I’d say that this bill, although it takes a small step, doesn’t solve the problem. It doesn’t begin to address the problems.", "I look forward to amendments. I look forward, for example, to extending OHIP coverage to newcomers; that’s the very least we could do. I look forward to the situation of international students being addressed, who have to get private insurance to be able to stay and who pay exorbitant tuition fees, where our universities and colleges are really balancing their budgets on their backs—of course, on the backs of those workers out on strike as well, but certainly on international students.", "I look forward to a real conversation on the way that we vet the qualifications for international immigrants who come here with qualifications and can’t work anywhere close to their fields. I look forward to all of that. Unfortunately, I don’t see all of that in this bill. Let’s hope they make it stronger, with lots of amendments." ],

I know that the member remembers or recalls that in late 2012 the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration launched New Direction: Ontario’s Immigration Strategy. This legislation, Bill 49, clearly supports very much the implementation of that strategy. The member outlined a number of priorities, and certainly they are for us as well, with recognition of the changes that are being made in terms of federal immigration policies and programs, and they are substantial and having, obviously, an impact. Again, I think that makes it all the more important that we have brought forward Bill 49. I think our previous bill was Bill 161, so this will indeed respond to that.", "There obviously are so many key issues that in a two-minuter one can’t get into, other than, certainly, having a vision and objectives for immigration in Ontario. We’re recognizing the long history of immigration to Ontario and the extraordinary economic, social and cultural value of immigration to all of us.", "Again, may I say that one recognizes how important it has been to the entire development of our province, but again, from someone who comes from northern Ontario, who watched the building and the history of our community being developed on the backs of so many immigrants, I can only say that we recognize how important this piece of legislation is and seek the support of all members of the House." ],

For the last number of years, there has been a consistent loss of young adults aged 20 to 29, mainly because of outward migration to either the western provinces or even the US because of the economy and because of opportunities in the oil and gas industry.", "Now, some of those people, unfortunately, because of no fault of their own, could be returning home, but of course the local economy is suffering too. It could be better. I know that we’re maybe in better shape in Sarnia–Lambton than others. But because of our connection to the oil and gas industry, that’s why many young adults have left there.", "Also, overall, Lambton county has a lower proportion of recent immigrants compared to the province, and visible minorities only represent 2.7% of our local population. However, that 2.7% is very important to that local population. Over the years, they’ve contributed, starting way back in the 1940s—I’ll talk about that more in my full remarks—when they built Polysar, which was because of the war effort, replacing the rubber plants in Manila.", "Anyway, Mr. Speaker, we will be supporting this legislation when it comes to the floor for a vote, but we want to see it go to committee and be improved with many improvements and amendments." ],

We had a say in the selection of 500 to nominate to become future Ontarians, and then 1,000.", "In 2012, as the Minister of Northern Development mentioned, we came up with a strategy that we went up to 5,000 in terms of selections for immigration. When you look at a province as big as Ontario—we welcome around 100,000 immigrants every year—5,000 is still a small number. This piece of legislation, if passed, will give us the tools to have a bigger say when it comes to what types of immigrants we’re looking for in Ontario. We welcome all, but when you look at the economic immigrant percentage compared to the national average, we’re way below the average. I think that’s why we need a bigger say when it comes to immigration selection.", "I just want to focus on one fine point I heard the member from Parkdale–High Park mention, and that is the international student portion.

Just a couple of issues: One of the things I didn’t have a chance to say, especially in light of International Women’s Day, is that of course there is a gender lens on this, because the ones who suffer most are the women who are newcomers to this country and new immigrants. One of the ways in which they suffer most is the very fact that Ontario will not extend OHIP coverage to newcomers for three months. That means that if a woman is trying to escape sexual violence, or trying to escape domestic assault, there is not that interface. She’s not covered by OHIP—not to mention the communicable diseases that we should be concerned about. It’s a danger to everyone. But on the file of wanting to do something about domestic violence and sexual assault, we fall flat when it comes to immigrant women and racialized women. So there’s that.", "The member from Trinity–Spadina talked about international students. Yes, we need them. So why don’t we treat them well? Why don’t we look at the amount of tuition we charge them and why don’t we also look at extending OHIP to them? Because they don’t ever get it. They don’t have to wait for three months; they have to wait forever. They have privatized health insurance. We, sir, Mr. Speaker, are a country that believes in public health insurance. That’s what makes us Canadian, in large part. Why do we not extend that to our international students? If we truly welcomed them, then maybe more of them would come here and more of them would stay here.", "All in all, what can Ontario do? I decry the Harper government and what they’ve done. They’ve moved us back on the immigration and refugee file. There’s no question that what they’re doing is shameful. But what the Ontario government could do is to make larger steps forward. Yes, talk to the Harper government and tell them they’re shameful. Yes, do more to combat the poverty and housing files and necessities for new immigrants.

  "text" : [ "It’s a pleasure to rise in the House this afternoon to speak to Bill 49, the Ontario Immigration Act. There’s a very long history of immigration to this province. As others have said, with the exception of those who are First Nations, everybody in this House is an immigrant or a son or a daughter of immigrants or a grandson, granddaughter and so on.", "Immigration to this province has brought great economic, social and cultural value over the generations. In fact, Ontario is the most multicultural province in this country. More than half of all new immigrants make this province their home.", "Ontario has a very strong reputation as being a land of opportunity. It’s a prosperous democratic society built by the hard work of generations of immigrants. I have to relate that to my own family. My parents immigrated to Canada from Poland. They immigrated to Quebec. They settled in Montreal. My father was an engineer. After a few years of working in Quebec, there were not the opportunities for professional accreditation back then in the 1960s in the province of Quebec that there were in Ontario. So he and my mother moved to Toronto, where he was able to fairly quickly have his engineering credentials from Poland accredited and become a professional engineer here in the province of Ontario.", "That speaks very well to the approach that this province has always taken of welcoming immigrants and giving them the opportunities that they so rightly deserve to try to make the most of their skills and their abilities.", "This legislation is a very necessary first step to Ontario being able to chart our own course when it comes to attracting more skilled immigrants to drive our economy and keep Ontario strong. If passed, it will put the necessary tools in place to help Ontario welcome the skilled immigrants it needs to meet future labour demands as well as improve compliance and enforcement measures and increase the transparency and information sharing to improve immigrant selection. These measures will lay a foundation for Ontario to operate a larger and more robust immigration program now and in the future.", "On the subject of accountability, I’d like to speak to how this bill continues to reinforce the government’s commitment to transparency and accountability.", "This bill ushers in changes that will greatly improve the decision-making mechanisms when it comes to the provincial nominee program. The provincial nominee program is an immigration program through which Ontario nominates individuals and their families for permanent resident status based on a pre-approved job offer from an employer in this province. The bill proposes to remove the existing ability to waive eligibility criteria for this program, thereby making it more equitable and fair for all applicants.", "Often, people wonder why Ontario is engaging in this. Surely, immigration is just under federal jurisdiction. But this bill shows how provincial action on immigration can be very relevant, even though it’s really part of a federal responsibility. Immigration is a shared responsibility, and the provinces have an important role to play. That’s especially true, because this is the number one destination for newcomers in Canada. Our government believes that a strong partnership between Ottawa and the province is a key to the successful integration of newcomers into our communities and our workforce.", "Immigration is inextricable from the economic strength of this province, and the 2013 budget affirmed that Ontario’s Immigration Strategy will respond to the province’s demographic and economic realities, and the province will be proactive in attracting the best and the brightest in the world to Ontario and helping immigrants and their families to settle and prosper.", "That’s exactly what we are doing with this bill: We’re being proactive on immigration. The types of opportunities that were afforded to my parents’ generation, when they came to this province, will continue to be afforded to future immigrants to Ontario.", "I’ll be sharing the balance of my time with the members from Scarborough Southwest, Beaches–East York and Sudbury." ],

Right now, most of it is done federally. Quebec does it differently. They can filter out, or decide which immigrants to Quebec should be allowed in. I think what we’re trying to do with this bill is copy that, but not as much as Quebec.", "I understand Quebec’s position, where they want mostly French-speaking people to come to their province. In Ontario, we want people to come to the province, and we want to be able to provide them with language training and other skills as well, so they can integrate faster into Canada and into Ontario. I think it’s a reasonable request. It makes a lot of sense. This bill, if passed, hopefully, will catch the attention of the federal government, and they’ll say, “You know what? Ontario is right. They should have more to say when it comes to immigration.”", "The other issue that I want to bring up, because I only have a few minutes to speak on this bill, is my own personal experience. As the member from Etobicoke–Lakeshore just said—my parents were also immigrants, but they weren’t from Poland; they were from Italy. My father came to Canada in 1953. He was 22 years old. He worked hard. After four years, he went and grabbed my mother, who was in Italy, because it was expensive for two people to live here at that time. He brought her to Canada, and eventually they would buy a house. They stayed here, and they had five children and raised a family.", "The beautiful thing about Canada, and the beautiful thing about Ontario, is that everyone has an opportunity to do well. I never felt that more than when I was called to the bar. When my parents came to this country, there were no restrictions. It wasn’t, “You know what? You’ve got to go up north and work on the farm or work in the lumber yards and cut down trees” or something of that nature—or become a miner. My dad was able to choose what he wanted, and I was able to go to law school and graduate and become a lawyer here in Ontario, as well as becoming first a city councillor and then a member of Parliament. There were no restrictions, which is the beautiful thing about Canada: Everyone has the opportunity." ],

I’m now into my 27th year as an elected official: 15 at the city and almost 12 here at the province. There are no barriers saying that a person who comes from a certain country can’t do things. But it would have been helpful if my mother and father had language training.", "My dad learned English while he worked at a lumberyard, talking to some employees who spoke English. My mother—it’s kind of a funny story—stayed at home to watch the kids, and she always said to me, “I learned English by watching I Love Lucy shows.” I guess that’s the way she learned, as others do too. The other one was the Three Stooges. I don’t mean to crack a joke here, but she was probably the only female I know who liked the Three Stooges. She would watch them and get a good laugh, and she learned to speak English.", "So, every opportunity is here. What Ontario is trying to do is make sure they can help out too in the program so that everyone can learn and become an immigrant in this country, and especially in this province, who can contribute to the country the way I have the opportunity today and the way my father did, working in a lumberyard for 35 years, and how my mother did, to be able to raise five children. She kept a good eye on all of us and made sure that all of us were well educated and able to leave the nest at home and move on with our lives being perfectly skilled or perfectly prepared to face the challenges of the outside world.", "My time is limited. I could speak for hours on this. I think that Bill 49 is really important. If Quebec can do it, I think Ontario should have the same right at the end of the day." ],

  "text" : [ "I too am delighted to follow my colleague from Scarborough Southwest, whose riding is directly east of mine, Beaches–East York, to speak to this bill, Bill 49, An Act with respect to immigration to Ontario and a related amendment to the Regulated Health Professions Act.", "How appropriate it is that this bill has been brought forward by the Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and International Trade, himself a new Canadian who came to Canada and established himself and established roots in our country as a country of choice, where he now has an opportunity to go forward on a revised immigration strategy for Ontario under his leadership and tutelage. I would like to thank the member profoundly for his work in this regard.", "I too am the child of an immigrant. My mother came here in the mid-1930s from Brighton, England, settled with her family and met my father, who was actually originally from Saskatchewan. But his father was from Edinburgh—so some Scottish heritage—through Cornell University, where he studied agriculture. He was a professor of dairy husbandry, which I may have mentioned before.", "He came to this country and settled in Saskatchewan, because that way he could be close to the sweetheart he had met and married, who lived in Montreal. I used to say that my grandfather knew much more about agriculture than he ever did about geography, because he settled so far away from her. But they had an opportunity to come here and make lives for themselves.", "Now, having come from Great Britain, I appreciate that the challenges they faced coming to this country weren’t nearly those we see with so many others who come to Canada nowadays. In my own riding of Beaches–East York, I’m delighted to say that we have a very vibrant multicultural community. I have a number of community organizations in Beaches–East York, like WoodGreen Community Services, Bengali Information and Employment Services, Bangladeshi-Canadian Community Services, Bangladesh Centre and Community Services and Neighbourhood Link, which provide invaluable assistance to new Canadians as they come to Canada and become Canadian citizens, to help them integrate, to help them with employment, to help them with housing and help them with all the important social measures they need so they can fully integrate into our society.", "If you were listening closely, you would have noticed that three of those organizations are of Bengali origin. That’s no secret in my neighbourhood, because in Beaches–East York, particularly in the northern part of the riding, Bangla is the second most widely spoken language, right after English, of course. About 58% of the residents in the last census indicate that English was their mother tongue, whereas the Bangladeshis, about 7%, speak Bangla as a first language.", "What we’ve seen as a result of that is an incredible richness in that community, as being the highest concentrations of Bengalis in Canada. I have had the chance, and so many opportunities, to integrate with them in a number of adventures, not the least of which was that we celebrated just yesterday at the East York Community Centre, as they unveiled a new design for a monument for International Mother Language Day. This is a program that they’ve been initiating over the last five or six years with strong community support.", "They were able to reveal the winner of the design, Mr. Monir Hossain, with his colleague Apurbo Bhoumik. What was incredible about this design is how it so closely resembles the monument in Dhaka with a great Canadian spin, because this is a monument that will represent all Canadians and their mother languages. Mr. Hossain, it is interesting to note, was the very first person in Bangladesh, before he came to this country, who could use computer-automated design software: AutoCAD. He self-taught himself AutoCAD back in Bangladesh, and then was able to immigrate to Canada and was able to get work in Canada in this new, emerging world of AutoCAD.", "I was delighted to be able to meet with him and see this exciting, exciting design that he’d been able to put forward, and what an honour, as he spoke at great length about the great honour that he, as a new Canadian, having chosen Canada, has been benefiting from the opportunities we’ve provided in a multicultural world.", "It’s no secret, and in her previous statement the member from the opposite side talked about some of the difficulties new immigrants and refugees may be having in Canada nowadays under the current administration. Because so many of the people we’re speaking of now came here under rules that were introduced through the 1960s and 1970s and benefited from the great work done by Pierre Elliott Trudeau and the Liberal government of the day. We’re hoping to see more of that. This bill will give us an opportunity to set a framework of discussion with our federal counterparts, and we look forward to seeing its speedy passage so that we can get on with this important business." ],

I would like to focus my presentation today on the work that this government is doing to help newcomers find jobs that match their skills and experience, and on how our proposed bill will strengthen these efforts. This is something I hear about in my community almost on a weekly basis, when I visit facilities like the Sudbury multicultural society and other organizations that are working to try to ensure that they can find this work, those types of jobs, for immigrants that match their skills and expertise.", "Now, if we are to achieve our immigration goals in this province, we need to improve foreign qualification recognition for internationally trained professionals. Further to that, Mr. Speaker, we must strengthen the settlement and integration programs that we have in place to help immigrants succeed.", "Ontario’s immigration strategy clearly articulates the need to strengthen these programs as a means to growing an economy that is globally connected. For example, our Ontario bridge training program helps thousands of immigrants each year to get licensed and find work in their fields by providing training and valuable connections to their sectors. Just last year, Mr. Speaker, our government committed $63 million over three years to support Ontario bridge training because we know how vitally important it is.", "One of our goals is to get highly skilled immigrants out of what we call “survival jobs” and into the workforce at their full potential: get them out of the cab and back into the lab, as we say. So Bill 49, if passed, would align requirements in the Regulated Health Professions Act with those in the Fair Access to Regulated Professions and Compulsory Trades Act, Ontario’s landmark legislation that continues to address the recognition of foreign credentials. This means that registration practices must be transparent and objective, and that decisions must be made in a timely manner.", "These proposed changes underscore our commitment to increasing the number of immigrants licensed in their professions. We want to increase the percentage of internationally trained professionals who get licensed in this province. Like I said, the faster we can get people working at their full potential, the greater the benefit to Ontario.", "Ontario’s labour market is diverse. Changes are happening in local economies that are making us think about the way that Ontario looked yesterday, what it looks like today, and how it will look in the future. What we know for sure is that Ontario needs skilled people to take us forward. By passing this piece of proposed legislation we will be more attractive to the skilled immigrants that we need in the future and we will strengthen our ongoing efforts to make sure skilled immigrants can work in their areas of expertise.", "I can talk a lot about Sudbury and the great work that many of our small businesses are doing in our community when it comes to mining, specifically. What we need are more skilled immigrants who can come to our community and work in the mining profession. We see so many of our new immigrants coming and looking for this opportunity to be paired with this great job, and the jobs are out there. This government is working hard on creating those great jobs, and it’s working." ],

Just this January, January 2015, the Fairness Commissioner released a report. She really focused on the requirement for Canadian experience as a huge barrier for immigrants to enter the workforce, and called for all regulators to remove the Canadian experience requirement except in very rare circumstances. This repeats a call that had been made earlier by the Ontario Human Rights Commission. We know that this is a real barrier for newcomers to integrate into the labour market and that bridge training programs can ease that transition.", "Unfortunately, the funding that is provided for bridge training programs is not sustainable. These programs start up and they close down, and there’s little certainty for immigrants as to where these programs will be offered and when they will be offered. They’re also very, very expensive. It can cost up to $12,000 for tuition to participate in a bridge training program. So saying that these programs are available is not the solution to help immigrants integrate into the labour market.", "The Fairness Commissioner also called for sustainable funding for bridge training programs, which is something that we need desperately if we are going to really assist newcomers to integrate into the Ontario labour market." ],

Had you thought about what this Legislature looked like in the last term, you would have realized that, had there been more co-operation on the other side, so much of this work would have been accomplished earlier, faster, back then.

Some talk about forcing that unnecessary election, which of course I don’t quite see that way.", "But I would also like to talk about the comments from the member from London West, who talked about the bridge training programs, obviously a very, very important part of the Ontario immigration strategy and something that flew out of the previous work that this government was doing to try to enhance opportunities for new Canadians as they come here.", "I know in my own community of Beaches–East York, there are so many people in the Bengali community who are agricultural specialists.

We should be able to find a way to do this.", "This is where this government is heading with this bill.

Clearly, I think we know everyone is supporting this bill today. Anything to do with our immigrants and the success we’ve had in Ontario and in our beautiful country is mainly the result of the immigrants who came here.", "Of course, we’re all immigrants. We were all immigrants at some point, other than our First Nation brothers and sisters. And I want to get to that as well, because I think there’s an area where we have dramatically let down our First Nation brothers and sisters. As we brag about an immigration act, I think we’d actually better really remember some of the problems we’ve got with our very first First Nation brothers and sisters, who were here for thousands of years.", "I want to talk a little bit about Simcoe county. Simcoe county was established, I think, 18 years before the province of Ontario was formed.", "We look at the families that moved to Simcoe county, starting with John Graves Simcoe signing documents and working with First Nation organizations and First Nation peoples to actually allow people to come primarily from the British Isles—Irish, Scottish, English, some Welsh. Those are the original people who came in the late 1700s and 1800s. If you look in any of the history books written on the county of Simcoe, you’ll find names that are there today—Dunlop, for example. Our family is from Scotland. There’s actually a town in Scotland called the kirk of Dunlop; it’s just outside of Paisley. That’s where my dad’s family came from in the late 1700s. In fact, the one—I think his name was Daniel Dunlop—who came in that time frame is buried in the St. Lawrence Seaway area. When they created the seaway, they actually had to move graveyards to accommodate, so they would still be in existence.", "We look at all of the work these people did. If you go into some of these communities, you can see. We talk about agriculture today, and we look at the kind of equipment we have to work with: tractors and combines and plows. The guys who came here, the people who came to this country and took huge woodlots and had to take the timber down just to use the soil—it’s the same sort of work ethic that built our railroad.", "I was saying to my wife just the other day, “If there ever was one thing we really got right in our country, it was the railroads.” Really, when you think of the work that was put in with horses and some immigrants from other countries as well—but how the beds of those railways, right to this day, are staying solid and firm. The kind of backhoes they would have worked with in the 1860s, 1870s and 1880s would have been like miniature little toys compared to the kind of equipment you’d see working on any of these high-rise sites today. There was nothing to them. Yet they built it; they built it right. They didn’t have tons of consultants and engineers and architects. They went ahead and built that railroad right across this huge country, and they’re still running those trains today, only the trains are a lot larger and a lot bigger, and they are moving billions and billions of dollars a year in commerce.", "I’m getting a little off track here, but I’m talking about the people who came here looking for jobs.", "The same thing applied to our farms. If anybody knows the Mount St. Louis Moonstone ski resort—I think many of you have probably been there. It’s three minutes from my house. My dad’s farm, where my dad was raised, was at the top of that ski hill. What they did is, 30 years or so ago, Josl and Elfriede Huter bought that farm off my grandfather—", "Interjection." ],

If you look at those hills from Highway 400, if you’re going by, you’ll see the hills have been raised much higher, probably another 200 feet higher because of that. They took it out of that farm at the back. The original farmhouse and barn are still standing at the back of the property. You can see them if you’re up there skiing. I show my kids and my grandchildren all the time. When I go skiing up there, I show them.", "That’s where that family was raised. They picked rocks. They raised enough to get the crops ready. They barely survived, but you know what? They didn’t draw any kind of social assistance or anything. They worked hard and raised their families there. That’s the way all of that area was done around there.", "I just want to say a little bit more about that farm, Mr. Speaker. Because of all the environmental rules, what they’ve done with that hill is, they banked the sides of the hills with clay, and then they pump water up there from the springs. That’s the same water that makes snow. They’ve got literally hundreds of millions of gallons of water stored there for snow-making equipment. That’s the type of thing, the sort of innovative thoughts on one piece of property that has happened throughout the years. We’ve got those kind of examples all across our ridings.", "The same thing applies to other areas of Simcoe county. I look at Oro-Medonte, at Tosorontio, at Clearview, all those areas where there have been mega-farms put in over the years and all kinds of people have worked really, really hard. Most of them are from those British Isles descendants. Those are the people we see in Simcoe county.", "But more recently, of course, we’ve seen a lot of the Dutch community, particularly in the last 50, 60 years, people who came from Holland—I know that Ernie is not here right now, but I can tell you that the Dutch are incredible farmers. You just have to look at the Holland Marsh. If you look at the Dutch families around Simcoe county, you can almost tell they’re Dutch when you look at the farm from the road. They have the driveways lined with flower beds and gardens along the driveway into the barns. Everything is neat around the barns.", "I look at families like the den Haan family down in Tosorontio, who have now got a cheese factory on their site as well. I look at different families that I’ve met over the years. These are families who came here with nothing. They didn’t ask for anything. They slowly got little jobs and they bought a piece of property. They raised their families and now the families are successful and the families are buying more and more properties. We see that all the time.", "That’s what makes Canada great. When you see these types of people who came here looking for one chance, one opportunity, to do something that would make life better than what we they had in Europe, these are the real success stories.", "Come to the city here. What would we have done without the Portuguese and the Italians working with concrete? They have built the city. I mean, the underground work that’s been done here—miles and miles of pipe have been put in. All of those guys who came here looking for their first job working on construction sites were all people who said, “Look, it’s an opportunity here and I want my kids to do better.” In many, many cases, the kids have done much, much better. They’ve gone on and they’ve gotten good education and they’ve been able to buy properties. Some of them have gone into development industries. But the one thing is, they haven’t asked for anything. In most cases, they’ve worked really hard to get where they are.", "I look at some of my friends up in the Orillia area. I think of the Greek families. We have a lot of people in our area who are of Greek descent and who operate restaurants—fantastic restaurants. You see them build these restaurants or dining rooms or steakhouses, whatever they may be, and you just know it’s going to be a huge success. It’s not one of these ones where they’re in and out and gone out of business overnight. They are there and they work hard and they tend to create a lot of jobs in their communities as well.", "I can think of people like—I wrote some of their names down here—the Town and Country Steakhouse in Barrie. I know that Ann over there has probably been at the Town and Country a number of times. I’m a Town and Country fan—a Greek family.", "There’s Theo’s Eatery in Orillia and the Bayside restaurant at the curling club in Orillia. Tops in Pizza: This guy, Jimmy Marinakos, every year at Christmas for 25 years, has opened up his business. All day long on Christmas Day, whoever wants a pizza in Orillia can go down and get a pizza made by Jimmy and that’s his Christmas gift to his community. The guy works his heart out all the time. That’s the kind of people we’ve brought. I like to brag about these kinds of people because I think it’s important that they are acknowledged because they are immigrants. Again, they came here with nothing and they’ve made success stories of themselves. They bought nice houses and their kids are doing well. It’s always nice to hear that.", "I’ve been doing a lot of work in skilled trades and apprenticeship reform, and I’m now the critic for education and training, colleges and universities. I’ve had quite a few chances to tour a lot of the facilities. I’d like to actually mention some people I’ve met as well. I’m thinking of a gentleman in Sudbury. I don’t know if anybody knows this gentleman, Milad Mansour of Milman developments. He came here from Lebanon. He came to Toronto and couldn’t find work in Toronto, so he went further north. He went to Sudbury. Milad, I believe now, has around 1,200 employees and a number of companies in the Sudbury area. It’s just a huge success story. If you go up to Sudbury and you ever get a chance to tour any of his companies—he does a lot of work in the mining industry and in the rail industry. He’s just a great person. I think he’s probably in his mid-seventies right now but still is a dynamic guy.", "Here’s a guy who came from Lebanon. When I first talked to him, I said, “I can’t believe you came from Lebanon to Sudbury.” He said, “Yes, but I made a great career out of it, and it’s been a wonderful time.”", "A couple of things: I wanted to go back to the member from High Park—" ],

  "text" : [ "—Parkdale–High Park. You made a couple of really good points that I picked up on today as well with the students when I met with them. These are the international students that we have here. Today, most of the colleges and universities are counting on international students because they pay more money. They pay the full shot. They’re paying more money to come to colleges and universities all across the province. We’re starting to get a bit of declining enrolment in the college and university system, so they’re in demand. But you know what? I could not believe it. They don’t get the same kind of health care.", "If a college student gets appendicitis or something like that, or they get sick, they have no insurance. I’ll tell you, that’s something that’s got to be changed. Very few of the kids do get sick when they’re at that age, but let’s face it: There should be something in our system that would allow them to actually—because they’re paying top buck here. They’re paying top dollar to the colleges and universities. There should be a better system for those students so they can be treated without going into debt even further, because they’re paying thousands and thousands of dollars more to come here than the students who are here.", "I think it’s important that we zero in on some of these things and listen to what these kids are saying. I’ve had this a number of times as I’ve toured some colleges and universities. Different international students have actually asked me about that. When the student union came today and said, “This is a problem we’ve got,” I think it’s something that the government should accommodate in the budget, when the budget comes up, because if we’re talking about a bill like Bill 49, there have got to be things that support it, and some of the things that should support it are things in the budget that we bring up in the House. We’re still going to vote for this bill no matter what happens, but the reality is that we want to make sure that these little things we bring up in the House are somewhat addressed.", "That brings me to another thing that’s happening in my riding this summer, and that’s our Franco-Ontarian friends. This is the 400th anniversary of European presence in Ontario this year. In the town of Penetanguishene, we’re having a huge event. It will probably be the signature event in Ontario for the celebration of 400 years since Champlain came here. I think the first mass west of Lower Canada was in Toanché on August 12, 1615, and there were natives and Franco-Ontarians, Francos, at that particular event. We’re celebrating that in a big way this year. They are, of course, our first European settlers to come to Canada, other than our First Nation brothers and sisters.", "I don’t want to spend a lot of time on that, but I know there has been a lot of effort put on the Franco-Ontarian—I do thank Minister Meilleur. I’ve been working with her for four or five years on this, and she has been very supportive of the 400th anniversary of Champlain. We hope other communities will celebrate it as well. Even here on September 25, you have Franco-Ontarian Day, and there will be celebrations around that time. I think there are some real opportunities for the government and all of us to capitalize on this anniversary.", "That takes me a little bit more into my final couple of comments, one being that the students who come from around the world to our universities and colleges—and I’ve said it a number of times, but I was just amazed when I toured Collège Boréal at 1 Yonge Street. It’s right down on the water by Captain John’s fish and chips place, that big boat that’s down there. Collège Boréal has about 250 students there.", "Most of the students are international. Most of the students who are there in Collège Boréal are francophone students, francophiles from somewhere in the world. Many of them are coloured people, many from different African countries. They all have French as their prime language, and they do take English courses there as well.", "But there are some real opportunities for the government, and for all of us, capitalizing on some of these different individuals that come here. A lot of them will be going back home with the diplomas that are required but what I’m hearing from the administration there is that they could use more programming. I think that if we could pass anything on to the ministry or to the government—and particularly in Franco-Ontarian colleges, I think there are some real opportunities for more training.", "That training can be used to help other countries in mining, for example. Boréal does a lot in mining in northern Ontario. There are some opportunities, because they’re teaching people the mining industry, and they go back and create jobs in their country—in Sierra Leone or some of the French-speaking countries in Africa. It’s just amazing how small the world really is.", "That mining then turns into job creation for people who are creating mining products here in Canada, or wherever it may be in the world. It’s really working out positively.", "I think we should capitalize on some of our ethnic groups that are coming here just for an education, as international students, and yet they’re taking back valuable information to help develop other countries, and we can capitalize on the sale of products to those other countries as well. That’s one of the things I wanted to say as well.", "Finally, my last comment is on our First Nation brothers and sisters. The system we’ve got today is not working. We know that. I mean, it’s about jobs. Putting people on reserves 200 years ago, or whenever we did, whenever all that was created, I don’t think has worked well enough.", "We heard somebody speak earlier about the Ring of Fire. That’s the kind of thing that works: getting those young men and women jobs, and not saying, “There’s a cheque here waiting for you.” I don’t like what we’ve done there. I think we could have done a lot better job. I think there’s a whole pile of people to blame.", "As we build support for our immigration and for all the wonderful people who have come from all over the world, I think we still have left our First Nation brothers and sisters in a bad way. If the bill is really complete, and if it’s really supportive of all Ontarians and all Canadians, we’ve got to do a better job in working with our brothers and sisters from the First Nation reserves and places where they live. I know many of them are in deep poverty.", "I can tell you, from my own example in Simcoe North, we’ve got Casino Rama, which is the Chippewas of Rama. Most of the people who live in Rama, the First Nation people, have jobs, and they’ve got cars and nice houses.", "I go to the other end of my riding, out onto Christian Island, with the Beausoleil First Nation, where they have to go by a ferry to get there, year-round, or an ice trail or an ice road in the winter. They don’t have the same kinds of job opportunities. Young people—there are suicides; there’s that sort of thing.", "We’re not really complete until we look after our very first immigrants, which are our First Nation brothers and sisters.", "Anyhow, those are my comments on this. Of course we’re supporting it, and we’re looking forward to the amendments.", "I’m looking forward to the comments. I appreciate the opportunity to say a few words today, Speaker." ],

A few years ago, I was on the board of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities. I was at a conference, and my good Conservative friend Michael Thompson, a city councillor from Toronto, was talking about the benefits of foreign students to the city of Toronto. He said—and it blew me away—that when you add up the economic benefit of what the foreign students bring to the city of Toronto, it’s in the billions of dollars a year. It’s not in the millions, Speaker; it’s in the billions. When you think of how many there are, and the tuition they pay, the rent they pay, the food they eat, the clothes they buy, the entertainment and the transportation, it adds up to billions of dollars a year. We don’t credit, I believe, foreign students for doing that to our economy.", "So when it comes to things such as simple solutions, as mentioned by the member from Parkdale–High Park earlier—OHIP coverage for foreign students—and as reiterated again by the member from Simcoe North, I think we have to do better all the way around.", "We have a medical school in Windsor. They keep telling us that the more residents you get, the higher the percentage is who will stay within the community that they do their studies in.

The Barretts came over on the Bolivar, from southern Ireland. My middle name is Butler—Butler’s Rangers. We got kicked out of the Mohawk Valley at exactly the same time the Six Nations did. We fought side by side and ended up in the Niagara area. As with many of the Six Nations, we weren’t at the time that interested in cutting down all those trees and farming, so you move on and do something else. I know that on my mum’s side we still have the farm—my mum’s farm. It was established in 1796. The Culvers and Bowlbys came up by sleighs—came up in 13 sleighs, actually—from New Jersey. They came up through the woods and brought the slaves with them. Slavery was legal at that time on both sides of that border. We still have one of the sleighs from 1796 and, of course, the family Bible. Much of this, whether it’s on my mum’s side or on my father’s side with the diaries and journals, the immigrant experience, even going back well over 200 years, is still very, very alive in our minds.

The member for Simcoe North focused much of his speech on international students. Given his critic portfolio, his interest in post-secondary education makes a lot of sense.", "I think all of our communities have post-secondary institutions. I know in London we have Western and Fanshawe College, which are putting a lot of resources, effort and attention into international student recruitment efforts, because we recognize that bringing more students from other countries into our own communities benefits us hugely, whether they stay or not; but it also enables us to provide international experiences for our own students when we create these relationships with countries around the world. We are all made richer when we have a better understanding of people around the globe.", "One of the things we’ve seen in London is that we are gaining as many immigrants as we are losing. There has been no net change in terms of new immigration into our community. A lot of the international students are staying, but many are not. One of the implications of drawing increasing numbers of immigrants from post-secondary student pools is that the role of the college and university becomes very much settlement service provider. I think that in light of these trends, in light of the fact that increasing numbers of provincial nominees are likely to be post-secondary students, we need to ensure that our post-secondary institutions are able to deliver the kind of settlement supports that students need." ],

I just hope some of the comments we make, whether you’re a government member, a member of the NDP or the PCs, are carefully listened to, because I think there are some good points being brought out.", "The member from London West talks about international students and that as well. There are key issues there. You know what? Today, I think our colleges and universities, because tuition has gone up—since this government took power, I believe tuition’s up about 110%. Colleges have no more money, so they really count on international students.", "But to give the international students decent health care—not every young man and woman is going to require health care when you’re 18 and 20 years of age. But when someone does get sick, they need it, because they have to go back to the bank or they have to call home for more money, that type of thing—or they have no money at all and they have to drop out of school.", "Those are the kinds of things that should be—if we’re talking about supporting our immigrants and the things we can do, let’s support some of the good ideas that we come up with in debate here. I’ll be looking forward to that because I know the student associations were meeting with 20-something people here today. I hope they would listen to that.", "Thank you for the opportunity again." ],

I want to take a few moments, though, before I get into the body of my speech to recognize an immigrant who made a huge difference in this city and this country.", "Mr. Neil Young, the member of Parliament for, first, Beaches–Woodbine and then Beaches–East York, was an extraordinary person. He died this past weekend. He represented an area with one of the largest South Asian populations in Ontario, centred on Crescent Town. He was a man who understood what it was like to come to a country, establish yourself, make a difference, build a family, and he represented that community in an extraordinary way. Neil and his surviving wife, Viv, made themselves a political force in the east end of Toronto, one that had broad respect right across this city. Neil will be missed, and I know this: His work will not be forgotten.", "Speaker, today we’re talking about a bill that we hope will help future Neils and future Vivs in the work that they can do in this country. We in the New Democratic Party see this bill as small, see it as a step in the right direction nonetheless, but we need a bill that is going to do more on the “big picture” issues. My hope is that when this gets into committee, there will be the opportunity to actually strengthen the bill and make differences so that the people who come to this country, the people who establish new lives in this country, have the opportunity to fully utilize all their potential, all their skills, all their talents.", "We know that Ontario is falling behind when it comes to the number of immigrants who arrive in Ontario. That is a huge problem, Speaker, because although I know that there are some who say having immigrants come into a country or a city takes away jobs from those who are here, in fact, if you look at the history of Ontario, if you look at the history of the GTA, a large part of the wealth, a large part of the prosperity of this region and this province, has been rooted in that great wave of immigrants from around the world—from Africa, from Asia, from Europe, from Latin America—who have come and contributed their incredible energy to building an economy and a society that is second to none in the world.", "If we are losing people, if we are losing attractiveness to newcomers, we are losing future prosperity. There’s just no getting around it, Speaker. That is simply the reality. We need to be an attractive destination. We need to be a place that makes people from around the world say, “Yes, we want to come to Ontario.”", "I think one of the members earlier was talking about a gentleman in Sudbury who had come from Lebanon. I had a good friend a number of years back who was from Bangladesh, an accountant who arrived in Ontario and went to Baffin Island to get work as an accountant.", "People come here. They are incredibly ready to adapt to a new situation, to adopt a new lifestyle. What they need, though, are the supports from this province, from this society, so they can contribute to their full ability. This bill doesn’t address many of the fundamental challenges facing newcomers, nor does it reflect the typical low-wage migrant experience.", "Speaker, a few years ago I had the opportunity as the finance critic to work with people in the Sikh community in Brampton. This is a very dynamic community. People in Brampton from the Punjab, from an area that has been a big hub of economic growth on the Indian subcontinent, were finding that they couldn’t get work, full-time or permanent work, with actual companies. They had to go through temp agencies time after time after time. They knew that the temp agencies were getting a very large hourly payment and that they, very capable workers that they were, were getting a low hourly wage.", "Speaker, one of the things that we need to address, if we’re going to make Ontario an attractive destination, if we’re going to keep it an attractive destination, is this whole question of precarious part-time work. When I researched it, I found that in parts of northern Europe where governments had taken on this issue, what they ensured was that a part-time or temporary worker would get the same wages and benefits as the full-time permanent worker. It eliminated the incentive to use temp companies, to use those middle people who would take a big chunk of whatever was paid by the company and not pass it onto the person who actually worked on the shop floor, who worked on the construction site, who worked in the office doing administrative work.", "Speaker, this government has been in power now for more than 10 years. It has had the opportunity for over a decade to address many of the concerns that my colleague from Parkdale–High Park had raised, that I have raised in previous speeches and that my colleague from London West has raised. It has left this until very late in the day.", "The member for Guelph, responding last week to the member from London West, said, “It’s important to understand that Bill 49 isn’t the be-all and end-all.... It’s really the first step; it’s the starting point.” If you’ve been in power from 2003 to 2015—12 years—why wasn’t the starting point a bit closer to the beginning of the mandate? I think that’s a reasonable question to ask and a reasonable concern to have.", "Last week, my colleague from London West addressed this bill in some detail. She’s the critic for training, colleges and universities. I’d like to return to a number of the specific points that she made in her speech. She noted that we as a province have a lot to learn from others about best practices. Between 2001 and 2011, Ontario’s proportion of immigrants declined from 60% to 40%, which is now Ontario’s lowest share of new immigrants in 30 years. Particularly, Ontario’s share of economic immigrants has significantly declined, to the point where economic immigrants make up only half of all immigrants to Ontario, lower than any other province.", "That does not bode well for the future of Ontario. We’re losing the talent we’re going to need to build our cities and to develop our rural areas. We’re losing the talent that could make a difference in every city, town and region of this province.", "Now, it was interesting to me that the member for London West referred to London as “a preferred secondary destination for immigrants after they have arrived in Toronto....” I have to say, my parents were immigrants. They arrived in Toronto and almost immediately left town to go to London, which is how I came to be born in London, Ontario.", "Interjections." ],

Between the years of 2000 and 2009, the number of immigrants has risen an astounding 140%. These individuals and their families help contribute to the local economy, open businesses and create jobs, and they contribute to the sense of culture and community.", "But simply having people come and live in Ontario is not enough, Mr. Speaker. This bill will help to create the necessary tools for our province to attract the kind of skilled immigrants we need to meet future labour demands.", "Aligning our immigration policy with our economic policy is not the only reason for this type of legislation. Many new immigrants come to Canada to improve their lives and that of their families but can occasionally be taken advantage of right from the start, and that’s something we should all be concerned about. As a result of this, individuals representing themselves as so-called immigration specialists can confuse them with lengthy documents and confusing language, often charging them large amounts of money for their services. Once the transaction is complete, these people disappear and those who sought their help are left with nothing. This bill will help to strengthen and clarify the terms surrounding representation within the system and protect immigrants from this kind of fraud and abuse. This will ensure that only those authorized may act as representatives of those seeking to immigrate and will create penalties for those seeking to defraud would-be Canadians.", "This legislation is an important first step for the province of Ontario in increasing our role in immigration policies. By working to enhance our relationship on this issue with our federal counterparts and sharing this great responsibility, we can help those who wish to be part of our great province do so and, in turn, help grow our economy and our communities.", "In closing, immigrants are going to be instrumental in the shaping of Ontario’s future economically, culturally and otherwise, and so it is our job to make sure it’s done right.", "In summary, helping immigrants is all of our collective responsibilities. Showing them the red carpet, not red tape, is what Bill 49 is all about, and I urge every member of this House to support it." ],

It builds our economy, enriches our society and helps us to compete on the world stage. Immigrants have made deep and enduring contributions that have shaped the quality of life we enjoy today across this province. At every stage of Ontario’s history, newcomers offered skills, knowledge, optimism and hard work that advanced our economy.", "This is certainly true in my community in Cambridge. The original towns of Cambridge that make up today’s Cambridge were Galt, Preston, Hespeler and Blair. They were founded on the Speed and Grand rivers, which provided power for the many textile mills.", "Early in the 20th century, Portuguese textile workers were some of the best in the world. Many Portuguese immigrants came to these thriving mills that contributed so much to the very early economic development of Cambridge and really provided the foundation for the economic success of Cambridge today.", "These immigrants sponsored their families to come over. In the mid-1980s, when I arrived in Cambridge, almost one third of Cambridge residents actually spoke fluent Portuguese. They were certainly able to contribute to the rich fabric of our society in Cambridge today.", "As Ontario faces more global competition, we’re counting on newcomers today more than ever before. The Ontario Immigration Act would position Ontario for success in this global economic environment.", "As we all know, talent is the most sought-after commodity in today’s economy. Entrepreneurial spirit, cultural knowledge, and creative thinking make economies more innovative and creative. Ontario’s newcomers bring with them links to international markets, which in turn create more opportunities to build strategic partnerships across the world.", "Newcomers bring innovative ideas and unique perspectives. They make valuable contributions to emerging industries like information technology, engineering and bioscience.", "In the global economy, Ontario’s cultural diversity gives us a clear edge. That’s really what our government’s Going Global Trade Strategy is all about. Our effort to tap into new markets is greatly enhanced by people who speak very different languages, have international networks, and understand different business cultures.", "Of course, it’s more than trade. We continue to rely on newcomers to maintain our labour force. With an aging population, low birth rates, and retiring baby boomers, we are counting on skilled immigrants to continue helping to meet our future labour needs.", "Speaker, I’m so pleased to hear so much support for this bill across the House, and I really look forward to its passing." ],

I’m not quite sure what the reason is.", "However, we had a lot of discussion about francophones and francophone immigration in this province. It seems that all members who have spoken today are wanting the francophones to come to their communities. But I can tell you that in my community of Glengarry–Prescott–Russell, which is over 65% francophone, providing the services to new francophone Ontarians is very critical. We do have all the services available for our francophone community. That’s why, in our immigration strategy that the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration has put forward, we have a target of 5% of all newcomers to Ontario—we’re hoping they’re going to be French-speaking, because we know the economic benefit of that. We are a bilingual country; there are two official languages.", "I have a minute and 40 seconds left.", "I want to congratulate and thank the Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, the Honourable Jeff Leal, for his commitment in ensuring that the collège d’Alfred, in my riding of Glengarry–Prescott–Russell, continues to provide services and educational programming in my riding.", "It was great news when he announced last Thursday, along with the minister responsible for francophone affairs, the Honourable Madeleine Meilleur, and the Minister of Training, Colleges and Universities, the Honourable Reza Moridi, that La Cité collégiale is going to assume the lead of this important agricultural francophone college in my riding. So I want to thank you, Minister, for that commitment that you’ve made in ensuring that we can continue.", "I am so excited about the opportunity.

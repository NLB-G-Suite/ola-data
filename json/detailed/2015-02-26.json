The CFIB presented its sound analysis of the ORPP at the pre-budget hearings held by the Standing Committee on Finance and Economic Affairs less than a month ago. At the hearings, the CFIB vice-president, Mr. Plamen Petkov, commented on the lack of public understanding of the ORPP proposal: “I’m not quite sure, though, that the average Ontarian actually understands that this is going to be money coming from their paycheque. I think they are going to realize that after they see that deduction in 2017 onwards.”", "Just back to my original point, people in the election weren’t really understanding the impact this was going to have on them, if they were thinking about it at all. Most, in my area of Haliburton–Kawartha Lakes–Brock, were thinking that they couldn’t pay their hydro bill, and how were they going to put food on the table.", "Anyway, back to the CFIB, “I think there is a big education component here that is missing from the whole debate on things such as, it is not a free plan; it is not something the government is giving to the people; and there’s also the fact that it’s going to take 40 years of contributions to actually get the benefit.”", "“So it is really a combination of different charges that, as a small business owner, you either have to take from your payroll, meaning reducing your labour force, or you have to pass on to your consumer, meaning raising prices. If you keep raising prices, you’re not going to be competitive and you’ll be out of business pretty soon.”", "The people I explain this to say, “I’m going to lose my job.” Up in Haliburton, they’re like, “I’m going to lose my job, because my employer cannot afford to keep me on.” And you see that across all the small businesses. They’re having fewer employees, and the mom-and-pop shops, or whoever the owners are, are working longer hours.", "So, the CFIB, which represents a huge number of businesses, is not wrong. I get the same feedback in my riding. So, I think the member from Peterborough—I invite him to come up on a tour of Haliburton–Kawartha Lakes–Brock.", "Anyway, the CFIB did a poll to see what employers would do if the plan was forced on them. Implementation of the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan: “Do you support the implementation?” Eighty-six per cent of Ontario businesses in the Canadian Federation of Independent Business said no—get the message. “If implemented, what impact would paying additional ORPP premiums have on your business?”" ],

Your government”—the Liberal government—“is putting significant pressures on employers to deliver a new pension program....” That’s what you’re doing. You’re putting it on the employers.", "They went on to say—this is the Ontario Restaurant Hotel and Motel Association—“The ORPP will likely limit economic growth in our industry and hit the youth the most.” We already have high, high youth unemployment, so you’re going to make that worse, the Liberal government. “Employers will hire less full-time employees, hire less youth, hire fewer employees and expect more of those that remain employed. A 1.9% increase in labour costs is a significant new cost to absorb in a low-margin industry where labour represents the largest expense. To add to this, the additional administrative costs required to meet an accelerated implementation timeline will only increase the negative impact on businesses.”", "With the addition of the ORPP, we will see the cost of doing business in Ontario continue to rise.", "This government totally ignores what businesses are saying. They’re asking people who can’t pay their hydro bill, if they are lucky enough to have a job, to pay an extra 1.9% off their paycheque. They’re asking their employer, who is having a hard time paying the hydro bill and wants to give jobs to local people—they are going to be taxed. And yes, it’s a tax. We have the highest payroll taxes in the country; that will continue. We have the highest hydro rates in North America; that is continuing.", "At what point do you not see that people are backed up against the wall? There is no margin for them.

For decades we’ve seen that there has been an imbalance, inequality in terms of income, where the very wealthy are getting wealthier, the middle class is eroding and the poor are getting poorer. There’s has been no real, tangible effort on the part of any government—specifically the provincial government, nor the federal government—to make any effort to buffer that. New Democrats have proposed our own plan, but as you see—this morning I woke up and I saw CBC Newsworld talk about the fact that RRSPs eat up a massive amount of the funding or the cash in administrative fees. They are not a vehicle for secure retirement. They aren’t the vehicle of choice; they shouldn’t be the vehicle of choice. However, it seems as though this government is going to rely on a private vehicle, ushering in private entities to manage, to organize and to direct these funds, rather than a solely public entity that would lower those administrative fees, give those retirees the most return for their buck and also guarantee and ensure retirement security.", "They’re on the wrong path.

Why does she not think that that’s an enormous burden?", "If you just simply could get the federal government to give up income splitting and put that money into the Canada Pension Plan, which is what we wanted in the first place, every single criticism you’ve made would evaporate in a nanosecond. But this is why the Conservative Party constantly loses seats and is going to lose the next federal election: because they’re so ridiculous, from not believing in evolution to believing that stripping 80% of Canadians in their retirement of their income to support the highest income earners in the country makes sense.", "The CFIB, I hate to say, is wrong. It’s not an economic analysis; it’s an opinion survey. Every economic analysis of minimum wage increases and pension benefits shows job growth and GDP growth. You cannot, my dear friend, produce a single study that says contrary, because it doesn’t. So you’re left to an ideological, single-owner organization pretending to be a substitute for chambers of commerce that does opinion surveys with no background or data. It is laughable.", "You were opposed to the HST, which would reduce the cost of business by $8.5 billion. You couldn’t even agree with your federal cousins on that.

The reason that we’re looking at implementing the ORPP is in order to help people save for their retirement. I think ultimately, when you look at the cost of hydro, the cost of living in general, it is prohibitive for many people to be able to put money aside. Often they’re faced with the decision of whether they’re going to keep the lights and the heat on or whether they’re going to eat. I think that’s something that the government needs to be looking at: bringing the cost of living down so that people have the ability to put money aside and ultimately have some disposable income to spend in our communities.", "I also spoke yesterday to private pensions. My riding specifically has a large manufacturing area, a large automotive sector, and all have private pensions through their companies. Unfortunately, we often see these companies—people work there 20, 30 years, thinking that at the end of their career they’re going to have a solid pension. Unfortunately, too often we find these companies close up shop, leave town, and these people who have worked their whole life towards a pension no longer have that retirement savings. I think we need to come up with a plan to protect those people who have worked all their life for that security in their retirement.", "I’d just like to reiterate again, I think it’s important to give people the opportunity to save for retirement, and I think a big piece around that is the affordability." ],

This way, people can choose the vehicle—and there are tax vehicles for pensions, for savings, for their retirement. They are out there; they can be used.

To say that every citizen in this province, including, I would argue, members of this assembly—that it should be up to them to decide how they’re going to invest their dollars for retirement and that is going to make the problem of adequate retirement income go away, is a fallacy. I will argue that—out of 107 members in this assembly, how many people are able to retire at age 55—please put up your hand—with your own investments? How many of you can actually afford to retire at age 60?", "The reality is we don’t have a pension plan here in Ontario as MPPs. Most people don’t know that. We’re RRSP-based, and the reality is the money that we have in RRSPs has not done well. We’ve had years where we’ve made a few dollars on our investments, but we’ve had years where we’ve lost all those dollars of investment. Essentially, you’ve pretty well got the money that you put in; you really have not made any interest over the last 20 years that I’ve been in that plan. It’s the money that I’ve put in that’s still there—because I made some, I lost some, and when you balance it all out, you’re lucky if you get 2%, 3% on average per year—if you’re lucky.", "What I find really ironic in this whole thing is that it’s Conservative members who cancelled the Ontario pension plan for MPPs, but it is also Conservatives who are lobbying, trying to reinstate a defined pension plan for people in this province. So what is good for members should be good for the public.", "I believe the best way to provide income for people in retirement is by having a defined pension plan. If you have a defined pension plan, you know what you’re going to get at retirement, month in and month out; you’re able to plan with your family, your spouse, what it is you’re going to do in retirement and what you can afford to do. You’re not left to the whim of the market and you’re not left to the whim of your own budgeting. Because the reality is that most people do not budget for retirement. Most people are more concerned about the here and now, and say, “You know what? I’ve got a truck that broke down,” or “I have a water heater that’s busted at home,” or “I’ve got braces to buy for my children,” or “I’ve got to pay for a college or university education.” Those are the things that we as families and as parents have to deal with on a day-to-day basis for the majority of the time that we’re in the workplace. It’s just called trying to make ends meet.", "So most families and, I would argue, 90% to 95% of us, don’t have the ability to say, “Well, you know what? I can put $1,500 a month away, so that I have enough money to be able to retire at age 55, in my own pension plan.” Because that’s about what you’d have to put away. If you start working at age, let’s say, 20, and you can put away $1,500 a month until age 55, you might have enough to retire on. But nobody can afford that because, quite frankly, most people are not working for that kind of money. The majority of people in our society are working for $50,000 and $70,000 a year, if they’re lucky. That’s why it’s always better that we have a mechanism through the payroll, that there is a defined pension plan that says, “When you work, a percentage of your income is going to go, along with a contribution from your employer, to be able to provide a defined pension plan so that when you retire,” at whatever the plan allows, 57, 60, 55 or whatever it might be, “you know you’re going to get so much money per month to be able to plan for your own retirement,” pure and simple.", "We as New Democrats, under Andrea Horwath, who brought, I believe, the first such bill into the Legislature, introduced the concept of getting the federal government to increase the CPP so that the Canada Pension Plan becomes a defined pension plan for all of us who don’t have a pension plan at work, and allow those who have a pension at work, like teachers and others, to opt out. If the federal government is not prepared to do it, what we said was that then Ontario should go on its own, but that’s not our first option.", "Our first option has always been that we should get the federal government to accept that we have some mechanism to increase the contribution to CPP so that rather than retiring on a meagre income on your Canada Pension Plan, it would be somewhat sufficient to be able to provide for retirement.", "I’ll just talk about my own situation. I make a good buck. I make 130,000-some-odd dollars a year as a member here and being a House leader. The employer, the Ontario government, puts about $1,000 a month into my RRSPs, right? That’s what I’ve got to retire on. It is not sufficient for me to retire at anything before age 65. So the only thing I have to look forward to—and I’m not complaining; I’ve had it pretty good.", "The point I’m making is this: Most people, if they wait until age 65, with the current CPP, and they don’t take the early retirement provision at age 60, are lucky if they’re going to get $900 a month. On top of that, they will get their old age pension, and if they’re lucky their spouse is the same age or a little bit older and you will get the old age pension and CPP from their spouse as well. Put all that together and you’re lucky, collectively, if you are making $2,500 a month, in my particular case. Most people are having to survive on that and less.", "I look at my community, and I’m sure every member of this assembly has the same story. A husband and wife retired; they retired on whatever pension arrangement they had. The husband dies, and the wife is left alone. More times than not, she has to sell the house because she can’t afford to pay to keep the house going on what’s left when it comes to income from CPP death benefits and her own old age pension. So the widow is trying to survive.", "Most people don’t have pensions. I look at the mining sector that I come out of, out of Timmins. Most of our mines did not have adequate defined pension plans. So those widows whose husbands died because of the work they did in these mines—they banged up their bodies or lungs and everything else—are having to retire, after the husband dies, and try to live on a CPP death benefit, which is about $400 or $500 a month, and their old age pension. They can’t afford to keep the house going with $1,200 a month of income, even though the house is paid and clear, so what I see is that most of them are selling off their houses in order to have a little bit of equity so they can afford to do something with their grandkids and have a little bit of comfort in their days of retirement.", "So, yes, we need to up the Canada Pension Plan in some way, and if that’s not possible, then, yes, we need to do something in order to provide a first step towards providing retirement income for people. If we leave it to the individual, as the Conservatives suggest, it will always be the same, and, I will argue, it’s not even the top 10% but probably the top 5% of Ontarians, who have money, who will retire with a good income. The rest of us won’t. It will be at the whim of the market, whatever we have in RRSPs.", "I look at a good friend of mine who lives a couple of cottages over from me. The guy had about $600,000 in RRSPs. At the last crash—remember the big one we had?—the value of his retirement pension was devalued by half. Guess what he did? He panicked and sold out, so he ended up with only half of what he was hoping to retire on, and that’s what he has to survive on for the rest of his days. He did what the Conservatives suggested. He put money into his RRSPs, his own money. Every year, he put money into his RRSPs. He tried to provide for a retirement income. When the market crashed and he lost half of the value, he did what other people did: panicked and sold his investments. He’s left with very little money to retire on. Now he’s chewing that up at a pretty fast rate, and all he is left with is his meagre Canada pension, his old age pension, and his wife’s old age pension and a very small CPP, because she only worked for about 10 years.", "I disagree with the Conservatives on this one. I think that defined pension plans are the way to go, because at least that way, people are able to know that when they retire, there will be a decent pension for them in their retirement years.", "We are lucky. If we work in the public sector, most of us have a decent pension, except for members of this assembly: nurses, teachers, workers in the civil service. If you work for one of the larger employers in Ontario, like Ford or Falconbridge or any of those big companies, you probably have a decent private pension plan with your employer that was negotiated with your union. But the rest of us, which is, I would say, about 65% or 70%, worked for mom-and-pop operations or medium-sized businesses or were self-employed, and we don’t have any mechanism to be able to provide for a pension.", "Is this pension plan that the government is putting forward perfect? Absolutely not. I think there are things that we’re going to want to talk about, once we go to committee, about how we’re able to change it in some ways to make it a better thing for those people who retire. But it is a step in the right direction. It’s something that Andrea Horwath advocated for for years before she became leader, and I know my friend Paul Miller, who is our critic, did the same, and it’s something that we talked about over a couple of elections. The government is moving in that direction. That’s fine; it doesn’t matter where the idea comes from. The fact is, we’re stepping out in that direction.", "Can it be better? Absolutely. But I’d just ask the Tories: Let’s stop this fallacy that if we only allowed people to provide for themselves, everything would be better. Look at the United States when it comes to their health care system. If you don’t have an employer with a plan, you don’t have health care, and it’s the same when it comes to pensions." ],

They want a vehicle to be able to know that their money is being properly managed and invested, and that the return on the back side, when they do retire, will be adequate for the ever-increasing cost of living each and every day in the province of Ontario, which the government has a whole lot to do with. Whether it be energy prices or otherwise, it’s getting more and more expensive, and I would guess that it will continue to be.", "It’s interesting to hear a member from the PC caucus rail against any type of vehicle or mechanism for retirement security. I would imagine that they would rely solely on the free hand of the market to dictate and to provide that mechanism.", "We heard just recently that some in their caucus don’t believe in evolution, which is interesting, although they do believe in one of the aspects of Darwin’s theory of evolution, which is natural selection, whereby the strong will survive, and by that I would imagine they believe that the rich will survive because they are then in fact the strongest. If that’s the type of society we’re trying to create here, where the more money you have the better off you’re going to be, regardless of intervention or any type of effort on the part of the government, then we are indeed doomed to lower the standard of living in this province.", "I would say, let’s put our best minds forward.

We will not let those people go homeless. We will not let them go to food banks. We would have to do something. The cost of dealing with this issue later on, when those people are struggling or suffering, is going to be much higher than not taking action now. If we take action now, if we create this Ontario Retirement Pension Plan, we are going to be able to help a lot of people and save future costs.", "Speaker, this is an important bill.

I’d like to say a few words about my community of Ottawa South, where I’ve lived all my life and have seen it change over some 50 years.", "I come from a community that’s wonderfully and beautifully diverse. You can see it when you go into our schools. Often I go into schools, when we’re back during constituency weeks and on Fridays, and our schools are just a beautiful cultural mosaic. I think that we have in Ottawa South 140 different nationalities and over 70 languages, and you can see that in the schools. Ottawa South is also home to one of Canada’s largest Arabic-speaking populations. That happened through waves of immigration. It began 50, 60 years ago. There are many Lebanese immigrants who have built businesses and built up our community.", "Actually, one of my predecessors in this seat, Dalton McGuinty Sr., had a saying. He didn’t like the term “new Canadian.” He said there are only new, newer and newest Canadians. What that meant is, this country was built on immigration. That’s what our strength is. We’ve brought the world together. That’s how we’ve built the community of Ottawa South; that’s how we’ve built Canada.", "I’m pleased to support the changes that are in this bill. Of course, the overriding importance of this bill is its potential for economic benefit to our province. As a shared jurisdiction with the federal government, on immigration, they’ve made some recent changes. Bill 49, if passed, would include a vision and objectives for immigration to Ontario; authority to establish and govern Ontario immigration selection programs; authority to establish and govern settlement and integration programs; authority to set targets for Ontario selection programs; authority to establish employer and recruiter registries; a compliance and enforcement regime; authority to directly or indirectly collect, use and disclose personal information to maintain program integrity and deter immigration fraud in Ontario selection programs.", "Now I’d like to speak to one of the changes in this bill, which is the amendments to the Regulated Health Professions Act to align requirements in the RHPA with those in the Fair Access to Regulated Professions and Compulsory Trades Act related to the timelines in decision-making and access to records. These changes were requested by the Fairness Commissioner.", "I think we have all experienced in our communities people coming to our offices, or people that we meet at events, who have come to our country and have been trained as teachers, as nurses, as doctors, as engineers. They have made the effort to acquire these skills—another jurisdiction has supported them in acquiring these skills—but they can’t find work in their chosen field, in the thing they have decided to do with their life. We feel for people, because we understand how we would feel if we were in that position, if we were not able to use all our skills to the fullest extent of our abilities. There’s kind of a moral and ethical thing when you see that. You say, “That’s not just.”", "The other thing that we have to consider is, it’s in our economic self-interest to support people who have skills that have been acquired and paid for in another jurisdiction, and all we need to do is either recognize those skills or help them get to the standards that we have here in our country. So I think this change in the bill is very important. It’s something I feel very, very strongly about, not only from the perspective of being fair to people but from the perspective that it’s an economic benefit to our province." ],

As of almost two weeks ago, 55 years ago, we landed in Halifax, so if one does the math, you know how old I am. My father came in 1959. My mother, my sister and I came in 1960.", "We are so delighted—my family is; I’m sure other families across this province are—that not only Ontario but Canada has adopted us as Canadians. Shortly after, as soon we could qualify to become Canadians, we all became Canadians, all four of us.", "It’s not that I don’t cherish my heritage, because I think heritage is very, very important. That’s where I was born, and, obviously, there are lots of ties. I still have a lot of relatives in my hometown where I was born.", "Whenever I get an opportunity to talk about immigration, certainly it has got that side of me. I’m not pretending. As I speak, I’m living the vision.", "Back then, immigrants gathered around large urban centres. Frankly, at that time, in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, a lot of immigrants were of the construction type of immigrant, who worked very hard to build Ontario to what it is today. I remember my father—then, the labour laws weren’t as they are today. That’s not to say that workplaces where he worked took advantage of him. Certainly, they did the best they could.", "For Ontario and Canada, immigration has become a staple. I think places like Ontario, like large urban centres, depend on immigration. It’s sort of a leaning post to an economic driver. It’s part of what drives our economy.", "Today, I see immigration is much different than it was then. Then, as I said a minute ago, immigration centred around large urban centres—the Torontos, the Ottawas of this world—but today, immigration is spreading its wings. For example, in the riding of Northumberland–Quinte West, Northumberland county is a portal, where potential immigrants who want to come to Ontario now have a place to explore the beautiful Northumberland county, with its seven municipalities. The city of Quinte West—I had a good chat with them just after the election in June. Obviously, they’re looking for immigration to expand their well-being.", "I guess what I’m saying is that immigration has become more and more of a staple, as part of our economic drivers.", "We know that immigration is the responsibility of the federal government; I think we all know that. But I think we need to be able to create, with this piece of legislation, what’s important to us here, to make sure that as we get into the selection process, we get the type of immigration that will work well for Ontario—and not to be selfish. When I talk about what has to work well for Ontario, and part of that Ontario mix, it’s those immigrants. In the immigration piece, for any immigrants who want to make Ontario their home, we want to make a special place where they feel at home.", "It’s challenging. Sometimes I wonder, for example, what made my mother and father decide to come to Canada. It was obviously for a better life for them, but also for my sister and I, and we’re so, so grateful for that.", "We’ve got to make sure that we have a piece of legislation at the end of the day that makes that transition as smooth as possible; that makes sure these immigrants who come to this great province, and this great country, land in a place they can call home, because we all want to feel at home at the end of the day.", "Speaker, I would say to you that, as we debate this, I’m going to certainly pay close attention to make sure it hits those marks that are needed.", "Having said that, Mr. Speaker, this obviously needs debate. Hopefully, we keep in mind also that we don’t use this as a political ploy, as we did with some other pieces of legislation, to just hold things up, because there are people who want to come to Ontario. There are people who want to call Ontario home." ],

Ensuring that it’s accountable and sustainable for current and future Ontarians is extremely important. Our demographics are slowly changing, and the Ontario of today owes itself, in large part, to the wonderful people who choose to call Ontario their new home. We must make sure that our province remains a viable option for people from around the world, and we must make sure that we are welcoming to those who want to bring their families here.", "There are many difficulties faced by those who wish to immigrate to any part of this country. Much of that comes from the seemingly simple task of establishing yourself with a place to live and a place to work. There are usually many hurdles and hoops that one must jump through in order to achieve this legally and effectively. Offering programs for foreign nationals who wish to come here to work is an excellent way to re-evaluate how we help to welcome new Ontarians and new Canadians.", "Giving them the opportunity to move more easily through the transitional period will give them more of a footing when they settle here and will give them a better chance at making a lasting effort to stay and become citizens.", "Employers who employ foreign nationals will also benefit, in that they will have a streamlined way through the government to provide and offer working opportunities in a consistent and centralized way. This should make it easier for them to coordinate the process.", "Of utmost importance are, of course, accountability and transparency. I am glad to see that the ministry is taking this into account. Providing for the inspection and investigation of new programs will be vital to ensuring, to those who participate in them, that the process is fair to existing Ontarians, who deserve to have faith in the system. Of even greater impact is the provision for appealing selection decisions, and giving a voice to those who may wish to become Ontarians, but feel they have missed their opportunity and wish to have their case heard.", "Navigating the immigration process throughout our country is a joint effort. It is reassuring to know that we are doing our part as a province to make it work for those who wish to become Canadians. Working with the governments of Canada and of our fellow provinces and territories is necessary, but we must also ensure that the process is fair and equitable to Ontario and to all Ontarians. It is reassuring to know that our minister is taking the steps required to make sure that this is a reality.", "Ontario is one of the greatest provinces in this country, although you might not hear that from the opposition. They try to tear Ontario down at every instance, but, as a government, our effort is to build Ontario up. That’s what we’re doing. Building Ontario up is welcoming new immigrants who can provide new skills to this great province." ],

There is no state or province with more people in it than Ontario. There is no economy larger than that in Ontario.", "A large part of what has made Ontario the economic engine of the heartland of North America has been the new Canadians who have arrived from all over the world with the capacity to do business everywhere in the world. We speak every language in the world. We understand the world’s customs. We know what the world needs.

It was talking about the multicultural experience in Europe and the degree to which they were having problems with it. It brought back to mind some of the time I spent chairing the Standing Committee on the Legislative Assembly. Speaker, I know you’ve chaired this committee, so you can probably share this experience. We would have our incoming delegations from wherever and, along with the Speaker, the Chair of the Standing Committee on the Legislative Assembly would be invited to lunch, to sit down with the elected members from—fill in the blanks, because they came from everywhere in the world.", "They would walk around downtown Toronto and they would say, “We are just blown over by the diversity here in the province of Ontario.” And they would ask questions: “How do you go about doing this? How do we deal with attracting the best talent?” Then, the most important part, the settlement and integration: How do we enable new Canadians to get on with their lives so that there isn’t the generation that comes from the old country, regardless of what the old country is, that has to be a lost generation? We know that the priorities of the generation that comes from the old country are pretty simple: Restart your career, get a place to live, get your kids in school and allow your family life to continue to go forward. At those lunches, we would talk about how we go about settlement and integration.", "Inevitably, whoever was leading the delegation would often turn to me and say, “We could never do that where we come from.” That’s something that Ontario uniquely has in the world. It has been one of our big drivers in making us the most sought-after, the most prosperous place in North America. We can do that where we come from. We can take people who come from everywhere, who refer to the Almighty in every faith on the planet, who speak every language, who know every skill and trade. We can turn all of those people into part of our Ontario family within the same generation that they arrive. That’s what we’re here to do and do better.", "The first thing this new Ontario Immigration Act seeks to do is to have a broader conversation, to say, even though we do this better than anywhere else in the world, let’s talk about that vision and objective so that we can keep doing this better than anywhere else in the world. That’s probably, more than anything else, the most important thing to do, because if we’re going to look at that horizon, it would be nice to say, “Let’s know what horizon we’re sailing toward.” That’s something that’s just a key part of this bill.", "It also seeks to refine some of the laws and procedures that enable Ontario to select the best-quality newcomers and to be able to govern policies and procedures regarding settlement and integration. This is something that’s done unevenly. The federal government is absolutely hopeless in its programs for settlement and integration. It is just wretched, and there’s no better place to see that than in my home area of Peel region—at some of the money that is completely wasted by the federal government. We can do a lot better on this. Among the other things in this is the authority to set targets for Ontario’s selection program.", "Speaker, I could do with a lot more time. I’m just getting warmed up, but I’m out of time. Before you cut me off, I just want to thank you for the opportunity." ],

The Great Lakes are vital to the health of Ontario’s environment, to our economy and, of course, to our people. These beautiful lakes are unparalleled, holding one fifth of all the fresh water on earth. At a time when we are seeing this valuable resource under threat in other places around the world, our water wealth gives Ontario a significant competitive advantage.", "However, there can be no doubt that the Great Lakes are also under stress. We are seeing increasing water quality problems, such as the harmful algae bloom in Lake Erie last summer. Invasive species threaten to undermine valuable fisheries and the quality of coastal waters and beaches. Land use pressures are degrading critical habitats such as coastal wetlands, and climate change is bringing the risk of significant changes to water levels, along with record storms and flooding that wash pollution into our lakes. Most significantly, many scientists now agree that the Great Lakes are actually at a tipping point of irreversible change if action is not taken now to restore ecosystem health.", "Taking action is exactly what our proposed Great Lakes Protection Act sets out to do. The proposed Great Lakes Protection Act is designed to protect and restore our Great Lakes so they are drinkable, fishable and swimmable. If passed, it would give the province new tools to work with partners to protect and restore these important resources by ensuring action against the complex and increasing number of threats to the lakes, waters and shorelines.", "The proposed act would establish a Great Lakes guardians’ council to bring together municipal representation; representatives of First Nations and Métis communities; representatives from farming, tourism, industry, science and environmental communities; conservation authorities; and others with a stake in protecting the Great Lakes. The council would be a forum to identify Great Lakes improvement priorities, share information and help focus resources on addressing those priorities together.", "The proposed act, if passed, authorizes the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change to set targets to address particular Great Lakes problems. For example, it would require at least one target for reducing algae blooms to be established within two years of the act coming into force.", "The proposed act recognizes the importance of science in assessing the impact of stressors on the Great Lakes, identifying solutions and the need to continually assess our progress, adapt our actions and chart the way forward. The proposed act would ensure the establishment and maintenance of monitoring and reporting programs to improve understanding and management of the Great Lakes. It would increase reporting transparency and accountability by requiring that regular progress reports be tabled every three years in this Legislature; they would include reporting on performance measures and targets. It would also require that we consider traditional ecological knowledge that is offered by First Nations and Métis people as part of the decision-making process.", "The proposed act, if passed, would enshrine Ontario’s Great Lakes strategy in law as a living document to be reviewed every six years, and its progress reported on publicly every three years.", "Many partners, as I mentioned before, were involved in drafting this. This is truly the work of the people of the Great Lakes.", "This is the third time such a bill has been before this House.

Whether it was driving North America’s industrialization in the 20th century, welcoming new Canadians into our northern communities or expanding international trade, resource development has been a major part of the fabric of our province and our nation. I’m pleased to say that despite commodity and investment challenges that we’re facing globally, Ontario’s mining sector remains strong and competitive.", "Innovation has been key to the success of mineral development in our province, Mr. Speaker. You’ll be pleased to know, as I think all members of the House will, that right here in Ontario, we are responsible for close to one quarter of Canada’s total mineral production. In addition, Ontario is one of the world’s top 10 jurisdictions for mineral investments and has been for many years.", "There is no better place to celebrate and to promote Ontario’s success in mineral development than at the annual Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada convention. Next week, on Monday, in fact, I will have the honour of officially opening the Ontario pavilion at this convention, which is attended by well over 25,000 delegates from more than 100 countries. I’m looking forward to sharing the story of the continued success of Ontario’s mineral development sector with delegates from all around the world.", "The bottom line is that when it comes to mining, the province of Ontario gets it right. Since 2003, the value of mineral production has risen from $5.7 billion, a pretty impressive figure, up to $11 billion in 2014—not bad. That makes Ontario the leading province in mineral production every year for the last decade. In fact, Ontario is the number one producer in Canada for an array of metals and minerals, including nickel, copper and platinum, among others.", "Delegates at this convention are going to be learning about the significant impact the mineral development industry has had on the people of Ontario. For many, many people in our province, mining has quite literally transformed the way that they live.", "There are approximately 900 mining supply and service companies that support the mining industry in our province. Together they directly employ 41,000 people and have an estimated direct economic impact of $6.6 billion. That’s the mining supply and service sector.", "It’s also an important fact to note—those who understand industry understand as well—that more global mining projects get financed in Toronto than in any other financial centre in the world. The Toronto Stock Exchange is the global leader in both mining equity capital raised and the number of mining companies listed on the exchange. It’s pretty impressive. We currently have approximately 1,500 mining companies listed, $240 billion in mining market capitalization and $6.9 billion in new mining equity.", "Speaker, there is no question that our province is a global mining force. The success of our industry is due to our commitment to drive innovation and collaboration in the mineral development sector—absolutely both key elements. It is this drive and determination that, may I say, is leading the development of the Ring of Fire.", "The chromite deposit in the Ring of Fire is a momentous discovery, one of the largest known chromite deposits in the world, and it has a mineral potential that we believe to be worth more than $60 billion.", "Last year, our government took a number of major and important steps to lay the groundwork for the development of this project, including the commitment of $1 billion for strategic transportation infrastructure in the region, a very remote part of the province, and establishing the Ring of Fire Infrastructure Development Corp. We’ve also very strongly strengthened our partnership with the First Nations through the signing of a historical framework agreement with the Matawa member First Nations.", "We are very proud of these accomplishments and are continuing to work very closely with all interested parties on the opportunities for the development of the Ring of Fire.", "Overall, we are so committed to sustaining a healthy mineral development sector. We’re committed by supporting competitive regulatory and taxation policies and ensuring that our approach to mineral development balances the interests of all parties. That’s always a real key to find that balance. This certainly includes respecting aboriginal and treaty rights, private landowners, public health, safety and the environment.", "So next week, when the investors at the Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada convention, or PDAC, want to think of a secure, safe and successful jurisdiction to stake a claim, we want them to think of Ontario, because there is simply no better place to invest than right here in Ontario. We have the resources, we have the talent, and we have the passion.", "To ensure that we build on this momentum, our government is working very hard. We’re working on renewing Ontario’s mineral development strategy. In the very near term—I think that means really soon—I will be sharing Ontario’s plan to update the province’s mineral development strategy, which will set out priorities to strengthen the sector and cement Ontario’s position as a leading mining jurisdiction. With more than 30 advanced mineral exploration projects under way, it is truly an exciting time to be involved in mineral exploration and development in Ontario.", "Next week I will speak with investors about Ontario’s mineral development legacy and our future with some real pride. I invite all members to join me in speaking proudly about our mineral development industry in the province of Ontario and share our province’s mining success stories. See you all at PDAC.

For instance, the Goderich harbour routinely sees commodities such as grains, oilseeds and minerals loaded onto lakers destined for locations beyond the sunset.", "It is also a source of recreation and tourism and an economic driver in my riding. Here you can relax in the sun along the shorelines and take a hike along the trails, enjoy fishing or bird watching, or get active with cycling and canoeing.", "I thank the municipalities, the communities and organizations who are already committed to being stewards of all of our Great Lakes.", "On behalf of the riding of Huron–Bruce in particular, I would like to share with you that I also share in the minister’s passion for ensuring we have a proactive approach to protecting our Great Lakes. However, in reviewing Bill 66, I must raise to the House my reservations and concerns surrounding this bill and if it can deliver on its promises.", "First, the proposed guardians’ council claims to be an open forum for participation and discussion, but when the minister is hand-picking who is invited to these meetings, it doesn’t seem very open to me.", "Further, I have serious questions surrounding the absence of funding to implement initiatives. After speaking with ministerial staff in a technical briefing, they were unable to indicate where money for initiatives would come from. I fear that these costs will be downloaded onto already overburdened municipalities.", "Lastly, one of my biggest concerns is the amount of power afforded to initiatives yet to be determined by the minister’s hand-picked council and their ability to override existing legislation. This has the potential for further erosion of municipal autonomy, just like we saw in the Green Energy Act.", "Speaker, I have to tell you: To protect the Great Lakes, I share with the minister that we need to support local conservation efforts, promote environmental stewardship across all industries, and enable local municipalities to make smart planning decisions in their own communities." ],

I do remember that it used to be number one. We’re somewhere further down these days in the various ranking systems. But I’m going to remain positive today, with PDAC happening.", "The mineral exploration and development industry is a key contributor to the economy of our country and particularly here in Ontario. The industry is part of our national identity. The Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada make Toronto a worldwide destination for the industry during the first week of March every year. I’d like to congratulate them this year on the 83rd year of the convention.", "The sheer number of people who attend annually is astounding, with over 25,000 individuals at the show in each of the past four years. Last year, I was particularly pleased that the Prime Minister was able to attend—the first Prime Minister ever to do so. I look forward to the opening speech by Finance Minister Joe Oliver this Sunday.", "Annually, the convention adds millions of dollars to the Toronto economy—just ask those who conduct early exploration mine development—and it adds billions of dollars to the Canadian economy. The conference is as popular as ever—just ask anyone who has tried to book a downtown hotel during the days when PDAC is on.", "We have a great mineral potential in the province of Ontario. I encourage the government to work to reduce the red tape in the prospecting and permitting process in Ontario so that we can realize that potential.", "I look forward to the convention and to the continued commitment to supporting prospectors and developers in our great province. Again, please accept my congratulations, and all the best for another great convention in 2015." ],

After all, Ontario borders on four of the five Great Lakes; 75% of the people in Ontario get their drinking water from the Great Lakes.", "One thing that desperately needs to be changed, though, is legislation that allows companies to take our water for next to nothing and then sell it. Since 1961, companies taking more than 50,000 litres of water a day needed a permit. The government collects $200,000 in annual permit fees, but it costs $9.5 million a year to monitor and enforce this activity, and that should change. Water-bottling companies—indeed all 6,000 permit holders who do this—have to start paying their fair share, and it’s only right. Seven years ago, the Environmental Commissioner of Ontario was calling on the government to change this; the Drummond report also calls for that to change.", "We also need to do more to reduce phosphorus levels in the Great Lakes. Phosphorus, nitrogen, manure—they all lead to algae blooms and threats to our watersheds. We need to pay more attention to radioactive materials and to plans to bury this material on the shores of Lake Huron. We need to monitor any plans to ship radioactive material along the Great Lakes. We need to have a full environmental assessment before we even consider allowing oil from the Alberta tar sands to be pumped through aging pipelines near our Great Lakes. We need new shutoff valves on both sides of any lake, creek, brook or stream that pipelines would cross.", "Our Great Lakes are under constant threat. Purple loosestrife, zebra mussels, phragmites, Asian carp—there’s a never-ending cavalcade of threats to our Great Lakes. These are threats to our drinking water, our commercial interests, our tourism, our economy and even our property values. We must do more to protect the watersheds and shoreline green spaces that are home to 4,000 species of plants, fish and wildlife.", "In my area, in Windsor–Tecumseh, we promote the 100 Mile Peninsula as a retirement community. We’re nearly surrounded by water, with affordable homes, marinas and waterside golf courses.", "I’ll remind the minister that in 2012 the Liberals said they would put $52 million into the budget to protect and restore the Great Lakes. It didn’t happen.

I want to start off by dedicating this bill, Bill 68, An Act to amend the Municipal Elections Act, 1996 to keep voting places open until 9 p.m., to young people, to students, people in school, and the pages here today. It’s important that they understand what’s involved in the voting process and how democracy works. I think it’s very important that we debate that today.", "These days, there are all kinds of distractions: social media, Google, Facebook, YouTube, emails, texting, and much more. Sometimes people get distracted or don’t focus on what’s really important.", "I think that public service, either as a politician or as a civil servant, is something very important because what happens here or what happens in the federal Parliament or what happens in every city council affects people’s lives every day.", "Earlier this week, we had a model Parliament. Students came in and were able to go through the process and understand the system. But it’s a lot different nowadays than it was before, as I mentioned, with all the distractions. This simple bill hopefully will bring some attention to how government works and whether or not to participate in that.", "Today we’re debating a very simple thing: to keep municipal election voting places open until 9 p.m. instead of 8 p.m. Why is this important? We need to give every voter the opportunity to go out and cast their votes and exercise their civic rights. Furthermore, I think it’s important to start a conversation to make democracy more accessible to all.", "Today, I want to hear from other legislators from all three parties and try to figure out how we create a conversation to increase participation in public office.", "I hope this bill is sent to committee, where we’ll have an opportunity to hear from the public and to hear from the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing and from other civil servants and other members of the public, to get their points of view. Maybe they can amend or change the bill or suggest things so that people will be able to participate and have more voters coming out. We start that today. I fully expect it to hopefully go to committee and to come back up here for third reading debate.", "In some countries—approximately 22—they have compulsory voting, which means that every registered voter has to vote or else he or she is fined or forced to do community service. Some of these countries are in South America, but one of the most interesting examples is Australia. Personally, I don’t think we should use that system, but I want to explain what it does. In Australia, everyone is registered to vote. On election day, they have to bring their voter registration card and vote. If they don’t, the government can do one of two things. They can get a fine or they can be forced to do community work. So of course, voter turnout is really high—in the high 90s; 96%, 97%—depending on which election. That counts both for their federal elections and the various state elections inside Australia.", "I personally don’t agree because in our country we have a charter with fundamental rights, and one of those rights is freedom of expression. If we were to pass a law saying that everybody in Ontario who can vote has to vote, it would probably be challenged in court. I don’t think judges would say that voting is more important than your freedom of expression. What we have to work on is trying to get people to participate, to come out and vote voluntarily, and not to force them to come out and vote.", "Getting back to this bill: Provincial elections are open from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Municipal elections in Ontario start at 10 a.m. and close at 8 p.m. That’s a two-hour difference. Last year, in 2014, we had a provincial election in June and a municipal election in late October. I was involved in both. I had to gear up my campaign, and that election day was June 12. My wife is a city councillor, and her election was at the end of October. So right after my election, I was helping her a bit—not too much; she can do well on her own. But still, I noticed a difference in the timing and how elections came out.", "People have various working hours and different lifestyles today than they had 20 or 30 years ago. Thirty years ago, people usually finished work and the family would gather around the dinner table at 5 or 6 p.m., and people would either vote after that or before that. Nowadays, people have various work schedules. They can work in the evening or in the morning—flexible hours, not just in work, but also for people who are going to school, those who are teachers and people who are involved in other activities across Ontario." ],

I was happy that I won, but for the remaining time until the next election, which would be November 1991, everybody was approaching me and saying, “I got you elected.” It got so ridiculous that I got a phone call from a gentleman one day who said, “You have to come see me because I got you elected. I voted for you, and so did my family, five other people.” I went to his house, and it was a good two or three kilometres outside of my area. So I said to him, “You couldn’t have voted for me.” He goes, “Yeah, well, I found a way to vote for you anyways.” So, again, it was kind of strange, but it was true.", "I want to just review the results of what happened.", "At the federal and provincial—Ontario—levels, we’ve seen a steady decline in voting.", "Back in 1867, 73.1% of people voted federally across Canada. In Ontario, in 1867, 73.9% of people voted. Nowadays, in the last federal election, on May 2, 2011, 61.1% voted. Provincially, they only had the results for October 6, 2011, but the result was 48.2%. That’s less than half of all eligible voters who voted.", "In the city of Toronto, they’ve made efforts to increase voter turnout, and it has worked. They increased the number of advance polls, as I mentioned earlier. In 2010, 50.55% voted, and last year, in 2014, 54.67% voted. There are various factors involved in that: They registered more voters, they advertised more and they had different ways of voting to encourage people to vote. Still, though, it was 54.67%. The other part—let’s say 50%—don’t vote; they don’t bother to.", "So with this bill, I basically want to make sure that people come out and vote, and that their vote counts.

So I support the idea of extending voting hours.", "But I want to talk about two other amendments that I think need to happen to the Municipal Elections Act, which I support and frankly hope we can add to this bill in committee.", "The first is from a member of the government side that they should be very familiar with, because it was an initiative championed by a former Liberal member, Jean-Marc Lalonde. He tabled a private member’s bill to reduce the lame-duck period that exists for municipal councils from their election in late October to December 1, when councils are finally sworn in. As we all know, meetings just took place here in Toronto for the OGRA/ROMA conference. There are many, many municipal issues before them to deal with. They can’t really wait a month, to be stuck in some lame-duck limbo before they get down to business.", "In 2011, Mr. Lalonde’s bill received all-party support, but like so many great initiatives by MPPs in private members’ business on Thursdays, the bill basically didn’t go anywhere after it received second reading.", "The second change I’d like to see is eliminating the excessively severe penalty for municipal candidates who file their expenses after the deadline. For those who are unaware, even one day late triggers an automatic forfeiture of the person’s council seat if that candidate was successful. There’s also a prohibition from seeking municipal office in the subsequent election, whether the candidate was successful or not. This is far more severe, I would suggest, than would happen for any of us if we were late. As most members know, they can ask the Chief Electoral Officer for an extension, and it’s normally granted. The penalty for a municipal election is far more severe.", "This came up in my riding in 2010. My friend Earl Brayton, who is a councillor in the township of Elizabethtown-Kitley, had to go to court to earn a reprieve from the act, costing him a lot of money and a lot of time. So I committed to Earl that I would work to change it. I introduced petitions on his behalf. I wrote to ministers of the day, and I got their assurances that that would happen.", "I actually wrote to Minister Jeffrey in October 2013 to remind her that the window to amend the act prior to the 2014 municipal election was closing. You know what she told me? She told me not to panic. She said they had plenty of time. But we all know that no amendments were made to the act last year for the elections; neither was my request to change the late filing or expense period—that Mr. Lalonde’s bill would have done for the lame-duck period.", "So I guess I have a message to the member for Scarborough Southwest: I say to you that I support your bill, and you can count on my support to try to push some of those other amendments that we need to the Municipal Elections Act.

  "text" : [ "I’m pleased to rise, on behalf of the people I represent in London West, to join the debate on Bill 68, the voting hours extension act, introduced by the member for Scarborough Southwest.", "This is a short bill. In fact, I think it’s one of the shortest bills I’ve seen since I was first elected. It revises the Municipal Elections Act to extend voting hours from 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. Certainly, it’s hard to argue against this change. Making it easier for people to exercise their right to vote is always a good thing: making it easier for people to participate in the democratic process, making it easier for people to cast a ballot and have a say on what happens in their community. There is research to show that making voting more convenient does encourage more people to vote. So it is possible that keeping the polls open one hour longer could increase voter turnout in municipal elections. But research also shows that this kind of reform, this kind of tinkering around the edges, has only a limited and marginal impact. The bill is not a game-changer for democratic participation—not by any stretch of the imagination.", "What would be a game-changer—what would really invigorate and strengthen local democracy—is proportional representation. The problem is not that the polls close at 8 p.m.; the problem is the system of voting, whether at the municipal, provincial or federal level. The problem is the winner-takes-all or first-past-the-post system, which has the same basic flaws at every level of government.", "People don’t feel that their votes count. People don’t feel that their issues matter. This is particularly the case for young people, who were mentioned by the member for Scarborough Southwest. People don’t like the negative and adversarial campaigning that goes along with first-past-the-post. Most importantly, too often the people who get elected do not reflect the diversity of the people they represent.", "The solution for these flaws is proportional representation. A study of 36 democracies over 55 years found that countries using proportional voting systems had a 7.5% increase in voter turnout. They had government policies that were more reflective of the median voter. They had citizens who felt more satisfied with democracy, even when their candidate or their party did not win. Most importantly, they had an 8% increase in the number of women elected.", "Why is it important to elect more women? Because we make better decisions when we hear a diversity of views, when we have different people around the table bringing different experiences and perspectives to bear on the issues at hand. We know that many of the policies we talk about in this place have very different impacts on women, compared to men. Women continue to earn 30% less than men. They continue to be overrepresented in minimum wage jobs. They continue to be involuntary part-time workers because they can’t get child care. They continue to experience violence from male abusers.", "After the last election provincially, it was encouraging to see that we are making progress here in Ontario. We are electing more women, even under first-past-the-post. I’m especially proud that within the NDP caucus, we elected a majority of women MPPs, a first for Ontario and, I believe, for Canada. However, it will take years, even decades at the rate we are going, to achieve gender parity, with women holding 50% of elected offices in Canada. When we look to Europe, we easily see that the best way, the surest way to get more women elected is through proportional representation.", "During the last Parliament, my former NDP colleague Jonah Schein proposed an alternative voting system for the city of Toronto. Many of you were here in this Legislature for the debate about a ranked ballot system. Even though the legislation was specific to Toronto, I have to tell you that the possibility of changing the way citizens vote in municipal elections in Ontario galvanized people in my riding of London West. I must have received over 100 emails from constituents who were eager for change and excited by the prospect of electoral reform, excited by the prospect of engaging more citizens and building a stronger democracy.", "The last time electoral reform was on the table in Ontario was in 2003, when the Liberals formed a citizens’ assembly to look at alternatives to first-past-the-post. After consulting widely, the assembly proposed mixed member proportional representation, which would have allowed voters to vote for both the candidate and the party, the system that is currently in place in Germany and New Zealand.", "The referendum on the proposal was, unfortunately, completely botched by both the Liberal government and Elections Ontario. With minimal budget, no real effort was put into educating the public about the proposal and about the issues involved, and as a result, the referendum failed.", "By all means, let’s go ahead and keep municipal polling stations open one hour longer. We certainly don’t oppose this bill, but I have to say we are very disappointed by the missed opportunity this bill represents." ],

In our ridings, we see first-hand the impact of the decisions made at the municipal level, and so we know that our constituents must have ample opportunity to elect their municipal representatives.

Each of them would benefit in slightly different ways from an extension of the voting hours.", "As the eastern anchor of the greater Toronto area, and sitting along the 401 on its southern border, Durham has a significant number of commuters, of which I am one: men and women, parents with new families and grandparents with established families, business people and community leaders—average people with very busy lives. They all spend significant amounts of time before and after work commuting into the city and returning home later than they would probably like.", "As a commuter myself and a daily passenger on the GO train, I can attest that no matter how comfortable my journey, I return home to my family at an hour too close to 8 o’clock to consider doing much else, let alone travelling to a polling station and voting.", "My constituents should be afforded the time to return home, to tend to their families and the needs in their homes, and still have enough time to make important decisions at a municipal polling station.", "Of course, commuters are not alone in needing more time for voting. Durham, much like other urban-rural ridings on the fringes of large cities, is chosen as the home for many in retirement. Many older Ontarians who do not have the mobility that they require often seek the assistance of family members or transportation services to go about their daily lives. This adds time to the day, and can mean the difference between having enough time to vote and missing an opportunity.", "This sentiment is heard from younger Ontarians as well, who have after-school programs, sports and important social lives.", "The modern lifestyle at all ages is simply too evenly paced, and we must make sure that our democratic systems do not get overlooked in the hustle and bustle.", "I would like to thank the member from Scarborough Southwest again for bringing this bill to the House.

These reforms are necessary and imperative before we can see any hope of turning around the voter turnout numbers and restoring faith into the people who put us in these seats in the first place.", "I think it’s very important that we continue to talk about these issues. I know that in the last four years, I’ve had people in my office each year to talk about proportional representation and to talk about ranked balloting. Certainly, that ranked balloting piece was almost there the last time around. Unfortunately, it didn’t quite make it back into this Legislature. There were committee hearings, and it didn’t make it back.", "I think it’s incumbent on the government to be actually listening to the people of this province when it comes to electoral reforms. Let’s move this piece of legislation forward so that it’s in place in a timely way." ],

I’m very proud to say that I am the first woman elected in the riding of Davenport.", "I also agree with the member when she says that we need to also have a more diverse government. I’m extremely, extremely proud of our Liberal caucus and how diverse we are, representing what is truly our province and all of the various colours, religions, backgrounds, sexual diversity—everything that we have in our province, we have here on this side. So I’m very proud of our Liberal caucus.", "I have to agree with the member from Thornhill when she says that we do need to do a little bit more—and perhaps do a lot more—in terms of educating people on advance polls and how important it is to get people out on advance polls.", "However, I don’t agree with her argument that if we were to have this private member’s bill passed, we would need more volunteers on E-Day. Her argument for advance polls is pretty much the same here: We would also need to have more volunteers helping out at the advance polls. That’s one of the things I don’t agree with.", "Ranked ballots: Members from the third party talked about ranked ballots. I just want to commend the member from Scarborough–Guildwood and all the work that she did in trying to put forth a bill that would actually address the issue of ranked ballots. Unfortunately, we had to go to an election, because members from the opposite side did not want us to pass what we wanted to pass at the time, so that fell off. Had we not had this election, we probably would have had that private member’s bill already as law.", "Today we are here to talk about my colleague from Scarborough Southwest and the private member’s bill that he has presented here today. I want to thank him for bringing forth this important bill. Thank you for putting forward this important piece of legislation, An Act to amend the Municipal Elections Act, 1996 to keep voting places open until 9 p.m., which I’m very proud to speak on today.", "Mr. Speaker, our democratic system underpins everything we do here in the Legislature. The reason we are here today is because constituents from all of our ridings exercised their democratic right to entrust us with these positions. Voting is tantamount to democracy, and as elected officials, it is of absolute importance for us to encourage voting in any way that we can.", "Indeed, much is often said about the troubling trend of low voter turnout. I think it is really our obligation to allow as many people as possible to come out and to exercise their democratic right. One of the primary ways for us to promote voting is really simply by making the polls more accessible to as many eligible voters as we can.", "The member from Scarborough Southwest’s initiative takes important steps to tackle this issue by doing just that. By keeping municipal polls open from 8 p.m. to 9 p.m., we open the democratic system to a much greater pool of potential voters.", "If we look at my riding of Davenport, the utility of such a legislation certainly becomes apparent. Davenport is such a diverse riding, which incorporates a very wide variety of different voters. Whether it is the elderly citizen, blue collar workers or the young professional on west Queen West, I’m always impressed by how active and engaged so many of my constituents are with their local issues.", "However, my constituents, due to their varied obligations, all find difficulties making it to the polls on election night. Working to resolve these difficulties would in turn work to open up our democracy to even more voices. In particular, the elderly in my riding, in the areas like Corso Italia or Little Portugal, find it difficult to reach the polls and, as such, find voting as something difficult.", "Even young people see a disconnect from the ballot box, in part because they are unable to find time to vote after studying all day and working multiple jobs, or after a long commute home. How many people here in this House know how long it takes to commute from one place to the other in this city, and it does take a long time, having to run to catch trains etc. A lot of people in my riding who have to take a lot of transit to get places in the downtown core are finding it very difficult to get to the polling stations for 8 p.m.", "Many families call Davenport their home, and these are often young working families with small children. In many scenarios, the fact that there is an election does not rank as a top priority for such busy individuals. Whether it’s in the northern part of my riding by Eglinton Avenue, or in the condos by Queen Street West, election night is filled with a great deal of confusion unrelated to the casting of one’s ballot.", "In young families, both parents may work all day, and when they come home they need to worry about picking up their children, preparing dinner and spending quality time with their family. After all these duties are properly attended to, it’s often the case that, before you know it, it’s 8:30 at night and the polls are closed. I’m sure that this is often the case for many of my constituents where, for the average person, voting is not prioritized over all of these extremely important obligations.", "I have two young boys, and I know that when I get home, that’s what my end of day is like: trying to make sure that they’ve done their homework, that they’ve studied, that they have their backpacks ready for the next day and we’ve got lunches on the go, after cleaning up the kitchen and getting the kids down to bed. It’s a very, very busy household.", "For a lot of people, it isn’t just apathy in the political system that leads to them not casting their ballots; it really is the busyness of the daily lives.", "The need for this legislation certainly cuts across all ages and employment. While there will be a cost to paying election workers for an additional hour, and the volunteers, in my view, if this means more people will vote, then it is worth it. We as elected officials must work to address the issue of low voter turnout.", "Thank you again to the member from Scarborough Southwest for bringing this important issue to the Legislature here today. I’m happy that I could put my voice in support of this bill and I look forward to further debate on this bill. Thank you." ],

Voting opportunity, then, has to reflect that kind of change in time.", "People have mentioned the advance polls and things like that. Personally, I think that that kind of flexibility in voting is an extremely important element of making voting accessible to people.", "Democracy is a fragile system. It needs a lot of tending, it needs a lot of integrity, and it needs a lot of action to make sure that we have a healthy democracy. One of the least invasive expressions of that is, of course, to show up and vote.", "There was a time not so long ago where you could tell the time by the activities going on in the community. The schools all got out at the same time. People left their offices and workplaces at the same time. With that kind of very strong rhythm, you could also have a reflection of the polling time as being very rigid. But over the years, we’ve seen that kind of predictability of people’s lifestyles challenged considerably. Stores hours are up to 24 hours a day, but they’re certainly very flexible, and family life reflects that change. Work schedules can be varied. The question of transportation—being able to get home in time to vote—is reflected in this private member’s bill. I think it’s really part of that whole process of dynamism in our community and lifestyle today, which is really 24/7.", "I want to end on an interesting historical note, and that is that a couple of hundred years ago it wasn’t uncommon for people who were running for office to offer drinks in the local tavern. That would encourage people to have a better view of how they should vote. There was quite a long period of time when this was allowed, and there was a great deal of urgency that came about to restrict that. There was a time in Ontario when the bars had to close a few hours before the end of voting.", "Reflect back on this time a couple of hundred years ago, when in fact people were making sure that they could encourage voting in a certain direction. The whole history of voting hours is a reflection on our community and our lifestyle. For that reason, it should continue to reflect our lifestyle and make those hours more conducive to the current lifestyle that people have." ],

We had a tour that day and we were sent back to our hotel rooms. I slipped out by myself and decided to take a look at Tiananmen Square. All of a sudden, there was a guy who came up behind me. He was part of the delegation. He said, “What are you doing?” I said, “I’m just taking a walk.” He goes, “Why are you taking a walk?” I said that I just wanted to look around. “I’m going to have to join you here.” I said, “Why?” He goes, “That’s the way our party works, so I’m tagging along.” Then he asked some questions. He goes, “You’re so young. How did you get elected?” I said that I ran for office. He just scratched his head, and he said to me, “In China, the politicians are older men, in their sixties and seventies. How old are you? Thirty years old? What are you doing here?” I thought how fortunate it is that we have the opportunity to exercise our votes and that anyone can run for office. Any one of us can run for office. We all ran. We have different backgrounds. We come together and we debate. This is private members’ time, so we don’t have to vote along party lines.", "I really appreciate all the comments that were made here.

In the fall of 2013, I was happy to put forward the notion in the PC white paper A Champion for Northern Jobs and Resources. In November, over a year ago, I was pleased to speak to the motion that was put forward by the member from Glengarry–Prescott–Russell, which received unanimous support in the Legislature. That was well over a year ago.", "To give a little bit of background, the rules regarding ATVs, all-terrain vehicles, are very specific, and they come from 2003. The definition of an ATV is a vehicle that has four wheels, carries one person and that you straddle—so quite specific. The rules in Ontario allow for an ATV to be used on some designated provincial highways, and otherwise it’s up to municipalities.", "The more rural municipalities tend to be freer in terms of allowing use of ATVs. For example, in the riding of Parry Sound–Muskoka, in Parry Sound district, which is more rural, all the municipalities—I think with the exception of the town of Parry Sound, which is more urban—allow ATVs pretty much anywhere on the roads. In most cases, that’s small back roads, little dirt roads. In the district of Muskoka, it’s a little more of a patchwork; I think the only municipality that allows ATVs anywhere is the township of Georgian Bay.", "In the last couple of years, some of the bigger towns like Bracebridge and Gravenhurst have designated certain parts of the towns where they allow ATVs. For example, I happen to live a half-hour drive from the urban part of Bracebridge, but still in the town. Under the current rules, you can actually ride an ATV on the provincial highway that goes by out to that area; it’s one of the designated provincial highways. But until the town of Bracebridge, just last year, said that you could ATV on the dirt roads in the area of Vankoughnet, where I live, you couldn’t actually ride on the smaller municipal roads. That’s changed, but that’s up to the municipalities, as it should be.", "However, as I mentioned at the beginning, the definition of an ATV is very specific: just one person. In recent years, we’ve seen the development—in the last 10 years, there have been all kinds of UTVs that have been developed that are side-by-side, where you can carry two or three people. They may have bucket seats; they may have a bench seat. They tend to have a pickup box in the back so that you can carry loads of firewood or whatever else you might want to carry. I would say also, with the development of all those vehicles, if anything, they’re probably safer in most cases than a traditional ATV, and they probably have more appeal to, say, seniors who might find it difficult to ride a traditional ATV or people who just want to use them for more work purposes.", "But the way the rules stand right now, if you happen to live in, say, Kearney, north of Huntsville in Parry Sound district, and you’re on some small dirt road, you could drive your ATV down the road to access a woodlot, but you can’t drive the UTV.", "This bill is about expanding the definition of ATVs to include utility task vehicles. Those would be vehicles like a Polaris Ranger or—there are various different models made, by Bombardier, Honda, Kawasaki and Argo. The member from Kitchener–Conestoga has made sure I’m aware that Argos, which are vehicles that have either six or eight wheels and are kind of an amphibious vehicle made right here in Ontario—he wanted to make sure that the definition of UTV included those vehicles.", "In most cases, being able to use a road is just to be able to access a trail. So as I say, if it were me, I might have a 100-acre lot down the road that I want to cut firewood on. I want to be able to drive legally down the dirt road to access that woodlot and then come back without breaking the law. Certainly for the hunting population out there, it would be a case of being able to access the trails or to go between trails—in most cases, a relatively short distance on the roads. People don’t want to be riding them on the roads other than to access trails, in most cases, or to access woodlots. It could be hunters who want to access hunting trails and locations. It might be a farmer who wants to get to another side of his property and needs to go down a side road. It could be a golf course that needs—to go drive down the road a little bit. There are various different situations.", "The rules to do with some vehicles are a little grey. I noticed even around Queen’s Park here, they have some vehicles like—I think it’s a John Deere; I don’t know the name of the actual vehicle, but it’s a UTV. They have a Kubota RTV that they use for salting around the precinct. It could be considered, under the current rules, an instrument of husbandry, in which case, if it has a slow moving vehicle sign, it may be legal, but it’s kind of in a grey area. I know a few years back the Kubota dealership in Bracebridge was just transporting their Kubota RTV to the Bracebridge Fall Fair, assuming that it was legal under the rules to do with an instrument of husbandry, with a slow-moving vehicle sign on it, and they got ticketed by the OPP.", "For the people buying these, we need to have some clarity, and we currently don’t. So that’s what this private member’s bill is about. It’s about providing more access—and I see the time is slipping by quickly, so I would like to read some quotes that I have received in support of the private member’s bill. In particular, I received from ATV Ontario Tourism—that is Andrew Ryeland, who happens to be in the Parry Sound area and operates Bear Claw Tours. He wrote, “ATV Ontario Tourism Initiatives Inc. ... is encouraged to see MPPs from all parties expressing the will to update Ontario’s out-of-date off-highway vehicle regulations. Members like Norm Miller know how important off-highway vehicles are to the economic prosperity of their ridings.” It’s from Andrew Ryeland, president of ATV Ontario Tourism Initiatives. He operates Bear Claw Tours. He does a big event in the spring each year called Spring Jam. I know he also—I’ve seen it on his website—uses Honda side-by-side UTVs as well in his business.", "We have a quote from the Canadian Off-Highway Vehicle Distributors: “COHV supports all responsible efforts to more equitably treat owners and riders of all types of off-highway vehicles. In this regard we strongly support the private members’ bills brought before the Legislature related to more equitable access. Off-road riding is a healthy, family recreation and it contributes significantly to the economy of Ontario.” It’s from Bob Ramsay, president of COHV.", "I’ve had a lot of letters from the Ontario Federation of Trail Riders, quite a few letters. I’ll just summarize a few of them. They want to be included in this legislation. If this bill passes, I would recommend that they come before committee, if it gets before a committee, and/or participate in the review of off-road vehicle safety in Ontario, which was just announced yesterday by MTO, the Ministry of Transportation. They write, “We are happy to support Bill 58 both in its non-partisan spirit and the sound reasoning behind it.", "“Additionally, the Ontario Federation of Trail Riders encourages further enhancements to this bill that would include licensed and insured off-road motorcycles and other recreational vehicles. Our experience has shown that there is a real need to develop improved highway access legislation that serves all types of off-road recreational vehicles, for practical, economic and safety reasons, as well as much-simplified administration and enforcement.”", "They go on; I don’t have time to read it. That was from Brian Knechtel, president of the Ontario Federation of Trail Riders.", "I see I’m down to almost two minutes, so I’m not going to be able to cover all the points that I wanted to.", "I did want to mention that I think Ontario has a lot to learn from Quebec on this file. Currently, the rules in Quebec do allow UTVs on roads. They actually have a network of trails. They even plow the trails in the wintertime for UTVs and ATVs; I’m not sure whether that necessarily makes sense. But I would say, generally, on the trail issue, Quebec does a much better job with trails: with snowmobile trails, with ATV trails, with cycling trails. They have the Route verte that covers the whole province and is also used for snowmobile trails in the wintertime.", "I can see I’m down to a minute, so I won’t be able to tell my whole story.", "I had the pleasure of snowmobiling around the Gaspé, in Quebec, the first week of February. Because they have this fine network of trails, and enough users, it creates a critical mass so that you then have the accommodations and the restaurants, to make for a pleasant experience for somebody who wants to visit the area. I would simply say that we could learn from what Quebec is doing. There, even in the small, little towns, you’ll see people pull up in a UTV, park at a restaurant and go in and eat there.", "I think it’s time to update the rules here in the province of Ontario. I’ve heard from many members on this side of the Legislature who support this: the member from Huron–Bruce, who told me she has heard from a lot of constituents; the member from Haliburton–Kawartha Lakes–Brock; the member from Leeds–Grenville; and certainly the member from Kitchener–Conestoga, who wanted to put in a good plug for Argo.", "I look forward to debate on this issue. I think it is time to update the rules. I was pleased to see announced just yesterday that MTO is starting a process to try to get some input on it." ],

These particular vehicles, I would argue, are a lot safer and afford an opportunity for people to be able to use these things for everything from clearing the snow on their driveways to hauling the garbage to the dump to taking a ride out with your loved one out on a nice dirt road somewhere, to enjoy the outdoors of northern Ontario or southwestern Ontario or wherever you might live in this beautiful province, to go fishing, partridge hunting or whatever it might be. These particular vehicles, I would argue, are a much safer vehicle than others out there that are available for people to be able to cruise the bush with.", "The example was used where a number of people have used these in order to put a plow in front of them, to plow their driveway. There have been a couple of examples where the person is on their property but has to back out onto the road in order to clear the entrance of their driveway, and they get charged because the wheels end up touching the highway or end up touching the municipal road. Clearly, this is something that’s got to be fixed.", "The good news is that we know, as a result of the pressure that was put on by the member from Timiskaming–Cochrane, and now the pressure put on by the member from Parry Sound–Muskoka and others before, that finally the government is moving on doing a consultation in regard to regulatory change that will, hopefully, lead to these particular vehicles being used.", "I can tell you that was greeted in northern Ontario with applause, quite frankly. I know that I heard from my constituency staff and others that across northern Ontario, the news got out yesterday that the government is looking at changing the regulatory part of this in order to allow them to be used. The media across northern Ontario has been quite supportive in thanking Mr. Vanthof the week before, and I’m sure they will do the same for Mr. Miller this time around for actually getting this thing done.", "I think it’s a good demonstration of what can happen at private members’ hour. It’s not just the government that has the good ideas. Members of this assembly from all sides of the House have good ideas that they bring to the floor. In most cases, when you bring a private member’s bill, you’re very, very lucky if you actually get your private member’s bill passed and enacted into law. Normally, they will get second reading. You might be lucky and get some committee hearings. You may even get third reading. But enactment of a private member’s bill sometimes doesn’t even happen after third reading, because normally a government wants to do it themselves. Well, you know what? If the government wants to do this, let’s do it and let’s do it right. Let’s make sure that we consult with those people that need to be consulted with and do this thing because it is the right thing to do.", "Je peux vous dire qu’il y a beaucoup de monde dans mon comté, dans la région de Timmins, Hearst, Kapuskasing, Smooth Rock et d’autres, qui, vraiment, sont contents que le gouvernement a fait ces changements-là parce qu’ils voient, franchement, que les vieux règlements étaient des règlements écrits dans le temps avant que ces machines-là aient même été mises sur le marché. Les règlements avaient besoin d’être améliorés pour être capable de refléter ce qui se passe aujourd’hui avec l’industrie mobilière à travers toute la province. So, donc, c’est une bonne nouvelle.", "Again, I just want to say to my good friend Mr. Vanthof, the member for Timiskaming–Cochrane, job well done. It is pretty clear—it was helpful to be able to bring this forward in getting the government to finally do something that’s right. Let’s hope that there are more things like this that can happen in the future." ],

There has been a lot of interest, as I mentioned a minute ago, in this topic as of late. I know that there are, as of right now, three private members’ bills tabled related to off-road vehicle use, two from the member from Parry Sound–Muskoka, Bills 51 and 58, and one from the member from Timiskaming–Cochrane, Bill 46.", "Bill 46 was debated last week and it received all-party support. The member for Parry Sound spoke during debate on that particular bill.", "Just some statistics on the off-road vehicle piece: In 2013, there were over 407,000 off-road vehicles registered in the province of Ontario. According to the Canadian Off-Highway Vehicle Distributors Council, over 11,000 of these were new ATVs that were sold in Ontario in 2013 alone. That refers to the economic benefit that these vehicles provide in our communities.", "Mr. Speaker, every year more and more people seem to be buying and using these types of vehicles right across the province, and the ORV industry continues to modernize and change. That is why it’s important that we balance this kind of modernization with road safety considerations.", "We should be very proud that we have the safest roads in North America, and I think the people of Ontario need to make sure that we keep that in perspective. But we know that there’s always more that we can do to improve the safety of our roads.", "As always, keeping our roads safe is the highest priority for our government. That is why our government has taken a number of concrete actions to keep both drivers and ORV riders safe. MTO staff continue to work closely with more than 150 road safety partners to develop and implement public education initiatives at the community, regional and provincial level. These partners include police agencies, injury-prevention practitioners, ORV clubs and trail organizations right across the province. MTO staff and these partners attend annual trade shows, make public presentations, develop and distribute public education material, create community displays, and deliver interactive programs to young riders in partnership with local secondary and elementary schools.", "An important component of these initiatives is promoting youth rider safety. I think that’s where it starts. Regardless of the safety that we build into whatever vehicle, we always have to depend on education.", "Ontario’s second annual ATV Safety Week will take place in May 2015. MTO has launched four ATV safety videos to assist the public in learning how to safely operate their ORV. An online knowledge-assessment tool has also been produced to allow riders to test their safety IQ.", "Speaker, as we continue to debate this private member’s bill, I will certainly support the initiative to allow these vehicles, once we’ve hit all the points, to make sure that they’re safe—not only for these vehicles, but also the safety of others, which we sometimes tend to forget. Sometimes we think we know how to handle one of these vehicles, but it’s also people who are not in the vehicle who we have to be concerned about.", "It has been a pleasure speaking to this piece of legislation." ],

That means we’ll have passed a motion and two private members’ bills on the matter. Yet when it comes to action by this government, the wheels in the Ministry of Transportation continue to spin.

Not once, not twice, but as of today, it will be three times.", "I’ve heard from so many folks in my riding of Leeds–Grenville. I’ve written to two Ministers of Transportation. I’ve tabled petitions in support of this issue. Every time, essentially, the response is the same. It’s “Be patient, Steve.” But frankly, people in my riding are running out of patience on this very simple issue.", "Last fall I got an excellent email from Dianne Beach, who lives near Elgin in beautiful Rideau Lakes township, a fabulous place to explore on your ATV. Dianne and her husband own two-up ATVs. She sent me a detailed 10-point email on why they deserve the same treatment as her friends who own ATVs permitted under regulation 316/03.", "I don’t have time to read all 10 points. I just want to highlight a couple. One of them, her number 4: “With these two-ups, we have to have a licence plate for the machine, insurance, road pass and my own driving licence.”", "The point that really hammered home the issue for me was number 7: “We have grandchildren, and they enjoy getting out in the wilderness. They see things otherwise they would never get a chance to—the hidden wonders of the outdoors. What happened to participation and teaching our children of life? We have taught our grandchildren if they see something of interest, we will stop.” I think that’s what the bill is all about: allowing more people to get out and explore what Ontario has to offer.", "In the little time I have left, I just want to talk about two other points.", "The first is what the amendment to regulation 316/03 doesn’t do, and that is allow ATVs, two-ups and side-by-sides on municipal roads. There’s been some confusion in my riding about that. I want to ensure everybody understands that road ATVs are allowed, and those decisions are with municipalities. They’re going to continue to be with municipalities in consultation with their residents. The bill doesn’t change local decision-making.", "The second thing I’ve heard—and the member for Parry Sound–Muskoka mentioned it, and it was mentioned by a number of off-road motorcycle enthusiasts in my riding, like Dave Chartrand of North Augusta, Trevor and Stan Strickland, and Judy Kingston, who are all from Lombardy. It’s the same thing. I know that the member behind me, Mr. Miller, mentioned this issue. The Ontario Federation of Trail Riders had mentioned this, and he mentioned them in his remarks. I agree that we need to get this and the other concerns of the off-road vehicle owners in front of committee.", "Again, I think we all agree on this. For everyone, we’re waiting on action by the government. I truly, truly hope that the third time is the charm. We need to hear a commitment from the minister and their parliamentary assistant, but I’m glad that we’re having this debate again in the House." ],

Although this place tends to be very fractious at times, here’s an issue, the issue of allowing side-by-sides to be governed under the same regulations as all-terrain vehicles, that is agreed on by, you would think, all three parties, because they’ve supported it a couple of times.", "So what’s the problem? Because it would seem that this is a fair—and actually, for the government to do this, they don’t need to pass a law; it’s a regulation change. Those of us in rural Ontario who depend on these vehicles for work, who use them with our families for leisure, for whom it’s become a part of our being, are getting past the point of perplexed about why the government doesn’t move on this.", "But we’ve had a few clues. While we were speaking, the Chair of Cabinet mentioned a couple of times the environmental impact of these vehicles. Perhaps he would rather the people in northern Ontario walk to save what he believes is an impact. These vehicles are tested for their emissions. If they were governed more closely—that could also be governed more closely.", "The fact is, when you have kids or teenagers in my riding who take an ATV to work, as opposed to a 10- or 15-year-old car, I’m sure the ATV has fewer emissions. It’s becoming plainly evident that a lot of people on the other side, on the government side, quite frankly, do not understand rural Ontario.", "Last week, when I was debating basically the same bill, the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change across the aisle said, “You don’t understand, John. This isn’t an urban-rural issue, because I have friends in Muskoka who use these.” Yes, Muskoka is rural Ontario.

If you want to be a cowboy with an ATV, you know what?

Another thing someone brought to his attention, and it’s a valid point: What happens if this regulation is passed and all of a sudden UTVs get to look as big as Ford F-150 pickup trucks?

You hear about the ATVs and the UTVs and you wonder: Is that the same as the closed-circuit TV or the cable TV? In fact, the ATV refers to the all-terrain vehicle, which means it’s something you ride with handlebars, very much like a bike, and the UTV is, as my friends have explained to me, “Think of the paradigm of golf cart.”", "My good friend from Timiskaming–Cochrane talked about: Are there unintended consequences if, to use his analogy, the UTV evolves to be the same size as a Ford F-150? Then we’ll have to address it. I agree with him; I think that’s a perfectly valid point.", "Let me give you an example historically where just such a thing happened. In the 19th century in New Delhi, under the Brits, the British had a problem in that there were too many cobras in New Delhi, so they paid a bounty for every cobra skin that was turned over to them. As it happened, the unintended consequences were that a lot of local people began to breed cobras so that they could turn over the skin and make some money. There is a point to mention to my friend. What happened when the British caught on? All the people who had been breeding them just released them into the streets. But that’s not what we’re here to talk about, because the member has actually introduced a serious measure and I think it deserves a measured response.", "In fairness to my colleague from Parry Sound–Muskoka, I’m just going to quote from a document that he gave me a few minutes ago, and he said, “I didn’t have time to actually mention this.” He pointed out that the Ministry of Transportation is now actually asking for comments in writing and by email on exactly this issue. It’s asking people: Would they send in submissions? So out there, if you have a feeling on this, you’ve got between now and the 13th of April of this year to send in your comments to the Ministry of Transportation. They’re asking a number of questions. They ask, for example: What assessment criteria should the ministry use to determine what roads an off-road vehicle could travel on or along the shoulder of? They ask: Should existing on-road access be maintained? They ask a number of questions that I think are very serious ones. If you have a stake in this, I think you should download this questionnaire, have a look at it, and send it in.", "It also shows something that my friend from Timiskaming–Cochrane was wondering. He said, “Is the government actually going to move?” This is showing—at the risk of being a prop—that the Ministry of Transportation has in fact taken some ownership of the issue and said, “We think it’s time to have an intelligent, adult dialogue about doing something for utility terrain vehicles that we already do for all-terrain vehicles.”", "As an urban member, I’m thinking to myself: If technically, up north, someone who uses a UTV, as both members have mentioned, to do what they have done for years with an ATV—and my friend from Timiskaming–Cochrane talked about: Would an elderly couple who had once had two all-terrain vehicles and who have traded them in for a UTV, something like the equivalent of a golf cart—would they be technically legal if they’re in two ATVs but illegal if they’re driving a UTV? If it sounds like it doesn’t make sense, then that’s why God created a Legislature and put adults here to make good law. That’s what I think we’re trying to do: make some good law in this circumstance.", "Now, I’m kind of interested in that because every year at end of November, in the Streetsville Santa Claus parade, I and my trusty cat, Obi-Wan, drive a golf cart right down Queen Street in Streetsville. Does that mean, on what would be classified as a UTV, that technically I might be in violation of the law? I really don’t know.", "There are apparently, as of the last year for which figures are available, some 407,585 off-road vehicles registered in Ontario, and some 11,000 new ATVs were sold in Ontario in 2013 alone. So, very clearly, this is an issue that the province needs to take seriously, devote some thought to and come up with a workable framework of law to allow people who have a UTV which they intend to use for the purpose for which the vehicle was designed, where they don’t, for example, intend to use it in an urban park—and as my colleague from Parry Sound–Muskoka pointed out to me, many of these laws are in fact the children of the municipality, not the province. It means that what’s right in the north need not necessarily be right in an urban area, which I think is intelligent.", "All in all, I think the member has brought forth a measure that definitely deserves discussion. I think we’re all going to vote for it in this House." ],

So the act should also include the word “tracks,” specifically, to avoid any confusion. I want to say thanks to my friend Richard for passing that point on to us.", "The Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters has sent a letter to the Minister of Transportation to this effect with respect to the bill, and is calling on the revision of the Highway Traffic Act to include the currently undefined classes of off-road vehicles. In ATV clubs and trail organizations, members are also reaching out with calls for action.", "The gap in the legislation makes it difficult for ATV clubs and trails associations, as users who prefer this newer class of vehicle and may be less inclined to purchase permits as they’re not legally able to use the vehicles on public property. The limitations in the use of these off-road vehicles are not always made apparent when you go and purchase one of these vehicles.", "In conclusion, let me say that other jurisdictions have embraced defining new classes of off-road vehicles. Quebec, for instance, allows them under similar regulation as traditional models and continues to benefit from tourism on public trail systems. Surely we can look at the Quebec example and make this work here in Ontario.", "This is a good bill. We can do this in Ontario. It makes sense.

They highlighted a couple of different things for me, Speaker.", "First, they felt they didn’t have access to the retail market that was necessary for the industry to grow. Second, they felt that regulations around the transportation of their product were ridiculously out of date.", "Many of the people I met on that trip to the county have remained friends and valuable sources of information ever since, whether it was Caroline Granger, from the Grange of Prince Edward County; Lanny Huff, from Huff Estates; or Richard Karlo, from Karlo Estates.", "I was thinking about this in my office just the other day: If I had to do one thing over again, I might change the name of this act. Many times in this House, Mr. Speaker, I’ve gotten to my feet and taken a poke at the government for introducing bills with great names that really don’t do much. I wanted to introduce a bill with a great name that actually did something. If this bill gets to committee, Mr. Speaker, I think I might amend one thing, and that would be the name.", "You see, my friend Richard Karlo lost his battle with cancer last year. Within two years of opening Karlo Estates, he made that winery profitable in Prince Edward county, something that is almost unheard of when we talk about the wine industry. My heart goes out to his wife, Sherry Martin, as well.", "Rick’s wines made it to the wine list at the Royal York hotel and the Toronto International Film Festival. He fought the LCBO’s Cellared in Canada labelling, which would have given a marketing advantage to wines where up to 99% of the grapes harvested for a particular wine could be grown outside of Canada.", "Last year, after we lost the election, I went into my office, and there was an email from Richard. He had watched the results come in. He told me to keep my chin up, and he said, “You should think about running for the party”—advice that was indicative of the incomparable King Richard I met in 2011, described in the National Post as the Indiana Jones of the Ontario wine industry.", "I didn’t take his advice, Mr. Speaker, and here we are today.", "I know it is strange to lead off a discussion of your own bill by talking about one thing you might like to change. But I think this bill should probably be called the Richard Karlo act.", "That having been said, there is a lot packed into this bill that would help the beverage alcohol industry in this province grow and create more jobs. I think we all want that.", "In 2014, the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario conducted a report to review the regulatory regime surrounding beverage alcohol in Ontario. In that report, the AGCO looked at a number of regulatory changes put forth by proponents seeking to make changes to the way our growing beverage alcohol industry does business.", "Back when I used to call OHL games, there used to be a rule of thumb for an Ontario Hockey League franchise. One third of the franchises made money, one third broke even and the final third lost money. I sat down with the Prince Edward County Winegrowers Association over the recess this winter and was told that the reality for Ontario Hockey League clubs isn’t all that different for winegrowers either. The bigger operations seem to make some money—some of them actually make a lot of money—and the more medium-sized wineries with strong regional presence do a little better than breaking even, but for many vintners in Ontario their winery is quite literally a labour of love.", "I hear from those people all the time that they do it because they love it, not because they’re getting rich. Their profits are their vintages at the end of the day. Many of them labour for years to produce a great pinot noir or an award-winning chardonnay. The question has to be: How can we make it possible for some of these great Ontario products to end up in the hands of Ontario customers, either at special events or at restaurants across the province?", "One way is to loosen some of the transportation regulations regarding the delivery of alcohol. As the AGCO report itself states, “It was therefore suggested that the relevant regulation should be amended to permit liquor delivery services to offer their services to business customers.” Presently, if the Grange of Prince Edward, which is a great winery, is making a delivery of product on a truck that is half-full, it can’t pick up products from other wineries or pick up products from the craft distillery in Prince Edward county and drop it off at the same point, which seems ludicrous to me. The two companies must contract the vehicle of a third-party company to do this.", "Wineries in particular in the county are used to working together because they have the Prince Edward County Winegrowers Association. If one were to deliver to a restaurant in Belleville, Kingston or Ottawa, delivering alongside other wineries or the County Cider Co., which has the great Waupoos Cider, they are right now forbidden by regulation if those products are on the same vehicle. It just doesn’t make any sense.", "As the AGCO also states, the existing regulation with direct delivery to licensees already causes problems and a decrease in business for the producers. When I go to a restaurant here in Toronto and I want to order wine, I usually have a choice between maybe one or two—maybe three—of the wineries from Prince Edward county. I might be able to order a Huff’s; I might be able to order a Sandbanks or a Casa-Dea or maybe a Karlo. But we have so many other great wineries in Prince Edward county whose access to market is being inhibited by the current structure and the current set-up.", "That brings me to the second major facet of the bill, which is cross-selling. To quote once again from the government’s own AGCO report, proposals include “allowing breweries to sell the beer of other beer manufacturers at their on-site brewery retail stores,” which they call “cross-selling.” Recently in this province, we’ve had an ongoing discussion about the retail sale of beer. It has been a hot topic.", "Right now, if you want to buy a beer in Ontario, you have three options. You can buy it at the Beer Store, the LCBO or on the site where it’s brewed. That’s it—the retail store at the on-brewery site. If you’re a craft brewer in this province, that means that the only retail options outside of your brewery are controlled by either the government or your major competitors. No other product has this type of retail environment that is this constrained, and that’s a shame.", "We’ve seen a boom in craft beer growth in the United States, in states like New York and Oregon. The number of craft breweries there has taken off, and they’re not just making great beer; they’re creating jobs in those states. But here in Ontario, once again, the transportation and retailing regulations make it hard to grow a business. I can order almost any great Ontario craft beer here in Toronto or buy it at the LCBO, but back home at Earl and Angelo’s steakhouse in downtown Belleville or at the Waring House in Picton, you’d be lucky to find options much beyond a Steam Whistle or a Mill Street if you’re looking for a craft beer—not that there’s anything wrong with those products; they’re great, but there are so many others out there that we should be opening the market up to.", "Last summer I was having a barbecue with some friends and I wanted to stock up on some Twice as Mad Tom, which is a great craft beer from Muskoka. You can find it here in Toronto. Within a half-hour drive of my house, in the Stirling area, there are eight LCBOs and there are four Beer Stores. Do you think I could find Twice as Mad Tom at any of those stores? No, I couldn’t.", "Under this bill, Barley Days Brewery, which is in my riding in the Picton area, would be able, as a member of the Ontario craft beer association, to stock Muskoka products at their onsite brewery store. Effectively, this would turn these stores from showrooms for a single label into small, private craft beer stores across the province. It would allow wineries and distilleries to do the same thing, if they so choose. The AGCO report noted that small brewers in particular would welcome this opportunity.", "The final piece is the introduction of a warehousing system outside of the current LCBO system. If we’re going to loosen the direct delivery regulations to allow businesses to expand, we have to be serious about it.", "If you’re a brewer in Kitchener or a winery on the south coast, say, in Norfolk or Essex counties, but you’ve got a licensee in Ottawa or Sudbury interested in your product, same-day service is pretty much logistically impossible.", "However, if you or the manufacturers’ association to which you belong have licensed and bonded warehouse spaces available, you have the ability to not only expand but grow province-wide as a brand if you can meet the demand. That’s the kind of market we should be establishing for Ontario-grown products.", "There’s a winery in Prince Edward county called Casa-Dea Estates. My friend Paul Marconi runs that winery." ],

I think there are things that we’ve done, and I think there are things that can be done, in order to make that happen.", "But I do believe that the LCBO is the premier flagship, I would say, almost worldwide of the places that I’ve seen where we have the sale of alcohol.

I’m sure there would be some who would be, but, quite frankly, I think it’s a bit problematic.", "The larger issue is, why would we try to break up essentially what is a good system that we have currently today with the LCBO? They’re very well organized. They have a huge selection when it comes to product. It’s not as if we’re without the ability to find a store somewhere in Ontario to buy those products we want to buy. But at the same time, it is an opportunity for the province to generate much-needed revenue that we don’t have to take by way of additional taxation. If we decided that we wanted to diminish their market share by going in this direction, and that’s ultimately what would happen, it really means to say we’re undercutting ourselves as a province, or we’d have to increase the taxes on the products that are sold privately in order to make up the difference, which would mean that consumers potentially could end up paying more.", "For a number of reasons, I just want to say up front that I will be voting against this, and I assume the members of our caucus will do the same for reasons that are going to be put on the record a little bit later by my good friend the member from Toronto–Danforth, Mr. Tabuns, who will speak to this as well.", "I also just want to say that I think the one thing the LCBO has done well over the last while is that they’ve been really good at allowing new products to go into their stores and to get shelf space in order to sell.

I’m going to be looking forward to the debate and eventually seeing this bill go through committee for further review. But I think the fundamental principles of what the member for Prince Edward–Hastings is trying to achieve are things that I certainly support, and I think many people on this side of the House would support.", "The notion that this is to simply create a parallel retail distribution network, as the member for Timmins–James Bay said, misses the point. I think what the member for Prince Edward–Hastings is trying to get to is that this is about creating not just new outlets for the sale of beer, wine and spirits for producers, but it’s about creating those experiences that visitors—whether they’re Ontario visitors to another region of Ontario or tourists from outside of Ontario—seek to have by sampling different wines, sampling different beers and different brew products. So I think this notion about being able to introduce more ability to cross-pollinate the craft brewer industry, the winery industry, is an excellent notion. I think that’s certainly very consistent with some of the review that the government has been undertaking through the council on review of government assets, which is not just looking at how to realize more revenue for the government, but to modernize how we do things.", "Certainly, in terms of Etobicoke–Lakeshore—unfortunately, I don’t have any wineries in my riding, but I have three fabulous craft brewers: Great Lakes Brewery, Cool Beer and Black Oak. Over the last few weeks during the break, I took it upon myself to visit these three establishments, talk to them, see their operations and ask them how they think the current system is working. I may have also sampled some of their products along the way.", "What’s clear from that is their ability to work together in a community would be enhanced and that would create a better experience for consumers as well as for the manufacturers. I don’t think it would take away from the ability of a well-managed, government-run institution like the LCBO to continue to thrive. I think what it would actually do is it would create more economic activity. I think it would create more jobs, more sales and more tax revenues. Tax revenues flow to the government and benefit the residents of Ontario ultimately. I think from that perspective, this is something that we should be looking at.", "As I mentioned, the review that Mr. Clark is doing for us through the council on government assets is looking at how we could improve the sale of beer in this province, looking at ways that we could maximize the revenues from the sale of beer, alcohol and spirits. That kind of work: looking at some simple things like whether you sell six-packs or 12-packs or even two-fours in liquor stores or maybe allow some other retail outlets to sell brewed products. These are the kinds of innovative ideas this government is looking at. When a member of the official opposition comes up with good ideas, I applaud him. I will be supporting this at this stage and I would urge my colleagues to do so as well.", "We talk a great deal in this House about wanting to create a better economic climate in this province, and I can think of no better way than taking steps that encourage the entrepreneurs, those who create the vast majority of jobs in this province, to make their lives a little bit easier and at the same time make this province a little bit more fun to live in and more fun to visit. I think these types of measures would assist that.", "Certainly when we do that, then we will see the economic growth. We will see the growth in tax revenues. We will see that support for this government’s ability to pay for our 10-year, $130-billion infrastructure plan, for the $29 billion that we want to invest in public transit, roads, bridges and transportation infrastructure throughout the province so that those very entrepreneurs who have product to move in this province will be able to move it more effectively and so that the tourists who want to go and visit these wonderful establishments throughout the province will be able to get to them more easily and more safely.", "I say to the member for Prince Edward–Hastings, I raise a glass to your bill, and I look forward to the rest of the debate.

This bill actually addresses quite a few of the concerns that they’ve been asking about for a number of years. Being able to cross-sell their brew with other breweries throughout the province, in addition to being able to transport their beer throughout the province and sharing the load with other breweries, will not only decrease their costs but also enhance their ability to grow and, at the end of the day, create more jobs. I think that’s really what Ontario needs now. Craft brewers of this province are one of the leading job creators in the marketplace, and they only continue to grow as craft brewers grow.", "Speaker, I have Railway City brewery in my riding, which I truly do support. I just have to make mention of two brews that they do special limited editions of that I really enjoy. The Witty Traveller they come out with during the summertime—you can only get it in the summer. It’s a great way to cool your thirst during the summer. Also, during Christmastime, the Cranberry Festive Lager is made with their southern rail line beer, and throw a little cranberry in it. It’s probably one of the best-tasting Christmas beers I’ve ever had. In fact, I still have a bunch left in my fridge that I hope to enjoy later on this year.", "But I do have to mention that we do have a couple of wineries in my riding that I’m quite proud of: The Carolinian winery, which is out in Thorndale, they just purchased Rush Creek winery near Aylmer, and they do fruit wines, which is really good. Of course, we have Quai du Vin. It’s a long-time winery just outside St. Thomas on Fruitridge Line. Jamie Quai is now running it. I think this will be an added benefit to them, especially with the transportation of their product to other areas throughout the province. When you can decrease the costs that these wineries and breweries have in their business, they’re going to expand, they’re going to grow, and it’s going to be a plus for Ontario.

That’s what this bill does. It’s not sort of at the core of it. It’s not sort of hidden anywhere. It’s really straightforward. If you manufacture spirits, if you ferment wine, if you ferment beer, you’re going to be able to sell products and sell products that everyone else produces, as well. This is a privatization initiative. I’m surprised to see that the member from Etobicoke–Lakeshore is in support of this bill, because my understanding has been that the Liberals have understood, to some extent, the importance of keeping the LCBO in public hands, the importance of that revenue for our health care services, for education.", "The reality, Speaker, is that people in this province don’t want privatization. They don’t want privatization of the LCBO. They don’t want privatization of their electricity systems. We went through this debate about five years ago when Dwight Duncan and Dalton McGuinty hired Goldman Sachs—those wonderful financiers, those geniuses behind the Greek economic miracle—to ask them how to privatize OLG, LCBO, OPG. In the end, Dalton McGuinty and Dwight Duncan, in a majority government situation, realized that, politically, it was a total loser, and they dumped it.", "In this province, we hear constantly about the need for funding for education, about the shortfalls in funding for education. We had nurses filling this chamber this morning, desperate for recognition of their wages, desperate for investment in health care, desperate for equity between those who work in hospitals and those who work in communities. Where will that money come from?", "This is a government that has been cutting corporate taxes for a decade. This is a government that has been saying, “We need all these services, but we don’t have the money to provide them.” Why on earth would this government vote for a bill that would undermine the very sources of revenue that we need to provide the services to a modern society that has a chance of competing in this global economy?", "Mr. Speaker, look at some of our experiences with privatization in this province. The Conservatives started the privatization of the electricity system. At the end of the 1990s, that program rolled out under their jurisdiction till about 2003, and then that program was carried forward on a piecemeal basis by the Liberals. What has come with it? Soaring prices for electricity. An undermining of our economy. Hardship for families who are trying to keep the lights on and keep themselves warm, and in the summer, obviously, keep themselves cool. People finding that their household budgets are stretched to the limit. Why? Because this government decided that privatization was a good thing. They didn’t do it overtly the way the Tories did. They did it silently, a piece at a time. But in the end, the effect is the same: a huge rise in prices, a reduction in the standard of living. This bill continues that kind of thinking.", "The Auditor General’s most recent report noted that this government, through its commitment to public-private partnerships—the privatization of public infrastructure—had wasted $8 billion. Eight billion dollars is a lot of money. You can build a lot of hospitals. You can repair a lot of schools. You can hire a lot of child care workers. You can put people in place to help children with special education. When you privatize public services, when you privatize public agencies that make money that we use for services, then ultimately those services are cut.", "Speaker, this bill represents an honest expression of Conservative ideology. Fair enough. I don’t think that’s an approach that’s actually going to allow this province to grow. It’s an approach that will undermine our services. Frankly, it’s an approach that the Liberals, who speak for services, should be opposing." ],

They said, “We’re not efficient. We hire a lot of people.” At that point, they were in an old co-op building in downtown Bracebridge which was a good retail outlet as well, but because they grew so much—they’ve doubled and doubled their output—they actually moved into the old Alcan plant in Bracebridge, which was a much more efficient operation for producing the beer.", "The crazy part about the rules in Ontario is that they had to give up their retail outlet in downtown Bracebridge—a much better place for people actually looking to buy beer because the rules say that you can only sell the brew where you make it.

  "text" : [ "I’m honoured today, as I am every day that I have the opportunity to stand in this fine chamber and speak on behalf of my constituents in my riding of Oshawa.", "Today it is my distinct pleasure to rise to discuss Bill 40, An Act to amend the Crop Insurance Act (Ontario), 1996 and to make consequential amendments to other acts. It is also referred to as the Agriculture Insurance Act.", "My remarks follow in the footsteps of the always illuminating member from Timiskaming–Cochrane, who also serves as our party’s critic for agriculture, food and rural affairs. In this role he delivered impassioned and poignant remarks on this bill prior to the Legislature break in December, and as a lifelong farmer, his remarks are insightful and immensely valuable.", "As members of provincial Parliament, we have the opportunity to learn about and speak about such a vast array of topics and subjects, and consequently we often call on the expertise of others to form what we hope are balanced and well-reasoned positions. But on that day, it was especially exciting to watch my colleague the member from Timiskaming–Cochrane speak not just on an academic level but on a personal level about a topic that he has not only learned, but lived. For that, I thank him and hope to echo some of his sentiments here today.", "In that vein, I would like to begin by restating a brief passage of his speech that I feel encapsulates a concern that we, as members, hear far too often from our constituents. Speaker, what this legislation does is that “it changes words so that this could happen. It changes it from the Crop Insurance Act to the agricultural products act, I believe. That needs to happen in order to proceed, but that doesn’t guarantee that other products will actually be covered. It’s changing the wording. It’s an important step, but a very small step. It’s a step that could have been taken at any time in the last 11 years.", "“It’s worthy to note that Ontario is the last province to actually move in this direction. We sometimes hear that Ontario is a leader” in climate change. “‘We’re a leader in climate change,’ the government says, ‘and we’re a leader in this.’ They’re certainly, absolutely not a leader in agriculture production insurance. They’re not a leader, they’re a laggard, and that’s important to note.”", "And he goes on: “As much as we support this legislation.... [this] legislation in itself is not going to be that change. There is a lot of work and consultation to be done. This is a step—an important first step, but it is merely a step.”", "And so, Mr. Speaker, our concern is not with the content of this bill. We support this bill and what it represents. Our concern is with the time it has taken the government to realize it. It should be noted that Ontario is the only province that does not allow production insurance for a broad range of agricultural products, so you can see why the agricultural industry has been calling for this change. It is another great example of how this government has managed to distinguish our province. Other such examples include having the highest tuition rates in Canada and the greatest net debt of any province in the country, so it is another area where the government needs to make necessary changes, and they need to happen now.", "Agricultural insurance is one of the fundamental tools that we have to protect farmers and ensure food security for our province. It makes sense to ensure that all agricultural products are covered under this program, not just crops. So our concern is with the government’s motivations. As my colleague stated, this is a change that should have been put forward a decade ago, and there was no reason why it couldn’t have been put forward then. So while we appreciate that the change is being made, we are reminded of why so many believe that government is too slow or just generally behind the times. I guess the government must reap what it sows on this one.", "I understand that there will always be outstanding changes that need to be made, but this bill represents a shining example of this concern and the reason for public disenchantment. For those who haven’t read the bill, it consists of a few pages of mostly the same statement: “ ... of the act is amended by striking out ‘agricultural crop or perennial plant’ and substituting ‘agricultural product’.”", "Of course, the implications of this are significant and its impact will be far-reaching within the agricultural community. Farmers and agricultural experts have been calling for this change for years, and I am pleased to have the opportunity to join their voice in support.", "It is also noted in this bill that the government will need to pass regulations once the bill passes. I hope, for the sake of the agricultural community, that those regulations are not going to take another decade to see the light of day. As I mentioned earlier, I’m not a farmer, but I’m pretty sure that if it took them 10 years to plant their field, it would have some pretty significant repercussions for their harvest.", "There are also concerns about the government’s commitment to fund this bill. Ultimately, its implementation is going to cost money, yet no funding has been earmarked in the budget for this change.", "Speaker, I will once again refer back to my colleague from Timiskaming–Cochrane for further background on the reasons for our concerns, and I again quote.", "“The cost of production insurance is shared by three partners: farmers, the provincial government and the federal government. It’s shared 40% by farmers, 24% by the province and 36% by the feds, and there’s the issue, because there’s no money on the table. We waited 11 years for a word, but there’s no money on the table, and that’s really important, Speaker, because we know that there’s no money in a lot of places. In fact, a lot of places are losing money.", "“There is another program where farmers worked together with previous Ministers of Agriculture. It’s a risk management program. The production insurance that we’re talking about today covers the actual production: how many tonnes of crop you get from a field, how many bushels of potatoes.... Risk management covers the price you get. With risk management you can insure yourself to make sure that—because crop prices go up and down, so it can kind of even it out. Agricultural groups, with the provincial government, got together and they did a really good job. They created a risk management program bar none for the province of Ontario. It was bankable; it was predictable. That’s what agriculture needed. Then this government capped it.", "“It was estimated that for this program to run efficiently and to make sure that the agricultural sector, the base production sector, which actually drives the agri-food industry in our province, which creates, I believe, $30 billion or $34 billion in economic activity and fuels 740,000 or 750,000 jobs—that’s all based on the primary producer being solid, bankable and predictable so he can go to his bank and say, ‘I need to borrow X so I can plant my crops.’", "“That’s what we had with the risk management program. Then this government capped it, so it’s no longer bankable or predictable. Does it help? Yes. Are the commodity organizations going to chastise the government? No, because at the end of the day, it’s the government. But, in all reality, Speaker, for that risk management program to work, the cap has to be raised close to what it was when the program was originally designed, which is between $175 million and $200 million.", "“Why that’s important ... and why that has something to do with production insurance is because for the production insurance to be moved over, or for the umbrella to cover more commodities, the money is going to have to come from somewhere to pay the province’s portion. That hasn’t been identified.”", "I should also note that the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs is among the ministries facing annual cuts of 6% per year, every year, for the next three years. I hope the government is accounting for this anomaly as they draft the required regulations.", "As we have stated before, this is an important change that experts and stakeholders have been demanding for years, so we want to make sure the government has dotted its i’s and crossed its t’s. It is our job as members on this side of the aisle to hold the government to account, and we don’t want anything left up to chance, just as the agricultural community is going to want some assurance when it comes to their insurance. That’s what this bill is about.", "Insurance provides a level of stability. It provides guarantees and peace of mind. Currently, there are large portions of the agricultural sector that do not have the opportunity to be a part of this program. As a specific example, Mark Wales, president of the Ontario Federation of Agriculture, told Better Farming, “We’ve been working on getting more crop insurance products for quite some time.” Livestock farmers “have been promised crop insurance for more than a decade, going back to the agricultural policy framework in the early 2000s.”", "The fact is that farmers have needed these changes for a long time. Pork farmers should have had access to insurance against PED. Beef farmers should have had access to insurance against BSE. No, Speaker, I’m not going to attempt to pronounce the full names of those diseases, but what I will do is say that both of these diseases represent the same thing: instability. Just as any company insures their building in case of fire or theft, the agricultural industry should be able to insure its assets against outside risk factors.", "This program currently protects producers from yield reductions and crop losses caused by factors beyond their control, including drought, disease, pests, frost and floods. Any of these can cause significant volatility to a farmer’s business. Regardless of the precaution they take, there is nothing that can guarantee protection from a pest or invasive species.", "I had the opportunity to learn about invasive species recently. The Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters is headquartered in Peterborough, not far from my riding, and I popped in and enjoyed the opportunity to meet with them over the winter break. I did my undergraduate degree, interestingly, in biology and was able to have conversations about fish, fish science, fishing and conservation, and we talked about invasive species. They primarily focus on the threat of invasive species to Ontario’s lakes and wetlands, but potential for catastrophic damage is consistent with the concerns that the agricultural sector faces with a number of pests.", "In partnership with the Ministry of Natural Resources, the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters developed the Invading Species Awareness Program in response to the fact that “invading species can have devastating effects on native species, habitats and ecosystems.” This is the same devastation that harmful pests can have on crop yields, and it’s the reason why agricultural insurance is just as necessary as insurance is to any other industry and why it is important that this program is expanded to include livestock.", "I’ll also take this opportunity to invite everyone, outdoor enthusiasts, to stop in and visit their new heritage and education centre. You can learn all about invasive species and more.", "There are actually a lot of similarities between this and some of the other issues I’ve been speaking about in my role as the NDP pension critic. This is also about ensuring stability for Ontarians and for Ontario’s economy. Leaving people in the lurch prevents them from effectively planning for their future and limits their ability to act as freely as they otherwise would, whether that be investing in their farming business or contributing to their local economy with a greater discretionary income. It benefits all of us when an entire sector, especially one as significant as the agricultural sector, is more effectively able to plan and grow.", "As I stated in a speech to the Legislature just last week: “We don’t want our communities to suffer. As Ontarians, I don’t believe we want our neighbours to struggle. We don’t want our businesses to go under. We don’t want our young people to feel hopeless. We don’t want our seniors hungry and destitute. We want people employed. We want people to be secure and comfortable in their golden years.”", "Stability is important for a business, important for a farm, just as it is for a family, and it is another important reason why I support this bill.", "Speaker, I would be remiss to not take a brief moment to at least recognize the important role that the agricultural community plays in all of our lives every day. They grow the food we eat, provide the milk we drink and play a foundational role in the economy in our province and across the country. The reach of their industry extends far and wide.", "We are all well aware of the rise in obesity rates across North America and the effect that this has on the well-being of our citizens, and the cost it has on our health care system. As a teacher, I am reminded of the importance of food literacy, which is a topic also endorsed by the Ontario Federation of Agriculture, and that the greatest indicator of a healthy diet is not what you eat but where that food is from.", "Generally speaking, the closer we are to where our food is produced, the better it tends to be for us. In schools, we talk about nutrition, and locally grown food needs to be a part of that conversation. Fruits and veggies that ripen on the vine, in the field or on the tree have far more nutrients than those that ripen in a cargo container. Sometimes the simplest answer is the best one, and when it comes to food literacy, there are few better pieces of advice than increasing the amount of locally grown produce in your diet.", "On a side note, if I may, for anyone that is interested, it is worth taking a look into the Good Food Box program from FoodShare. It’s basically a subscription service for local produce that provides members with a box of fresh, in-season fruits and vegetables on a weekly, bi-weekly or monthly cycle, all for the purpose of fostering community development and promoting healthy eating. I think any time that we can bring the community and health together, we’re going to strengthen our societies.", "As I’ve stated a few times now, I may not be a farmer, but, as I said in my inaugural speech back in July, I did talk about my affection and affinity for backyard gardening. When it’s a little bit less chilly than it is now, I tend to spend whatever time I can growing heirloom and organic vegetables and herbs in my backyard. Though my production output may not be on the same scale as my esteemed colleague from Timiskaming–Cochrane—" ],

Feed the Need Durham is an organization in my riding founded on the principle that hunger should not be the reason to prevent anyone from the chance to fulfill their potential. As an extension of that principle, they provide not only non-perishable foods and items but also distribute fresh produce to 46 member agencies across Durham region. Though I may be getting a little off topic, I like to take every opportunity I can to mention Feed the Need Durham and thank them for the incredible work they and all those member agencies do in our community. And, by extension, the families and community members they support appreciate having fresh fruits and vegetables on their tables at home.", "The point is, the impact of the agricultural community is far-reaching. So it is important that we, as legislators, listen to the industry and work with them to pass the changes they need to grow, if you’ll pardon the pun. That is what this bill does, albeit more than a little late and in the form of little more than enabling legislation, but ultimately a necessary step toward necessary change for farmers across the province.", "Before my time expires, I wish to remind the government that their job is not complete and that there are still regulations that need to be drafted before livestock farmers and other producers are protected under the insurance program. New funding will also be needed unless the government decides to institute further cuts elsewhere as well. I ask that these changes are made promptly and properly to permit the best possible environment for our agricultural community to grow and flourish.", "I thank all those who will speak today and have spoken before on An Act to amend the Crop Insurance Act. I thank the minister for tabling this bill, delayed or not, and I thank my esteemed colleague the member from Timiskaming–Cochrane for his expertise and experience on this particular subject. Most importantly, I thank the agricultural sector for all the reasons we have discussed here today.", "Our three parties may disagree on a lot of things, but this is one we fortunately do agree on. This bill is about ensuring stability for an industry that creates hundreds of thousands of jobs and infuses tens of billions of dollars into our economy. So it’s important that it is passed promptly and that the necessary regulations follow suit. It isn’t just that we all need to eat; we need to eat well, we need to eat healthfully, and we need to support our farmers and our agricultural sector as they endeavor to provide that for us.", "Thank you again for this opportunity to speak to Bill 40.

In fact, there are four classes of agricultural land. Class 4 doesn’t mean that it can’t be used. I think it’s really important for land use planning to be able to look at that potential, to look at all four classes and how they support each other in different crop ways.", "This is something that I’m aware the OFA is concerned about.

  "text" : [ "I’m very happy to speak in the House today and to show my full support for Bill 40, the Agriculture Insurance Act (Amending the Crop Insurance Act, 1996), put forth by the Honourable Jeff Leal, Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, who does a great job for our farming community.", "The bill amends the Crop Insurance Act of 1996 to expand the insurance. Currently the act applies to “agricultural crops” and “perennial plants.” The bill would expand the act so that it would apply to all agriculture products that are designated by the minister for regulation.", "The insurance unveiled by Bill 40 puts more commodities under that umbrella, and that’s the long and short of this. It hasn’t been updated since 1996. It’s long overdue. If passed—and I certainly hope it will be—Bill 40 would expand Agricorp, which covers production losses and yield reductions caused by insured losses for vegetables, fruit and honey, forage—which is grasses and other plants that are eaten by animals such as cows, and perennial plants. There is no doubt that there needs to be an expansion of the list of agriculture products under Ontario’s Agricorp. Today’s threats of invasive species, volatile agriculture commodity markets and increasing frequency of very extreme weather events—something called “climate control”—are amongst just a few of those reasons.", "I can tell you that my relatives came to this area, the GTA, from Tipperary, Ireland, back in 1846. They landed in Pickering, in Cherrywood. They were farmers: the Teefys. They ended up with several farms. They now have farms across Ontario. They have done just wonderful, wonderful things, and they would have been thrilled with this legislation today. As they look down upon me—as most Irish people do, they’ll say, “Thank you very much.”" ],

I don’t come from a farming background per se. We may not think of farms in Oshawa, but we are surrounded by fields and farms. At a morning at one of our vibrant farmers’ markets, you can see the showcase of what surrounds us and what we’re able to easily access and benefit from.", "My introduction to farming since being elected was the trip to the International Plowing Match. While that was a great opportunity to connect with the agricultural community in a big way, I think it’s important for us as legislators to recognize that our role is more than to have our picture taken with a shiny tractor. I was on the float that was actually driven by a shiny tractor—well, it wasn’t that shiny, but a tractor that was driven by our member from Timiskaming–Cochrane—and it is wonderful as a caucus to be able to draw from our strengths and our backgrounds in that way.", "While I said that I may not come from a farming background—I had the opportunity to speak about this before—my father has decided to become a farmer in his retirement, and he has wonderful adventures that I can learn from. I’ve learned that there is such a thing as a deer fence: that you have to build a fence of a certain height to keep the deer from hopping into your orchard and the area where you’re growing your goodies. I get to hear stories about that. He has also built a chicken coop, and has wonderful stories about chickens and roosters. While this bill may not affect him, I think we can all appreciate that farming hits very close to home on our table." ],

  "text" : [ "I’m pleased to get involved in the debate for Bill 40, the Agriculture Insurance Act, an act to amend the Crop Insurance Act, 1996. I appreciate the chance to speak and to bring the perspective of the outstanding farm and agri-food sector in the great riding of Leeds–Grenville.", "First of all, I just want to say off the top, just like the agricultural community and the Ontario PC caucus’s previous speakers, that I am supportive of Bill 40. I am proud of the great relationship that I have with the agriculture producers and agribusinesses in Leeds–Grenville. We regularly meet to discuss concerns within the industry, and I’ve had the chance over the last couple of months to meet with a variety of local producers and groups in my riding, which include the Leeds county milk committee, the Christian Farmers Federation of Ontario’s St. Lawrence/Ottawa Valley district, and the Grain Farmers of Ontario, district 13. I also had the opportunity to join producers in my riding at last month’s Dairy Farmers of Ontario 50th anniversary banquet and, just last week, the Beef Farmers of Ontario AGM.", "Finally, I should also add that I was pleased to join Minister Leal himself for a meeting with a group of young farmers from my riding when he made a whirlwind trip through Leeds–Grenville at the end of January. It was a great discussion at the Verburg family farm on the challenges facing the new generation of farmers who desperately want to carry on the family tradition.", "I’d like to think that the time I invest in cultivating my relationships with agricultural producers in Leeds–Grenville gives me a fairly good understanding of some of the concerns.", "It’s interesting, in the context of today’s debate, that the topic of production insurance really doesn’t come up a lot when you have those types of meetings with the farmers in your riding. It’s not that it’s not an important issue, but when the priority comes for farmers and farm families, this isn’t the one they decide they want to talk to me about.", "However, what they do want to talk about, like most constituents, is the rising cost of electricity as a result of this government’s mismanagement of that sector. The ever-rising cost of energy doesn’t just hurt industries. The soaring price farmers are paying to keep the lights on and operate their equipment is devouring more and more of whatever income the family can produce. Unlike industries that we see packing up and leaving the province for greener pastures and cheaper energy, our farmers can’t take their land somewhere else to do their business. For them, the only option would be to leave the farm altogether. That’s an issue Bill 40 can’t resolve, obviously, because there is no insurance against this government’s costly energy blunders.", "Whenever I’m with any of the groups I met with earlier—people like the Christian farmers, the OFA, egg farmers, beef farmers, dairy producers or any other farm group—I appreciate the fact that when you meet with them, they give you the straight goods. They don’t waste their time talking around an issue. They don’t really have that time to waste. They cut right to the point. I’m going to follow their lead when it comes to issues around Bill 40. They look at me, and they say, “Steve, this idea to expand production insurance beyond crops is a good idea.” They say that we should support the bill.", "They’re telling me this because they know, when it comes to offering producers insurance for a broad range of agricultural products, that we here in Ontario trail every other province. In fact, I was very disappointed to learn that we’re the last province to do this. It’s especially disappointing, because we know how much our farm and food sector means to our economy. When you look at the economic impact they have, the figures are really staggering.", "The sector sustains 760,000 jobs in Ontario and is directly responsible for some $34 billion worth of economic activity annually. What those numbers tell us is that the food we’re producing is not only critical to our basic needs—we have to eat to live, after all—but this industry is the backbone of our provincial economy. I don’t think we truly appreciate the significant role the farm sector plays in our economy, and that’s why it’s so critical for us to ensure that it is healthy and sustainable. That’s why I share the view of the farmers in my riding who say that Bill 40 is a welcome piece of legislation. In it, we’re finally seeing this government take the long overdue step of creating a production insurance program that will go beyond crops and perennial plants.", "I would point out something raised with me by an OFA official when I asked them for some feedback on Bill 40. While they called it a good-news story, they questioned why it has taken so long for the government to act on this. In fact, they pointed me to a 2003 federal-provincial agriculture policy framework that highlighted the need to expand crop insurance to other farm products. That’s 11 years ago. No wonder the farmers I represent are asking one question of me and also to the minister: Why did this take so long?", "I think there are some fair questions about the timing of the bill. Why, after 11 years of waiting, would the government act now on an issue they know has widespread support among the agriculture sector? We know over here that nothing happens by accident when it comes to the timing of legislation, and I agree with one suggestion that’s been made during this debate: I think the true motivation here is the heat that the government has been taking from the farm community over neonicotinoids. I know the government threw science out the window when it announced an 80% reduction in the use of neonics by 2017. Already we’re hearing from the Grain Farmers of Ontario that it’s going to cost their sector $630 million a year. I wonder if the grain and oilseed producers in my riding can get some insurance for those losses.", "I also want to bring forward the frustration that farmers have expressed to me about this government not doing its homework. They look at the government’s own recommendations from the Bee Health Working Group. Again, what they said to me was that farmers should implement some of the new best practices that are being discussed. They’ve made some gains. I think bee deaths will reduce by 70%.", "They’re telling me that they did their part. They have worked with the government; they decided to be partners. Yet the government turned around and made their announcement without that consultation. Judging from what I heard when I had a chance to drop in to the grain farmers’ region 13 AGM in Elgin, I don’t think Bill 40 is going to make the problem go away for government. They were very concerned, and they expressed it to me that day.", "I also feel that we need to talk about the fact that this piece of legislation also has to deal with regulations. If you read through the bill, it’s very short, just five pages, which includes the cover and the explanatory note. Really, when you look at the bill, it doesn’t say that much; it just amends the title of the Crop Insurance Act, adds a few definitions, and substitutes a lot of language in the act which was passed in 1996. What Bill 40 does is it gives the Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs the ability to create the new production insurance program, but again, there’s the issue of the regulations. I certainly hope they show a little more urgency than they have shown over the last 11 years.", "When you read through the bill, the key part for people to pay attention to is the one where the act is amended to add the following:", "“Regulations by minister", "“11.1 The minister may make regulations,", "“(a) designating agricultural products for the purposes of this act;", "“(b) defining any word or expression used in this act that has not already been expressly defined in this act.”", "This is where we’re giving the minister the authority to make the regulations that will determine how Ontario’s new production insurance program is going to operate.", "As I said earlier this week when I was talking about Bill 31, this legislation is another example of the devil being in the details of those regulations when they are being brought forward by the minister. That means the answers to the most important questions that farmers I represent have about this program are unknown. So we’re not debating the actual program, and the unknown aspect is a concern to farmers, to myself and, I think, to our entire caucus.", "I want to pick up on a point made by our critic on the file, the member from Haldimand–Norfolk, who made this point in his lead-off back before the House rose for Christmas. He pointed out that neither the minister nor his parliamentary assistant, in opening the debate on Bill 40, offered much insight into what this program is going to look like. They’ve made commitments about consulting closely with the federal government and with farmers—and certainly we’re going to hold them to that and make sure those talks do happen—but there’s still reason for concern because we know this government doesn’t exactly have a sterling record when it comes to implementing new programs. I can mention the Green Energy Act. I can talk about some of the other programs they’ve had difficulty with, things like Ornge and eHealth and MaRS. I see the Minister of Community and Social Services is across from me. That SAMS debacle is just another case of the government not implementing a program. On that program, the SAMS program, my constituency office is right beside an ODSP office. It’s right next door. I was hearing about problems with that program before they even happened.", "So it’s quite reasonable for us to express concern about how the minister is going to carry out this process on how Bill 40 will get through once the bill goes to committee. After seeing how the government dealt with two bills this week—by moving to close debate—this bill will probably have the same thing happen to it next week some time.", "I just want to talk briefly about some questions and concerns that farmers have raised to me about the new program. Certainly a primary concern of theirs will be the cost of the program. We know production insurance costs are shared by the province, which pays 24%; the feds, who pay 36%; and of course the farmers, who pay the remaining 40%.", "We’re talking about a significant change here to create an insurance program that extends coverage to additional agricultural products, including livestock and bees. While the change from just crops and perennial plants to other commodities is a good idea and one that’s long overdue, the fact is, it’s going to cost more. We need to know, then, how the government plans to pay for it. The last thing we want to do, in establishing a new production insurance program, is to drain funds away from the existing programs that Ontario’s agricultural sector relies on for support.", "The critic also questioned whether there would be incentives available to encourage farmers to buy into the new crop insurance program. One of the questions, for example, that they’ve had is, will there be a premium holiday? That’s something that I’ve heard on a number of occasions.", "Farmers are going to be watching this program. They want to know the most obvious things: What is this going to cost me? How much time am I going to have to spend filling out paperwork? I hear that over and over again. One of the things that comes up at meetings all the time is this red tape, this filling out of paperwork.", "I know our previous ag critic, the member for Oxford, exposed how big a problem this is in the agri-food sector. He did a survey that essentially said—and it was an unbelievable number—the farmers in the province spend 154.2 hours every year filling out government forms. That was part of his survey. Think about how hard these men and women work in the agricultural sector and the fact that they do such a good job, yet in addition to a 40-hour week, they’ve got this tremendous amount of time filling out paperwork.", "In the few moments I have remaining, I want to talk about another issue that, during debate previously, I’ve always been on the record about—the government, when they have these consultations. It’s one thing to have them; I want them to listen to people. I know the parliamentary assistant is making copious notes across from me.", "I’ve said that I would love to have one of those consultation meetings in Kemptville because of what happened regarding Kemptville college. The minister will have to speak to his colleague at the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities to see if the University of Guelph would even allow a meeting on that campus because I know that they’ve severely restricted the amount of bookings that take place at the college.", "Again, I look at the debate, and I’ve read comments from people offering issues around farming, the fact that they’re so concerned. It’s almost been a year since the Kemptville college announcement was made by the University of Guelph. You have to ask, Speaker, what could be more important to the future of farming in this province than education? To me, it’s critical.", "The ministry went ahead and hired their provincial facilitator, Mr. Vanclief. He’s a well-respected former federal minister. The minister and the ministry may think that they’ve solved all the problems of the world and they’ve answered all the questions on the future of Kemptville college with this report, but you know what, not by a long shot.", "What he’s accomplished with his announcement last month will take a very small step forward by agreeing with what everybody already supports, and that was to take the management of the campus and transfer it to the municipality of North Grenville. But there was nothing from the minister about the real issue, and that is the continuation of agriculture education in eastern Ontario. The reality is the minister and his colleague at training, colleges and universities need to show that this government is serious about partnering with a post-secondary institution to deliver those degree and diploma programs.", "I said it when the minister made the announcement. It’s no surprise to me that Mr. Vanclief failed to find a public or private institution ready to come forward. You look at his report and there are some glaring errors. About half a dozen institutions took the time to present a proposal. There was a lot of interest there, but there was no money put on the table. There was nothing put on the table to show.", "I want to quote something the minister said in the opening remarks of this debate. Minister Leal said, and I quote, “While serving as Minister of Agriculture and Food, Premier Wynne issued the agri-food growth challenge. It calls on the sector to double its annual rate of growth and to create 120,000 new jobs by 2020.” That’s the quote, which is a great idea, but how do you expect a sector to grow like that when you’re closing the institutions that provide the knowledge our agri-food and agri-business sectors need to remain competitive? The answer, as we all know, is that you can’t. I simply don’t understand why the minister has been so blind to this.", "In my riding, the Leeds and Grenville economic development committee had a great economic development summit in North Grenville in the fall. It’s just about a kilometre or two away from the Kemptville college campus. We all talked about the tremendous opportunities that were there if the government would just make the commitment.", "I was given a copy of a report entitled Planning for Tomorrow for OAC: Input from Industry. It’s a report that was done by the Ontario Agricultural College and the University of Guelph that looks at the needs of the agriculture and food sector. I’ve talked about this report to the minister previously, and I hope he has a copy by now. If he’s read it, he will realize the disastrous decision the government made to allow the University of Guelph to close that 97-year-old tradition of ag excellence. I’ve only got a few minutes left, and I just want to share a few highlights of the report in the important context of the debate that we’re having today.", "Here’s one eye-opening finding:", "“The survey revealed the large gap that currently exists in Ontario in the supply of graduates trained in agriculture and food programs and the difficulties employers are having in finding suitably trained graduates.”", "Another section found that “demand in Ontario is three times supply for agricultural graduates at the bachelors level.”", "Finally, this conclusion: “Via this study, our interaction with industry indicates that there are significant unmet needs in the agriculture and food sector in Ontario in regard to the number of students being trained at diploma, undergraduate and graduate level in agriculture or food programs.”", "You can see why I and the entire eastern Ontario agriculture and food sector are so adamant that we need to maintain education and training at Kemptville college. Forget the future; we can’t even meet today’s needs. So I can’t understand why the government, even though they’ve got this bill that is long overdue, cannot make a commitment to fill this unmet need, to make sure we’ve got young men and women coming forward to be our next generation of farmers. We can’t meet the demand now. How are we going to create 120,000 new jobs when we’re not having graduates at the degree, diploma and undergraduate level? The ministry needs to stop and take a look at their decision and reverse what happened one year ago." ],

This bill is enabling legislation, and it’s going to go forward. It’s 10 years too late. Where the devil is in the details is in how this bill is actually going to be funded and if it’s going to be funded with new funding or if some money is going to be taken out of another area, or if it’s just going to lie dormant and then it will just be a press release. That’s where the rubber is going to hit the road.", "I have to say that this government has been a bit of a contradiction, as far as agriculture goes. I’ll give an example: Right now we’ve heard that we want to focus a lot more on jobs, and one of the focuses is northern agriculture, bringing agriculture to northern Ontario. Good idea. But some people might not know this: In one of the best places for agriculture in northern Ontario, in the little clay belt around Temiskaming Shores, this government is now allowing solar farms to be built on the best land we have in northern Ontario. Why? Because in northern Ontario there is no land designation. So while this government says that they want to promote agriculture in northern Ontario, they stand idly by while on the best land in the Temiskaming district—tile-drained, cleared, farmed for a hundred years—they’re building solar farms.", "Again, if you want to talk about agriculture, let’s talk about agriculture and let’s fix the problems right away.

But what we have before us is just enabling legislation. The government is going to have to bring forward regulations; it’s going to actually have to put funding on the table before we know if this is of substance or not. My colleague from Timiskaming spoke very well about whether there’s actually going to be new money on the table—or is this just a rearrangement of titles, a reprinting of bills with new names on them? Is it actually going to be substantive for the farmers in this province whose production we in the cities depend on?", "Right now, we have a bill, the Crop Insurance Act, that applies only to a limited, designated group of crops and products. This bill changes the name of the act. That’s not a bad thing, but I don’t know how substantial it is. It changes the name of the Ontario Crop Insurance Fund. Again, who can dislike renaming a fund? But is it going to change things?", "There are no regulatory changes attached to this bill that we’re aware of. There’s no indication that funding will be attached to actually implement this bill. So I ask, and I would hope the government would speak to this: What, substantively, will we get out of this, other than name changes? Will there be funding? Will it make a difference to producers of all agricultural products in Ontario? Will we actually see regulations come forward? Will there be public consultation on those regulations so we’ll actually be able to judge if something substantive has been done for Ontario?" ],

Again, I want to thank all the members for their attentiveness and their comments previously. I got a thumbs-up from the parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, so maybe that’s a good sign. Hopefully, it’s a thumbs-up for money for Kemptville College. I don’t know, but we’ll see.", "The member for Toronto–Danforth hit the nail on the head of what I said earlier. You’ve got a piece of enabling legislation that ultimately the government will have to put some dollars on the table for. Again, I just worry, with the last year of my life, with the University of Guelph’s decision with Kemptville college—the frustration that the province would appoint a facilitator yet not make a decision to put dollars on the table to show those post-secondary educational institutions that they’re serious.", "I want to go back to the minister’s opening remarks in this debate, when you praised the Premier as a former Minister of Agriculture and Food. We’re going to have so much difficulty getting this Agri-Food Growth Challenge for jobs to be able to have 120,000 new jobs by 2020. We’ve got a problem in this province. Our own reports are showing that demand in Ontario is three times the supply of agriculture graduates at the bachelor level. If you’re going to look at 120,000 new jobs, and you’ve already got demand exceeding supply three to one, how are you going to have that extra growth in jobs when you don’t have young men and women who want to take on the family farm have an opportunity to have education close to home? The beauty of my campus was the fact that kids could go to school and then help on the family farm.", "We need a commitment by this government." ],

  "text" : [ "It’s an honour to rise once again, twice today in this House, and to speak to Bill 40, the Agriculture Insurance Act.", "As my colleagues have previously mentioned here over the last couple of days, the bill is long overdue and it’s about time that Ontario keeps pace with other provinces in this country. By extending this crop insurance, it would provide protection to all agriculture products. At the moment, it only applies to agricultural crops and perennial plants and leaves out other products like livestock. By amending the act, it will expand the scope to include all agricultural products.", "I would like to talk about the member from Timiskaming–Cochrane, who actually did his one-hour lead yesterday, I believe. He talked about being happy that this bill is coming to fruition finally after its impetus was passed 11 years ago at a federal-provincial agricultural ministers meeting, back in 2003. So it has taken 11 years, Speaker. In his introductory remarks, the parliamentary assistant to the minister said the bill was moving with haste. If it takes 11 years for this government to move on desperately needed legislation when it’s moving in haste, I’m not sure we want to know what normal speeds are.", "From my critic portfolio, if you ask the members of the AODA Alliance, they would be sure to tell you quickly how long it takes this government to act on its promises. They were promised improvements to accessibility standards in this province 10 years ago. Yesterday, we just learned that the only thing they are going to receive is further cuts to the enforcement measures.", "Another important thing, and a lot of members have spoken to it, is that this is merely a framework. It amends the name, it amends the act, but it’s a framework. By definition, it is more broadly defined. But it does not specify what it’s going to cover, who it’s going to cover, if there is going to be any money on the table or if there are going to be any time targets. I think the government owes it to the Legislature, to the agricultural community and to the province’s economy to move forward with this in a timely way, being that it has been on the books for 11 years.", "Most importantly, it will be up to the government to ensure that it’s an inclusive process of consultation; that the farmers, the researchers, the policy advisers, the communities and associations all have a chance to have their say on this legislation. I need not remind us of what happens when the government doesn’t heed the advice of those facing issues on the ground on a daily basis. In the last few years that I’ve been here, we’ve witnessed this: the wasted money, in the case of this Liberal government, billions of dollars, you get with an Ornge scandal that’s still under OPP investigation, an eHealth crisis that has not yet been resolved, P3s wasting $8.2 billion of taxpayers’ money; or you have a government entangled in an OPP investigation—three, I think; one as a result of the election rules being broken.", "In my critic area, we have the issue of the SAMS program as well, affecting thousands of people on Ontario Works and on Ontario disability support payments, $250 million spent on a program that’s not working. Now we’re going to have to spend some more money actually bringing in a peer reviewer to try to fix the problems. It’s very important, I think, that this issue move forward in a timely way.", "One of the reasons that the SAMS program is broken is because the government failed to heed the advice of front-line staff and managers who were sending red flags and warnings for many months and who actually begged the government not to move forward in December until we got all the kinks out. But that didn’t happen. We’ve seen system failures lead to massive budget cuts later on in order to compensate for this government’s waste.", "We have the ability to do the right thing here, and I urge the government to take those next steps. We have 14,000 farmers in this province who cover an average of five million acres that have crop insurance. It’s good to finally be moving forward with a framework that will protect all of these five million acres.", "As it stands, there are no regulatory changes nor any funding with the bill. As we’ve seen far too often with this government, action is hard to come by. I urge the government to move hastily to start the consultation.", "Although I’ve never been a farmer, I have a riding that encompasses a large farming community in Wainfleet, and so these issues are important to my community as well.", "We all enjoy our fine Niagara wines. We talked a bit about wine in private members’ business a while ago. I hope that we all do our best to support our local economies and to buy local wine. According to my friend and CEO of the Grape Growers of Ontario, Debbie Zimmerman, Ontario’s grape and wine industry is a $3.3-billion economy to this province and employs over 14,000 people. She says that crop insurance is one of the risk management tools that grape growers count on in difficult years. It provides a cushion for those farmers in the event of environmental damage because of the elements.", "I’m sure we all remember last year’s polar vortex as we were doing by-elections in Fort Erie and Niagara-on-the-Lake. Those frigid temperatures aren’t just horrible memories implanted in our minds; they’ve left their mark on the Niagara region and on the wine industry. Derek Saunders, who founded the Calamus Estate Winery near Beamsville, adds that anyone who tried to shop for a local wine as of last summer will have noticed it was impossible to actually buy a 2014 Merlot or Sauvignon Blanc on any of the store shelves because it was the hardest hit.", "The VineAlert program, which measures the bud survival rates in Ontario, estimates that only 50% of the buds survived last winter. Unfortunately, this winter will be a bad season as well for the wine industry as a result of the cold temperatures. Although the blankets of snow seem to be helping, there’s no guarantee that it will save the crops.", "As my colleague from Timiskaming–Cochrane previously mentioned, the issues of agriculture and the environment go hand in hand. It’s inevitable that the more extreme weather we see, the more support our farming communities and our agricultural sector will need. The bill, in principle, will help provide the framework for these supports.", "The recent cold temperatures in Ontario over the last few weeks in the Niagara area are going to cause severe crop damage to grapes and to tree fruits. Ryan Brewster, who is a field service manager, is anticipating a complete wipeout this year in Niagara for peaches, apricots and plums. Although the extent of the damage is too early to assess, it doesn’t look good. The early signs are troubling, and it’s too soon to tell for certain.", "These people who I’m mentioning here in my remarks today are reassured about the principles of the bill, and that expanding coverage for the production losses or the yield reductions is good for agriculture. If it’s good for agriculture, it’s good for business, it’s good for the economy, and it’s good for the people who otherwise wouldn’t be able to actually afford it. It seems that we all agree to the principles of this bill, but we need to know some of the other answers: Who will be included, what’s the funding going to be like, what are the targets going to be like and all of those kinds of issues.", "If this bill had been passed earlier—we’ve been waiting 11 years for it to come around—it might have helped the pork farmers dealing with PED and it might have helped the beef farmers dealing with BSE, more commonly known to us as mad cow disease. Those farmers took a big hit, and this kind of bill certainly would have helped them, if it applied to them.", "I want to speak for a couple of minutes—I’ve got about four left—about bees, because bees are a real issue across this country and in particular in this province. Although they seem insignificant, without honey bees, the agricultural sector would be doomed. When the Minister of Agriculture and the parliamentary assistant presented this bill, there was no specific mention of honey bees, although the bee mortality rate had been on the rise since around 2006. Bees are pollinators, and as a result, our ecosystems rely on them. Our farmers especially rely on bees for pollination. In fact, it’s believed that almost half of the leading crops—apples, soybeans, cocoa, almonds—rely on pollination, and it’s about a $212-billion value. Crops couldn’t reproduce without them.", "Some blame pesticide use. The neonicotinoids, a pesticide that was banned last year, were believed to contain very low levels of toxicity to many insects. In 2013, a review of the neonicotinoids showed that, as they are typically used, they harm bees, and safer alternatives are needed.", "Before I close here, Speaker, I want to just talk a bit about this interesting phenomenon that happens in my riding. It happens to be one of the places where wild and domestic bees thrive. It’s an area that has been appropriately named the Niagara Beeway. It’s about a two-kilometre swath on either side of the Welland Canal and, bizarrely enough, completely unaffected by the phenomenon of bee colony collapse. It seems to be a place where bee colonies continue to thrive. Beehives can be found on either side of the canal in trees, in factories, in churches and even in homes. Local organizations work with the beekeepers to ensure that these swarms of bees are captured, free of charge. They’re later used for apprenticeship programs and training for new generations of beekeepers—so great for Welland and great for the province.", "George Scott, my friend and president of the Niagara Beeway, told me that the small beekeepers actually welcome this bill as a positive turn in the sweep of bad news happening at every corner in the bee industry. If honeybees were included in this bill, it would provide beekeepers with a safety net to fall back on in the case of a bad colony loss.", "What George did mention is that many large beekeepers often pay the price for previous beekeepers overstating their losses to insurance companies. Because verifying larger bee yards comes at a higher price to inspectors, it’s rarely done, therefore, leaving enormous incentives to overstate those losses on claims. Unfortunately, Speaker, as with most cases of bad apples—while we’re speaking about this bill—everyone ends up paying the price. The largest beekeepers end up receiving delayed payment as a result of this, while the smaller bee yards get their claims returned in a timely manner.", "Forget the administrative delays—these interruptions naturally then cause delays in replacing colonies. For example, if a beekeeper loses a yield of bees late in the year, they need to replace them immediately. The life cycle and the payment of the crop insurance don’t mesh a lot of the time, Speaker. That’s what I’m being told.", "Lastly, another common denominator in all of my conversations is that losses aren’t always claimed because the current paperwork required under the crop insurance plan is an administrative nightmare. It’s time-consuming. It is inaccessible. As a result of that, we’re not even capturing all of the losses of farmers in this province. I hope that this bill, when it actually has some meat on the bones, addresses some of those issues that the beekeepers in our agricultural sector are wanting to rely on in their small businesses.", "Ultimately, the insurance act bill is one that we as New Democrats will be supporting. It’s desperately needed—for over a decade, almost 11 years—and one that should have been implemented sooner. It’s now up to the government to table the plans that actually go with the bill. We hope it doesn’t take another 11 years for that to happen." ],

  "text" : [ "I’m pleased to share my time today with my colleague, the hard-working member from Burlington, Eleanor McMahon.", "Speaker, today I rise to move third reading of Bill 135, the Energy Statute Law Amendment Act, 2015. This proposed legislation would accomplish several very important measures for a stronger, more collaborative energy planning process. It would improve energy transmission reliability in the province of Ontario, and the new planning regimen creates a strong platform to keep electricity rates competitive and for a strong economy.", "Before I get into more detail of the proposed legislation, Speaker, I want to recognize the hard work, dedication and commitment of the Ministry of Energy staff and the staff across our energy agencies, including the Independent Electricity System Operator, the Ontario Energy Board and Ontario Power Generation, all of whom have worked tirelessly on this vital piece of legislation and the effort they devote to the energy sector throughout the province every day.", "I’d also like to acknowledge energy’s role in building Ontario up. Nothing is more essential to our everyday quality of life and economic success than a steady supply of clean, reliable and affordable electricity. Our economy continues to grow, and as technical and operational innovations accelerate, ratepayers, economies, industry and governments need to adapt, and adapt quickly.", "I’m talking about electric cars, electrified transit, behind-the-meter generation, smart grid technology, electricity storage, innovations in renewable energy, off-grid generation, modernizing building codes and, most of all, eliminating carbon emissions. This makes our unwavering commitment to innovative, cost-effective, clean and reliable power an ongoing necessity for our economy, our environment and our quality of life.", "Mr. Speaker, Bill 135 creates a reliable planning mechanism to keep electricity rates competitive and our economy strong and growing. One of the biggest myths we hear—I know it’s one often promulgated by members of the opposition—is that electricity prices in Ontario are the highest in North America. This is just plain wrong. Ontario’s residential electricity rates are, and will remain, competitive with jurisdictions in North America. When comparing the cost per kilowatt hour, Ontario’s rates are lower than most American cities and significantly lower than electricity rates in European cities. While some Canadian provinces have lower prices than Ontario, Ontario has competitive prices with other provinces such as Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, Saskatchewan and PEI.", "While most other jurisdictions are still burning dirty coal for two thirds of their power, our government is proud that we have achieved competitive rates while undertaking the largest climate change initiative in North America. This requires smart planning legislation and smart planning policies.", "Our 2013 long-term energy plan is putting Ontario in a competitive place. The 2013 long-term energy plan is the platform on which we’re building the needs of the future through Bill 135.", "Looking across Canada, Ontario’s recent 2.5% bill increase is reasonable and stacks up competitively across our comparators. BC Hydro rates increased by 4% on April 1, 2016; Saskatchewan power rates were approved for a 5% increase in 2015; Manitoba Hydro applied a rate increase of 3.95% as of April 1, 2016; and Newfoundland Power applied for a rate increase of 3.6% for residential customers as of July 1. Yes, our rates went up by 2.5%; I challenge any member in the Legislature to find a jurisdiction in North America where rates are not going up. The issue is, how do you keep the increases to a minimum? That is a very, very significant issue when it comes to electricity planning.", "We also recognize that the price of electricity can be difficult for those who pay a higher share of their income toward the bill, particularly low-income families and seniors on a fixed income. That’s why the Ontario Energy Board launched the Ontario Electricity Support Program for lower-income families, and that is why the debt retirement charge was removed on January 1 of this year, saving the average family a combined $430 annually.", "We also know that bills can be even harder for families and seniors in rural and remote areas that heat with electricity or use medically assistive devices. That’s why we doubled the monthly benefit these families can access to up to $100.", "Bill 135, when passed, represents a planning framework that makes these price mitigation measures possible by government.", "Through our planning framework, we have additional programs that help reduce bills for Ontario families. The Ontario Energy and Property Tax Credit saves qualifying individuals up to $993 per year; the Low-Income Energy Assistance Program provides emergency financial support; the saveONenergy Home Assistance Program provides free home energy efficiency assessments and energy-saving measures; and the Northern Ontario Energy Credit helps families and individuals in northern Ontario, providing individuals up to $143 in savings.", "Regarding industrial prices, northern Ontario actually has one of the lowest industrial electricity rates in North America—among the lowest in Canada and lower than 49 American states; the third-lowest in North America. Industrial rates in southern Ontario are lower than in Michigan, Wisconsin, New Jersey and California, and below the American average.", "Just a few weeks ago, the Ontario Chamber of Commerce partnered with the Ministry of Energy to publish clear data on these facts. It’s called the Ontario Energy Report and it’s available on the ministry website at www.ontarioenergyreport.ca. I’m going to read that again: www.ontarioenergyreport.ca. Speaker, it’s there. There’s a chart showing the comparable prices. It’s credible, it’s objective and it shows that Ontario is doing extremely well compared to our competitors.", "Bill 135, if passed, would allow a planning framework to continue and expand existing programs. Just last week, I was in Timmins discussing some of the programs the Ministry of Energy now offers to even further reduce the impact of electricity prices on the bottom line of some of Ontario’s industrial consumers. That’s the industrial electricity incentive. This is a program our government launched in 2012 to offer sharply discounted rates of up to 50% for job creators across the province, with a special focus on industrial consumers like the mining industry, greenhouse growers, refrigerated warehouses and data-processing centres. Speaker, I want to provide some examples of companies that are benefiting from this IEI program, which provides up to a 50% discount off their electricity bills, a program that could be expanded under the Bill 135 planning process.", "I was fortunate to be in Timmins to highlight two local companies, Alamos Gold and St. Andrew Goldfields, which both have made use of this program and expanded their mining operations in that region. We were up there with our staff two or three weeks ago. We had a very positive reception, particularly from the company involved. Alamos, for example, has increased its daily gold output by 2,000 tonnes per day, creating 75 new jobs and supporting more than 700 good jobs for this community. The CEO of that company credits this program with enabling them to proceed in this way.", "These two success stories in the riding of the member from Timmins–James Bay aren’t the only companies participating in this program." ],

I appreciate the fact that my critic gives us credit, once in a while, for doing something good. Thank you.", "In fact, the list of IEI program beneficiaries includes FNX Mining Company Inc., in the member from Sudbury’s community; Vision Extrusions, in the member from Vaughan’s community; Roelands Plant Farms Inc., in the member from Lambton–Kent–Middlesex’s community; Amco Farms Inc., in the member from Chatham-Kent–Essex’s community; Omya Canada Inc. and Tweed Inc., in the member from Lanark–Frontenac–Lennox and Addington’s community; New Gold Inc. and EACOM Timber Corp., in the member from Kenora–Rainy River’s community; White River Forest Products, in the member from Algoma–Manitoulin’s community; and Resolute FP Canada Inc., in the Thunder Bay community. Just for the record, Speaker, seven of these 10 examples are benefiting companies and communities that are located in opposition members’ ridings.", "Mr. Speaker, we’re going to continue to focus on ensuring that our electricity system is clean, reliable and affordable for all. That can only be accomplished with a modern, updated planning framework, which Bill 135 would provide. And we’re continuing to make significant progress in transforming the electricity system into one that Ontarians can continue to count on for reliability, leadership and clean energy.", "Speaker, when our government came to office, 25% of Ontario’s generation was from very cheap but very dirty coal. A central priority of the government when it comes to energy planning was to ensure a very clean supply mix so that we’d have a healthy population, and a strong planning platform is needed to initiate these types of transformational policies. In that context, Speaker, we have closed all of our coal-fired electricity plants, helping to clean up the air that was making our kids sick and saving the province $4.4 billion per year in environmental and health care costs. That is the largest emissions reduction action plan in North America, taking the equivalent of seven million cars’ worth of emissions off the roads in Ontario, efforts that reduce carbon emissions and fight climate change. It wasn’t an easy decision, Speaker, but it was one our government committed to achieve, and, as they say, promise made, promise kept.", "But, Speaker, we can’t lay down our tools. And one of the best tools we have, moving forward, will be Bill 135. We’ve taken energy planning and electricity reliability to a level ignored under previous governments, and we have rebuilt our transmission and distribution systems, investing $34 billion in the generation and transmission that ensure that when Ontario needs electricity, you can count on it to be there. It’s easy to forget that this wasn’t always the case, not long ago, and the system was crying out for proper planning frameworks.", "I think we can all recall the rolling brownouts and blackouts that made Ontario an unreliable place to do business and set up shop, and that the then-PC government had installed large portable generators in downtown Toronto as a backup for an unreliable and dirty system that had a deficit of electricity. So after years and years of underinvestment, we finally turned the page and ensured that when you flip the switch, the lights will come on.", "Speaker, Ontario has also recently confirmed that the future of energy planning in Ontario is strongly rooted in an affordable, reliable, emissions-free supply of baseload nuclear power. This was planned for under the 2013 long-term energy plan, the predecessor to Bill 135. Under that plan, we will continue building for the future, undertaking a very significant nuclear refurbishment plan at the Darlington and Bruce reactors.", "What’s truly amazing about this commitment is that all nuclear facilities in Ontario are variants of the Candu reactor design, and it’s significant that more than 90% of the supply chain that supports this type of nuclear units is located right here in Ontario. That supply chain represents more than 180 companies employing tens of thousands of Ontarians in well-paying jobs.", "Refurbishment is also a direct vote of confidence in this supply chain and this domestic industry. It’s a vote of confidence in companies like Cambridge’s BWXT Canada Ltd., which employs more than 500 people in the community, or Peterborough’s General Electric Hitachi nuclear energy facility, which employs more than 350 people in highly skilled trades in the nuclear industry, or perhaps a vote of confidence in Cameco’s Port Hope facility, which employs 660 people in the nuclear industry. That energy planning vote of confidence is going to create 60,000 Ontario jobs. It’s going to invest $25 billion in updated and needed energy infrastructure. It’s going to drive economic growth in communities across Ontario, and it’s going to secure 30 years of emissions-free power. That’s amazing as well.", "If all that wasn’t enough, it’s going to help stabilize prices in Ontario. It’s going to secure three decades of emissions-free power at a very affordable price of just 7.7 cents per kilowatt hour on average going into the grid.", "The planning framework that enabled this success needs a refresh, and that’s going to take place in Bill 135. An affordable, clean supply mix is central to our planning. That has recently been reflected in the IESO’s first competitive procurement for renewable energy contracts. Last month, the IESO announced that this successful first round would come in at an average price of 8.5 cents per kilowatt hour, which is comparable to conventional generation, and will include 13 projects, or 80% of the total projects, with significant aboriginal or First Nation participation. And 75% of these 16 projects had local community support, Speaker.", "So yes, the world of energy and electricity is changing at an accelerated pace. That’s what Bill 135 is all about. What’s incredibly significant about our renewable achievements of local support and lower prices is that, compared to the forecasts in our 2013 long-term energy plan, our system now benefits from $3.3 billion in savings, saving the average consumer $1.67 per month on their electricity bill, thanks to renewables. This is a significant change in how we procure renewable power in Ontario and sets a strong benchmark for the future of energy planning in this province, one that includes nuclear, renewables, water power and natural gas.", "All of these decisions and actions taken by our government to drive cost pressures down, to ensure reliable supply and transmission and to transform our system from one dependent on coal to one free of it relate directly to the legislation we are considering here today.", "If passed, this act would establish in law a long-term energy planning process that is transparent, efficient and able to respond to changing policy and system needs, and also, very critically, enable to change a plan and adjust quickly to the accelerated innovation that we’re seeing across the energy and electricity sector. This is consistent with our government’s commitment to enhance transparency and community participation through open data, open dialogue and open government initiatives.", "This act would also support increased competition and enhanced ratepayer value by empowering the Independent Electricity System Operator to competitively procure transmission projects. This is important because previously, there was a regimen that allowed, for example, Hydro One to initiate transmission projects and to implement them. We now have implemented a competitive process where the IESO will open up transmission implementation to all players in these sectors.", "This act would also introduce two new initiatives to help Ontario families and businesses conserve energy and water to help manage costs at both the retail customer level and the system as a whole.", "First, it would require owners of large buildings to track their buildings’ energy and water use and greenhouse gas emissions over time, to allow owners and renters to determine how a building’s energy performance is changing and how it compares to similar buildings.", "Second, it would set water efficiency standards for products such as appliances that consume both energy and water, like dishwashers and washing machines, allowing Ontarians to make the best choices for themselves when shopping for appliances.", "We are not reinventing the wheel here with these two initiatives. Both of these initiatives follow best practices in a significant number of jurisdictions in Canada, the US and the United Kingdom.", "This legislation would protect the long-term energy planning principles that developed the 2010 and 2013 long-term energy plans to ensure that future plans are developed consistent with the principles of cost-effectiveness, reliability, clean energy, early community and indigenous people’s engagement, with much more attention to innovation, new technologies and climate change.", "Our government knows that sound, prudent, long-term energy planning is essential to a clean, reliable and affordable energy system. The best way to ensure that kind of robust system planning occurs is to consult with the public, indigenous communities, industry and the energy stakeholder community. The proposed legislation includes a role for the Ontario Energy Board and the Independent Electricity System Operator in facilitating the implementation of cabinet-approved principles.", "In essence, the proposed legislation would give the government the ability to set goals and objectives for the energy sector, but only after consideration of independent technical information on the sector from the IESO and after broad and substantive consultations with the public, stakeholders and aboriginal communities. Once the long-term energy plan has been developed, the IESO and the Ontario Energy Board would be responsible for independently executing and implementing that plan.", "The proposed act would ensure that energy planning is conducted in a transparent manner consistent with the government’s open dialogue initiative, requiring that the government undertake consultations with the public and relevant stakeholders and consider the results of those consultations when developing the long-term energy plan. This would build on the model of the comprehensive public consultation and engagement already undertaken with consumers, stakeholders and First Nation and Métis communities as part of the 2013 long-term energy planning process.", "For the 2013 long-term energy plan, the comprehensive engagement included a number of stakeholder sessions and public town halls which took place in over a dozen communities across the province. More than 1,000 formal submissions were considered, and the ministry received about 8,000 responses to an online survey.", "This act would enshrine in legislation the kind of planning process that the ministry used to develop the 2013 long-term energy plan. There is more work to be done, and having an energy planning process that is more open, transparent and responsive to changing times and innovation will help us to continue to build on our achievements.", "We are anxious to get moving with this legislation to ensure that open, consultative planning continues to be the watchword of this government. We have heard often from opposition critics that a reliable and affordable electricity system is essential for a strong and competitive economy.", "I’d like to conclude this morning by briefly reviewing the strong economic results that energy planning in this province has directly supported.", "Ontario’s GDP is currently 2.9%. Tied with British Columbia, we are together leading the country. TD Economics has just released its updated forecasts for the country. It projects that Ontario’s GDP growth will be 2.9% in 2016, 0.7% higher than we projected in our 2016 budget released just a short while ago.", "Ontario has gained 22,500 jobs in the last three months and 85,000 jobs since this time last year, with 90% of those jobs, Speaker, being full-time jobs and 76% being in above-average wage-earning industries.", "Our job recovery rate since the great recession is 224%, well outpacing the United States at 161%.", "Speaker, we hear the opposition alleging that job losses are resulting from bad energy planning, but the converse is the reality. Good energy policies contribute to a healthy economy and to job creation.", "It should not be a surprise that Ontario has been named number one in North American jurisdictions for foreign direct investment for a second year in a row. Investors and companies from around the world are voting for Ontario with their chequebooks. That’s the bottom line. Our unemployment rate is 6.8%, well below the national unemployment rate of 7.1%.", "Ontario’s combined federal and provincial corporate tax rate is the second-lowest of all North American jurisdictions. Together with a reliable, clean, affordable and well-planned electricity sector, Ontario is a magnet to attract investors. So it should come as no surprise that Moody’s rating agency has recently upgraded Ontario’s rating because of our strong economy, cost containment, and positive deficit reduction results.", "Ontario made a choice to continue to invest in people, in infrastructure and in a robust energy sector and to take a little longer to get back to balance. That is why today, Ontario is right up there with British Columbia, leading Canada in economic growth, job creation and exports.", "I encourage all members of this House to focus on moving this legislation forward, to securing an open and engaging process for energy planning. Together, we will continue to build Ontario up, to build our local and regional economies and, most importantly, to build a better and carbon-free future for our kids and grandkids." ],

  "text" : [ "Thank you, Madam Speaker. I want to begin this morning by thanking the Minister of Energy for his leadership in helping to rebuild and strengthen Ontario’s energy system. We are extremely fortunate to have in Ontario a strong mix of reliable sources for our energy needs. This enormously complicated file requires someone steady and wise at the helm, and this minister is definitely both. He is leading Ontario transformation to a clean, green, reliable and affordable future, and for this he deserves our admiration and our thanks as one of the best public servants to hold this portfolio in the history of our province. I thank him for his diligence and his leadership.", "Due to his and this government’s efforts, Ontario has come so far in building a clean, reliable and diverse energy system. That is why I am pleased to rise today in support of the third reading of Bill 135, the Energy Statute Law Amendment Act, 2016.", "Madam Speaker, the current legislative process for energy and electricity planning is burdensome, slow, unresponsive to the changing environment of the energy sector, and unnecessarily costly. That’s exactly why our government has proposed a new process which would be able to respond in a timely manner to the emerging policy, program and technology needs that have the potential to make our system stronger and more focused on consumer needs. It would reduce process red tape that can bog down effective planning and reflect a more integrated approach to planning, consultation and implementation. But mostly, Speaker, this is a tried and tested process, one used already in the development of both the 2010 and 2013 long-term energy plans.", "Now we have the opportunity to replace the outdated system officially with a planning process that works, both across government and with and among our stakeholders—and it has been embraced, I should note, by them.", "The act would bring about improvements in three areas.", "First, it would establish in the law a long-term energy planning process that is transparent, efficient and able to respond to changing policy and system needs.", "Second, it would support increased competition and enhanced ratepayer value by empowering the Independent Electricity System Operator, or IESO, to competitively procure transmission projects.", "Third, it would introduce two new initiatives to help Ontario families, businesses and our province as a whole conserve energy and water to manage costs.", "Let’s begin with the long-term energy planning process. This government recognizes that sound, prudent long-term energy planning is essential to a clean, reliable and affordable energy future. This goal is being achieved through the implementation of the 2013 long-term energy plan, more commonly known as the LTEP. In fact, the 2013 LTEP was the biggest, most open and comprehensive consultation in ministry history and an early leading example of the principles of open government.", "To give you some more background, the 2013 LTEP was designed to balance five principles that guide all of our decisions: cost-effectiveness, reliability, clean energy, community engagement and putting conservation first. For the past two-plus years, we have been rolling out a variety of initiatives under the plan, and it will continue to guide our efforts. The overarching theme throughout the LTEP, and the guiding principle of the plan, is that commitment to putting conservation first.", "The 2013 LTEP reinforced this government’s commitment to conservation. In fact, it set a long-term conservation target of 30 terawatt hours in 2032. This target represents a 16% reduction in forecast gross demand for electricity, the equivalent of more than all of the power used in 2013 by the city of Toronto alone. The 2013 LTEP also set a goal of meeting 10% of peak demand using demand response by 2025.", "Energy efficiency will also help us with another key priority: Meeting the objectives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through this government’s Climate Change Action Plan. The Ministry of Energy is making progress in implementing conservation first by launching electricity and natural gas conservation frameworks. Both frameworks are long-term commitments to support the delivery of conservation programs and are aligned to promote collaboration of conservation efforts among electricity and natural gas utilities.", "It’s important to understand that what is being accomplished on conservation is all driven by the commitments laid out in the LTEP. It is the guiding document and process for the Ministry of Energy, its agencies and the broader energy sector. A high degree of thought and care goes into planning the energy system for the future, including efforts to reduce costs and complexity. Quite simply, this means prioritizing the reliability of our energy supply and making the requisite investment in our energy system. It means thinking beyond the four-year election cycle and planning for the longer term, to ensure that Ontario businesses and residents have the reliability that has become the hallmark of this government’s energy policy.", "Effective planning also means securing input, and our government is committed to stakeholder and public participation in energy system planning. With this in mind, the province has refined a planning process which is efficient, responsive to changing policy and system needs, and supported by robust stakeholder consultations.", "Under the proposed legislation, the IESO technical report is a starting point, a launching pad for stakeholder consultations. Developing the LTEP is a highly collaborative process in which the Ministry of Energy directly engages with stakeholders, indigenous communities and the public. The feedback from consultations and engagements would then be considered in the development of the plan itself. The ministry, with support from its agencies, would then be responsible for preparing the LTEP based on the data provided by the IESO and feedback received through consultations.", "The LTEP would include specific goals and objectives for Ontario’s energy system and would require cabinet approval before it is issued to the public. Cabinet would also issue directives to the IESO and the Ontario Energy Board asking for implementation plans from both to meet the plan’s goals and objectives.", "Both the IESO and the Ontario Energy Board would then develop their respective implementation plans outlining frameworks on how best to implement the government’s objectives and requirements as set out in the plan.", "These implementation plans would be subject to the Minister of Energy’s approval. Once the minister has reviewed and approved the implementation plans, the IESO and the OEB would proceed with procurements and developing programs or policies as outlined in their prospective implementation plans.", "While this series of checks and balances might seem and feel as though it is very process-oriented, as the saying goes, “Fail to plan, plan to fail.” Getting the plan right is critical.", "In support of open government, open dialogue and open data, Bill 135 would require consultation in a variety of forums and mediums when developing LTEPs and would require publication of key background information and data used in their development.", "The report would be similar to the technical report that the IESO will be developing on the electricity sector under proposed legislation.", "Speaker, as you can see, the built-in consultation in this process is impressive. As I said before, the preparation of the plan, the 2013 LTEP, involved the biggest, most open and comprehensive consultation in Ministry of Energy history, and was an early leading example of following the principles of open government. Opening up the process not only ensures greater input; it also enhances understanding of the enormous complexities that are inherent in the energy system process.", "Consultations included 12 regional sessions; round-table discussions with over 600 stakeholders, including evening open houses so the public could participate, and, excitingly, 300 members of the public did so; and 10 indigenous engagement sessions, meetings with a total of about 275 participants from over 100 First Nations and Métis communities and organizations.", "An academic-focused innovation session, in development with the Mowat Centre, was held to discuss best leading-edge practices in conservation, community energy planning, emerging technologies and ensuring grid resiliency.", "The Ministry of Energy also heard from individuals, municipalities, industry associations, businesses, non-government organizations, First Nations and Métis communities and other groups.", "The ministry received more than 1,200 EBR submissions, 2,000 emails through letter-writing campaigns and close to 8,000 questionnaire responses. All of this has shaped our plan moving forward, Madam Speaker.", "The Ministry of Energy went to these communities, and senior officials met face to face with thousands of people. This is meaningful consultation, not conducted in some closed-door boardroom. The LTEP consultation process is a very public one.", "One initiative that has resulted from the LTEP planning process is the Ontario Energy Report and website. This quarterly report brings together approximately 60 datasets from across Ontario’s energy sector and makes them available to everyone—an excellent example of transparency and open government in action.", "Over the 2010 and 2013 LTEP rounds, the LTEP planning process has proven itself an effective means of establishing the government’s key goals and priorities for our province’s energy system. Again, the effectiveness of this planning process is yet another reason why the government is proposing a statutory basis for long-term-energy planning that would build on the 2010 and 2013 processes. This plan would make consultation with the public, stakeholders, First Nations and Métis groups throughout Ontario a requirement in the development of energy plans moving forward, as well as ensuring that energy plans and their supporting technical data are made public.", "There has been a lot of support for Ontario’s leadership in energy planning and setting a standard for openness and transparency in the process. Many positive comments were shared by stakeholders during public committee hearings for this bill. I can tell you that in my own riding of Burlington, where a good cross-section of the nuclear energy supply chain is resident, there is broad support for the minister’s leadership, the hard work of his officials and the steady hand that is guiding the helm of the long-term energy planning process.", "Indeed, Chris Hughes, the CEO of Laker Energy, a company in my riding and a supplier engaged in the Bruce nuclear refurbishments, has said publicly that this is the best energy minister he has worked with in the history of his career.", "He is not alone in his praise of the important work that our government and this ministry is doing. For example, Deputy Grand Chief Derek Fox of the Nishnawbe Aski Nation said:", "“Bill 135 is a clear recognition that energy has far-reaching political, economic, social and environmental impacts—all of which are critical to NAN and the 49 First Nations it represents.", "“Bill 135 clearly establishes the requirement to consult with First Nations” of NAN, and, in acknowledging that First Nations must be consulted, that we “must be an active participant and beneficiary of Ontario’s energy industry.”", "Also, David McFadden, chair of the Ontario Energy Association, said:", "“I’ll outline a few of the reasons why we think Bill 135 is important.", "“First, and perhaps most importantly, it provides clarification on how energy planning will proceed in the future in this province. Predictability is very important for the energy sector, as you well know, because energy projects are often capital-intensive and require long lead times for development and construction....", "“Energy infrastructure is vital to our province’s economic prosperity and to our standard of living. Proper planning is essential. By spelling out when and how energy planning will be done, Bill 135 greatly improves the ability of energy companies to do business in Ontario and provides Ontario’s citizens and businesses with reliable and sustainable energy supplies.”", "He continued: “Bill 135 also makes some specific positive changes to the role of the Independent Electricity System Operator. In particular, Bill 135 adds electricity storage and transmission projects to the IESO’s procurement authorities. The proposed IESO procurement mechanisms will improve the integration of renewable power into Ontario’s energy system while encouraging new, competitive entry into Ontario’s storage and transmission businesses.", "“If any of you participated in the 2013 LTEP,” he continued, “then much of this will sound familiar, and that’s because the government did an unprecedented job in developing the plan, consulting with our industry and the public, and working closely with the IESO to get the facts right.”", "The second change proposed in this bill is a change to transmission planning and procurement. Electricity transmission system planning is the responsibility of the IESO and involves assessing need and timing for new transmission infrastructure. Key bulk system transmission projects may be identified in the proposed LTEP process that I just described. Currently, the IESO can procure generation assets and electricity capacity, but it does not have the authority to undertake procurement for transmission. The legislation would provide the IESO with this ability, and it will allow for it to undertake competitive processes for transmitter selection or procurement, where appropriate.", "A shift to a competitive procurement approach to transmission reflects the increasing role of the private sector in the transmission system with all of the inherent efficiencies this brings, and will ensure ratepayers receive the best value when investments are made to upgrade the system. And those need to be made, make no mistake. To suggest otherwise is to imperil our system and it would mean a return to the brownouts that were a hallmark of our past.", "The IESO is well positioned to undertake the selection or procurement processes. If passed, Bill 135 would empower the Independent Electricity System Operator to undertake competitive selection or procurement of transmission where appropriate, leading to enhanced affordability.", "The third change under Bill 135 relates to energy conservation. Conservation is one of the five pillars of Ontario’s long-term energy plan, along with cost-effectiveness, reliability, clean energy and community engagement. Conservation is the cleanest and most cost-effective energy resource. It helps families and businesses save money on their energy bills and reduces the need to build expensive energy infrastructure. Conservation also reduces greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, creating a cleaner future for our children and grandchildren. It builds on our investments in the system, which saw us transition from dirty coal to a cleaner energy future, the single most transformative clean energy decision in North America. Fewer smog days and hospital admissions have been the powerful legacy of that investment, and as an asthmatic, I’m grateful for both of those.", "As the government plans our energy needs for the next 20 years, conservation will be the first resource considered before building new generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure, wherever cost-effective. When you consider the potential for large-scale electrification, making the most of our existing resources and achieving maximum efficiency becomes doubly important.", "Ontario has already made great strides in building a culture of conservation. From 2005 to 2014, Ontarians conserved 9.9 terawatts of electricity, enough to power the cities of Ottawa and Windsor in 2014. As mentioned earlier, the electricity conservation target is 30 terawatt hours by 2032. We are also aiming to use demand response to meet 10% of peak demand by 2025.", "Bill 135 introduces two new initiatives that would help Ontario families, businesses and our province as a whole conserve water and energy and manage costs. The first of these mechanisms is the energy and water reporting and benchmarking initiative for large buildings. If this legislation is passed, the energy and water reporting and benchmarking initiative for large buildings would help building owners identify opportunities to save energy and water, thereby saving money on their utility bills. It would also help tenants and buyers make informed property decisions, enabling property and financial markets to value energy- and water-efficient buildings. It would help Ontario, too, to meet its conservation and greenhouse gas reduction goals.", "Buildings accounted for 19% of Ontario’s total greenhouse gas emissions in 2013. This means that large building owners can play an important role in helping Ontario meet its conservation and greenhouse gas reduction objectives. The new legislation would enable a requirement for property owners of large buildings that are 50,000 square feet and above to track their building’s energy and water use, as well as greenhouse gas emissions, over time to determine how a building’s energy performance is changing over time and how it compares to similar buildings, giving businesses the tools they need to remain competitive and save money, too.", "Ontario is already demonstrating leadership through energy reporting and benchmarking requirements for government and broader public sector buildings. Extending this requirement to large commercial buildings would align our policy with jurisdictions across the United States, Europe, the United Kingdom and Asia, which is all very critical and important in the global economy that we operate in.", "The second one is setting water efficiency standards for energy-using products. Ontario already has the most stringent efficiency requirements in Canada for a number of products. The Ministry of Energy has been regulating the energy efficiency of products and appliances for more than 25 years. Bill 135 proposes to add the water efficiency standards for energy-consuming products initiatives. To maintain Ontario’s leadership role in regulating energy efficiency and to fully harmonize efficiency requirements, as I mentioned earlier, with leading North American jurisdictions, the Ministry of Energy is proposing to regulate the water efficiency of products and appliances that consume both water and energy, such as dishwashers and washing machines. Products that meet both energy and water efficiency requirements use less energy.", "Currently, manufacturers can supply the Ontario market with models that meet our energy efficiency requirements but consume more energy than they would if we also included water efficiency standards. Other jurisdictions, including the province of British Columbia and the US Department of Energy, regulate both energy and water efficiency standards for these products. By harmonizing with the US standards for these products, Ontario can streamline the process for manufacturers, save consumers money and show continued leadership in setting efficiency standards.", "Adding water efficiency standards to the existing energy efficiency regulation would streamline requirements for manufacturers and increase opportunities for consumers to choose a more efficient product. We are, Speaker, empowering consumers with this initiative.", "During the committee public hearings for this bill, we heard positive reactions from several stakeholders, including from the Building Owners and Managers Association, the Toronto Atmospheric Fund, the Real Property Association of Canada and companies working in the energy efficiency sector. Brian Purcell, director of policy and programs at the Toronto Atmospheric Fund, said, “We really encourage the province to move forward with that type of policy, and we’re encouraged to see it as part of the package of legislative updates to the Green Energy Act that are part of Bill 135.”", "Bala Gnanam, director of sustainability and building technologies with the Building Owners and Managers Association, said, “As a major stakeholder in the province’s commercial real estate industry, we are fully supportive of any initiative aimed at promoting building performance and environmental stewardship. We also welcome the minister’s customer-centric approach to the province’s long-term energy plan.”", "Brooks Barnett, manager of government relations, said: “We view this bill in its entirety as a major enabler of enhanced energy management and improved communication of key industry trends. The overarching theme throughout Ontario’s long-term energy plan is the commitment to put conservation first. We believe that these proposals are indicative of the government’s commitment to energy conservation in Ontario.", "“In this, Ontario has a chance to lead by example.”", "To sum up, Madam Speaker, the planning of the 2013 long-term energy plan was based on both a wide range of datasets and the most comprehensive consultation in Ministry of Energy history. By enshrining this planning process in legislation, this will ensure that we have the best information and planning for Ontario’s energy future and that the process is transparent and the data is made available to inform the public and the process.", "The ministry and government have worked so hard to finally be here in the Legislature and are so close to solidifying the act. If passed, Bill 135 means an open, transparent and highly collaborative future, with energy planning that is conducted in a manner consistent with the government’s open-dialogue initiative. It would continue to build on the comprehensive public consultation and engagement already undertaken with consumers, stakeholders and aboriginal communities as part of the 2013 long-term energy planning process, more commonly known, of course, as LTEP.", "In conservation, if passed, the new legislation would give Ontarians the information we need to make smart energy decisions about the products we use and the places we live and work. As more Ontarians want to conserve energy, we are empowering them to do so, which is a really important next step. The new knowledge would help people manage their energy bills, help businesses remain competitive and create jobs, and help our province reach its conservation and greenhouse gas emission goals as well.", "From conservation first to helping consumers, businesses and industries save money and nuclear refurbishment, the Ministry of Energy is at the forefront of projects that matter to people. The top priority will always be ensuring that Ontario’s electricity needs are met in a sustainable manner. Developing renewable energy sources and fostering a culture of conservation are cornerstones of Ontario’s balanced plan to provide clean and reliable energy while encouraging the development of a clean energy economy for our future. Our efforts today will have benefits lasting for many years and many generations to come.", "Speaker, I look forward to seeing how this act, if accepted, will make that future happen, and I encourage all members of this House to support this cleaner, carbon-free future." ],

It’s a burden on electricity payers, families, businesses across this province, and that’s not even to mention smart meters or the gas plant scandal. This bill is a disaster." ],

  "text" : [ "I am doing that, Speaker, very closely, because this is about the power of the minister. But in order to establish why we are so opposed to this bill, we have to talk a little bit about the history of the Ministry of Energy and what they did to this province, costing us $1billion—shameful.", "Let’s go back to that. The minister then cancelled the plants. Now we’ve got a situation where we’re building transmission lines from Sarnia down to Oakville, from Lennox down to Mississauga. Why? Because they decided they were going to cancel it for political reasons. As the Premier said herself, admitted herself, it was a political decision—a political decision. Political decisions aren’t made by what used to be the OPA or the IESO. Political decisions are made by the politicians. That was a political decision that cost this province and its energy ratepayers over $1 billion.", "That was when the minister didn’t have Bill 135 in his or her pocket, whoever the minister will be today, tomorrow and into the future. That was without Bill 135. Now this government, through the power of its majority, where it ran roughshod over us at committee, has decided that they don’t want to retain the powers the minister had; they want to increase those powers so that the minister can actually ignore the best advice of the professionals at the IESO and the Ontario Energy Board. They can just take the OEB and the IESO, fold them into a little ball and toss them in the garbage, because they don’t need to talk to them anymore. The minister is the supreme being. The minister will make the decisions.", "They talk about consultation? That is a sham. We looked at that in the bill. Oh, yes, they’re going to travel all over the province, just like they do on everything else. What about those pre-budget hearings that amounted to nothing? The minister had already written the budget, and they were still out, going around the province: “Oh, what do you think we should do in the budget?” What a joke that was. So what do you think we’re going to get on a consultation process throughout this province if Bill 135 passes?", "You know what? I love the way they line up their supporters and get their quotes. When they’re answering questions in the House, they’ll have some group that will say, “Oh, this is the best thing since the invention of the wheel.” And then they say, “See, everybody loves us.” They even talk about that when it comes to hydro rates. They say, “Oh, look at Joe from wherever, Kalamazoo”—it might as well be Kalamazoo—“says that his hydro bill has gone down.” So the Minister of Finance gets up in the House, saying, “Hydro rates are going down in the province of Ontario.”", "Now we’re going to have Bill 135, where we don’t just crown the minister; we make him the emperor of energy. Not the energy czar; that’s not high enough. I hate to disagree with my friend from Toronto–Danforth, but “energy czar” is not a strong enough title. He’s going to be the emperor of energy. He will just be able to ignore the sound advice of the professionals.", "We had the Society of Energy Professionals—the professionals who run the plants, the professionals who run the system. It’s highly unusual for them to come to a committee hearing and disagree with a minister of the crown, but they came to the hearings and said, “Don’t proceed with this bill unamended. We cannot have that kind of power put into the hands of one person.” Ignored.", "I’ve got to say to my colleague from Toronto–Danforth, I was shocked, and I believe he was as well. I can’t speak for him, but he is the member from Toronto–Danforth, and he is the energy critic for the third party. I believe he was as shocked as I was that none of our amendments were accepted by the government. They ask us: “Are you going to vote for this?” Are they crazy? We didn’t vote for it the last time. They didn’t make any changes. We won’t be—" ],

Their world has been turned upside down, and their child is hurting. We can’t begin to imagine the raw emotions, self-doubts and uncertainties of parents whose child is affected by this life-threatening illness. In the words of my hero, Terry Fox, “Somewhere the hurting must stop.”", "The intention is that whether it’s through members’ statements or recognition by way of resolutions like mine, we take the time every September to recognize our children and youth and let them know that they are not alone, and that we will do better for them by standing united to conquer childhood cancer.", "Consider the impact of it, just in Ontario. On any given day, 3,000 kids need cancer care in our province. Four hundred more children will be diagnosed with cancer this year. Two in three, or 65%, will suffer long-term effects, including infertility, heart disease, hearing loss and learning disabilities.", "Children are most affected by leukemias (32%), central nervous system tumours (19%) and lymphomas (11%), kidneys, bones and muscles. The average child’s age is five. One in five, or 20%, sadly, will die.", "Yet it is estimated that only 3% of cancer research money is directed to childhood cancers, according to Childhood Cancer International.", "As childhood cancer is the number one cause of disease-related death for children ages one to 14, the fight should not be fought alone. Across the entire world, from the United Arab Emirates to China, people are taking action to raise awareness of prevention and early detection of cancer. That is what the Gold Ribbon Campaign is about: to mobilize help for raising funds for family support, research and, most importantly, finding cures and saving our beloved children.", "Last September, my constituent, cancer advocate and dad Neal Rourke, did just that when he, along with three young cancer survivors, rang the opening bell at the Toronto Stock Exchange in recognition of childhood cancer. Volunteers like Neal are reminding us that we need to do more so we can build a future free from cancer; that is, to build on the progress achieved, and to make new drug research possible so we can ensure a brighter and healthier future for all of our children. That means government, industry, hospitals, research institutes and individual and corporate donors—everyone—has to join the fight against childhood cancer.", "My reason for introducing this resolution is also a personal one: It is in memory of Conah Higgins and Neal’s son, Brendan Rourke, whose childhoods have been regretfully cut short. I stood in this House probably about a year and a half or so ago, Madam Speaker, and we celebrated, again, as a result of Neal’s encouragement and urging to recognize and wear gold ribbons in the House.", "Conah Higgins is a young man, the son of dear family friends from England. Conah was in the process of moving to Canada from the UK when he sadly passed away from cancer at the age of 17. He really didn’t even know he had it. He started out with a little sore on his arm. By the time he got diagnosed, it was only about two or three months that he actually survived after that.", "The other is in memory of Brendan Rourke, a young man from my riding of Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound, and to recognize the tireless advocacy work of his father, Neal, who, in collaboration with an international network of parent groups and survivor networks, is raising funds, is raising awareness for young boys and girls whose childhoods have been regretfully cut short.", "It was proud the day that, I believe, Neal was able to stand with those other survivors and ring the bell and light up the CN Tower. I know that Neal has got lots of plans. I’ve never seen someone so dedicated: the energy that he puts in, the conviction, the commitment. That, of course, is a legacy to his son, but also so that others don’t have to suffer what he and his family have gone through.", "Volunteers like Neal are reminding us that we need to do more so we can build a future free from cancer—to build, as I said earlier, on that progress achieved to make new drug research possible so we can ensure a brighter and healthier future for all of our children. It means all of us: government, industry, hospitals, research institutes, and individual and corporate donors—everyone has to join together to fight childhood cancer.", "Madam Speaker, there are stories like what I have just shared with Conah and Brendan every day, sadly. I recommend that we recognize their extraordinary challenges and feats. They deserve to be honoured by having this resolution passed today so that every year in September we take the time to recognize the brave fight that these amazing children and their parents and their support circle of friends and family realize every day in their communities and in our communities.", "While this is just really scratching the surface of what really needs to be done, it’s nevertheless, I believe, an important commitment we need to make to our children. It’s a symbol that we are here for them, that we will make the effort to find a cure, that we’ll work tirelessly to ensure that we give them every opportunity to grow and thrive and live in a world that is free from cancer in all its forms.", "In the end, it is my hope that we will soon, for the dream of my hero, Terry Fox, find a cure for all cancers. “Somewhere the hurting must stop.”" ],

His name is Landen Harasym. He found me on Facebook and he called me and sent me a message. He said, “Would you mind coming to my mom’s place of work? We’re raising awareness for childhood cancer, and I’d like to paint your nails.” So, of course, into my truck I go, and off I go to Manitoulin Island. I sit down and meet up with him. I had no idea they organized this. The media was there to take pictures, and it was just a fabulous afternoon of doing this. I met up with his beautiful little sister—her name is Hailee—his grandmother Marilyn and his mom, Marilee Harasym.", "It was just a wonderful shop. They painted my nails in nice little yellows and blues and purples and bright greens. You know, nice fall colours. It was really, really pretty. If you ever want to get out of your comfort zone—and this is what awareness is all about: getting out of your comfort zone so that you can create awareness. Mind you, I have no problem getting out of my comfort zone. I actually look at opportunities to get out of my comfort zone to raise awareness for a vast number of issues that I believe in.", "They painted my nails, and we had a wonderful afternoon. We had chit-chats and everything. That afternoon, I left Manitoulin Island and went to meet up with the cattlemen’s association. That afternoon was the first time I met up with the cattlemen’s association. Mind you, it was the first time they met up with their local member of Parliament that afternoon, as well, and when I extended my hand to shake hands with them, they went, “Whoa, look at his painted nails.” They took a step back and were wondering, “What the heck are we getting involved with? This is our member?”", "I explained the situation and everybody just goes, “Oh, yes, that’s right. Good on you. Good on you for doing that.” So I left that event after a bunch of chuckles, and I’m leaving Manitoulin Island with my wife. Madam Speaker, I was going too fast. My wife and I were in a heated exchange at the moment, and one of our finest from the province pulls me over. I’m not making this up. You can’t make this story up. This happened. It was actually in one of my columns in my riding.", "The police officer pulls me over, comes over to my window, and I can see in the rear-view mirror that he is not impressed. He comes over, I roll down my window and I turn around and look at him, and say, “You know, I have no explanation. I’m sorry. You got me. I was going too fast.” “Driver’s licence and registration.”", "I reach into my glove compartment and pull them out. He does, “What the heck?” He sees my nails that are painted, and he questions me. He says—he looks at that, and I say, “Do you want an explanation?” And he goes, “No.” I said, “Well, you’re going to get it anyway.” So I give him the explanation as to what I was doing. He hands me back my slip and tells me, “Now I understand, Mr. Mantha. You’re rushing home to finish buffing your nails. Slow down. Have a nice day.”", "Now, the story doesn’t end there, because I turned around the next day and made an extra donation because of the speeding ticket I got out of, the extra charge, because I was going to get charged a hefty amount that day. I called Landen and I said, “Thank you very much for what you did for me by painting my nails. You basically saved my wallet.”", "Developing that relationship with him—he often comes back, and I want to let everyone know that Landen has been in remission from the cancer that he had gone through for, I believe, six or seven years now. He often comes up to my condo. Each and every one of us who has a condo here—I live close to the hospital, so I offer my apartment to each and every person across my riding who is in financial difficulties because it’s just a skip and a hop for them. Plus, it gives me company. Sometimes, when a mom or a grandpa or even a dad comes over, I get to have a free supper and company when I go home. It’s always nice to have them.", "Those are some of the stories that I have. These kids love to come up. They walk down Yonge Street, go up Bay Street, go down to the aquarium. Each and every one of us has that opportunity to open up our hearts and give our homes to them. I would encourage you all to do it, and I want to commend the member for bringing this forward." ],

I want to salute the member from Bruce–Grey–Owen Sound for tabling this conversation today and for his passion, too. I had a chance to listen to your remarks. It’s really touching and it’s one of the great things about private members’ time, when we get to hear from all members of the House about how, sometimes, they come into public life with their personal experiences and what got them here. It’s clear for everyone here today that your passion was really put in front of us today, and we salute you for that. I love that you talked about Terry Fox. I’m going to talk about him in a second.", "What a pleasure to talk about something that touches us all and is so important. It’s often said—and it seems trite but it’s true—that cancer is a disease that touches us all. I’m sure every single member of this House has lost a family member, a friend or neighbour, and among them are children who have died of cancer. I have friends who are in that boat. I don’t have children myself but I have friends who have children and who have lost children to cancer.", "I remember very vividly friends of mine whose daughter died of cancer at a young age. We all took turns staying with her at SickKids while she went through her course of treatment. I’m proud to say that I was part of that village that helped them and her. While she didn’t survive that horrible disease, it was a privilege to be with that family and with her on her very difficult journey.", "We have much to do when it comes to looking after our children who are diagnosed with cancer, because they are forced to grow up far too quickly. We know that these little angels, some of whom have gone to heaven, have really touched us all. We see in their spirit the impacts of the disease that they’ve had to face and the challenges that they’ve had: the endless medical treatments that they have to go through and the appointments. These are times when they should be learning, enjoying, playing and growing up, and instead, unfortunately, they’re in the grips of this horrible disease.", "The good news, of course, is that some of them do survive. While Ontario is a leader in cancer care, and while our survival rates are amongst the highest in the world, as has been noted already, we need to and must focus—particularly when it comes to our children—on better outcomes.", "We understand that cancer care is an important example of how investments are being made. I think it’s worth noting that our government has increased funding to Cancer Care Ontario from $333 million in 2003 to over $1.8 billion in 2014-15. That is an important number, Speaker, because it speaks to the growing challenges with cancer.", "Children battling cancer have unique needs, and they need a support system. Thankfully, we have that system. I think it’s again important to note that it takes a village. What we have here in Ontario is the Pediatric Oncology Group of Ontario, or POGO, which plans, supports and seeks treatment, and is part of the framework of treatment for children. That system includes a provincial registry, a networked information system and evidence-based clinical practice guidelines.", "These things are very important, again. They’re part of the infrastructure for treatment. This system is designed to monitor the incidence and prevalence of childhood cancers, the demand for care and the workload of pediatric oncology programs, patient outcomes and the long-term effects of childhood cancer, all of which, again, are part of the larger issue. I’m proud to say that our government gave POGO, the Pediatric Oncology Group of Ontario, $6.3 million in base funding this year.", "While we’re making inroads, and while our cancer system has improved significantly in the past years—we can say that we measure more, we know more and we report more—we’re working towards increased accountability and continued improvement, because children in Ontario can and need to receive the best care that there is to offer.", "Again, I want to salute the member opposite for allowing us to have this conversation today. This has touched us all. Continued advocacy on behalf of children facing a battle with cancer: There probably isn’t a much more important topic that we could be discussing, and so I’m pleased to take part in it.", "By shining a light on this issue and encouraging Ontarians across the province to join in the fight against childhood cancers, we can help to ensure that all children have that opportunity to be kids, and to become the leaders of our province and of our future that we know that they can be.", "Thanks so much, Speaker, for this opportunity." ],

So we need those people out there who have a passion in their heart, get involved and either create organizations to offer different types of support or just fundraise for support or research.", "I’m really pleased, when we do have these commemorative ribbons and pins that we wear and we promote things, that we use our social media accounts not just to promote ourselves, not just to promote our side of the House in partisan politics, but we use them to promote all the great people across Ontario who want to fight for a better quality of life for everybody.", "I think that that is what’s really the focus: to do the best that we can do for the children of Ontario. We know we can’t wave that magic wand and make everything perfect and make all childhood cancer disappear, but we can certainly do more to raise awareness and to help in the prevention and to help in the treatment.", "When we hear news reports about parents whose children have meningitis and they don’t understand that there is science behind the treatments, that there are specialists—we have fantastic doctors in Ontario, but if the child is not brought by the parents and the child can’t express that, “I want to see a doctor or a specialist or travel to Toronto to SickKids Hospital”—the child can’t fight for themselves, so it’s really our job to fight for the kids and to help the people who are there to fight for the kids.", "I knew a woman—just somebody I worked out with at the gym—and she had two identical twin boys, four years old. One had leukemia and passed away and the other one was not ill and didn’t. I think about it a lot, because here you have living proof: a twin who doesn’t have his identical twin brother.", "I want to bring up one issue sometimes with childhood cancers. My son actually had his thyroid removed—it was a malignant tumour—when he was 11 and a half. He was the oldest of four kids, so you can imagine the struggle that was, when you have three younger kids at home and you don’t want them to know everything that’s going on. He was 11 and a half years old. He was too old to be at SickKids but not quite old enough to be at Mount Sinai, which is the centre for thyroid cancer in Canada. Very few children have thyroid cancer, not because they can’t have it but because it grows very slowly and it’s not detected that young. A friend of mine is a pediatrician and it was caught very early and he got treatment very early. We were very fortunate that Mount Sinai Hospital agreed to take him on as a pretend 12-year-old, and he was followed from then on.", "He’s now starting his cardiology training. He has finished internal medicine and he will be taking care of many patients in Canada. So what goes around comes around. When we save a child’s life, that child could go on to do fantastic things." ],

It is a sad reality that so many of our young people suffer from cancer. There are about 10,000 children living with cancer in Canada today. Each year, about 1,500 new cases are diagnosed.", "Childhood cancer is unique. It’s not just a subset of adult cancer; it has its own specific biology and treatment and effects of treatment. On the one hand, adults are most affected by breast, lung, prostate, bowel and bladder cancers. Children, meanwhile, are most affected by leukemia and by tumours of the brain, nervous system, lymphatic system, kidney, bones and muscles. Leukemia is the most commonly diagnosed of these, comprising some 30% of the total new cases diagnosed each year. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or ALL, is the most common form and comprises about 75% of these cases, with peak incidence at two to three years of age.", "For adulthood cancers, causes can often be traced back to lifestyle, things like the environment, diet, alcohol, smoking—and I’m sure politics plays a role in there as well. But children’s cancers usually aren’t explainable, especially to a child. With the causes in most cases unknown, it presents that much more of a challenge to mitigate and to treat. The same treatments are often used for children. Just as with adults, they too undergo chemotherapy, radiation and surgery, but the difference is how they experience these treatments. Children are more likely to have significant side effects like cognitive dysfunction, cataracts or even organ failure. The reality is that these harsh treatments are extremely tough on children’s young and developing bodies. A major difference between the two, though, is that children have an overall cure rate of 80%, much higher than the 50% range for adults.", "Even as cancer survivors, because of the process of treatment, many of these children will continue to experience health challenges throughout their lives. The health effects go beyond just what happens to their bodies. Cancer and all that is involved with treating it can prompt psychological and emotional issues for children long after a diagnosis or a cure. Their families, too, are wrapped up in the treatment of childhood cancer. They are such crucial supports to these young patients and, in so doing, often have to make tremendous sacrifices.", "Parents and other family members can also be affected both emotionally and in other ways. Some common family concerns during treatment include, of course, financial stresses—the member from Algoma–Manitoulin mentioned this—travelling to and staying near the cancer centre, the possible loss of a job and the need for home schooling. Cancer is really not limited to just the one person who suffers; its impact goes far beyond that.", "There’s no doubt that we’ve come a long way in terms of treating cancer for children and for adults. The survival rate is about 80%, and has risen from 46% since the 1960s. But there is so much more that can be done, which is why raising awareness about childhood cancer is such an important goal. Childhood cancer is still responsible for more deaths of children and adolescents in Canada than any other disease: more than asthma, diabetes, cystic fibrosis and AIDS combined. Canada loses tens of thousands of years of potential life each year to childhood cancer, and the impact of improvements in treatment and survival for childhood cancer could have a profound effect on our country, our province and our communities.", "Take, for example, the story of Laura Hillier, a teen in Burlington who recently lost her life from a rare form of cancer. Even at one of the province’s top cancer treatment centres, Juravinski Hospital in Hamilton, she wasn’t able to get the treatment she needed in time.", "I just want to say a few words about Laura, if I can get through this. She made a promise to her mother. She became an advocate for childhood cancer and for access to appropriate treatment throughout her journey. She made her mother promise that her mother would carry on this important cause. “She’s left an important mark,” said a doctor at Juravinski Hospital. “Laura and her mom really did the province and across the country a service in highlighting what they’ve gone through and the importance of the issue. It’s had an effect at multiple levels.”", "Her mom said, “She lived her life to help others. There was no half measure for her. If she was going to do something, she was going to give it everything she had.” That’s what we should do as well, not only to honour the life of Laura Hillier, but also to make sure that no other family in the province of Ontario has to go through what she did. Her mother finally said that she showed “incredible determination and resilience” throughout her battles with cancer.", "I’ll be thinking of Laura and the other children in the province of Ontario when I walk in the Relay for Life at WCI on Friday. I commend the member for bringing this forward. It is important. This is a shared cause that we all have. It’s a shared responsibility we all have. Laura made a difference, and this government listened on two issues that Laura was particularly concerned about. This is the place to get things done and to work together to improve the health of all Ontarians." ],

This month will allow us to take a moment to remember and think about the lives lost and those who are still fighting this devastating disease, and to stand together with the families who are facing this terrible disease. It’s about dedicating ourselves together to fighting this disease together.", "I’m sure that everyone here who has a child or grandchild, or a friend or neighbour, can sympathize with any family coping with childhood cancer. No one wants to see a child suffer, ever, and certainly not from a disease as scary or as devastating as cancer.", "I have two children of my own, and I cannot even begin to imagine what it must be like to watch your child undergo cancer treatment. I have, however, watched a young girl in our local community, at our local school, struggle with cancer. It was a moving experience and one that I really walked away from feeling completely at a loss to understand how this could happen to a child. The good news is that she was courageous, and she is a cancer survivor.", "I’m proud to say that Ontario is a leader in cancer care in Canada and around the world. This year, the Cancer Quality Council of Ontario revealed that our province’s cancer survival rates are among the highest worldwide, and I know our government is working hard to push those rates even higher. We have increased funding to Cancer Care Ontario from $333.8 million in 2003-04 to $1.8 billion in 2014-15. We’ve also increased funding for stem cell transplants by more than 600%—600%—in recent years.", "But, of course, we know that too many Ontarians are diagnosed with cancer every year, and we could still do more. That’s why I encourage all of my colleagues here in the House today to support this motion to declare September Childhood Cancer Awareness Month. This is just one more way that all of us can work together to help protect our most beloved and our most vulnerable: our children." ],

In my case, the childhood cancer story was very meaningful, because it was across the street from where I live: A seven-month-old baby who was still nursing was diagnosed with leukemia. It had the entire neighbourhood just torn between being frozen in horror and anxious to help where possible. It certainly demonstrates that while cancer may be something that is a terrible thing to go through, at the same time, it brings out the best in everyone around you.", "This was a family with four children and a dairy farm. To see the way in which people slipped in to provide meals, take over the management of a dairy herd, get the baby and mother, on a regular basis, down to Sick Children’s—and, of course, the baby was there for a long time, in and out for seven months. At the same time as this family was dealing with leukemia with a baby, so was someone else who came into the same unit. It just made it very difficult, because the other one didn’t survive.", "But the baby who was my neighbour—it was very difficult, as you can imagine, to have a seven-month-old to be able to communicate and be able to explain anything that was happening and so forth. But one message that the baby was able to make was when he had been there for a while and had the experience of all the specialists coming in. When he saw them, he’d say, “Bye-bye.” He knew that it would be better when they were gone. But he fought a tough battle. I have to tell you that, last year, in a grade 5 class, he came up to me and he said, “Mrs. Munro, I’m your neighbour from across the road.” It was a real thrill to see someone who, by the way, is taller than I, but the picture of health and such a success story.", "As we know, all too many are diagnosed and either lose their battle with cancer or are unable to enjoy good health in the years following diagnosis. Cases like this are, of course, tragic for the family and leave an impact on the community.", "But we can look at some initiatives like Camp Ooch, which provides an opportunity for children who have been challenged. It’s a camp in Muskoka, and it serves the Toronto-area hospitals.", "So there are things that we can look at as demonstrations of where we have been successful in providing some opportunity for families.", "We need to stand united to conquer this disease, and we need to have the goal-driven campaign to help shine a light on the types of cancer that affect children in our communities." ],

A local family donated $50 million to the hospital in memory of their son Michael, who died of cancer. Berna and Myron Garron made tremendous amounts of money in manufacturing. Their son was diagnosed at seven years old, had over five years of extensive treatments, and eventually he succumbed at 13. He was lying on his deathbed, and he said to his mother, “I’m so worried that I will be forgotten.” His mother said, “Don’t worry. We will never forget you.” They put up $50 million in his memory, and in his honour we’ve renamed the Toronto East General Hospital the Michael Garron Hospital, as part of the Toronto East Health Network.", "As we dropped the veil on that renaming, I was struck by how powerfully I felt the loss of not their son, who I didn’t know, but of my brother Bruce Thomas Aidan Potts, who died in a car accident—actually, he was in a coma for 10 years before he succumbed—and of my nephew Jason Gareth Thomas Potts, who was diagnosed with brain cancer at about three and died at 12. He went through incredible treatments, and he was such an incredible spirit. I recognize how sometimes cancer affects families in broader ways than just the cancer. His older brother, so depressed when the cancer came back for the third time, died of self-inflicted wounds. I remember my nephew on his sickbed, saying, “Why did my brother take his life? I told him—doesn’t he know?—it always gets better.” Those were the near-dying words of my nephew as he was remembering his brother.", "I’m so delighted that you brought this piece forward, because bringing greater awareness in September to remember the lives of our young ones is what I was thinking about as we revealed that flag. It’s not just about their son; it’s about us all remembering those who died young in our lives." ],

It’s long been a symbol of hope and a chance for individuals and communities across our great province to come together to raise funds and continue to fight against cancer.", "Unfortunately, cancer stands as the number one cause of disease-related death for children under the age of 14. Tragically, one in five of these children will die and two in three will suffer long-term effects as a consequence of dealing with this disease in their youth.", "I’m encouraged, Speaker, by the universal agreement that I hear from members of the Legislature on this important resolution. Going forward, we have an opportunity again this afternoon to ensure that no child should ever have to face cancer alone, and we will be able to encourage our communities particularly in fighting against this dreadful disease." ],

  "text" : [ "I’d like to begin by welcoming some constituents from Parry Sound–Muskoka to the Legislature: Stephen Cairns and his wife, Carol Cairns, and friend Mike Forth are here in the members’ gallery today.", "Stephen and his wife, last year, were driving to Niagara-on-the-Lake with their bicycle rack mounted on the back of their vehicle, looking forward to enjoying some cycling in the beautiful area of our province. They got onto the 407, and a friendly OPP officer pulled them over for having a rack obscuring the licence plate on the back of their vehicle, which happens to be against the law in the province of Ontario. They did have a transponder on board, so they weren’t trying to avoid the fee for using the 407, and they did explain that to the OPP officer, but they were charged anyway. So I have that one incident, and I’ll come back to that, hopefully, if have time.", "A few years back, I had Ian Dawes from Ecclestone Cycle, who, incidentally, is the son-in-law of the Minister of Education here in the province of Ontario and has a cycle shop in Bracebridge. He called my constituency office saying that he’d had some customers who had been stopped by police for having bicycle racks obscuring their licence plate.", "Sylvia Jones wrote to the minister and copied me, saying—this is her letter:", "“I have received several inquiries from Dufferin–Caledon drivers who have received tickets because a bicycle rack was obstructing the rear licence plate.", "“Rear-mounted bicycle racks are a popular item for bicycle enthusiasts because of ease of installation and use. Many Ontarians who want to transport their bikes to and from trails and paths cannot easily lift their bicycle to a roof-mounted rack. The availability of rear-mounted bicycle racks leads sellers and purchasers to believe they are 100% allowable.”", "She goes on to say: “Minister, the province is promoting and encouraging active living, but the rules surrounding transportation [are] causing confusion. I believe the legislation needs to be clarified to ensure cyclists can safely and legally transport their bicycles throughout the province.”", "Surprise, surprise: I agree with her letter. That’s why I have brought forward this legislation, co-sponsored by the member from Burlington, to allow for regulations to provide an exemption for rear-mounted bicycle racks.", "I might note that other jurisdictions do allow for exemptions. For example, the state of Utah allows, “Licence plates may be reasonably obscured by a trailer hitch, a wheelchair lift or wheelchair carrier, a trailer being towed by the vehicle, a bicycle rack, ski rack, or luggage rack, or a similar cargo-carrying device.” There are many other jurisdictions that do allow for this.", "I wanted to go on and mention that in the case of my constituent, he and his wife pointed out that they purchased their bicycle rack at Canadian Tire. They’re sold all over the place, and thousands of people have these racks. In fact, I have one myself, and I’ve done the same trip they talked about, going with my wife to Niagara-on-the-Lake. We did a similar trip to Prince Edward county, completely unaware that we were breaking the law. Thousands of people do that. When you buy it at Canadian Tire, it doesn’t have a big sign on it saying, “This may be illegal when you put it on your vehicle.” You have to buy it, get it home, open it and read the owner’s manual, and there in fine print it says, “In some jurisdictions this might not be legal.” I don’t think that’s very fair to the consumer. It’s my feeling that when you have a law that many people are inadvertently breaking without realizing they’re breaking the law, it’s a law that really should be changed. That’s what this private member’s bill is about.", "Madam Speaker, I guess I’d just like to come back to the Cairns case and mention that in their case, they didn’t know they were breaking the law. They got pulled over, they got charged, and then they had to go to court. They had to come from Muskoka, first of all, for one trip down just to let them know they were going to fight the case, and then another day back down to Vaughan to go to court over the case. Then, when they got to court, they basically won the case in part because of the fact that it was obvious they weren’t trying to avoid paying the fee to go on the 407—but also when they produced pictures of OPP vehicles with similar racks mounted on the backs of their vehicles being used around the province.", "I just think this makes sense, to make a change that will make it legal to have rear-mounted bicycle racks, and other racks; it’s not just limited to bicycle racks. It would also allow for wheelchair and luggage racks in the province of Ontario. As the member from Burlington will agree, I’m sure, we’re trying to promote healthy living. We’re trying to promote safe cycling and we’re trying to make it easy for people to be able to use their bicycles. This is one small way of being able to do that.", "Because this is co-sponsored by the member from Burlington, I will now hand it over to the member from Burlington to use the next six minutes." ],

I want to welcome his constituents here. I’m pleased to see you. Thank you for making the trip; it’s important to have you here.", "Madam Speaker, as the member opposite mentioned, this is an important issue, an important conversation. Sometimes, some of the issues that we raise here in private members’ time are personal to us all. I know and I will speak to the member opposite’s commitment to cycling, and my own. This is something that is well worth discussing, so I’m proud to be here.", "That said, issues related to cycling in Ontario, as I mentioned, are close to my heart. Road safety and the safety of cyclists across the province are important issues for me. But this issue isn’t entirely about cycling in a way, because rear racks on cars can carry all kinds of things: skis, surfboards or sometimes even wheelchairs and mobility devices.", "But it does underscore an important fact, and that’s that people who do choose to cycle in our province, whether they’re doing so as a means of daily transportation, cycling tourism, recreation—as the member opposite mentioned, there are so many benefits to cycling. It’s important and timely that we have this conversation today, because our government is encouraging Ontarians to cycle even more and investing heavily in cycling infrastructure, changes to the Highway Traffic Act and cycling-related programs. Again, it’s an important debate and a timely one.", "The safety of our roads and those who use them is always the highest priority for our government. As members well know, we have the safest roads in North America, and we’re proud of that.", "My history as a cycling advocate is known to the members of this House, Speaker. It’s a robust one. It’s twinned with my commitment to road safety. Why? Because prior to my election, of course, in 2014, my commitment to cycling advocacy was promoted by a personal loss when my spouse, OPP Sergeant Greg Stobbart, was killed in a cycling tragedy.", "Again, as someone who was married to a police officer, I shared his passion for cycling, but I also shared his commitment to and passion for road safety, because he spent close to 25 years as a police officer. As the member opposite must know, because his spouse is also an officer, when you live with a police officer, these issues touch you in an even more profound way.", "We want to encourage people to cycle and cycle even more. As the member opposite mentioned, we want to help people discover the benefits of getting on their bikes, and safety is paramount to us, of course.", "We know that cycling is growing. Almost three million Ontarians choose to ride their bikes at least once a week; 32% of them ride their bikes at least monthly, and of those, 4% say they ride a bike daily, with an additional 28% riding weekly. Almost 600,000 people in this province are riding their bikes every day, and that’s critically important.", "Cycling tourism is also an important conversation that we’re having in Ontario. Why? Because we look to Quebec, which has invested over $200 million in the Route verte. It brings them $134 million in return on that investment. Ontario wants to realize some of those revenues, and we want our people to be cycling.", "We know, too, that just south of us, in the United States, they have a 50,000-mile bike route that they’re planning and investing in. Cycling adds an astounding $49 billion to the US economy.", "As part of our government’s #CycleON strategy, released in 2013, my colleague the MPP for Cambridge and PA to the Minister of Transportation recently announced the recipients of the Ontario Municipal Cycling Infrastructure Program and the Cycling Training Fund, two new programs designed to promote cycling and cycling safety in our province. There were over 100 municipalities—150, actually—that applied to that fund. It was a $10-million fund. This is good news, and evidence of the pent-up demand that cycling is in our province.", "The other issue that comes to mind in this debate today is education and awareness. I remember talking to the member opposite about that, too. Why? Because Ontarians who choose to carry their bicycle, their luggage or any other equipment on the back of their vehicle are likely unaware that they are in contravention of the act; they don’t know that their plates were not visible. I think that’s an important thing to mention, because opportunities like this debate carry the inherent possibility to educate Ontarians, but also the debate going forward, which today’s discussion is going to initiate, provides us with that ongoing opportunity to really decide how we’re going to fix this situation and how we’re going to bring the issue to the minds of Ontarians that this is very important for them to know.", "What does this tell us? It tells us that we need a solution, and that a solution is worth exploring. On the face of it, I know and I understand that allowing an exemption, which is one option, might seem like a straightforward solution. But it’s worth noting that, in doing so, there might be unintended consequences. So I’m a little bit torn, because I want this issue to be explored; I want us to find a solution. Again, I think that, moving forward, a broader consultation is necessary; perhaps a discussion at committee, which I would absolutely welcome.", "As I mentioned earlier, I’m aware of the issues and dangers of road safety and enforcement because of my late husband. We know, too, that it’s important for front and rear licence plates to be visible. Again, how do we engineer that? How do we make it happen? Of course, the member opposite mentioned the 407. The people here today experience that. There are red light cameras. The Ontario Association of Chiefs of Police has done a presentation to the government on this issue and reminded us that we need to find solutions.", "But we also understand that, at its core, the intention of this bill is to promote cycling in Ontario, and again, I heartily embrace that.", "As I was preparing for today’s discussion, I found some really interesting opportunities online for in-vehicle technologies that exist in Europe. I think those are worth exploring. We should talk to vehicle manufacturers and cycling equipment manufacturers.", "I look forward to that robust debate, and I want to thank the member opposite again for asking me to join him and for his cycling advocacy in his riding and beyond." ],

I think it’s a great opportunity to show the people of Ontario that when good ideas come forward, we can all get behind the piece of legislation and share that, and ensure that safety becomes paramount.", "This bill seems like a pretty good piece of common sense legislation in the fact that people need to transport their bikes to certain areas in order to participate in cycling, and a hindrance, obviously, is the fact that these racks to mount bikes on the back are obscuring their licence plates and, at the end of the day, they could have a ticket.", "I think this is an easy solution, and I hope the government ensures that this bill gets through committee and back for third reading as soon as possible. I’m hoping that we can have this bill legislated before we break in the second week of June. We have lots of time, and I think this bill should become a priority.", "I think that the cycling strategy is important, and I commend the government for pushing forward with improving cycling. However, my riding was unsuccessful with the grants that were given out, and there are a lot of upset cyclists in my area, because St. Thomas and Elgin county are pretty rural and the roads were never really built to put cyclists on, and they’re so important to the people who like to cycle every day, to get out and ride, but they want to be safe.", "Elgin county has created a cycle path or bike lane on Highway 4 at Sunset Drive over the last few years. I think that’s great. They’re connecting Port Bruce to Port Stanley with widened roads to make it safer, but there are quite a few areas in our area where people like to ride but they aren’t able to do so safely; they do so at their own risk. I’ve seen some of the drivers in our area, and I don’t cycle on the roads mainly because of that.", "Being lighthearted aside, though, in rural Ontario, to get to our trails, sometimes you have to put your bikes on a rack to get to the area you want to go to. The fact that you can get a fine in order to get your bikes—if you can’t fit them in the back of your truck. I have a pick-up truck so I throw the bikes in the back of the truck when I need to go somewhere. However, not everybody has that choice, and it might hinder them from riding.", "My daughter and I like to go for rides in the area. However, the roads we live around—we choose to go on the sidewalk. Again, we could probably get a fine for doing that in our area too, but I’d rather risk that fine than the fact we put ourselves in danger.", "I know that the member from Cambridge has offered to look at the next proposal that my area puts in for the next amount of grants, if they still have them. We’re going to take her up on that. We need to have that money for our area because we don’t have a huge tax base. We’ve lost a lot of manufacturing. We won’t say it was caused by this government—but at least they’re coming back with some cycling infrastructure money. We’d like to get some share of that in order to improve it.", "I also, at this time, just want to give a call-out to the cycling shops in my area because sometimes people in my riding don’t know where to go. My grandfather came from Poland in the late 1920s. He was known as Pop to the neighbourhood. What he would do is fix everyone’s bike, growing up, and he built the first two bikes that I rode. He became known as Pop. I called him Pop; everyone called him Pop in the city, because he fixed bikes. But nowadays we don’t have that many Pops in the area to fix bikes." ],

The cycling communities are growing at a very fast pace throughout Ontario. They are also growing at a very fast pace in northern Ontario; both winter and summer enthusiasts are out there cycling regularly.", "I’ve been newly minted as the co-chair for the all-party cycling caucus, and I work very closely with my friends—and I can say “my friends”—Eleanor and Norm when we’re talking about strategies for the cycling community. It was great that all three of us, along with our critics—we were all at the Ontario Bike Summit, where I was enlightened on a lot of information that was there.", "It was at that point in time that I informed everybody at the summit that I had decided to make some serious health-changing decisions. I’m glad that the member from Bramalea–Gore–Malton is here, because he actually recorded a promise that I had made when I was out at the bike summit. I hadn’t been on a bike in, oh, I would say 20-plus years; it had been a long time. By the end of that evening, I told the delegates that were there that I would get out, get on a bike, ring a bell and do a little bit of pedalling. I did go out, the member did record me and it was a fantastic ride that I did take down on Yonge Street here in Toronto.", "I want to put a shout-out for the group MICA out of Manitoulin Island, the Manitoulin Island Cycling Advocates. They are going to be having the Manitoulin Island cycling passage, which is going to be held on June 4 and 5, I believe, of this summer. There are a vast amount of individuals that come from southern Ontario, who jump on the Chi-Cheemaun and come and enjoy the cycling routes that are there on Manitoulin Island. We receive them wholeheartedly each and every summer and have a wonderful time hosting them at the vast bed and breakfasts and hotels that we have on Manitoulin Island.", "Which brings me to talk about what the member is bringing forward. Basically, we think, from where I stand, it is actual common sense. If you look at a bike rack, what’s the difference between a bike rack or a Ski-Doo trailer? You’re still not looking at the plate. It makes sense that you’re going to have your Ski-Doos on your trailer, but you can’t see the plate that is being covered, because most of the time it’s covered with snow. The bike rack is just making good sense. Again, it’s promoting good, healthy options as far as what is needed in many of our communities across this province.", "I want to put a shout-out to Maja from MICA, from Manitoulin Island, who has been working very hard on behalf of the group in order to establish another thing that we think is a possibility. We put the petition forward to the Minister of Transportation, as far as looking at this as a pilot project. What we’d like to use, in order to bring more cycling enthusiasts, not only to Manitoulin Island but across the province, are the existing signs that are on the cycling routes across Manitoulin Island. Why? It gives an opportunity to the cycling communities to know exactly where they’re going, because individuals that are coming to those areas sometimes get off-course. Having the pilot project so that we can establish it there, to see if it actually works and helps the cycling community to get to and from their destination, I think would be a very positive step forward, such as the common sense that we have with this particular piece of legislation. It would be a very welcome issue going forward.", "There’s the other thing that we also are always diligent on, and it is making sure that when we are working on infrastructure we have those paved shoulders. I’ve been working with the minister, and his assistant as well, to make sure that in upcoming projects, if the opportunity is there, we make sure that those paved shoulders are there. I have to say that on Manitoulin Island we’ve almost got the loop done. We’re working very hard to finish the east end of the island, to make sure that with the upcoming resurfacing that’s happening on the highways, shoulders are included. This is very key, because now we have the trail up the middle. We have the one on the west side, but if we can get the east side as well, that completes an exact cycle, and individuals can really enjoy and benefit from the culture on Manitoulin Island: have the full cycle, a short cycle, a little peek through, it’s all there.", "Again I don’t hear enough talking about Manitoulin Island, because it’s the largest freshwater island in the world. Why wouldn’t we be talking about it? I’m always going to put a plug in for that. You’re all welcome to join us for the passage on June 5, 6, 7. Come enjoy the culture that we have; come and enjoy the North Shore. There are many cycling community activists from Sault Ste. Marie all the way to Sudbury. We’ve almost got that area included within the cycling community, Madam Speaker. I’m looking forward, over the course of the summer, now that I am the co-chair of the all-party cycling community, to going out and actually engaging with all of these discussions to continue my education. I’m glad that my friends Eleanor and Norm are always going to be there to help me out with this. I look to be an advocate with them for the cycling community as well." ],

I also wanted to thank the members from Parry Sound–Muskoka and Burlington for bringing forward this bill this afternoon—to be able to discuss one of my favourite topics, which is cycling.", "Madam Speaker, if you will, I know that the member from Algoma–Manitoulin, at the bike summit that I also attended, made the commitment that he was going to get out on the bike, and I want to commend him that he’s already taken up the challenge.", "Here’s the other challenge: He talks about all the great work that we’ve been doing as a province to help complete some of the trails, especially on Manitoulin Island. There’s been some provincial infrastructure cycling money to be able to complete some of that. If he’s going to take up the challenge, and I get up there to do that trail, I’m wondering if the member will agree to come out on the trail with me at the time.", "It’s great today to comment about that. I have to say that it’s great to hear some of the really positive comments that we’ve got from many members in the House this afternoon who are actually part of the cycling caucus. I really appreciate the support.", "One of the reasons that I love this topic is because I’m the parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Transportation, and the cycling strategy of Ontario is my file and in my mandate letter. I’ve had the opportunity, for almost two years now, to be able to work on this file and to look at various ways that we can get more people out on their bike.", "As we know, Madam Speaker, right now, just about three million people hop on their bike in Ontario at least once a week. Some of those folks are there daily. They’re cycling and they’re commuting, and they very much understand a lot of the benefits of cycling, such as the health benefits from the exercise; when you’re on a bike, there’s no greenhouse gas emissions being produced; it’s great for tourism; it’s great for just getting out and around and being social; and, also, a great way to see our province.", "I also wanted to talk about road safety, because being out on the bike and sharing the road with other road users brings me back to the transportation file. I have to say that I’m enormously proud of our Ministry of Transportation. MTO has really worked very, very hard over the last few decades to ensure that we have some of the best and safest roads in North America to travel on, whether you’re a pedestrian, a cyclist or a driver.", "I’ve got to say that, over the last 10 years, Ontario has been first or second in North America as one of the safest jurisdictions in road safety, and that’s something that we can be enormously proud of. The safety of our roads is always important to us. We know that there’s more work that can be done, and it continues to be one of our highest priorities.", "We were very pleased, last year, to be able to bring forward the Making Ontario’s Roads Safer act, Bill 31, which had a lot of pieces of legislation that really worked hard to ensure that it’s safer for our cyclists to be on the road with that. We wanted to just reiterate some of those provisions that are now coming on to our roads. It’s not only protecting drivers, but our cyclists.", "When we’re talking about dooring, which is the act when somebody opens their car door into the path of an oncoming cyclist, those fines and some of the demerit points have been increased for drivers, upon conviction, for dooring cyclists. If that happens, they now face a fine range of $300 to $1,000 and, potentially, three demerit points.", "Drivers of motor vehicles must also now maintain a minimum of one-metre safe passing, where practical, when passing cyclists. The fine range for that offence has been increased to $60 to $500 and two demerit points, if convicted.", "In addition to these items, we now allow cyclists to ride on the paved shoulders of unrestricted highways. I know that the member from Algoma–Manitoulin was talking about paved shoulders. On unrestricted highways now, cyclists can get out there. I know that some of the cycling infrastructure money that has gone forward from the province has been to address some of the areas in the province that needed more paved shoulders.", "In addition to all that work, we’ve got the ability now to allow contraflow bicycle lanes on one-way roads. I know that here in the city of Toronto, there are several instances where that’s going to be allowed.", "I just wanted to do a shout-out today. I know that yesterday Toronto city council approved the addition of cycling lanes on Bloor Street, and I think that that’s a very good sign that we’re now really putting cycling forward as a very effective mode of transportation. I didn’t even talk about the good things that happen when you’re out of the car: less congestion, fewer cars on the road and better transit options. That really helps those of us who need to be commuting. So we have taken strong action in a number of different ways to protect cycling.", "I also wanted to identify some of the other things that we’ve been doing. The cycling strategy, the #CycleON Action Plan 1.0 that was released in 2014, had a number of action items that we’ve been delivering on steadily since that was released. One of the things that we were talking about was infrastructure money. There was $25 million that was earmarked in that cycling strategy for infrastructure: $15 million worth, which I’ve already talked about, in terms of improving provincial roads, but another $10 million that was identified under the Ontario municipal cycling infrastructure fund.", "On March 11, I was able to announce the first group of recipients of these monies in Cambridge. I was very proud that Waterloo region had three municipalities that were able to go ahead and receive their funds from this particular fund to be able to improve the infrastructure. In total, a number of my colleagues have also announced some of those funds, and it was actually up to about 37 municipalities that received this—a lot of interest, and I know we’ll be looking forward to looking at other programs down the way.", "The other monied fund that we have been releasing recently in the last year or two has been regarding the Cycling Training Fund, and that helps to identify areas where cycling education and making cycling safer have been beneficial.", "When I’m looking at Bill 191 that we’re discussing this afternoon, Madam Speaker, I find that, yes, the two members have identified an issue in Ontario. I know the member for Burlington was saying that it’s not just bike racks on the back that may obscure licence plates, but also other things, including luggage racks with big boxes or suitcases on the back, that may do that. So it is important to bring this bill forward so that we can start discussing this among the ministries that are affected by this and be able to have this discussion as to what kind of solutions we can bring forward.", "Visibility is something that I know is very important, for obvious reasons, but also something that we need to resolve, because the province really does support cycling in the province and we need to identify some of the solutions. Clearly, visible licence plates are important for red light cameras as well as the 407.", "I very much understand that the thrust of this bill is there to make sure that we can continue to have more and more cyclists in the province of Ontario, but also to identify those areas where we need to find a solution that works for all parties. I think it’s important to pass this this afternoon, get it into committee and start looking at some of the solutions that would alleviate the problem but also allow more people in Ontario to be able to hop on their bikes." ],

I’m very pleased to support this bill, co-sponsored by our member from Parry Sound–Muskoka and the member from Burlington. I think this is an opportunity to see the parties come together on such a wonderful topic.", "Speaker, as you’ve heard, as the government of Ontario continues to invest in cycling, it’s important to remove the barriers to accessing cycling and active transportation opportunities. I think that’s the really key point here: The laws need to keep up with the demand and the changes that have been made through the use of these racks and that type of thing. As the member from Parry Sound talked about earlier, the one particular court case was waived, if you will, as the OPP cars themselves have their plates covered. So we understand why, and we understand that this is important to do.", "I think what I’d rather spend time chatting about is the exciting sport and hobby and fun of cycling for families. We heard a few minutes ago about the Ontario Municipal Cycling Infrastructure Program. North Bay did receive the maximum, $300,000, for that, so we will have an additional investment into our trails. Quite recently, we also announced, just a couple of Fridays ago, a large Trillium Fund grant for our trails in North Bay, and we’ll be seeing those trails enhanced and expanded.", "They are wonderfully friendly. When I served as mayor of the city of North Bay back in 2003, in those years, we spent a tremendous amount of time building cycling trails through our parks and through our municipality. You can cycle from one end of the city all the way down to where I live, 20 miles south of North Bay, into Corbeil. You can cycle past Corbeil and on. It’s a phenomenal opportunity. In fact, our mayor, Bill Vrebosch of Corbeil—he has been a great mayor for more than 30 years in Corbeil—really lobbied hard with the province when they were repaving Highway 94 in Corbeil, right down in front of my residence, to have cycling trails paved three or more feet wide on both sides of the highway. That was a really positive move. He said, “Look, you’re paving the highway anyway. Let’s do an estimate of the amount of asphalt that we’d need to actually put bicycle lanes on both sides of the entire extent of Highway 94.” Today, you can bicycle either way, by my place now, on a major highway. I think that’s a real improvement.", "For all of those cyclists who like to drive there and then bike, I will continue to support this wonderful bill." ],

We can get that up on YouTube as well.", "Anyway, a couple of things: The member from Parry Sound–Muskoka mentioned that this was one small step to make cycling easier. I think he was being very humble about it. Though it may be a small step, it speaks to a larger picture. The larger picture is this: We need to make cycling easier. We need to make the healthier choice in life, in every aspect of life, the easier choice.", "I went to an amazing event talking about health promotion. All the advocates, whether they were doctors or health promoters, talked about: In life, people are drawn to the easier choice. If it’s easier to take the elevator, they’ll take the elevator. But if you make a building where stairs are very easy to access and they’re front and centre and they’re beautiful, people are more likely to take the stairs. If you hide the stairs in the back corner of a building and it’s hard to find and it’s difficult to get to, people will be less likely to use the stairs. So in general, whether it’s nutrition or whether it’s activities, if you make healthier choices easier, people will make those decisions.", "With cycling, we should ensure that there’s no barrier to cycling. If people want to, for recreational purposes, take their bikes out to a certain area, to a rural community or a community with a beautiful biking trail along the river, along the lake, they should be able to do that, and we should not create barriers for them.", "The purpose of this bill is to ensure that people who travel with their bicycles are not going to be penalized for doing so. That’s an amazing initiative, an important initiative, and it speaks to that broader concept of how we can make cycling easier to do and more accessible in our city. It’s an important bill, and I support it.", "I think the story, the real-life example, was very poignant. It’s very important to provide real-life examples of people who weren’t trying to evade the law in any way. In fact, they had the transponder. I think it’s an important point to point out—that they were travelling on the 407, but they had the transponder, so they weren’t trying to avoid any tolls. But they were charged and given a highway traffic offence for something where they weren’t really trying to evade the law; they were just trying to engage in an activity that many people engage in. I think it’s absolutely important.", "When we talk about the cycling strategy, there are a number of different areas. We talk about Toronto: I also want to give a shout-out to city council for passing that amazing initiative to be able to have bicycles on Bloor. It has been the work of advocates for a number of years, and I thank the member across for mentioning that. I know that our own leader Jack Layton was one of the champions behind this as well, but there are a number of people, and we should give credit to all the people who have been tireless in their advocacy to ensure that was brought back. I know there was some concern around other areas where there were cycling lanes that were in existence and that were taken out, and now we’re wanting to see them come back. Bicycles on Bloor is an amazing initiative.", "When we look at cycling in communities where there is a greater percentage of people who are cyclists and when we look at the network of not only trails, but bike lanes, what we need to do is make sure that they connect, that they provide a grid, so you can actually get to places where you want to go in a way that’s safe, and you feel secure. We need to connect to different pathways. Bloor is an amazing connecting pathway; it criss-crosses the city in a very strategic way. But we need to make sure that the other bike lanes also intersect in a way that you can actually travel around the city and avoid some of the areas which are more difficult to ride in.", "I know I ride on roads all time, and I probably wouldn’t want people who are less experienced to get on those roads, because when you don’t have a bicycle lane, it makes you feel less comfortable and you feel a little bit intimidated with cars zipping by you. When you have that protected lane, it makes you feel more comfortable. We know, and studies show very clearly, that the more protected lanes you have, the more safe and secure the lanes are, the more people get out and bicycle. One of the major barriers to cycling for most people is that they feel that it’s something that they’re afraid to do. They feel like cycling in a city is dangerous and scary. If that’s the barrier, we need to do everything we can to get rid of that barrier. Anyway, I’m a big supporter of this.", "Another thing: I want to give a shout-out to the suburbs—because in the suburbs we have vast areas. They’re sprawling, but one of the saving graces is that if we could bring in more cycling lanes into the suburbs, we could make those cities more livable. Brampton needs more cycling, as well as the rest of Peel, as well as the rest of the entire GTA." ],

They’re actually hosting a wonderful event in Brampton on June 18 called Bike the Creek, which I look forward to participating in, as I did last year. I’m not as much of a cycler as some of my colleagues, but last year I had the opportunity to cycle with Bike the Creek for about 15 kilometres. This year, I’m hoping to do the full 40K.", "The cycling community in Brampton was very excited when we did receive funding just recently. We received maximum funding to improve infrastructure projects and to improve existing biking paths in Brampton. This is a very important project for us; it was a gap that they were going to be closing under the bridge of the 407 and the 401.", "We want to ensure that people in our biking and cycling community are safe, and we want them to have all the benefits that they can to be able to ride and enjoy and to encourage more people to cycle in our communities. It’s environmentally friendly, and it’s definitely a separate option—it’s a new and exciting option for people.", "Many municipalities from across the province submitted expressions of interest when they submitted for the infrastructure. We were able to get it. I’m also proud to say that the city of Brampton supported that by meeting it dollar for dollar so that we could have a more firm investment and continue our projects.", "I understand that this bill proposes that if a carrying rack, such as a bicycle rack, is mounted to the rear of a vehicle, that the individual should still be able to drive their vehicle on the highway, even if the rack obscures the licence plate. This is a very interesting proposal, and I understand it has support from Ontario’s cycling community.", "We know it’s important for both our front and rear licence plates to be visible for a few reasons. Firstly, it allows for law enforcement officers to be able to see. But as long as the plate is visible, we should allow this opportunity. It gives people more opportunities, and it allows them to travel with their bikes, go to different areas and have their bikes available to them.", "I’m supportive of this proposal and I look forward to it passing, so that the cycling community has even more options and the cycling community can continue to grow. I know that approximately three million people cycle once a week right now, and if we allow things like this to happen, it will only grow." ],

When you see them up in the galleries—some people had to have a little bit of help climbing the stairs; some people have scooters; some people have wheelchairs; some people have lots of friends with them.", "I just want to mention, first, Paige Zaldin and her mom, Michelle. Paige was really the spearhead for this because, about five years ago, her mom, Michelle, got a parking ticket in Vaughan for parking where you’re allowed to park in Toronto. She assumed that Vaughan, the municipality just bordering Toronto, had the same parking rules. Luckily, she didn’t have to pay the ticket, I believe, because she found some kind of error in the licence plate number or the date. Michelle is also involved with the UJA accessibility committee, which is called Itanu.", "We also have Peter Athanasopoulos from Spinal Cord Injury Ontario. He’s the senior manager of public policy and government relations.", "We have Louise Russo. A lot of you may recognize her name because she’s a bit of a hero for a lot of people, not just because she was injured in, basically, a mafia shootout, but because of her advocacy work and her braveness in the face of what she went through. She founded WAVE, Working Against Violence Everyday, which I’m sure keeps her busy with all of her advocacy work. We all appreciate everything she’s doing.", "Wendy Murphy with Spinal Cord Injury Ontario is here, as well. She’s a former reporter for Citytv.", "Lynda Staples is also with Spinal Cord Injury Ontario.", "Eddie Rice is the chairman of the Ontarians with disabilities committee of B’nai Brith.", "I’m not sure if he’s here yet: Patrick Bramm from Reena, which is for people with disabilities in the Jewish community. It’s a very well-known organization in my riding.", "Stewart Kiff: I’m just going to say my friend Stewart Kiff, who is here, because he has so many different jobs that he does. Dr. Iris Kulbatski: I went to a fantastic show of Wheel Dance, which is wheelchairs and able-bodied people who dance with them; she’s the executive director of the organization. I also want to mention quickly David Lepofsky, chair of the AODA Alliance, who sent me lots of notice but, regretfully, couldn’t be here today. He’s a lawyer and a professor at York University.", "I want to borrow a line from my colleague the member from York Simcoe. She’s going to be speaking on this as well. Basically, what she said is that accessible parking needs to be accessible. That’s what we’re speaking about here today. Right now, we have parking rules that are set by municipalities in the best interests of the people who live in those municipalities. The problem is that people have enough challenges if they’re dealing with mobility challenges of any type, whether visible or not visible, that they shouldn’t be carrying around a stack of papers dealing with the different rules for different municipalities.", "I’m not suggesting that we should order how municipalities set their parking rules; I’m just suggesting that we need to sit down—all the accessibility groups, some of which are represented here and some of which might be watching at home—and have those discussions with the municipalities on how best to streamline and, where possible, have as much the same rules; and if the rules aren’t the same, to maybe have a system of posting so that people will know, because in my opinion it shouldn’t be that the rules south of Steeles or north of Steeles are so vastly different. Hopefully, people here are agreeing.", "The other side of the coin is permits. We’re seeing with the blitz by the Toronto police that went on earlier this year that close to half of the permits seem to be either counterfeit or being used fraudulently, and the system definitely needs some tightening up. There’s a serious problem when people are trying to get somewhere and it’s not easy, I’m sure, for them to get into their vehicle or their friend’s or relative’s vehicle. It’s hard enough to get into the vehicle itself without arriving somewhere and not being able to find parking.", "These are not patients; these are not sick people. These are people who want their independence and deserve their independence, and who deserve our compassion and help, but not our pity. We used to say “disabled parking,” and I think it’s sometimes hard to make that change. But words are very powerful, and there is a lot to be said for changing some of the terminology we use every day. I wouldn’t punish somebody for saying “disabled parking” or “handicapped parking,” but we all have to put our heads around the fact that it’s not about sickness; it’s about accessibility and having everybody in the community being part of that community.", "I just want to mention the Toronto exemptions, in case people don’t know. Some of them are that if it’s not rush hour, you can park where it says “no parking.” That is not available in most other municipalities in Ontario. You don’t have to put money in the on-street meters, you don’t need on-street permits—at my sister’s house, you need an on-street permit—and there are no time limits. This is done to be fair to people, to help people and to show compassion for people who have mobility challenges. Unfortunately, other people in the community see this as an opportunity to either get away without paying or to somehow circumvent the time limits that are placed there.", "We also have a lot of challenges in terms of public awareness and education. We always talk about kids in school being made aware of what it means to have accessible parking and permits. I have a feeling that if we’re teaching kids that it’s not right to use that permit when grandma is not in the car, those kids will speak up and, at least when they’re in the car, I’m betting that their parents aren’t going to dare do it. Parents, we all know, do behave better in front of children.", "Maybe we have to get through to the kids and get them speaking and letting people know that it’s not appropriate to say something if you see somebody who parks in handicapped parking: “You don’t look like you have mobility challenges” or “I don’t see a wheelchair.” It’s not the public’s place to make those kinds of nasty comments. We hear that way too often. People can have challenges that might not be visible to us. But we can see where that’s coming from, because too many people know of fraud with accessibility permits and accessible parking, so when they see somebody they don’t know or they don’t see a wheelchair, they assume it’s fraud.", "That’s when we know we have a big problem here: If people see somebody parking in accessible parking and assume that there’s some kind of fraud going on—maybe there is, but we don’t want the public to feel that there’s some kind of scam that they should be trying to get on. We want to nip this in the bud. We want to make sure that, going forward, people are treated respectfully and those spots are for where they’re supposed to go.", "I want to just read a couple of comments that I was given by people in terms of their challenges in terms of what they face. One is from Wendy Murphy herself, who is here:", "“Confined to a wheelchair following a car accident in 1984, I have been around the disabled parking permit issue since its inception back in the early 1980s. I am saddened to see where it seems to have lost its initial purpose.", "“Easy access becomes paramount when trying to maintain independence while in a wheelchair, most importantly when going about daily routines while driving. Close access to the entrance of public buildings is what the disabled parking permit was initially designed to offer those using wheelchairs. Today, the designated parking spots have often lost their size in dimensions, and their availability. These frustrations are escalated when weather conditions are difficult, such as winter.”", "I think that that’s what we need to get through to developers and the municipalities, who are now very often giving the developers permission to not put in as many parking spots. They are seeing higher density, and maybe there’s transit going in the area, but if accessible parking is a percentage of the parking spots, then those numbers of accessible parking go down if we allow developers and redevelopment of existing infrastructure to somehow have less parking and then somehow have less accessible parking. Maybe those ratios have to be adjusted and changed along the way.", "I want to just mention quickly that the March of Dimes’ Steven Christianson sent a comment:", "“As someone living with post-polio syndrome, I need to use a car for transportation because if I overwork my muscles, the nerve damage in my legs increases.” He runs a business, and his life revolves around worrying about parking and looking for parking. That’s really disturbing, Madam Speaker. He talks about the area of Kingston, where he feels that accessible parking is being greatly diminished in his community. He is frustrated, and I certainly don’t blame him and I don’t think anybody here blames him.", "I just want to mention that I’ve been offered a challenge, and I’m rising up to the challenge. It’s called the Wheelchair Challenge and it’s taking place this year on September 18. Maybe somebody here wants to join my team; six people can be on the team.", "What they’ve done is so interesting. I think a lot of us remember when Mayor John Tory took the challenge and spent a day in a wheelchair. The feedback they got from getting a few people to do that—this is through Spinal Cord Injury Ontario—is that it was just too difficult to be in a wheelchair all day. You can certainly see why, because maybe our homes and our offices aren’t set up for us just for that day.", "So what they’ve done is that they’ve made it fun. They are having a carnival and they’re having teams. You get the idea of what it’s like to be in that wheelchair, but in a fun sort of atmosphere. It’s a fun challenge, and I’m sure there’s going to be lots of great food. They mentioned lots of great games as well.", "I’m taking the challenge, and I’m asking everybody else to join me—also our federal colleagues, the MPs, if they also want to join the challenge and create some teams. This event can build momentum and maybe also bring those kids out to educate them. I think that, a lot of times, kids think it would be fun to be in that wheelchair. If a child has an opportunity to be in a wheelchair, I think you should give them that opportunity. I don’t think that the person whose wheelchair it is feels disrespected; I think that they welcome us to take a turn in their wheelchair and see how difficult it is to manoeuvre.", "I’m looking forward to everybody’s comments, and I’m hoping that we can get this to committee to have that discussion on how to streamline and how to prevent fraud." ],

These are important conversations to be having, because in the coming up on two years I’ve been in this Legislature, we haven’t had very many conversations about accessibility. Certainly we haven’t had enough. I don’t know that we could ever have enough, because until everyone can access all parts of our province and all parts of our systems, we still have conversations to have.", "Specifically today, we’re talking about the bill put forward and it is a bill that requires the Premier to recommend to the Lieutenant Governor in Council that a commission be appointed to investigate accessible parking for persons with disabilities. Specifically, this commission would develop standard municipal bylaws and make recommendations concerning legislation to require municipalities to adopt and enforce such bylaws. The point is that the only people who should be parking in accessible spaces meant for Ontarians with disabilities are Ontarians who meet those criteria. That’s the end of it.", "We hear about people who are becoming almost like they’re policing it. They think, “Oh, that person doesn’t appear to be disabled. They’re misusing the pass.” That’s not what this is about. This is not about the misuse of the system; it’s about making sure that there are standards, because it isn’t up to me and the public to identify what someone’s challenge with accessibility is. Invisible disabilities are everywhere, and we’re never going to see them, nor should we. That’s the point. We want people to have full and fair access and be able to participate.", "I’ve had a constituent who has called our office on and off through the last couple of years and lets us know every time that there is a challenge at our GO parking lots, and some of our other public spaces where it isn’t being enforced: that there are individuals parking in accessible spaces and it would seem they shouldn’t. We do need to crack down. We know that during periodic crackdowns, specifically the Toronto police have regularly seized over 1,000 permits each year for misuse. That’s terrible.", "I appreciate the goal of this bill, and I think that it is something that’s very important to have the municipalities involved with a commission that would develop the standard bylaws so that we’re all on the same page and making things more accessible.", "While we’re talking about accessibility and taking this opportunity: In my constituency office, we had the chance to make some renovations and to open up fresh to the community. We thought, “Well, good, it’s accessible.” Then we went, “Well, hold on. What is ‘accessible,’ actually? We think it’s accessible.” We made sure we had an accessible washroom in the different parts, and then we thought, “We better bring in someone else to weigh in before this is a done deal.” I’m learning about accessibility, but I don’t have to live it on a daily basis and be aware of the different accessibility standards that seem to exist out there, if I can call them standards.", "We did have someone come in and point out the fact that our washroom needed to be large enough, not just for a wheelchair—because a wheelchair is not a standard piece of equipment for people who have mobility challenges. A four-wheeled scooter, a three-wheeled scooter: These are larger vehicles with more of a turning circle. We need to be able to get into a place and turn around and leave. These are things we need to think about.", "We have a push panel outside the door that is actually pretty cool. Technology has come a long way. It isn’t just a press panel; it’s an entire strip that can be pressed by a service animal, by any type of mobility device or certainly by a person, and it allows more people to be able to come in. In fact, I would venture to say everyone, and that’s the point. Especially when we’re talking about anything to do with our Legislature, we want full access.", "This is a chance to talk about our standards, to talk about what it could look like. I think we should also take a moment to talk about what it does look like or doesn’t look like, and back to that point of standards.", "I had the opportunity to speak to the Durham region stroke recovery group about a year ago. While I was there talking to them about post-stroke physiotherapy and specific issues, a lot of what we talked about—it came out that they couldn’t access places in our community, whether it was because there were accessible parking spaces but they were blocked; or whether it was because there wasn’t a curb, that something was marked accessible but there wasn’t a lowered curb, or there was but there was a flowerpot in the way and you couldn’t actually get into a restaurant or a building.", "There were a number of stories of restaurants and entryways—doorways that have been specifically designed for Canadian winters to keep the cold air out; the two doors never open at the same time and winter stays on the outside and fine, warm dining stays on the inside. But the truth of the matter is, it also keeps out our community members. If someone is in a chair with a family member or partner behind them, they can’t press both doors, they can’t open the doors.", "It’s just recognizing that everywhere we look, we should be thinking about who can come in and how can they access—we need to see how to bring more people into our systems.", "Thank you. I think that’s it for time. In fact, I’ve gone over. There’s so much to say, Madam Speaker." ],

I think things are much better, but I still hear about my mother and her friends and some of the challenges they have as they go about their daily lives. It’s really important, obviously, too, that we make sure that especially seniors are able to maintain their mobility, and that includes making sure there is a robust permitting system.", "I thank the member opposite for bringing forward her private member’s bill on this important issue. This is an important one. I think members on both sides of the House can agree that the misuse and abuse of accessible parking permits and parking spaces is unacceptable and reprehensible.", "I think, however, that it’s important we fully understand the implications of the proposed commission of inquiry that her bill proposes. I know, and it’s maybe my municipal councillor background—as municipal councillors, we don’t always look favourably upon things being pushed down on us from on high. I am certainly sensitive to that. I know that our municipalities have their own needs and challenges, and the Municipal Act allows them to establish the bylaws that reflect local concerns. Any reforms to the accessible parking permit program, I fear, will need to reflect this and allow the municipalities to manage and regulate their own bylaws.", "Since 2006—just a bit of history we’ve looked up here—our government has made a number of improvements to the accessible parking permit program to increase security and reduce the misuse of permits. Most recently, in January 2016, we introduced enhanced permits that are more secure and tamper-resistant. We’ve implemented new identification requirements for applicants and third-party representatives to strengthen the integrity of the program. Individuals applying for, renewing or replacing a permit are now required to produce valid ID that proves their legal name, date of birth and signature. Third parties who submit an application are required to provide a letter of authorization signed by them and the applicant or a power-of-attorney document. So some significant enhancements have occurred already.", "In addition to the these changes, our government has reduced the validity period for interim permits from six months to three months, initiated new verification measures to identify and prevent fraud, revised and improved application forms, and developed and deployed a standardized approach for reporting accessible parking permit seizures, in partnership with municipal officials.", "Ontario has the highest fines in Canada for the misuse of accessible parking permits, and to that I say, “Hear, hear.” ServiceOntario will cancel or refuse to issue a replacement permit if one has been seized for misuse. We’ll continue engaging the enforcement community and stakeholders to specifically address permit fraud and misuse in Ontario. As I said at the outset, everybody in this House will agree that the misuse of these permits is absolutely reprehensible. It’s so important that we ensure that the credibility of the program remains intact. I think that a lot of what the government has done over the past year and a half speaks to making sure that that system is, in fact, very credible and very accessible.", "Again, it has been said before: The challenge that we face is that this is a two-tier issue. We have the province, which issues the permits, but we have the municipalities, and each one of them is different, each with their own needs. It’s up to them to decide where people can park through bylaw and how things are going to be enforced. It is a bit of a challenge. I know that in the work that I do and as a former municipal councillor, not only did I hear it, but I said it all the time, “One size does not fit all across Ontario.” Any thinking that one Ontario law would take care of the issue across Ontario, I suspect, would not work because, as I said, each municipality has their own needs.", "I think I’ll leave it there, other than to say, again, I wanted to thank the member for bringing forward her bill. We all agree that the permits are very important, and the credibility of that program needs to be maintained. I’m not convinced that we need a full commission of inquiry. I think what we need to do is just steady progress, as we’ve demonstrated, over the past couple of years, that we’re enhancing the protection of those permits.", "Thank you for the opportunity to speak, Madam Chair." ],

I know Mr. Baker is also on those panels, Mr. Singh is on those panels as well, and Ms. DiNovo. It has popped up a number of times. What I’m going to say to the member is that it’s not a matter of simply fines; what you need is more Ryan Favros. You need more people like Ryan Favro.", "You may remember this story, Speaker. The headline was “Video of Woman Pitching Coffee at Man over Disabled Parking Spot at Tim Hortons Goes Viral.", "“A YouTube video of a woman angered by a man who confronted her for parking in a disabled parking spot outside a Tim Hortons in Toronto has sparked howls of online outrage.”", "This video was posted by a man named Ryan Favro; it had over 100,000 views, social-shaming this individual who parked in that spot.", "When she was confronted, by the way—I’ll read you this: Ryan politely asks her about her Jeep parked in the Tim Hortons with no pass on it, no permit. She refuses to respond, so he says, “So why do you park in a handicapped parking spot? Are you handicapped?” “No,” she says and walks away. “Well, what makes you so special that you can park in a handicapped spot?” he asks. “Pardon me, I will break your (expletive) phone,” this woman says, as she gets into the driver’s seat and slams the door. She then gets back out and hurls what appears to be iced coffee, along with profanities, at the videographer. The sad thing is, I think she only got a warning by the police after all of this was caught on video.", "But social shaming—good for Ryan Favro. I actually think we need more of this. We no doubt will have some parking enforcement officers—those things are up—but a little bit of social shaming I think also goes a long way. It takes a particularly low form of humanity to steal a parking spot from someone with a disability, doesn’t it? Because they’re too important to walk the extra steps to get into a store? Come on. Fine them, shame them. I think that will go a long way.", "In New Zealand, they also have a demerit point, which goes further; it impacts your insurance on your driver’s licence for this type of loathsome activity.", "Let me add on one more thing. There is an expression in life that I’ve become quite fond of: There’s an app for that. God bless human ingenuity and rising to an important cause. Let me tell you a little bit about some of the apps that are out there and then I’ll get to a final point. I know my colleagues want to speak as well.", "Here we go. “New App Could Let Citizens Report Illegal Parking, Get Cut of Fine.” What a novel idea. It’s probably new for some of us to contemplate, but I kind of like it. So Mr. Potts, for example, may be a crusader to make sure people with disabilities have good parking. He finds somebody else has parked in that spot. He can snap a few photos, send them up through the app, which then goes to the municipality, the enforcement agency. The person gets fined, and you would have your choice of getting a cut of that fine or donating to your local charity, up to 20%. I think it’s a fabulous idea. The app is called SpotSquad. I think it’s spotsquad.ca, but just do a little search on your app downloading device and get SpotSquad.", "How many people would be willing to snitch on their fellow citizens’ poor parking?" ],

Also, Parking Mobility allows posting of disabled spots anywhere in the city or the province or the state to make it easier for those looking for that type of parking to actually find it.", "I think at the end of the day we will move from a world of paper-based permits and writing up tickets to one where you will actually have sensors in the spots that will connect with sensors in the vehicle so that you know only somebody with a disability can use that spot.

I’m not disabled. My mom was born with spina bifida and she couldn’t walk until she was seven or eight years old. She was born in World War II, when the people of Holland starved. A lot of people were born disabled at that time. They performed experimental surgery and my mom could walk after that. She’s not an Olympic runner, but she can walk.", "So when I was a kid, I spent a lot of time looking for places to park. And this isn’t part of this debate, but I asked my mom once, “What was the toughest thing you ever faced?” And the toughest thing she ever faced was when they immigrated to Canada, they only allowed healthy people. My mom was inspected by a doctor and she had to stand for a certain length of time, and if she didn’t stand long enough, her family couldn’t come to Canada.", "So, do we have a ways to go? Yes.

She’s not out to make the big commission of inquiry that takes years and spends millions. She’s out to fix things for people, things that still happen.", "When I’m with my mom and we’re looking for a parking spot—she doesn’t drive anymore; I drive—we don’t always look for the handicapped spots, because frequently the handicapped parking spots are in the worst place to actually access the building. You’ll have the handicapped parking spot on one side of the building and you’ll have the part that doesn’t have the curb on the other side of the building. It’s crazy. It’s like, the people who pick the spots don’t look at how they actually can be used.", "As far as people misusing, yes, people misuse these spots, and sometimes—we have very public lives. Most people in my riding know me, so sometimes I will park with my mom’s sticker in the car to pick up my mom from a doctor or something, but I do it with fear because someone with an app could take a picture of me using a handicapped spot, but they’ll be long gone by the time I’m holding my mom’s arm, putting her in the car. That’s the danger of some of those things. That’s a true, true danger. I don’t lie awake at night about it, but every time I do anything with my mom and we park somewhere where I can help my mom and I’m not within picture distance of my mom, it’s a problem. I’m all for apps that do this and apps that do that, but sometimes you have to be very careful, because you’re actually going to hurt the people who are legitimately trying to help their loved ones, be they family, be they friends. That’s something we all have to be cognizant of. I feel that a lot of times.", "So we fully support this, anything that brings more people looking at this issue, more people understanding this issue. Hopefully, some other people who have watched this debate will gain some understanding of the issues these people face, the issues their families face. We’ve come so far, there’s no reason why we can’t go further, because many times a lot of the big steps have been taken, and now we have to make sure that the things we do make sense. I think that’s what this bill is looking for. That’s what the member, I believe, is looking for. I fully support it and I would like to fully thank her for bringing this issue forward." ],

  "text" : [ "I’m pleased to be able to rise this afternoon and spend a few minutes to add to the debate on Bill 187. I want, first of all, to applaud my colleague the member for Thornhill for landing on an issue that we all recognize but nobody has taken the time to understand the mechanics and the difficulties that people face.", "I just have to comment on the couple of comments that have been made about the assumption that when an able-bodied person gets out, they’re misusing the accessible parking space. You have no idea if or when the wheelchair comes out next or if the person needs physical help to get out of the car. In moving this issue forward, we have to maintain our understanding of the importance of not coming to a quick judgment.", "But there are some things that I think need to be addressed. One of them is the question of the handicapped parking rules. Not only are they complicated, but they are increasingly inconsistent across the province. We heard an earlier comment made about the municipalities putting their own rules and regulations in place but, certainly from a consumer point of view, that just adds to the complication.", "In my riding of York–Simcoe, not only are the rules different in York region and in Simcoe county, but even across the various municipalities. We not only have thousands of residents who struggle with mobility itself; they now have the extra burden of complex accessible parking rules that vary across municipal borders.", "I looked at a possible hypothetical constituent, one who lives in Georgina, works in Newmarket and sometimes travels to Toronto. He or she would have to go through three separate sets of rules and then add more if they went to Markham or Barrie. Quite simply, those people need a universal framework within which to operate.", "I can tell you that in Georgina, for instance, public places are required to provide designated accessible parking spaces. Then it drops down to the fine for this parking infraction, which is $300. But it is noted, at the same time, that certain types of parking violations are enforced on a proactive basis while others are only enforced on a complaint basis. So you’ve got difficulty with that.", "Then if you go and look in Innisfil, they have authorized signs designating a space, but no person shall park or stop a vehicle or allow a vehicle to remain parked or stopped in a parking space reserved for persons with disabilities unless the valid disabled person parking permit is openly displayed, and so forth.", "I think that’s the first thing that needs to be addressed: how to come up with adequate language similarities. I remind people that people can’t follow laws if they don’t know what they are; and if they vary from one place to another, it’s grounds for not knowing what the rules are. As was quoted earlier by my colleague from Thornhill, quite simply, the laws surrounding accessible parking, frankly, need to be accessible. At the same time, we need to crack down on accessible parking permit fraud.", "So there’s much for a group to do. I applaud the member for taking on this initiative. It’s certainly an opportunity for people to look at. It’s something that makes the lives of people much easier and better, if we look at this problem." ],

  "text" : [ "First of all, before I make some comments on the bill that is in front of us today, let me welcome and say hello, on behalf of the House here, to a constituent of mine, Louise Russo. I’m sure she does not need any introduction to this House. With Louise Russo, we also have a couple of members from the Ontarians with Disabilities Sub-Committee, which is from the League for Human Rights of B’nai Brith Canada, Edward Rice, up in the, what do you call it, the Speaker’s gallery up there—Speaker, that’s your gallery—and a couple of other guests who are here to assist in the debate that is taking place today. I want to congratulate the member from Thornhill for bringing this to the attention of the House.", "I have to say that I go back now to sometime in November last year when I started to deal with this particular issue as the minister, if you will. It was subsequent to a meeting which I had with Ms. Russo and others in the community, which was exactly pegged to these same issues. There are many reasons why I would like to say that something is being done about solving this particular problem. But if there is one, it’s to get me out of trouble, if you will: Every time I see someone parking in a handicapped space and then running into the store, trying to say, “Oh, I’m going to buy cigarettes and then come out quickly,” I stop there and I look at the person there, and then I get stared back at. I’ve gotten into an argument a couple of times. I want to avoid that situation where our nature takes over and says, “Ah, it’s okay. There’s nobody parking in here. I’m going to park in the handicapped parking spaces.” I say, “Why are you doing that?” Then I get a very dirty look.", "I’ll stop right there. I don’t want to go any further, but I believe this is something that needs to be looked at. I really don’t know that we need a very particular inquiry to get to the stage that we want to go to, but we know the problem. I know the difficulty that may exist with doing it uniformly throughout the province. There are municipalities that may want to look at the situation in their own way, in a different way, and that would be okay as long as they look at it.", "I speak mainly for the city of Toronto. There’s a little town called Toronto here, and I have to say that the abuses continue to escalate because of a lack of, if you will, people that go around, check it out and issue tickets and what have you. We don’t have the parking officers required. The whole city of Toronto has six, so you can imagine me calling from Finch and Islington, reporting it, and someone down at the Beach will have to come up and take a look at the parking space that I’m reporting at Finch and Islington. It’s impossible.", "I think, number one, we have to educate the public. The only way to do that is to involve some stricter rules and regulations and penalties as well. Otherwise, they won’t get the message.", "I can see that my time is going too fast even though I was not even allowed to say something, but I figure, if I can, I will. I’m getting the nod to say, “Cut it.” But I’m going to take all the time, and if I have an extension I’m going to say even more about it, because it’s something that we have to demonstrate to our people in need, people like Louise Russo and company there. We need to do something.", "You know what? It’s not only for them. It’s for the family members as well, because the family members will see and say, “I want to congratulate Gila Martow for bringing this to the floor of the House. I want to congratulate the members of the House for supporting it and doing something about it, because it’s an abuse.” When there is an abuse, that abuse needs to be looked after. If we have to lower the hammer a little bit heavier to do away with those abusers, send a message, educate them—if it’s through imposing major fines, then I would say, “So be it.” Because do you know what? It’s not only abuse. I think it’s the way we issue those permits as well. I think it requires a good overlook, if you will, of the way we issue those permits. It’s not fair.", "In my case, when I see wonderful people that can get off their truck and run, or very nice, expensive cars, and walk very gingerly, and I’m saying, “Why are they displaying a permit?”—and I know what the member on the other side has said. The mother, of course—he has the right to take the mother—whatever. But—" ],

I think that there has been previous discussion about this piece of legislation. There is a concern in our discussions that some of the legislation is incomplete, and we look forward to further amendments that can be made.", "It does include limits and guideline regulations that ensure certain fees and penalties are applied to stop obsessive overuse that traps those individuals finding themselves caught in the continual cycle known as the “debt trap.”", "This reminds me of the kind of no-win situation that was the case for people back in the 18th century. There were frequently debts created by gambling, but the person would be unable to pay their debt, and so then they would find themselves in debtors’ prison. In the situation of being unable to be in any gainful employment, obviously you would never get out of debtors’ prison. That’s the version a couple of hundred years ago, where people were locked away with no hope of being able to pay off their debts.", "The debt trap that we are talking about in this bill is obviously the limitation on what has prompted people to seek the payday loan. What happens there, then, is that if it is a stopgap and a way to be able to keep the roof over the head for the month, then it works, it happens, but it obviously creates that trap. There are many reasons for that, some of which I will make reference to in the few moment that I have.", "There are certainly a growing number of Ontarians who find themselves unable to meet their bills and meet those payments that are required, so they take that step into borrowing through the payday loan system. The danger is, of course, that what drove them to need it in the beginning now becomes a cyclic thing. Now the next time they need to meet payment schedules, they find themselves in that situation.", "Certainly, as an MPP, I see the effects of higher and higher costs—like the hydro costs, just to name one, but also increases in the cost of living and food and rent and gas and things like that. These things combine and obviously make it more difficult for people to pay the fuel bills, the gas, the hydro, food and things like that.", "There’s now a problem that people are having to make tough decisions. Sometimes these decisions include making a choice as to which bills get paid on time and how to make ends meet. Not all of us are fortunate enough to have the luxury of walking into a bank or calling up a family member for a short-term loan. Some individuals are forced to face these rising costs and bills alone. Certainly we hear from those people in our ridings. That’s one avenue of the problem.", "Another area that the bill alludes to is of course the need for a much better financial literacy level amongst the population as a whole, so that people would see the payday loan system as something that wasn’t designed for that purpose; it was designed for the need to be able to cash a cheque when sometimes banks take 10 or 12 days to process a cheque. The limits of financial literacy that too many of our citizens suffer from mean that they see this as a quick opportunity to do some financial management.", "I know in my riding I’ve had businesses tell me that they are trying to make contractual arrangements with people who have declared bankruptcy and who have no idea of the impact that that “bankrupt” cloud has over them for a few years, so that they can’t just walk into a car dealer and choose the car they want and assume there will be credit available for them.", "The financial world has become much more complicated than it was years ago. Even the banks I’ve mentioned have time frames that they have to follow, and I think that it’s important to understand that while we’re talking about the payday loans and things like that, we put the banks in the context of their historical role.", "Throughout history, we see the evolution of banking and its services, and the different products it offers now. Since the mid-1970s, we’ve seen the growth of a middle class, to now allow families enough money to begin thinking about personal finance, rather than making it to payday. I think that’s a very important goal.", "Banks were originally used as a safe haven to protect you through your travels. Now we’ve seen the advent of convenience banking, from online accounts to debit and credit cards. These systems have evolved to often become taken for granted, as it isn’t obvious to the consumer the extensive cost and security devoted to these systems. It is for these reasons we see the requirements of minimum balances and high fees.", "I think that I’ve got to circle back to this lack of understanding—the importance of people recognizing things like interest rates and how a store can advertise a level of interest rate, and how an interest rate can be misinterpreted: Is it annual or is it more frequently, than that? There are so many demands that people need to make. At the same time, advertising makes it look like it’s painless and easy. It’s the never-never plan. There seems to be a wide gulf in the way that people understand this. I know, for instance, of families that operate on the basis—their financial operation is, “Which bill will we pay this month?” So there’s a permanent state of indebtedness and a permanent state of not being able to get out of that.", "Payday loans are typically short-term loans of less than $500 that are repaid in a lump sum and made in exchange for a postdated cheque or pre-authorized debit. It’s difficult to have exact figures on this, but it is estimated that approximately 3% of Ontarians took out a payday loan in the last 12 months. They’re generally catered to individuals who are unable to access traditional sources of credit.", "Now, the government, aside from this piece of legislation, has set up a group of people to examine this process. This is not public at this time. It obviously limits the opportunity for a more fulsome discussion—if we had that information from the government at this time.", "Obviously, there is a great deal of learning to be done, of understanding by the general public—and not be drawn into the easy advertising that suggests you can make a deal anytime, anywhere." ],

A lot of our younger people don’t understand it. To compound that, what she also talked about is how society in general is pushing people to borrow.", "She mentioned advertising. When they advertise—they went to bi-weekly car payments to make them look smaller, and then weekly car payments, and there are certain cars you can buy for a coffee and a doughnut per day. It’s no secret what these people are trying to do: They’re trying to make things look attainable when maybe they really shouldn’t be. I don’t think it’s the real issue behind the payday loan problem, but it’s the same issue as, “Buy furniture now and pay 18 months later.” Well, for a lot of people, the couch is half worn out; you don’t feel like paying for it 18 months later. But you can have it now. We’re in a “you can have it now” society. I think that’s what the member was focusing on. It is a big issue where we have to make sure our younger generations know that at the end of the day, you have to pay your bills. If you don’t pay your bills, then bad things happen, and a lot of people don’t appreciate that. Close people in my family had to learn the hard way.

We seem to have moved into a world that is very consumerist-oriented and in need of immediate satisfaction of whatever we want. But for a significant number of people, it’s not a “buy now.” They definitely need the services that these institutions offer them. I’m so glad to see that Bill 156 will address a number of key ones.", "Let me, if I may, Mr. Speaker, just touch on a few of the important things that the bill will address, from a consumer’s perspective. Those consumers who have a debt in collections will benefit from the new debt collection rules that apply more broadly, including applying them to debt purchases. Consumers cashing government cheques at alternative financial service providers would have more information and may benefit from a cap on the rate of cheque-cashing services. I’ve heard this quite frequently across Ontario, that sometimes those people, those vulnerable people, who receive a government cheque are unable to open up a bank account and cash it. They rely on these institutions which charge them too much. That should come to an end. Consumers using rent-to-own services should be better treated; instalment loans, payday loans and those who borrow repeatedly should enjoy better coverage." ],

What I was able to share—I’ve got feedback in my riding that there is more and more people needing these types of services, and a lot of that is because the cost of living for a lot of people is getting that much more expensive. People between paycheques are having a hard time. It’s being able to access—again, people new to our province sometimes haven’t got that established line of credit built yet or approved, so they need it.

My colleague from York–Simcoe did a great job as well of bringing some valid points, and a number of my other colleagues are going to bring more of those.", "I think what I really want to leave the audience that’s listening and watching at home with is the reality, again, that these types of services, sadly, are becoming more needed. We’re hearing that there’s an increase in food banks. A lot of people are having to make choices in how they actually pay their bills. There’s not an abundance for a lot of people in the bank at the end of the day, and they need to have short-term access to be able to do these types of things. We all, sadly, run into occasions where we are struggling, where we don’t have the ability to have all the cash in the bank, so we have to make arrangements to be able to have short-term access to be able to pay our bills. To pay our food bill versus our hydro bill is one of the things we certainly hear in this Legislature on an almost daily basis; the people who are struggling, particularly those in need, trying to understand how they pay their bills. I think this is a valid service, and we have to be very cautious, going forward, to make sure that these types of services are accessible for those in need." ],

And 550% interest is what payday lenders are actually charging. To make one thing perfectly clear, $21 per $100 is not 21% interest. That is over a two-week period. If you annualize that, it’s in the mid-500s. That is the interest rate they’re charging.", "There used to be a usury law in Canada that capped interest rates at 60%. Again, I think that if anybody offered you 60%, you should run screaming from that bank or that credit card company. But people don’t get it; they don’t see what’s happening. These are the very institutions that prey upon those who are desperate because, quite frankly, the only people who would borrow any amount of money at 550% interest are the same people who used to go to Vinnie down at the bar, who broke your legs if you didn’t pay him back. I know that some of my distant relatives in the past had that experience.", "Here we have a legalized form of the same thing. Instead of Vinnie down at the bar who would break your legs if you didn’t pay him back, you have somebody across the street from your house—by the way, probably across the street from your house if you’re in the one of the poorer neighbourhoods—and they’ll charge you 550% interest." ],

We had a wonderful luncheon here, for those who partook of it, and celebrated Tibetan culture and their struggle for freedom in their homeland as well. I just wanted to put that out there.", "Now, to get to the government bill, which really is a set of promises for further consultation, let’s look at a little bit of the history of payday lending in this province. As I was saying in my comments about the member from York–Simcoe’s comments, this started as a federal criminal law: Any interest charged over 60% was considered usurious; that was the law. The Harper government, in their wisdom, downloaded the responsibility for taking care of usurious interest rates to the province. After I was first elected back in 2006, it was the Wild West for a while here in Ontario, and people were charging anything and everything. Payday lenders sprang up like mushrooms in the poorest districts across our city, preying on the poorest people, and interest rates were hovering around 800% to 1,000%. It was at that time that I tabled a bill modeled on the Quebec bill—which is law in Quebec—to cap interest rates at 35%.", "Now, even at 35%—I think many in this House have mortgages. Knowing that the mortgage interest rates are hovering between 2% and 4% for most people—I mean, think about it. There’s a big gap between 35% and even the highest interest rates charged by credit card companies, which are in themselves, arguably, out of line, in the high 20% to 30% range. But 35% is the law in Quebec. At 35%, with that law in Quebec, there are no payday lenders. They don’t have the blight we have here in Ontario. They have no payday lenders.", "Now, it gets complicated because since I tabled that bill with the huge support of the Toronto Star, which ran an editorial supporting my bill, and ACORN, a phenomenal group—by the way, anybody from ACORN listening, kudos to you for taking this on. They have made this one of their seminal issues. Since tabling that bill, guess what’s happened? The world of commerce being what it is, even in Quebec, the whole move to payday lending has moved online. So now, even though they have capped interest rates at 35% in the province of Quebec, that doesn’t stop somebody from going online, getting rollover and back-to-back loans at, again, 550% or more in real dollars and cents.", "Part of the problem with payday lenders is that they know their audience. They pretend that their audience is just people like we are: middle-class people in Ontario. That’s not who is taking out payday loans, I’m afraid to say, as somebody who stood in a demonstration outside with them back when my bill was live. The people who are walking in and out of payday lenders are those who earn the least, those who are the most marginalized, those who are the most vulnerable, those who are too desperate because they have to feed their children or they have to pay their rent. It doesn’t matter what the small print says. It doesn’t matter that we now—since my bill and since the pressure on the government in 2009, they limited to $21. Again, limited to only 550% interest, not 800% to 1,000%, and they also put in the real interest rates and information. But people who are desperate don’t read that information.", "Concurrently with the payday lending movement, what also was happening was the recognition that people who cannot get credit—who have a bad credit history or who can’t get a loan or an overdraft at their bank anymore—may need to borrow. But they don’t need to be put further in debt by payday lenders; they may need something called a microloan. Microloans are what people who live on low incomes occasionally need. ACORN and other anti-poverty groups recognize that.", "Actually, to their credit, some banks stepped up. I remember doing a whole long investigation with one of our banks that set up an outlet where they didn’t ask for the normal ID and where they did extend what could really be called microloans. Guess what happened? That outlet closed and guess what it is now? A pawn shop on Queen Street in my riding, next door to a payday lender. The banks not only didn’t follow through on that, but guess what? The banks also are now invested in payday lending because they know where profit is and where profit is to be made. How could you not make a profit at 550% interest?", "So what do we need? What we need is not in this bill. This is a consultation document. What we need is political will around this issue. What we need is a government with a backbone, that’s really, really willing to do something for those who are marginalized. I can tell you, there isn’t a financial planner in the world—not in the world—who will advise their client to go to a payday lender or not advise their client to get out of payday loans as quickly as they can. That is sound financial advice. There is no other sound financial advice when it comes to payday lenders, any more than there would be sound financial advice about Vinnie down at the bar who would break your knees if you went to him, and he’s a loan shark. No financial adviser is going to advise you to go to a payday lender. Clearly they’re a blight on our neighbourhoods. There are moves at city council to make sure there are not too many of them all clustered around the poorest of the poor. In fact, they’ve set up in my neighbourhood, right across from drop-in centres, where people on social assistance go to get meals. They know their target, and it’s merciless; absolutely merciless.", "So what do we need? First of all, what we need is to say, like Quebec did, that anything over 35% is usurious. Please—come on. That, we could do; that’s what we should do. It’s not enough anymore. Now we need to look at online lending. I have to tell you, there are jurisdictions around the world that are way, way ahead of us on this, Madam Speaker. There are jurisdictions, like in Florida and in fact in most of the states now, where you have real data—which the payday lending institutions are fighting against—real data tracked online, so if you go online and you try to do rollover loans, you try to borrow from here and then borrow from there and, of course, dig yourself deeper and deeper into debt in a way that you will never, ever get out—if you are to do that, we can track you and we can legislate around it. That software exists; that ability exists. Many of the states are doing it. We should be doing it here too.", "A two-pronged event: Stop usurious interest charges. Please, don’t tell me they can’t make money at 35% interest. Really? So stop that. Number two: Look at the online aspect of payday lending and at least be able to regulate that, as many south of the border do.", "This is what needs to be done. It’s not rocket science. It has been asked for for almost a decade by those who are in anti-poverty groups, such as great organizations like ACORN. But there’s no political will here to do it. We could talk about who gives money to which party, Madam Speaker, in terms of why there isn’t the political will to really get at this issue, but I won’t go there. I don’t even need to go there. I just need to talk about ethics, morals. In what world is it ethically or morally right for someone who is one of the most marginalized persons—because, you remember, they’re the only people who go in there. Nobody who could borrow money on their credit card or borrow money on a credit line or do an overdraft—none of those people would go to a payday lender if they knew one iota about them. What they prey upon is those who are so desperate they have nowhere else to turn. Those are who they’re preying on. They’re charging them 550% interest. Tell me in what world that’s ethical, in what world that’s not usurious, in what world that shouldn’t be criminal. It was criminal in this country.", "This government doesn’t think it’s criminal. This government thinks it’s okay: “We’ll just tweak around the edges a little bit. Five hundred and fifty per cent interest? Go for it, and build more payday lenders everywhere in our neighbourhoods.”", "I can tell you, that’s not what the people of Parkdale–High Park think. That’s not what the people I speak to in Ontario think. That’s not what any of the anti-poverty groups thinks. If this government was serious about anti-poverty, they would be looking at this issue too. So what do we do? Criminalize them, Madam Speaker: That’s what we should do." ],

We’ve talked about that, driving through a neighbourhood with homes where you think that those who are living in them probably have an easier time of it, perhaps, than in other neighbourhoods. But we realize that people are struggling so much under the weight of daily life and the cost of living that many are house-poor, many are turning to our food banks and many are turning to alternative financial services, which I think is a really pretty euphemism for loan sharks. But they’re turning to payday loans, as well.", "Historically, we’ve seen these lending agencies and loan sharks pop up in areas where they are targeting those who are disadvantaged, those who are struggling more obviously.

You thought of a great idea; the problem is, once you think of it, somebody already invented it. You’ve got to move fast. It’s called Borrowell. In fact, our consumer technology caucus, which I co-chair with the member for Waterloo and the member for Cambridge, had Borrowell come in to talk to us about some of the new opportunities from technology. Borrowell is basically an online lending service that gives you a low-interest loan online. You do allow them to check your credit, obviously, but because they don’t operate infrastructure and buildings, their costs are lower, and they have an algorithm to calculate the loan.", "I actually applied for one to see what it was like, and within minutes of me saying, “Yes, you can look at my credit history,” I was offered s loan at a low rate. I was a little worried they wouldn’t give it to me, but they did. I didn’t fulfill the deal; I was testing it out. But that’s filling in the gap. I know that some credit unions, as well, are looking at the easy microloans at a lower interest rate. I’ll talk about this in more detail later in debate, hopefully.", "I know the assumption of many is that anybody who goes to get credit from a payday loan institution needs to be protected by government, or they’re stupid and they’re not making the right decision, but I’ll argue the opposite: The vast majority are making rational decisions. The problem is, if you walk into your bank and say, “I need a $200 loan for a week,” they won’t even talk to you, most of them, or they’ll make you fill out all kinds of paperwork and come in next week. So they’ve filled a bit of a niche.", "I agree, we need to have strong consumer protection standards and we have to have transparency in decision-making, but let’s not automatically assume that we should close all these places down. Yes, there will be new technology solutions with this. I think the credit unions, like First Credit, are getting into this neighbourhood as well. But let’s be very careful not to shut down what is a legitimate choice by a lot of rational, thinking individuals." ],

  "text" : [ "Thank you again, Madam Speaker, for bringing the members in to hear the debate this afternoon. I think this is an important debate on Bill 156, an Act to amend various Acts with respect to financial services.", "It was introduced in the Legislature before Christmas. On December 9, it received first reading, and it stands in the name of the Minister of Government and Consumer Services. Of course, the government has led off the debate with a number of lengthy speeches explaining the rationale and the purpose for this bill. We’re told this bill is all about proposing changes to payday loans and debt collection—introducing legislation to strengthen consumer financial protection. That’s what the government is telling us the bill is all about.", "It’s intended, according to the government, to increase protections for consumers who find it necessary to use what they call high-cost alternative financial services, which we commonly speak of as payday loans, instalment loans, rent-to-own services and cheque-cashing services, and to better protect Ontarians with respect to these debts that might be necessary to collect back.", "If passed, the Alternative Financial Services Statute Law Amendment Act, the government tells us, would make amendments to the Payday Loans Act, the Consumer Protection Act and the Collection and Debt Settlement Services Act, increasing protection for consumers in several new ways, the government claims. They’re suggesting that consumers cashing cheques at alternative financial service providers would have more information made available to them and would benefit from a cap on the rate of cheque-cashing services. The government is saying that people would have more information about the transactions that they’re entering into voluntarily and that there would be a cap on the rate of cheque-cashing services so it wouldn’t exceed a maximum amount.", "The government says that consumers using rent-to-own services would benefit from a grace period for repayment, so people who enter into these contracts, I assume, would have a grace period before they have to resume paying back their obligation. Consumers using instalment loans would be certain that the cost of optimal insurance would not be excessive. Again, I think that commitment or statement by the government is subject to questions. How do we define “excessive”? That’s certainly a subjective expression, I’m sure. To some people, “excessive” might mean something very different than other people might conclude.", "Consumers who are repeat payday loan borrowers would have the option of a longer repayment period under this Bill 156, the government tells us. Consumers with overdue debts would apparently benefit from expanded rules against unfair collection practices from businesses that purchase and collect overdue debts.", "Now, all of us would hope and expect that the government would introduce legislation to ensure that consumers have adequate protection with respect to payday loans and other alternative financial services, and it remains to be seen if indeed this bill is fully in the public interest. We expect and anticipate that as this debate concludes, the bill may very well, because the government has a majority, pass into law. We would anticipate and expect that it would be referred to a standing committee, hopefully for an opportunity for public hearing so that people who have an interest in this issue, as well as the organizations that are involved, would be able to come to a standing committee and express their views, ideas and concerns, perhaps, leading to amendments that hopefully would strengthen the bill and improve it, and ensure that it is in the public interest.", "Now, the government tells us that they’ve already consulted approximately, I believe, a thousand people, I saw in one of the documents here. I would say admittedly, if indeed that’s true, that’s fairly extensive consultation. But I think, still, when the bill—any piece of legislation—is introduced, often there’s greater awareness that the government is moving forward with a serious proposal and, in many cases, it leads to additional interest from the general public. When we advertise about a bill for a standing committee, it usually leads to considerable interest from groups and individuals and, of course as we know, they participate in public hearings, if indeed those are offered by the government.", "Again, this bill was introduced, and apparently the government says they’re continuing to seek more public input on this issue, broadly speaking. There is a news release that was sent out just last month, April 20, where the government claims to be seeking more public input on how much borrowers should pay for a payday loan in the province. I would suggest that the government continue to consult on this important issue, to ensure that the end result is positive and in the best interests of the people of the province.", "Our party’s critic, the member for Stormont–Dundas–South Glengarry, gave a one-hour leadoff speech on behalf of our caucus. He made some very important points. I had the opportunity to be here because I was in the chair that afternoon. It was a good speech, and I think it highlighted a number of the concerns that he has heard in his consultations as our party’s credit critic and also from people across the province.", "I know our caucus has a number of suggestions and concerns with respect to this bill. We believe that payday lending should be a last resort for consumers who have bad credit or no credit and who experience an unexpected expense or an unexpected drop in income. Not everyone would partake of the availability of payday loans. People who have a bank account, who perhaps have a line of credit account with a credit union or a bank, in most cases, I would suggest, probably are not customers or clients of companies that do payday loans—in all likelihood. But there is a segment of our population that do use these alternative financial services and, from time to time, do need them.", "We believe this approach should not be meant as a regular source of funding. We want to ensure, though, that Ontarians who need these services continue to have access to them, including the cashing of cheques. We believe that not every recipient of a government cheque necessarily has a bank account and would need to have a means of being able to cash that government cheque if they don’t have a bank account, so these payday loans organizations provide that means.", "The payday lending industry, I’m told, strives to work with the government in order to create a set of consistent and fair rules that protect consumers and allow the industry to survive. I would hope that the industry is prepared to work with government, to work together to establish a regulatory climate that is fair to all and ensures that the public interest is served.", "Our party says that this bill, though, expands the reach of the government from rule-setting to micromanaging the industry in some respects. Certainly we would want to call attention to that issue. I’m sure there’s going to be further discussion of that issue at the standing committee and, hopefully, there may be some opportunity for amendments to respond to that concern.", "People who have only recently arrived in Canada or who have experienced negative credit events, such as bankruptcy, missed payments or a consumer proposal, might find it difficult to access extra funds, if needed. We would say that this government should be dedicating more energy to appropriate credit and financial literacy amongst the general consumer population rather than micromanaging the sector, hoping that that will solve the problem. I would agree with that, Madam Speaker. I think there is a great need for opportunities for some Ontarians to enhance their financial literacy and have a greater understanding of the implications of some of their financial decisions.", "But at the same time, we see a provincial government that has allowed the provincial debt to more than double during its tenure in office, going back to 2003. I believe the provincial debt now stands at $308 billion. The interest cost on that debt on an annual basis is now the third-highest provincial government expenditure, only behind health and education. We are the largest subnational debtor in the world. If we see a provincial government that is spending beyond its means, borrowing the difference, year after year after year, doubling the provincial debt, it’s not surprising that there are some Ontario residents who are struggling day to day to live within their means, month to month and, in some cases, in need of these payday loans.", "Earlier this year, I worked with my riding office staff to develop a petition on hydro rates. I want to put that on the record just at the end of my remarks, of course. Because, as of May 1, we experienced yet another hydro rate increase. We have to be concerned about that because it’s costing hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs, or at least contributing to the loss of those jobs. At the same time, many consumers are struggling to pay their hydro bills. There are a lot of concerns about the cost of living, and this is one of them. I would encourage the government to consider that concern as well in the context of the debate on Bill 156." ],

But they don’t have a choice because, quite frankly, they can’t get a loan from the bank and they might not have the credit history, and that is a huge problem. We have to be very cognizant that they are a lender of last resort. We have to make sure that the trick to helping is to make sure that people don’t have to go to a lender of last resort. They’re popping up to fill a void. It’s a void that we have to look beyond and see how we can fix the problems behind that, so they’re not forced to go to a lender of last resort." ],

All over the place, they’re popping up. They have been there for the last decade or so. That’s the reality, I think, of Toronto and the reality of Ontario and the reality in my riding. There are two solitudes: There are people who are doing very well and they can’t believe house prices—the average detached house is now going for $1 million—and, meanwhile, there are people who can’t really find enough money to pay for their food. That’s why these payday loans have sort of popped up.", "I think that the key is to try and get our banks and financial institutions to be more friendly to ordinary working people and not just to be catering to people with a lot of money, so they won’t have to use these payday loans because it is expensive for them but they don’t have any other choice. It would be wonderful to see that our banks made it reasonable for people to come and use the bank. But no; it is very difficult. And God help you if you get stuck in one of these credit rating agency circles where people of all different levels of education can never find out what these credit rating agencies really do and how they rate you. You can imagine a poor working person who maybe doesn’t speak English trying to deal with a credit rating agency.

Anyway, it was amazing what this individual had to tell me about how a lot of people who have good, well-paying jobs were coming. It’s not just, as I laid out that day and as I feel, that it was people who were down and out and, as some of the members have said, are up against it, who are their best customers. I made some comments about the festive season, so I won’t repeat those again. They might have been a little over the top. It was getting late in the day when I said it.", "My biggest concern is when this individual gave me an outline of what they charge—I think it was $21 on $100 to cash a cheque—and I said, “Why would anybody do that?” I did a little more digging, and it turns out it’s some people who maybe have obligations to, say, FRO—to spouses. Eventually they have to pay, but there are obligations to people they owe money to, so they’re trying to circumvent for a while, because I don’t think it happens forever.

It’s really kind of disturbing, to say the least. Why do people use payday loans? It’s because they’re at their lowest point financially and they’re forced to go to these payday loan places and pay even more and be taken advantage of again financially. It really is disturbing that as a society we funnel people who live in poverty to payday loans that take advantage of them all over again financially. How does that make any sense?

He mentioned cheque cashing.", "I commend him for the leadership he has shown in his riding, trying to bring people together. We, as legislators, sometimes don’t fully appreciate the authority we have, by virtue of our election. But one of our greatest powers, actually, is the power to convene, to bring people together, to get them discussing an issue and get them talking about solutions. That’s exactly the kind leadership that the member for Sarnia–Lambton is showing on this issue. He obviously demonstrates his concern for the low-income people of his riding, as well as those who, perhaps for other reasons, struggle to make ends meet from month to month because of other challenges. The fact is that we can all take a lesson from that and see what we can do, working with the local financial institutions in our ridings.", "I would hope that the large financial institutions—the chartered banks, the credit unions—are monitoring this debate as well. I think this represents a challenge to them, too, and perhaps an opportunity as well. They need to do what they can to ensure that all Ontarians have access to the kinds of financial services that many of us take for granted.", "Again, this discussion continues, and I look forward to debate from other members this afternoon and as the bill continues through the legislative process." ],

Perhaps the reasons that people—many of the reasons are the same, but some are perhaps different than here.", "Many of the people I know who have to go to these lenders of last resort aren’t necessarily in the lowest income bracket. They’re not middle class, but they’re gainfully employed. They budget, they’re conscious of their financial position, but they are subject to huge fluctuations.", "In northern Ontario, when the price of gas goes up—it’s already high, and it goes up by 10 or 15 cents. People in other parts of the province say, “Why do these people drive cars? Why don’t they take the bus to work?” Well, there is no bus. “Why don’t they take the train to work?” There is no train. They have no other choice but to drive a car. So they are very much impacted by fluctuations in the price of gas.", "It would be something like in this area. I live here six months a year while the Legislature is running. No one is going to dispute that people in this area have challenges; no one is going to dispute that. Can you imagine the challenges that people here would face if the price of public transit went up and down 25% on a two-weekly basis. Can you imagine how upset people here would be?

But there are people who can’t pay the heating bill, depending on how cold the weather is, through no fault of their own at all. I think that would be a big step. I really hope the chartered banks are listening, and the credit unions are listening. Some of them are taking initial steps, and I hope they take more steps.", "The payday loan sector is there.

It’s still a huge burden. For people who live close to Toronto, it’s a hop, skip and a jump in relation to the rest of the province. There are parts of the province that are much farther away than where I live. Again, if you have a medical emergency in your family—in the private members’ bills we talked about medical conditions. Well, those medical conditions could drive people so that they need an immediate infusion of cash, which they might not get anywhere else but a payday loan. If you’re facing something like that, do you know what?

I, for many years, questioned the need for these facilities as well, but in doing my own research and talking to organizations across Ontario who deal with vulnerable consumers, what they were so worried about was that, with the growth of online lending, which crosses jurisdictional boundaries, we can have people lending money to vulnerable consumers in Ontario who aren’t even based in Canada, for example, and we can’t control that. They were worried about driving business to loan sharks who do not provide a level of service that many of these places do, to put it lightly. Those were just a couple of their concerns around the outright banning of these types of facilities.", "I can tell you what a couple of organizations said, because they speak to what I believe, but I’d rather have their quotes say it. The United Way said, “While we believe that many of these services”—these are the payday lenders and alternative financial services—“may be causing harm to individuals, families and even to communities, until there are viable alternatives, for example, through the traditional banking and credit union sector, our communities tell us that they offer a necessary lifeline to many people who have no other options.”", "I heard that time and again across Ontario.

That seems to be a theme. Every time we have the opportunity to hear about what it’s like living up north, we learn that there are fewer options up there. When we’re talking about the cost of gas or access to health care, transit, the cost of living, hydro—and maybe the cost of electricity isn’t more up north, but they use it for different things. When we talk about agricultural industries, there’s far more—it does cost more, but they use it for more.", "When you add all of that together and you look at just how hard-pressed our northern communities, our rural communities are to make ends meet, I don’t know how they remain hopeful in a Liberal province.

It has been announced that the price of gas is going to go up five-point-something cents as part of the climate change initiative. It’s a problem, but people in Ontario want to pay their part. But again, people in the north should also be part of the offset. When the government announced $100 million for climatic retrofits to make your house more efficient, and it was done through Union Gas and Enbridge, I spoke in this House to say, “That takes out a lot of people who use propane.” I was challenged by the President of the Treasury Board that, “No, no, everyone is accessible.” I talked to the people who sell propane and oil in my riding, and no. So far, they don’t have any access. Do you know how big a difference it would make for the climate, for carbon, if we could take oil furnaces out of people’s houses and change them to propane?

It is an act that amends the Consumer Protection Act, the Collection and Debt Settlement Services Act and Payday Loans Act.", "We held a very interesting meeting in our caucus boardroom with some of the investors and owners of payday loan establishments. It is unfortunate when you hear that people have to get a loan of any kind for a family emergency, whether it’s at a bank or whether it’s from a payday loan agency or from a credit union. The key difference is that, most often, banks and trust companies are dealing with people who are getting loans based on equity and using that for collateral. They’re getting loans—it’s almost like an investment when they get those loans, because they’re using their equity—maybe the equity from their home or property that they own—to get some cash flow so that sometimes they can do improvements, which can be an investment, or invest in a business.", "This is a big stretch from that. This is the opposite end of the spectrum. People who have to avail themselves of payday loan establishments are people who don’t have equity to take to a bank. They don’t have a rainy day fund, and they are stressed. I think that we have to look at the broad picture and realize how this type of stress that people are living under day to day, wondering, when they open each bill—they’re afraid to open their bills. They avoid opening their bills, which sometimes makes it even worse because then there are interest payments or reactivation fees. They’re living under such incredible stress that it makes people turn to abuse of alcohol or drugs; it can make people violent; it can affect their children and other family members; it can affect their job performance at work; and it can affect their health as well.", "It is very important for us to make sure that people are able to access what I call microloans. That’s what these are. These are microloans. They’re small loans that are only meant to be for two weeks. They’re meant for family or personal emergencies.", "As we are hearing from some of the members from rural ridings, people rely on their cars in those rural ridings. They have no other choice. You cannot walk to a store to buy a few groceries for your children if you are in those kinds of communities. So if their car has an unexpected flat tire, a lot of times you can imagine how stressful that is. They are well aware that some construction project is going on near them and when they get a nail in their tire they probably, rightly so, blame that construction project for their bad luck and now, all of a sudden, they need to get two tires for their vehicle.", "We want people to be able to have that financial literacy, I would call it, and to understand how important it is to save in good times so that hopefully you don’t need to rely on some kind of microloan or a payday loan situation.", "We can’t talk the talk unless we walk the walk.

I wish I could laugh and say it was funny that we are hearing from members in the Legislature and members in our communities who somehow look down on people who borrow to make ends meet. We’re doing the exact same thing.", "I’m not blaming just this government. Other governments across Canada, across the world—municipalities are in debt. I’m in York region and I think the debt now has passed over $3 billion. Maybe the member from Newmarket–Aurora can vouch for me. The York region administration is in debt. Many of the cities in York region are in debt. That means that the individuals in those cities are in debt and living in a really scary situation, for people who sit down and think of it. Unfortunately, most people don’t take the time to think of it. Collectively, as a society, we all owe on those debts.", "I remember during my last campaign a very clever guy—I can still picture him. He said he was in a rented house. He was an electrician. His name was Mike. It sort of reminds me of when Obama campaigned and there was Joe the Plumber or somebody who went around. We wondered if that was a set-up, but this is a true story. I spoke to him about government debt and the reason why I’m a financial conservative. I consider myself a fairly progressive Conservative but I am financially conservative and that debt bothers me. It’s something I’ve always thought about: governments and debt.", "He said to me, “Well, I don’t own my house. I’ll just move to Alberta,” because at that time, things were still pretty good in Alberta and he figured he’d just pack up his family and get in his truck—he’s an electrician—and he could get a job in Alberta. He was probably thinking about it at the time. Maybe his wife didn’t want to move and maybe that was a struggle they were going through at that time.", "But that’s the mentality. People don’t have equity. They don’t own their house. They don’t own their business. All they own are their skills and they own the shirt on their back and maybe their equipment, if they’re an electrician. But people don’t have that equity and it makes them very transferable. We see people who will move to another province because there’s a better program for some kind of social services or disability.", "This morning during question period, we heard somebody speak about autism therapy; that they are concerned autism therapy will not be available for their child and they will look at other provinces and consider moving to other provinces.", "So if our debt is starting to affect the level of services, which I believe it is already, many people might have to consider moving to another province. That’s a problem, Madam Speaker. That’s not fair to Manitoba, who might be managing their books very well, to have all the families with autism or certain health problems all of a sudden move to their province. That means that we as legislators are not doing our job here at Queen’s Park.", "So the people who go to payday loans are at a very low point. I think that they need to have access to payday loan institutions. I’m not speaking against the loan institutions; I’m speaking against people being forced to live hand to mouth, often even with a good-paying job. If their electricity rates are sky-rocketing, if they’re having to pay for autism therapy for their child—I would wonder how many people are in debt in the province of Ontario because they’re having to access services that, really, the government should be providing, but they’re on a wait-list. I’d say, kudos, to those people who are willing to use their home equity and to invest in their children and to invest in their own health and to ensure that they are not going to be left behind.", "I think that it really comes down—and we’ve heard a lot of people speak about it—to education: financial literacy and financial education. I have to say, I still remember being in about grade 10. We had home economics for a couple of months, and different types of courses like that that many of the high schools don’t have any more. In one of the courses, we had to learn how to write a cheque, which I had not done until then; we had to learn how to reconcile our bank statement; and we learned about credit cards, interest, compounded interest and what it all meant. I actually found it very interesting at the time.", "I remember, I did very well in the exam, except I lost marks because I didn’t spell “cheque” with Q-U-E; I spelled it C-K. To this day, I have to tell people here that whenever I see somebody write the word “check” when they mean “to write a cheque to the bank” with a C-K, I’m outraged, because I say, “I lost marks for that, and you should lose marks for that as well.”", "I think that all of us here understand what compounded interest is. We understand that payday loans are meant as microloans for two weeks, without compounded interest. Yes, it might sound like a very small amount—$21 on $100—but that’s 21%. I think that that sort of financial literacy—it’s our job to ensure that the schools are teaching it. But we also understand that there are many people who are intellectually challenged in our community, or who may be developing dementia and their family members and friends don’t even realize it yet. They’re taking out loans that really they shouldn’t be. That’s a big challenge for us here in the province, because you want people to have their privacy and autonomy, but then there can be problems associated with that." ],

Earlier I was commenting on the member who has spoken about northern communities and what payday loans and these facilities are like there. But really, through our communities, we have stories that we need to be recognizing.", "I’m reminded of something I talked about the other day. We had a group that put on an Amazing Race to the Bottom, which was an obstacle course in my constituency office parking lot. It sort of—it didn’t make light of it, but was a clever approach to point out that people had to juggle child care and race to pay the rent and carry the weight of the necessities of life. It was an obstacle course that pointed out and highlighted the different challenges that people face. I’m thinking now that we missed an obstacle in this: when there is no money, when it isn’t just an obstacle to overcome, when you have hit a wall and there is nowhere to go. When you cannot climb that wall and you cannot go around it, what on earth do you do?", "The fact that so many people are forced into these establishments, forced to use a loan shark, forced to put themselves in this cycle—to the member’s point, she was talking about microloans and that idea that it’s intended to be short-term, to get you from one paycheque to the next or from one obstacle to the next.

One of the things that we perhaps don’t really realize is that the individuals who are forced to use these loans—which, yes, have been called “micro,” but tend to become macro and chronic in duration, long-term. Therein lie the challenge, the difficulty and the trials and tribulations, because what should be a two-week, four-week or six-week endeavour alone, as you know, Speaker, cycles upon itself, and then—as my kids realized one fine day, “Daddy, this is what compound interest does”—there is therefore interest on interest. That’s where the debt trap occurs, as has been mentioned.", "It’s in order to regulate that, in order to make sure that the interest rates that are charged, whether hidden, explicit or annualized, are more in conformity with what official or proper financial practices are, as well as, for example, instituting things like grace periods for collections and in general helping individuals who, yes, may legitimately require these types of bridge financing or bridge loans—I think probably we might want to call it that, as opposed to microloans. “Microloans” has a different connotation being used globally, by the way, in other parts of the world, as Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus will tell you.", "In any case, this is an important issue.

You’re hopeful that people only need this in short-term bursts; it’s only intended for a two-week period.

Yes, I don’t have a problem with microloans. I think that we need more microloans. What we have a problem with is the interest rate charged at 550% and the fact that, even with this bill, that situation remains.

I don’t think that it’s enough to just say, “Well, they’re mean business people and they’re charging these exorbitantly high interest rates.” The fact is that there is a reason why people go to payday loans.

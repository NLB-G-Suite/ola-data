I’m proud to have the opportunity to rise in the House today to speak about Bill 186, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Act (Strengthening Retirement Security for Ontarians), 2016, which I introduced last week. The introduction of this bill marks an important milestone for our government. I want to thank the staff from the Ministry of Finance and, specifically, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Implementation Secretariat for the tremendous work that they have done to make the ORPP a reality.", "I also want to thank the expert advisers who have assisted us as we developed this plan, specifically Michael Nobrega, former CEO of OMERS; David Dodge, former governor of the Bank of Canada; members of our technical advisory group on retirement security; and members of our business implementation advisory group.", "Bill 186 brings us one step closer to achieving our goal that all eligible Ontarians are part of the ORPP or a comparable plan by 2020. Premier Wynne and this government have shown bold leadership to ensure that the people of this province retire with financial security. When the Premier appointed me Associate Minister of Finance responsible for the ORPP, she gave me a very clear mandate to strengthen retirement security for Ontarians. That’s exactly what this legislation will help achieve.", "Mr. Speaker, we know that we have a retirement savings problem in this country and in this province. Study after study shows that too many Ontarians are not saving enough for retirement. Two thirds of Ontario’s workers do not participate in a workplace pension plan. That’s over four million people. The proportion is even higher among young workers aged 25 to 34, where about 75% do not participate in a workplace pension plan. Combine that with longer lifespans, lower personal savings and an average CPP benefit of just over $6,900 per year, and the result is a growing gap between what Ontarians need to save for a secure retirement and what they will actually have.", "Without immediate action, many of today’s workers will likely see a drop in their standard of living in retirement. A future generation of seniors retiring with inadequate savings would place pressure on younger workers to support health care and other public services that retirees need. That’s not good for people, that’s not good for business and that’s not good for the economy.", "In the face of this pressing retirement savings challenge, our government is moving forward with the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan. The ORPP will help shrink the retirement savings gap by providing Ontario workers with a predictable stream of income, paid for life. If passed, Bill 186 would enshrine the government’s announced key design details for the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan in legislation. This would include details on the requirements for participation and contributions to the ORPP, benefit types, and rules for compliance and enforcement. For example, as we have previously outlined, employers and employees will make equal contributions, ensuring fairness. The ORPP will aim to replace 15% of an individual’s pre-retirement earnings, up to $90,000. Together with CPP, this will create a strong retirement income floor that people can rely on. Mr. Speaker, I want to emphasize again that these benefits will be indexed to inflation.", "The sustainability of the ORPP is critical to our government. Ontario has some of the strongest public sector pension plans in the world. As we’ve developed the ORPP, we’ve leveraged the expertise that these internationally recognized plans offer and modeled the ORPP on the best practices they provide to ensure that the ORPP is among the best-performing plans and is sustainable for generations to come. Accordingly, the bill also includes clear rules related to plan funding to ensure that the ORPP is sustainable.", "In designing the ORPP, our government engaged with thousands of Ontarians. Mr. Speaker, last year I led an extensive consultation on key design features of the plan. I travelled to over 10 communities across the province and received over 1,000 written submissions. I heard from Ontarians in rural areas, our northern communities and our biggest cities. Through this process, I spoke with employers, associations, labour groups, pension experts, retirees and individuals and families. What I heard from those meetings was that people are concerned about their ability to save for retirement. They’re also concerned about the next generation. They want to know that their children and grandchildren will be able to retire securely.", "What I also heard is that they want their government to show leadership on this issue. That’s why we’re moving forward with this made-in-Ontario plan. We know that the benefits of the ORPP will be far-reaching, both for individuals and for the economy. But we also know that employers and employees need time to prepare. In my consultations, what I heard from businesses is that they need time to plan and certainty. That’s exactly what this bill provides. Bill 186 is a critical step in our commitment to provide employers and employees with the clarity they need to prepare for the launch of the ORPP. It also reinforces our commitment to begin enrolling employers in the ORPP in January 2017, with contributions starting January 1, 2018. The ORPP will improve the lives of Ontarians by ensuring that future retirees have the financial security that they deserve.", "I’d like to take the opportunity to highlight some of the key features of the legislation. Eligible employees working in Ontario or paid by an Ontario employer would be required to contribute to the ORPP. Employees would contribute 1.9% of their annual earnings between a minimum threshold of $3,500 and a maximum earnings threshold of $90,000, and their employer would match that contribution. This would apply to employees between the ages of 18 and 70 who are not members of a comparable workplace plan.", "In designing the ORPP, we heard from many employers about the generous workplace pension plans that they offer their employees. In many cases, these plans are already working well for some employees and employers. That’s why we created the concept of a comparable workplace pension plan: so that employers who offer their employees adequate pension coverage can continue to run their registered pension plans and not be required to contribute to the ORPP.", "Our government’s vision of a comparable workplace pension plan is grounded in the principles of adequacy and targeted coverage. We worked with experts to ensure that our proposed thresholds for comparable plans would deliver pension coverage comparable to the ORPP. We looked at plans that had the lowest probability of individual members outliving their savings.", "The ORPP would include other provisions that mirror the CPP. First Nations employers and employees on-reserve would have the option to opt in to the ORPP. At this time, self-employed individuals and federally regulated non-crown employees would not be eligible to participate. However, we have included a provision to allow them to participate in future, depending on the discussions with the federal government.", "I’m happy to have the opportunity to discuss the benefits of the ORPP and what it would offer to Ontarians. The ORPP would offer two specific benefits: a pension benefit and a survivor benefit. To ensure that members retain their purchasing power in retirement, benefits would be indexed to inflation. The ORPP pension benefit would target 15% of a member’s pre-retirement earnings, up to $90,000. ORPP benefits would be earned as contributions are made, and the level of benefit would depend on the length of time an individual contributed to the plan and their salary during those years.", "The ORPP pension benefit would be available to members when they turn 65. However, adjusted benefits would be available as early as 60 and as late as 70 to provide members the flexibility they need as they approach retirement.", "The ORPP survivor benefit would be payable not just to a surviving spouse but also to a member’s designated beneficiary or estate if the member was single. This is an important improvement on what is provided by the CPP.", "As the ORPP is designed as a pension plan under the Income Tax Act, both employer and employee contributions would be tax deductible.", "Last year, our government passed the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Administration Corporation Act, 2015, to create the ORPP Administration Corp. The ORPP AC is the independent, arm’s-length entity which will be responsible for administering the pension plan and for managing the plan’s investments for the benefit of plan beneficiaries.", "The ORPP is a plan for Ontarians and the sustainability of this plan is a core principle. Our government is committed to ensuring the contributions that Ontarians make to the plan are there for them in retirement. A clear funding policy that would guide the actions of the ORPP Administration Corp. and government in the event of either a funding excess or a shortfall is a critical feature of this legislation.", "Through a strong accountability and transparency framework, the board of directors and management team of the ORPP Administration Corp. will be fully accountable to plan members. In turn, the ORPP AC would hold employers to account through a compliance and enforcement framework laid out in this legislation. Compliance and enforcement measures would include education to make sure that employers understand what is required of them.", "Let me be clear: ORPP contributions and revenues will not form part of the government’s consolidated revenue funds. Instead, these funds would be held in trust by the ORPP Administration Corp. for the benefit of the members of the plan.", "I’ve spoken about some of the details of today’s legislation, but I’d also like to talk about the bigger picture and how the ORPP would benefit Ontario’s economy as a whole.", "The Conference Board of Canada’s cost-benefit analysis of the ORPP tabled last December confirms that both the economy and Ontarians would be better off with the ORPP. In the long term, it would be expected to add billions of dollars to the economy while providing a cost-effective means of helping individuals save for retirement.", "Today’s legislation is another significant step in our journey toward ensuring that by 2020 all eligible Ontario workers would be covered by a comparable workplace plan or the ORPP.", "Previous governments in Canada and Ontario have taken courageous steps to build a strong retirement benefit foundation through the Canada Pension Plan, Old Age Security, the Guaranteed Income Supplement and the Ontario Guaranteed Annual Income System, or GAINS.", "Today, the system needs to be improved for future generations. The province has long been a champion of strengthening the retirement income security system and is pleased that the federal government shares this commitment. Even as we introduce legislation on the ORPP, we are continuing to work collaboratively with the federal government, the provinces and territories to make progress on a CPP enhancement that addresses the needs of future retirees.", "But we also know that we need to make progress now to ensure that Ontarians can achieve the retirement security they deserve.", "Last week, I was at Studio [Y] in Toronto to announce the introduction of this bill. Studio [Y] is a program to support young innovators. They are smart, diverse, big-thinking problem solvers.", "I met one young person who builds robots to help clean up the shorelines in places where humans cannot go.", "I met another who has started a social enterprise that supports youth in creating art and music, promoting resilience in their lives and the lives of others.", "I met another young innovator whose passion is to advise and support students and youth groups to create real, tangible outcomes.", "All of these young people are poised and ready to do amazing things in this world and will have long and impactful careers. They are the leaders of today and tomorrow. They’ll be innovating and flourishing in a different kind of economy from the one that their parents and grandparents worked in, one where there are fewer traditional workplace pension plans. It’s a world where people are living longer and need their savings to go further in retirement. That’s exactly why we are moving forward with this important piece of legislation. It is critical for the future well-being of Ontarians and our economy that we take action now to ensure that future retirees, like the young people I met last week, can achieve financial security in retirement regardless of where their careers take them.", "Mr. Speaker, the ORPP is an integral part of our government’s economic plan to build Ontario up and to deliver on its number one priority: to grow Ontario’s economy and create jobs. Passing the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Act (Strengthening Retirement Security for Ontarians), 2016, is an important step in modernizing the retirement income system in our province. I’m asking the members of this assembly to support this very important legislation. Bill 186 will ensure for future generations of retirees and for all working Ontarians that they have the retirement security they need." ],

She said that Ontario would be better off with the ORPP, according to the Conference Board. Let me give you the details, Speaker, of exactly what the Conference Board said. The cost-benefit analysis from the Conference Board of Canada, commissioned by the Ministry of Finance, admits that it will take 20 years before the economy recovers from the shock of the ORPP. They calculate—this is the Conference Board; the ministry’s own study—that job losses will peak at 23,000 in 2023. Real disposable income and consumption spending will remain lower until 2040. This will lead to “a fall in ... private investment that peaks”—the loss peaks—“at $939 million in 2024.” Finally, when does the report say that the good news the minister said is coming will kick in? Well, that will be 2093, 75 years from now. That’s the report.", "So when she says that Ontario would be better off with the ORPP, she may be correct if anybody can forecast that far—they can’t forecast to the end of the week, let alone a three-year forecast. They are telling us that 75 years from now Ontario will be better off with the ORPP. So they are obviously not listening to their own experts, their own study from the Conference Board that tells them what a disaster this is." ],

I can’t remember who previously said—I think it was this minister, perhaps—that the workforce is changing and becoming a contemporary, mobile workforce.

Everyone knows that when people retire, if they have adequate income, they will continue to spend into Ontario’s economy, and that is good for business, that’s good for the individual and that’s good for our economy as a whole.

I have been critical of the manner in which this has been presented—the target audience, the timelines—but what I want to start with is the fact that my concerns are with what the genuine concerns that Ontarians, Ontario businesses, my caucus and I share about this proposal and its effect on the well-being of the province.", "We know, through public discourse, businesses from around the province and even a Ministry of Finance document, that this proposal is truly a job killer. The ministry document states that over 50,000 jobs in Ontario will be lost, while some industries will never recover. The Canadian Federation of Independent Business forecasts the same negative impacts on our economy if the Ontario pension is installed.", "One constant is that no one is saying that the pension plan will help to create jobs. Businesses in this province have been continually assaulted by this government’s increased red tape, increased operating costs in both taxes and hydro rates, along with the fear of a new payroll tax. Some of the most vulnerable businesses do not possess the financial cushion to absorb this proposal. Instead, they see a government bent on squeezing more money from them through any means necessary, including a mandatory pension.", "Businesses can only pay these when they make a profit. Businesses can only hire more employees and grow if the government allows them to do so. It is no longer a secret that each and every day companies choose to pass Ontario by and find jurisdictions where growth is possible.", "We all know that it’s impossible to save for retirement if you have no job. This isn’t just a message from the opposition bench. Some of the most respected institutions and some of Ontario’s largest employers have implored this government to reconsider the proposed new tax. General Motors, Ford, Canadian Tire, Walmart and Magna all worked in concert to formally let the government know the risks this plan creates. By the way, I should just emphasize that this is unprecedented, for industry leaders to come together and at the earliest stages let the government know of the risk this plan creates.", "These are associations ranging from mining to hospitality, from manufacturers to farmers, all across the board, whether it be different political stripe or industry. They are all in opposition to the Liberal payroll tax. Between skyrocketing energy rates, a looming carbon tax and your payroll tax, the cost of doing business in Ontario is far too high, and it’s costing jobs. Employers in Ontario are telling the government that enough is enough.", "With the Ontario government’s rejigging of the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan to slow down its implementation, we hopefully can take this as a sign that the government is slowly but surely becoming more realistic about its effect on a weak economy. However, the best course for this ill-conceived plan is to stop the whole thing in its place. The ORPP is a tax. The ORPP will apply to anyone without a defined-benefit or a sufficiently rich defined-contribution plan. The premium will be set at 1.9% up to $90,000 of earnings for employees, matched by a similar amount paid by employers for a grand total of $3,286 per worker. A benefit equal to 15% of insurable earnings will be paid, up to $12,815 per year. It begins in 2017 for Ontario’s largest corporations, followed by a one-year delayed implementation for medium-sized firms and a two-year delay for small companies.", "It seems when the Liberals try their hand at something new, they prove they can’t get anything right: green energy, SAMS—and economics is no exception. Simply, they don’t get it; perhaps they never will. The government has often fought fiercely against the idea that the ORPP is a tax, meanwhile disguising it as a way to help people save. I might just add parenthetically that it’s a mandatory way of saving. This misses the fundamental point of what a tax is. The definition of tax is “a compulsory contribution to state revenue” or taxes can be defined as an involuntary fee. The key concept in defining a tax is its compulsion, not its use. It doesn’t matter if you spend taxes on closing gas-fired power plants or health and education or fighting a war overseas. The only relevant point is that the taxpayer has no choice but to pay; it is mandatory.", "For determining if the ORPP is a tax, all that counts is that participation is obligatory. Taxes don’t just transfer money from people to government but are the obligatory removal of an individual’s freedom to spend that money as they wish. Saying that ORPP contributions are helping Ontarians to save is irrelevant and unproven, since it is quite likely people simply will reduce other saving methods to compensate. If Ontario wants to set up a voluntary pension plan to encourage more saving, that would be a different matter, but the ORPP is compulsory and therefore properly classified as a tax.", "The same principle about what a tax is applies to the Ontario health premium, one of the first measures introduced by the Liberal government in 2004, which broke its election promise not to raise taxes. Calling it a premium instead of a tax may make it sound like you’re paying for an admission to a select club, but all that matters is its compulsion, as goes for the cap-and-trade pricing system, which is just a tax on carbon emissions. Relabeling taxes might be good public relations, but it is bad classification taxonomy.", "Not calling it a tax encourages governments to engage in the fiction of having dedicated levies to fund every type of expenditure, from bridges to roads to debt service, without the burden of a tax. It seems as if the Liberals would like to live in a world where the taxes have been replaced by a slew of contributions, premiums, levies and user fees, every bit as onerous but without the distasteful label of “taxes.”", "It may come as no surprise that the Liberals are not familiar with the term they know so well, seeing how the Liberal government has introduced so many new ones or raised the rate on others, including the ORPP contributions, the harmonized sales tax, higher personal income tax, the health care levy, a multitude of environmental levies and the routine punishment of beer, tobacco and fuel taxes favoured by cash-strapped governments everywhere. Perhaps not understanding what a tax fundamentally represents and how its mandatory nature supersedes spending intent helps to explain why this administration keeps raising taxes, unaware of how they slow Ontario’s economic growth.", "Any pension reform should be targeted, not unnecessarily broad-based: a balanced approach. A balanced approach will be needed to ensure that the ORPP does not undermine any existing plans and disadvantage Ontario workers and investment. The very real risk is that Ontario workers will be worse off if employers with already attractive pension plans find themselves unable to continue those plans if they are required to include the ORPP.", "This job-killing payroll tax hinders the ability of the private sector to do what it does best: provide job opportunities for people and strengthen our economy to attract investment. Pension investments must be made with best intentions, toward the highest returns, free of political interference and free to invest anywhere across the world. Pension plans are supposed to be done in the best interest of pensioners and must not be restricted. The ORPP is an idea to achieve a hidden motive at a bad time. Despite what the government studies supposedly say, there’s no true need for this mandatory payroll contribution.", "This is true for the following reasons. The plan is unneeded for four fifths of workers, who already have sufficient savings for adequate retirement, as shown by Statistics Canada and Mackenzie studies taking into account all forms of savings. Instead, the plan will hurt many families with new taxes as they deal with child-rearing costs and invest in housing equity, which is the most important retirement asset in later life.", "There are pockets of individuals who need support, such as low-income seniors facing a poverty rate of 20%. A minority of households with modest family incomes below $60,000 do need additional support. Any pension reform should be targeted, not unnecessarily broad-based.", "The plan unnecessarily extends to many upper-income households, with up to $180,000 in income when two earners retire. This is well beyond any reasonable notion of what is meant by “middle class,” since most upper-income households have the means to ensure a good standard of living.", "The plan hurts the middle class, yet many middle-class individuals will bear much higher tax rates on plan benefits, especially in the $73,000-to-$90,000 range, as Old Age Security payments are clawed back. I think that needs to be repeated: The plan hurts the middle class. It’s not helping the lowest-income earners, and it also means that Old Age Security will be clawed back.", "The plan provides a poor return to savings for low-income Canadians, who will be provided little personal income tax relief for contributions yet face a walloping personal tax on benefits with personal taxes and reductions in guaranteed income supplements.", "The personal tax treatment of the ORPP is uncertain. If it is treated similarly to other retirement saving plans under the Income Tax Act, the ORPP will provide comparable returns to annuity plans for many middle-income households. If the pension contributions are treated similarly to Canada pension, only a tiny tax credit based on the low-income tax rate is provided as relief, making the ORPP savings a poor investment for many Ontarians.", "Although it is argued by the Liberal government that the ORPP will increase savings, it is quite the contrary. There will be a significant reduction in private savings, as many US and Canadian economic studies have suggested in the past, including a recent one by well-respected economist François Vaillancourt at the Université de Montréal.", "Businesses will face a new set of taxes on employees, much of it shifted back in lower wages over time. In the short run, companies facing international competition will face higher costs, along with higher Ontario energy costs, property taxes and new levies to pay for infrastructure. The latter is most critical to achieve growth in the long run, unlike the ORPP.", "Ontario had better options that would have avoided many of the above issues. It could have created a voluntary pooled saving plan with automatic enrolment, similar to the Saskatchewan Pension Plan, with a better take-up rate, even with an opt-out feature. Other provinces, like British Columbia, Alberta and Quebec, also offer similar kinds of legislative frameworks for people who would be better off with this kind of a plan.", "The Liberals failed at their other option, which was to push for an expansion of the CPP, which makes more sense than the ORPP. Canada pension expansion focused on those households with modest incomes—such as raising the replacement rate of working income to 35%—would perhaps, when this plan fails, be strong enough to deal with a modest expansion that would be acceptable to governments across the country.", "Instead of proceeding with the ORPP, it should be killed. It’s a major mistake in policy terms.", "Much has been raised about the expense to administer. There’s no question that there are some parts of the makeup of the ORPP that in fact make it more expensive to administer. When you compare the number of people paying into CPP, that’s the entire working community across the country. This one is not. It’s not even across the province.", "People moving in and out of the province will have to be tracked. Comparabledefined-contribution plans will be developed by many businesses, reducing the need for the ORPP and thereby increasing per-unit administrative costs for those in the plan. Taxpayers will be on the hook for shortfalls. Someone must bear the risk with downturns in the economy.", "That goes along with the Liberal government’s egregious benefits they offer to party insiders. We already know that very-well-paid individuals—the first CEO of the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Administration Corp. earned almost half a million dollars a year for the Pan Am Games. Despite these egregious wages, we are seeing the definition played out of what the government thinks is “arm’s-length.”", "The appointment of two Liberal insiders who have a track record of exorbitant salaries, cost overruns and close ties to the Liberal government does little to quell fears regarding management and the estimated $300 million a year in administrative costs surrounding the Premier’s new pension scheme.", "The question of a funding shortfall: Within section 45 of the legislation, it determines that the ORPP AC has the power to slide the contribution rate of 1.9% up or down 0.2%. Additionally, if the above measure fails to achieve the funding shortfall, the ORPP AC has the power to change the accrual rate. The accrual rate is the rate of interest that is added to the principal of a financial instrument between cash payments of that interest. For example, a six-month bond with interest payable semi-annually will accrue daily interest during the six-month term until it is paid in full on the date it becomes due. If both measures fail, the ORPP AC will return to the government to enact its power in some means to address the funding shortfall, and that means, find more money. This leads me to question if this plan, less equipped than the CPP, will fare so much better. Shortfalls and unfunded liability are a common fear felt today. If history is the best indication of the future, I truly fear that the government’s general revenue will be faced with funding the shortfall.", "Right now, Canada’s economy is growing, but it is weakened by the collapse in commodity prices and a lacklustre global economy. Outside a recession, this is the worst possible time to enact a $3.5-billion payroll tax.", "Ontario, in its economic picture, is the largest subnational debtor in the entire world—just one alarming distinction. Its debt is $294 billion, or over $21,000 per capita. Net debt to GDP is up 48% in the past 10 years, to almost 40%. Last year’s interest obligations totalled $11.4 billion, about the same as the cost of community and social services. I doubt that many Ontarians realize how much they are paying just in interest on the provincial debt. It averages $840 per person every year, and it’s rising. Not surprisingly, Standard & Poor’s downgraded Ontario’s bond credit from AA- to A+, citing a very high debt burden and a very weak budgetary performance.", "The timing of this ill-conceived plan further risks the fragile state of the economy. The ORPP has continually evolved as a revenue tool each and every time it looks to absorb as much money from the economy as possible.", "The chamber’s latest survey shows that 44% of businesses will cut jobs or freeze hiring because of the ORPP—that’s the Ontario Chamber of Commerce, with its ability to check with its members and see how they will be responding. Obviously, cutting jobs or freezing hiring is not a positive. It certainly won’t increase the number of people able to take an ORPP.", "ORPP administrative costs are expected to range between $130 and $200 per member per year. So a worker who contributes $800 per year will lose up to 25% of their contributions off the top in fees alone. That doesn’t sound like a very good return on investment to me. Ontarians won’t be saving more; they will just be losing more off their payroll stub.", "The Premier has said that the mandatory Ontario plan will be good for the province, yet recent studies show that 90% of small business owners are opposed to the ORPP. An employee making $45,000 a year would pay just shy of $800 toward the ORPP, with their employer contributing an equal amount. While larger businesses may be able to absorb these added costs, smaller businesses will be forced to either reduce the size of their workforce or the hours those employees are able to work. The creation of an Ontario-only pension plan will risk any immediate and future federal government stimulus in Ontario.", "I found it very helpful to examine the ORPP’s impact on different socio-economic groups. The poor will be squeezed most by a payroll tax as they struggle to make ends meet. Middle-income workers will take home fewer savings for RRSPs and TFSAs, a down payment on a home, mortgage repayment or their children’s education. Seniors will never truly draw a meaningful benefit, as we heard earlier from the member for Nipissing. First of all, they don’t have a job right now. Secondly, a pension takes about 40 years. As for the well off, it is hardly a public policy concern if some wealthy people are less affluent in retirement, which, in any case, a provincial pension would do precious little to address.", "Now let’s address the government’s core concern. First, I acknowledge a few, like the Broadbent Institute, have come to the conclusion that Canadians are approaching retirement with totally inadequate savings. However, this position seems to be an outlier. The federal Department of Finance notes, “Canadian retirees achieve relatively high levels of income in retirement.” That’s a quote from the former chief economic analyst for Stats Canada, Philip Cross. He said, “There is no crisis for the current generation of retirees.”", "The Montreal Economic Institute’s Michael Kelly-Gagnon concluded that only a very small proportion of Canadians are ill prepared for retirement. The Fraser Institute points out those expanding public pensions would reduce private savings, disadvantage younger Canadians, impose a significant tax upon the middle class and be less cost-effective than private plans.", "The C.D. Howe Institute pointedly wrote that “in making the case for the ORPP the province exaggerates the gap between what Canadians save and what they need to save, almost beyond recognition.” Studies after studies by multiple groups have arrived at the same notion. If this isn’t to help those without a pension plan, then what are the true motives?", "It’s important to note that there are two distinct groups of employees: There are those who have some type of pension benefit, which will be put to the government’s test of an annual contribution rate of 4% for the employee and employer, respectively, totalling a yearly contribution rate of 8%, and there are those individuals who have no pension with their employer, which then both the employees and employers will be forced to contribute at an annual rate of 1.9%, respectively. This then forces the remaining pension and benefit programs either to increase current pension benefits to employees which meet the government’s interpretation—" ],

This further makes me wonder why the government would force this on businesses and Ontarians.", "In the last year, the Liberals passed Bill 56, an act to establish the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan advisory corporation, or the ORPP AC, which is to act as the government’s neutral third-party administrator of the pension plan. However, from Bill 56, under section 2, duties of the entity, it states: “Investing contributions: The administrative entity shall be responsible for investing the collected contributions for the benefit of the members and other beneficiaries of the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan.” Who else other than pensioners benefits from their mandatory payroll contributions?", "If pensions are created for the benefit of the pensioners, an issue arises when asking who the government considers being the “other beneficiaries.” This ambiguity surrounding the wording in the legislation allows for the Liberal government’s influence and manipulation of further investments.", "Recently, the government released Proposed Amendments to Regulation 909: Eliminating the 30 per cent rule for Pension Investment:", "“A. Background.", "“In the 2015 Ontario Economic Outlook and Fiscal Review, the province announced its intention to eliminate the ’30 per cent pension investment rule.’”", "The Liberal government was recently caught in an underhanded move having to have some amendments considered to regulation 909.", "The 30% rule is one of the most quantitative limits contained in the federal pension investment rules which Ontario incorporates by reference. This rule in subsection 11(1) of schedule 3 of the federal Pension Benefits Standards Regulations states that “the administrator of a plan shall not, directly or indirectly, invest the moneys of the plan in the securities of a corporation to which are attached more than 30 per cent of the votes that may be cast to elect the directors of the corporation.”", "The federal pension investment rules currently have exemptions from the 30% rule for certain corporations—real estate, resource and investment corporations—if the stipulated disclosure and undertakings are provided to the regulator. It is proposed that a plan administrator would no longer be prevented from investing in more than 30% of the voting shares of any corporation. A threshold percentage could be established above which certain disclosure requirements or undertakings would apply. Possible requirements that may apply to the plan administrator and the corporation if the plan invests in more than a threshold percentage of that corporation’s voting shares are described below.", "Behind all the technical legislative amendments and regulations, in simple terms, the government is trying to change the law to fund their own Ontario-based projects with future tax revenue from the ORPP. This Liberal government will even try to change federal law to cover its tracks to finally face the overwhelming infrastructure deficit, which it will achieve by getting control on all the cash by diverting the new payroll tax to provincial infrastructure projects.", "Political interference in pension management is generally shunned because it is a sure way to compromise returns and jeopardize retirement savings. When I think of the Liberal motivations, the word “shameful” comes to mind.", "The most important item of note did not come from this legislation. It was a line that was quietly announced in a recent Ontario budget which stated that by “encouraging more Ontarians to save through a proposed new Ontario Retirement Pension Plan,” it reads, “new pools of capital would be available for Ontario-based projects such as building roads, bridges and new transit.”", "With the current legislation, it is up to the discretion and interpretation of the ORPP Administration Corp. to make investments that they consider to be to the benefit of members and other beneficiaries. The above-mentioned ability, in concert with the questionable purpose announced in the budget, draws into question the true motive of this pension plan. It is of great concern that the goal of this program is for the fiscally challenged Ontario government to gather money through a new payroll tax for the purpose of pooling funds for new provincial infrastructure programs.", "I’m wondering, since I’ve come to the end of a particular section, if we might recess at this point." ],

It’s very clear when you look at the mandate of the Canada Pension Plan. The CPP and their investment board mandate is set out in legislation. It states that the CPP investment board’s objective “is to invest its assets with a view to achieving a maximum rate of return, without undue risk of loss, having regard to the factors that may affect the funding of the CPP and the ability of the CPP to meet its financial obligations on any given business day.”", "I think it’s really important for viewers to appreciate that it’s very clear that these are the rules for the CPP. There’s not the fuzzy question of the benefit of members and other beneficiaries, as in the ORPP, as well as the excerpt from the budget document, which then allowed more Ontarians to save through a proposed new Ontario retirement plan. New pools of capital would be available for Ontario-based projects such as building roads, bridges and new transit. I think motive then becomes extremely important in understanding the complexity of this initiative for all Ontarians. It’s very clear from the material that I presented this morning that it is not in the best interest of poor people and it is a burden to those in the middle class because it reduces their choices in savings.", "One of the other things that is sort of an interesting light in terms of the position taken by the government—when the first bill was being introduced, I and my other caucus members on the committee wanted to introduce an amendment that would raise the minimum entry age from 18 to 19. The Liberals voted that down. Then we tried 20. Then we tried 21.", "There was obviously a certain frustration on the other side: “Why are you doing this?”", "We said it’s because between 18 and 25, many young people are in many different part-time jobs as they are working their way through school, or they’re getting new jobs or they’re looking for one.

Maybe they don’t contribute for more than a couple of years in their youth, and then they either are somewhere where Ontario has no jurisdiction, or they have a different kind of pension set-up—they don’t have an ORPP. This hardly seems like a fair way, and it doesn’t seem like we’re trusting these people with their own money, to make the right decisions. But, no, you are eligible to contribute from age 18 to age 70.", "The complexity of this is also illustrated by the number of acts that are affected and the technical responsibility in bringing these.

  "text" : [ "Mr. Speaker, I’m deeply honoured to have been asked by my caucus to reflect upon the memories and impressions of Peter Kormos and the profound impact he had on the lives of people in our community of Niagara and our province and indeed our entire country. To do so in just a few minutes is a challenge, since I think any one of us who served with Peter could take an hour or more to fully capture our own recollections of an individual who was truly, and I say truly, one of a kind.", "The size and composition of the gathering at his funeral—and it was a full house, I assure you of that. It included members of the press gallery, people from all walks of life. The size and composition of the gathering at his funeral spoke volumes about the man and the influence he had on all of us, whether it was those in the highest positions in our society or regular folks who had felt an attachment to the man who stood up for them when it seemed that others had forgotten them.", "In politics, we recognize that it’s often easier to avoid controversial issues that stir raw emotions in the population, and to deal in generalities or to sit on the fence. There was never any room on that fence for Peter Kormos. If there were feathers to be ruffled, Peter was there to ruffle them. He was always prepared to comfort the afflicted and to afflict the comfortable; in fact, he took great pleasure in doing so.", "It is said that politics is theatre at either its best or its worst, and indeed that is true, and on the political stage, there was none better than our friend Peter Kormos. He could be outrageous, bombastic or shocking, but you also and always felt that, unlike the manufactured rage that we observe on the political stage so often, his anger was genuine and his passion unquestioned, particularly when he was defending the interests of the weak, the downtrodden, the bullied or the disadvantaged.", "Peter was prepared to take on the powerful and the privileged no matter what the consequences might be, no matter how unpopular the cause might be. He was unfailing in his support for and defence of working people and the unions who defended their interests. They had no better friend than Peter Kormos, and they rewarded him with their solid electoral support, election after election.", "Strikes and picket lines are seldom popular with the general public, and demonstrations are often frowned upon by a large portion of the population. That never stopped Peter from joining his “brothers and sisters” in protest, and they never forgot that gesture on his part.", "In the book Giving Away a Miracle, in which the authors took an often critical look at the NDP government of the day, they observed, “If some people are loose cannons, Kormos was a runaway multiple warhead.” It was a description that Peter would have worn as a badge of honour.", "Some people dedicate their lives to business, a profession, an occupation, family or various personal options; Peter Kormos dedicated his life to politics. His knowledge of and respect for parliamentary procedure and democratic process were second to none. He could speak without notes, without the party script, without prepared talking points on virtually any subject, with eloquence and with authority. His analysis of legislation was thorough and comprehensive, since he was one of the very few legislators who actually read a bill from cover to cover. You might disagree with his approach or his conclusions, but you knew they were based on solid research, vast experience and personal principles.", "His knowledge of his constituency and his presence in his local community were legendary, as evidenced by those who are here today from the community and those who, back at home, are watching this particular eulogy. But some of us recognized that his presence in the halls of the Ontario Legislature, often at times when others had left for personal pursuits, was felt profoundly. Peter was the go-to guy for the NDP, the individual who was working when no one else was available. He did the media scrums, the sound bites and the panels when others had gone home because, in many ways, the Legislature and politics were his home.", "Peter Kormos, as TVO’s Steve Paikin observed, “saw injustice and wanted to right it.” Our friend Peter saw unfairness and wanted to bring about fairness in our society. He observed inequality and wanted to overcome that inequality. Wherever and whenever Peter Kormos saw a need for government or society to intervene on behalf of the vulnerable, the needy or those without privilege or position, he took on the challenge.", "A biography of Peter Kormos, written by Brock University professor Larry Savage—I’m referring to Socialist Cowboy, and Larry is in the gallery today observing the proceedings of the Legislature—tells a story of a renegade in politics whose contribution to the public dialogue was unmatched in recent Ontario history. And he did it following his mentor, Mel Swart, who was a beloved individual in the Niagara Peninsula and this Legislature as well.", "When the news broke of Peter’s sudden and unexpected death, shock, disbelief and, later, profound sadness permeated the ranks of those with whom he worked, as it did the community at large. Just as when illness struck a few years back, when political friend and adversary alike expressed genuine concern for his well-being, immense sadness greeted the news of his passing. He would have observed people of all political stripes at his funeral to pay tribute to a political icon in our part of the province. Political schedules are often full and unmovable, but you saw at the gathering in his honour so many who wanted to say farewell to a friend—my friend, your friend, our friend, Peter Kormos.", "At the cabinet meeting after the news of his passing emerged, the conversations turned, as we filed from the cabinet room, to Peter Kormos and our final chance to say goodbye to a beloved colleague, and a wish from Premier Wynne that all of us could join her in making our way to the memorial service in Peter’s honour in Thorold.", "It is said at virtually every funeral service that the deceased person will be missed. Indeed, this is always true for family and close friends. Peter is truly missed. There’s no replacement for a person of his character. He cannot be cloned. His is a pattern that cannot be duplicated. Peter Kormos may be gone from us in the mortal sense, but his memory will live on in the hearts and minds of those of us who had the privilege of serving with him in this House, and in all who encountered him in their daily lives." ],

He earned the respect and admiration of everyone who had the good fortune to know him, including people like me who are in different political parties. Most importantly, he earned the respect and admiration of the average person he represented as a lawyer or as an elected official. His constituents knew that he would fight for them without hesitation or reservation. There can be no higher compliment given than that earned respect.", "While Peter was flamboyant and always stood out in a crowd, he never forgot his roots and had no patience for what he termed “horsefeathers.” Peter didn’t use the term “horsefeathers” because he was being polite; as someone well-versed in parliamentary procedures and rules, he knew he could be kicked out for using unparliamentary language. Peter being who he was, he just couldn’t resist pushing the envelope, so he found clever euphemisms and turns of phrase to torment every Speaker. Everyone clearly knew what Peter was saying, but no Speaker could reference existing rulings or make new ones up fast enough to tie up Peter’s cutting tongue.", "Peter entered the provincial Legislature in 1988, two years before I also began my role as an MPP. One of the reasons I credit for my own longevity in this job is that I was fortunate not to ever find myself in Peter’s crosshairs.", "This was a man who wasn’t afraid to fire shots at absolutely anyone and everyone. When insurance company executives appeared at a legislative committee during the Peterson government’s time in office—they were introducing legislation that would increase insurance rates—Peter earned a reprimand from his own party leader for calling them “whores” and “slime.” Yes, Mr. Speaker, there was a time when reading Hansard topped any reality show for shock and entertainment value.", "Peter was single-handedly responsible for the highest viewership of the Legislative Assembly television channel. In protest of Premier Peterson’s insurance legislation, he filibustered for 37 hours, at one time speaking for 17 hours non-stop. Thousands of Ontario residents tuned in to watch this marathon feat. He had set up telephone lines to take in viewers’ concerns and comments, which he used to keep on talking. More than 500 people called into those lines, one of which was even staffed by then-NDP leader Bob Rae. Mischievously, Peter also provided colouring books for government Liberal MPPs during the middle of the night, when he saw they were getting a bit restless. I can’t even imagine how much fun Peter could be having if he were still in the Legislature today.", "It was such a delight for me to see Peter in action in this Legislature. He had such an intellect, and he would mesmerize everyone just about every time he stood up to speak. It was in Peter’s nature to deflate arrogance, inflict discomfort on the comfortable and comfort those in need or in trouble.", "Even at an early age, Mr. Speaker, there is a track record of challenging authority without reservation and often with humour. He was never afraid to get into a bit of trouble and would pay the price without complaint. As a practising lawyer, he used to regularly park in the judge’s reserved parking spot, often getting his sports car towed away. He obviously thought the sight of the judge having to fish out coins for a parking meter was worth the cost of the tow.", "As both an alderman and local lawyer before he entered provincial politics, Peter was well known for being scrappy and combative. Just before winning his first provincial election, he was cited for contempt of court on the grounds that he was insolent and grandstanding. I understand the citation was dropped just days before voting day. Personally, I suspect that everyone at court just wanted him to go to Queen’s Park so he wouldn’t be in their faces on a daily basis. In fact, there is a rumour that the lawyers whose arguments he would rip apart in court actually took up a collection to ensure his campaign had enough money for him to succeed to his election to Queen’s Park.", "Peter never forgot his roots and remained a maverick even when he was in the government caucus under Bob Rae. In the early days of the Rae government, there was a ridiculous amount of controversy over a photo that was taken of Peter. He appeared as the Sunshine Boy in the Toronto Sun. He was fully and conservatively dressed, wearing a white shirt, dark pants and a tie. In fact, he was probably more dressed up than was his usual habit here in the Ontario Legislature of cowboy boots and no tie. For some reason, this photo generated more anguish in the government at the time than any of the shenanigans of the day. Cabinet colleagues of Peter were critical, and Bob Rae ultimately removed him from cabinet. Different times indeed, Mr. Speaker.", "Personally, I was just jealous of Peter. No newspaper has ever asked me to pose for a glamour shot." ],

There have been few MPPs like Peter, that could command the attention of everyone each time he rose to speak. He had relentless drive and energy, never mincing words. Peter never hesitated to call “horsefeathers” in this assembly and express himself fully.", "When I think of Peter, I often remember how he would take every opportunity to reprimand the government for limiting debate through time allocation and closure motions. I know many of us fondly remember him yelling his famous line on these occasions: “The Liberals don’t want to work.”", "I know he would be saying that regularly if he was still with us today, so as in every debate that Peter participated in, once again, today, Peter gets the final word." ],

But in this House, Peter is a giant who earned respect and admiration across the aisles, as we’ve heard this morning, Speaker.", "In our party, he’s an icon. To the people of Welland and Thorold, the people he served here incredibly well for 23 years, Peter Kormos was a friend and a familiar face they could count on to always put the concerns of hard-working people first.", "As was said, for newer members of this House who have only been here since 2011, I should say that no speech confined to using parliamentary language will ever quite do justice to Peter Kormos. This is a man who knew the standing orders better than anyone, but also knew how to swear like a sailor and liked nothing better than skating close to those lines, which is why, if you look up Hansard, you can see Peter’s erudite articulation of the philosophical difference between lying, which, of course, is an unparliamentary accusation, and, on the other hand, bullspitting, which Peter reasoned is a perfectly parliamentary term to describe what too many politicians try to do.", "Nothing was going to stop Peter Kormos from telling it like it was, Speaker. He brought politics down to earth and he made sure that people back home could actually hear their voices in this Legislature. It was that commitment to the people of Welland that he wore on his sleeve, the sleeves of buttoned-down shirts that were made in Canada by unionized workers who he knew were treated fairly and paid decent wages, shirts that were laundered and pressed at Lee-Wah Laundry and that he had probably picked up at Blake’s menswear, because Peter knew that those local businesses and hard-working families are exactly what make our community strong. He knew that he worked for them.", "And as was said, he worked around the clock. If that meant filibustering for 17 hours when the government tried to shut down debate, Peter would do that.", "If it meant going undercover at the Family Responsibility Office, Peter would do that too. And if it meant borrowing Michael Prue’s union-made tuxedo and wearing it in this House, Peter would do that just to prove his point that New Democrats can never be bullied or shamed out of doing our jobs. Because of those memorable tactics, Speaker, he was reminding us that politics is about one thing: It’s about making a difference in people’s lives, and he was going to do that one way or another.", "Even if it meant challenging people’s assumptions, Peter was going to do the right thing, like when he fought for presumed consent for organ donation to help save the lives of people stuck waiting for transplants. To paraphrase Peter, it’s not so much an extraordinary act to donate an organ; the extraordinary act is to not donate an organ when people’s lives hang in the balance. That’s who Peter was.", "No problem was too big or too daunting to take on. When the rights of thousands of Torontonians were violated during the G20 summit, Peter stood up for the civil rights of those peaceful protestors and bystanders. He stood up for people who had been all too literally trampled on, and he stood up for people whose rights were being ignored. Whenever workers were locked out or when they were forced to the picket line to protect their rights, whether it was a factory in the smallest town or the tallest tower on Bay Street, Peter was there, letting those workers know that they were not alone.", "Voilà qui était Peter. Voilà le genre de gars qu’il était.", "He stuck to his principles, even if it meant taking on his own government or his own party. I can tell you, as I said at his funeral, that Peter could be a real pain in the—you know where I’m going with that, Speaker—a real pain in the posterior, shall we say. But because of those principles and because he never forgot who he was working for, Peter has left a tremendous legacy to this House and to this province.", "For New Democrats, he summed it up best when he spoke about the work that we try to do each and every day. Here’s what he said on December 18, 2003, while standing just a few feet from where I am standing right now. He said, “New Democrats are going to work provincially, New Democrats are going to work federally, to fight for those people who need fighting for, to speak for those people who need speaking for, to stand up for those people who need help standing up for themselves and to stand up for those people who have been dumped on, trashed on, shoved aside, marginalized, beaten up on, whacked, for far too long.” No one could have put it better, Speaker.", "Peter knew perfectly well that, even once he was gone, his work would continue, because the people of Ontario still need voices that speak up and people who stand up and aren’t afraid to call “bullspit,” or step up close to the line of what’s allowed.", "Speaker, we have our caucus members today wearing their shirt sleeves in honour of Peter’s favourite uniform here in the Legislature. It’s funny to recall that this irked so much one of the high-standing members of the Liberal caucus at one point in time that she actually was going to try to bring a dress code into Queen’s Park because it so irked her that Peter wore his shirt sleeves every day. So thank you, members of the NDP caucus who are in their shirt sleeves today. It’s quite a funny recollection.", "One of the things that’s true is that Peter had a voracious appetite for knowledge and information. In fact, when I first became leader, he was sitting beside me as my House leader. I would notice every day that he would have the dictionary. I would say, “Why do you have the dictionary, Peter? I’m sure you don’t have to look up the meanings of words. You pretty much know everything about everything.” He said, “Well, Ms. Horwath, I choose one word every day that I don’t know and I use that word for the rest of the day until I know that word and know what it means.” That’s how Peter was expanding his vocabulary day in and day out.", "It’s interesting, because we know that Peter was a voracious consumer of information and knowledge. He was always reading articles, newspapers, various books of precedents and literature. It was quite astounding how much information and knowledge he could take in, anything that his insatiable mind could get a hold of. In fact, the remnants of his intellectual consumption literally littered his office, his home, his apartment and even his car, if people had the opportunity to see the places where Peter consumed information.", "In fact, when I first was elected, Peter offered to drive me home after those night sittings that we used to have back in the day. I said, “Sure, that’s great. Thanks for the offer.” He had a little truck at the time. We were parked under the archways on the east side of the building. I went to get into his car. I opened the door, and I literally ended up with my knees at my chin because there were stacks of articles and paperwork that were on the floor of his truck on the passenger side. That’s what it was like with Peter: two-foot-tall stacks of paper everywhere you went.", "Speaker, if Peter had known how much pleasure his memory would give us, how many times we’d find ourselves chuckling at his antics or cursing the thought of what he managed to get away with or finding ourselves inspired by his wit and his wonderful mind, I have no doubt that he would have flashed that Peter Kormos grin and then he would have told us all, in no uncertain terms, to get back to work, which is a turn on the phrase that was used by the member of the official opposition in his tribute, which is “Liberals don’t want to work.” Right?", "Peter, we’ll miss you like crazy. We want to thank you here in this House for the 23 years of dedicated service that you gave to the people of Ontario. I want to end by actually inviting people here in the Legislature, on all sides of the House, and all guests to come and spend some more time remembering Peter at Hart House, after question period, in the east common room." ],

There is a broad consensus that carbon pricing, such as the cap-and-trade system, is a key tool for reducing greenhouse gases and driving a prosperous, low-carbon, high-productivity economy.", "Ontario’s cap-and-trade program is proposed to begin January 1, 2017, with the first auctions for emission allowances beginning in March 2017, but in order for this to occur, Ontario must have its cap-and-trade regulation in place by June 1, 2016. That’s why it is essential that this bill move through committee. Now, this isn’t to say that debate is not welcomed. That’s exactly why we’ve proposed more than 25 hours of committee time on this motion.

It appears that the rest of his caucus, as we’re seeing today, have their eyes closed. As of today, the general government committee has sat for 10 hours for the purpose of clause-by-clause voting, and the PCs have used every stall tactic in the book to prevent the bill from moving forward. In the first week, the committee spent a third of its time in recesses called by the PCs. Queen’s Park Briefing has said the PCs are “filibustering and making the process as painful as possible.” The member from Huron–Bruce even started reading her own quotes into the record.", "I’d like to thank the NDP for working with the government on this very important piece of legislation, specifically the member for Toronto–Danforth. In fact, when I was parliamentary assistant to a former Minister of the Environment, Mr. John Wilkinson, the member from Toronto–Danforth was very helpful in passing that enabling legislation.

There would be previous members rolling over in their graves today, because we’re debating another time allocation motion. The reason that we are debating the time allocation motion isn’t because of anything that that minister just said; the fact that we’re debating this today is because these guys want us to pass a flawed piece of legislation again, and we’re not going to do it.", "You know, it’s not surprising that the government finds democracy inconvenient, because that’s what this is. We’ve had a near-record use of time allocation by this government in this Parliament. It’s no longer a tool that’s used sparingly to expedite emergency measures. It’s not supposed to be used to shut down debate. It’s not supposed to be used to pass almost every piece of government legislation.", "I know what the members opposite are going to say. They’ll say that climate change—and we just heard it—is a major concern for governments around the world, and, indeed, it is. They’ll say that Canada and Ontario need to do our part, and, indeed, we do. But they won’t address the negligent amount of work that actually went into this bill, and it was, at best, another lacklustre effort by the minister to ram a piece of legislation through that, while obviously well-intentioned, again, is drastically flawed.", "The government is introducing with this bill one of the largest and most complex taxation schemes devised in the history of fiscal policy. All this, the government already knows. The government knows that where these systems are in place they’ve been prone to multi-billion-dollar fraud schemes, and the government knows that when opposition critics were briefed on this bill, they were told that the ministry had no idea how many people would be needed in order to enforce and administer this system. But no problem; we should just pass it as quickly as we can possibly can anyway.", "I can’t tell you—and this is sarcasm—what a comfort it is to the opposition to hear that the government is introducing a scheme that, when it has been implemented elsewhere, is prone to massive fraud, and it has no idea how many people it’s going to need to enforce and administer it.", "In retrospect, I’m nothing short of shocked that the government wasn’t given exactly what they want when it comes to this bill. After all, if it isn’t the responsibility of the opposition to simply hand the government a blank cheque for a massive new taxation scheme that’s prone to fraud, without the necessary oversight to ensure taxpayers aren’t ripped off, well, what exactly is the responsibility of the opposition, Mr. Speaker?", "Then the government recognized that they had put a laughably minimal amount of work into their legislation, and they tried to correct their mistake with about 70 amendments—70; seven zero. In the almost five years that I’ve been in the House, I’ve only once seen a government bill subject to as many as amendments as this one. That’s how unprecedented it is that the government would seek not just to amend the bill at committee, but fundamentally rewrite a bill that will bear no resemblance to the bill that left the House to go to committee in the first place.", "Try to conceive how unbelievable this process actually is. This government managed to take one of the most important legislative initiatives of the session and totally botch it at second reading to the point where bureaucrats had to inform opposition members that they had no idea how it would be administered or enforced. Then, rather than go back and do it again so that we don’t end up with Dr. Frankenstein’s monster trying to regulate carbon output while taxing consumers—doing neither of those two things well and being taken advantage of by people who want to manipulate the system—the government’s solution was to bring 70 bolts to committee to attempt to tighten the monster’s neck.", "Basically, the government showed up, like the kid who did their homework on the morning school bus ride, and complained when members of the opposition parties told them that they had to do it again. Now, there are members of the third party who will say that we’re simply taking a different approach than they are, and that’s true. They believe that they can tighten the bolts in the monster’s neck. They believe that the kid who showed up with the homework they did on the school bus shouldn’t have to learn how to do it better.", "Fundamentally, I don’t trust any bill that this government is going to bring forward. Somebody always ends up paying a price that they didn’t see coming, no matter how well-intentioned the bill is. Somebody always ends up getting a free ride because they wrote the right op-ed or they showed up at the Hyatt on the right night. Somebody always ends up getting a $100 hydro bill who never used hydro that much.", "When the government wants to remove the oversight of the Financial Accountability Officer from a $1.9-billion pot of government money, you’re right: We’re a little bit skeptical on this side of the House. When there’s no transparency on who’s getting investments from that $1.9-billion fund, I get a little more skeptical. After all, this government just collected $400,000 in campaign contributions from companies that they gave subsidies to. When the Financial Accountability Officer comes out and says that he’s concerned by the lack of government transparency when it comes to cap-and-trade, I’m concerned because I was here for the Ornge scandal, and I was here for the gas plant scandal as well.", "We will be subject to an endless parade of government members this afternoon, getting to their feet and telling us how awful climate change is and how they’re the only ones doing anything about it.

What the government is doing here is, the minister is putting forward Bill 172 with a blindfold and a chainsaw on. He’s not getting it right. That’s the duty of the opposition. Some members on the other side don’t understand that, but we do have a duty to make sure that a bill is as good as it can possibly be, and this bill is far from that.", "Rather than debate the amendments in committee, rather than rethink the bill and perhaps reintroduce something with fewer holes than the Ottawa Senators’ goaltending, we have a minister that strolls through the press gallery and vehemently and publicly voices his objections to legitimate democratic opposition. I respectfully submit that if the minister had just done his job right the first time, he might find there was a little less opposition to be found. But no; the minister asserts that the problem isn’t his work; it isn’t his lack of detail or lack of transparency; it’s the fact that other members of the House are objecting to his poor work and to the lack of detail and lack of transparency in the bill.", "So I say to the government: On the basic tenets here, we’re not so far apart. We agree that climate change is a major issue and that something has to be done to combat it. But this is a considerable shift in fiscal policy. It requires a considerable amount of detail and transparency that must be available to the public. Ontarians deserve to know how much is being collected and where it’s going. They deserve to know that the non-partisan officers of the Legislature are able to report on how the government is spending their money.", "It’s also my opinion that if we’re going to assert that polluters, and not consumers, are the problem, then it’s polluters and not consumers who should pay. I know that on that, the minister and I disagree. I believe that this regime should be revenue-neutral, because if it isn’t, it has the potential to have an economically crippling impact on working-class people in Ontario. I believe that a problem caused by polluters isn’t solved by endlessly taxing consumers.", "I’m not going to change Bill 172 to include that; I realize that. The Ontario people would have to change government in order to include that, and that option, unfortunately, isn’t currently available. But I can, as a member of the opposition and as a representative of people, expect and, in fact, demand that the government do better work than we’ve seen on Bill 172 to this point.", "I also want to offer a final cautionary note against the continual and seemingly permanent use of time allocation on government legislation. At some point, people are forced to conclude that this government simply has no interest in what people of certain ridings have to say. At some point, the government is stating that it believes that the House and the committee process exist only to rubber-stamp the government agenda. That’s not why I was sent here. The member from Barrie may have drunk the Kool-Aid, but we were brought here to represent our constituents and point out the problems with government legislation. Or, perhaps, as we heard this morning, the Liberals just don’t want to work and that’s why they’re pushing through legislation as quickly as they can, no matter how many flaws that piece of legislation may have.", "Don’t drink the Kool-Aid.

This government has used it time and time again to jam through bills, to end critical debate and put us in a situation where public consultation and legislative debate has been profoundly limited. In fact, in the past year, I’ve seen more time allocation and limitation on debate than I’ve seen in all the rest of my 10 years here. It’s hard for me to believe that Dalton McGuinty was more open to debate than the current government, but that, frankly, is the record. If in fact time allocation had been used far more sparingly, then one could see, occasionally, that its use, where it was absolutely necessary, would be feasible to justify. It is very difficult to justify time allocation given this government’s habits with time-allocating a bill, really, on almost a whim.", "Speaker, others may speak to the time allocation itself; I’m going to speak to the issues at hand with regard to the bill that we are considering in committee. I have to say that the consideration is proceeding at a glacial rate, without a doubt.", "The bill under consideration, Bill 172, puts in place a cap-and-trade system for the province of Ontario and has some other pieces in that bill that will assist the government—not just this one, but any government elected in Ontario—to move forward on taking action on climate change. Fair enough.", "In committee, the NDP has been pushing for a number of things that need to be in this bill. We have said all along that there needed to be fairness; there needed to be transparency; there needed to be effectiveness. If you look at fairness, there’s no question in my mind that this bill should be allocating a substantial piece of the revenue that comes from cap-and-trade to helping low-income households, northern households and rural households to make the adjustments they’re going to have to make. In California, 25% of the revenue that comes from cap-and-trade is allocated to low-income households. I think that’s fair. I think people whose income is low need to be at the top of the list for the retrofitting of their houses and for the changes in their energy needs, so that they don’t get hit by the higher prices and so that that hit is cut dramatically.", "This government has agreed to some amendments—and I appreciate the fact that they’ve agreed to some—but has not made the commitment to follow California’s lead in making a very substantial commitment to low-income households. When you look at the reality in northern Ontario, where today and for the next few decades it will be substantially cooler than southern Ontario, there should be an allocation to help those households and those families proceed far more quickly to retrofit their homes and cut their bills.", "In northern Ontario—and I’m sure there are a few here who can speak to this—the government’s cuts to the Ontario Northland Transportation Commission have been brutal and devastating.", "They have left the north without the kind of transit by bus and rail that provides an alternative for people in the south when they don’t want to drive their cars. What this government has done is cut the supports to northern Ontario and then said, “On top of that, we’re going to tell you that you have to pay more for transportation”—not at all reasonable or fair, and something that should be addressed for equity, for quality and really for that sense of fairness that people should have about government initiatives. That’s a substantial problem.", "We are very worried about transparency. Those parts of the bill—the most critical parts are to come. One of the things we asked for and were able to get was a transformation. As the bill was originally written, the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change would only have to report every five years on what is actually going on in terms of their climate plan; it now will be on an annual basis. That is a step forward, and I’m appreciative of that.", "But I have to say that the way the greenhouse gas reduction account has been set up in this bill, and the limitations on access by the Financial Accountability Officer, is profoundly worrying. People don’t have to look very far. If we look to Quebec and the use of the green funds in Quebec, the allocation from the green funds to build an oil pipeline in eastern Quebec said to me that this funding is being used totally improperly. The use of those funds to fix the tail assembly on an Air Canada jet: again, totally indefensible.", "Speaker, in order to avoid that kind of playing around with the money, when the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change makes a recommendation as to whether or not to proceed with a particular project, it has to be open and transparent. The criteria have to be clear, and the reporting and evaluation by the minister have to be clear as well.", "Right now, as the bill is written, I’m not seeing the transparency, openness and accountability that will be needed to ensure that those funds are spent properly, and so that the government of the day—of any day—is held accountable. Those are very profound matters for us.", "The last piece I want to address is effectiveness. There are concerns, first of all, about the fact that this government was not willing to put into the bill the climate targets that were incorporated into the Paris agreements on climate, decided on in December. I would say that that would be fundamental. We had a global debate—a global congress of parties—and they came to a formulation that everyone could live with and Canada said it is in favour of. Now this province is out of sync with Canada and the global community. Why on earth would we take that position?", "The targets for cutting our greenhouse gas emissions are very, very meek. When we look at what is happening in Europe, they have set targets over the next few decades that are meant to ensure that the whole of the European Union comes to some common goal. But within that European Union, different states have more ambitious targets. The UK has a target of 55% reductions—55%—by 2030. Denmark is 50% by 2020. What’s happening in that union is that the countries that are industrially more developed and better off are taking on more aggressive targets so that the poorer, less developed countries will not have to push as far; frankly, they wouldn’t be able to push as far.", "We here in Ontario are taking on, really, not quite the targets that the European Union as a whole is taking on. If we’re actually going to get to a world that avoids catastrophic climate change, we have to be far more ambitious than we are. This bill, as currently written and as currently modified in committee, doesn’t take on those aggressive targets. It is not the bill that’s going to be needed to actually meet the UN target to meet the targets set at COP21. That’s a huge problem.", "In terms of the techniques and platforms that are going to be used, which are set out at the end of the bill, there are changes that have to be put in there that, so far, I haven’t seen the government indicating an interest in. So this bill still needs substantial modification for fairness, transparency and effectiveness.", "I have to say to you, Speaker, that we are in a very tough spot as a society. We have let 25 years go by since the discussion in the early 1990s, when it was realized that there had to be very substantial, concerted global action to cut greenhouse gas emissions. They’ve gone up 60% around the world. So the space, the opportunity, to actually avoid a catastrophic impact has shrunk dramatically, and to the extent that we haven’t recognized it, that we don’t recognize it in our legislation and actions, we leave huge problems for the generations coming after us.", "Frankly, given the rate at which change is happening in the world now—and I think the minister referenced this at the beginning of her remarks: the hottest year on record in 2015. If you look at the temperature increases this year, they are in a whole other area, in January, February and March, than we have seen for decades.", "In the past, people said, “We want to do this for our children and our grandchildren.” I think, Speaker, that you and me and everyone in this chamber are going to get to see very dramatic and unpleasant changes in our lifetime. We aren’t going to be in a position where, unethically, we’re leaving it for the next generations. We’re going to have to come to grips with it on our own.", "I believe this bill does have to be modified. I believe that action has to be taken. I have to say I am not at all happy with time allocation, given what this government’s record has been on time-allocating the agenda in this Legislature on an ongoing basis, ignoring, frankly, what’s needed in a democracy." ],

But I can tell you that the real reason why they’re in such a hurry to get this bill done is because they cannot wait—they simply cannot wait—to get their hands on your money. I’m going to talk a little bit about the real reason that Bill 172 is here.", "We would acknowledge that climate change is indeed a very serious challenge that requires a credible plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while protecting the taxpayer and our economy. But we are very concerned that this government will take advantage of the goodwill that the people have shown in respect to climate change. They’re going to take advantage of that goodwill and use it as another opportunity to raid their pocketbooks.", "I can tell you that there is $1.9 billion a year that will come out of the cap-and-trade fund that they continue to tell the public will be used to help lower greenhouse gases. But let me take you on a small tour through their own documents, which will illustrate to you that that indeed is not what they’re using the money for.", "The fall economic statement was the first chance we had to see the depth of money that we’re talking about. Back then, it quoted $1.6 billion being available, but they showed it going right into revenue. That was amazing. It counters everything that they claim this money is for. This was shown right into revenue.", "In fact, I’ll quote from the National Post, November 27: “The document also reveals for the first time how much money the government hopes to raise from a new cap-and-trade scheme that will be phased in in 2016.” At that time, of course, we were with the old numbers. They went on to say: “It expects to raise $300 million that year and $1.3 billion the next.” That, of course, is from the National Post.", "That’s on pages 106 and 107 of the fall economic statement. Let me read you the wording that went along with that, because it says: “A preliminary estimate of the revenues that are expected to arise from the auctioning of cap-and-trade allowances” is $1.6 billion. Only four months later, in the actual 2016 budget, not only did the number rise to $1.9 billion, but again, it went directly into revenue.", "Now, they would be very quick to tell you: “Well, of course. We take that money in, and then we’re going to spend it on greenhouse gas emissions.” So when the actual bill was tabled—and they did the same trick with the Hydro One sale, on Bill 144. If you look—it’s a 67-page bill—on page 65 of that, right down at the bottom on the inside corner is one sentence of Bill 144 that said they can use that money to reimburse themselves for money already spent on transit and infrastructure. That is exactly what’s in this bill. That’s why they want to rush this bill through. That’s why they want closure: so that I can’t stand here and we all can’t stand here and tell the public about the real facts.", "If you look at Bill 172 and you look at page 44 or 45, I believe, you will find—it’s a 56-page bill. If you look at section 68—remember that number, Speaker, section 68, because I’m going to talk about it again in a couple of minutes—it says, under “Authorized expenditures,” that that money from the cap-and-trade fund can be used “to fund, directly or indirectly, costs ... described in schedule 1....” So then you flip to the last page of the book, page 56, and you’ll see schedule 1. It tells you that you can use the money to pay for active transportation infrastructure. That’s public transit vehicles and infrastructure. They list that.", "Then it sends you back to yet another chapter, and that’s where the magic words are. So you can see that it’s a big shell; it’s a big circle. You have to go from A to B to C, all through these things, but all it gets to, again, are a few words, one sentence that tells you, in subsection 3 of section 68 on page 47: the money can be used “to reimburse the crown for expenditures ... directly or indirectly” related to the items that I already mentioned.", "Here we go again. It’s a shell game. They take your money. They tell you that they will buy items that will reduce greenhouse gases, such as public transit vehicles and infrastructure, and then, lo and behold, they put that money in the fund and they’re allowed to pay for items that they already budgeted for. That $130 billion that the Premier announced in 2014 and again in 2015? This $130 billion is exactly what they can spend this money on. They gave themselves a little loophole—one tiny, little sentence that tells you that that’s the real purpose. All of this is so that they can artificially balance their deficit, balance their budget by 2017-18.", "All of the documents that we have—the public accounts, fall economic statement, their budget—show that they cannot balance without that extra revenue. They need the revenue from Hydro One. They can’t hide from it anymore. It’s been proven now that they’re using the Hydro One revenue. Now, by using that exact same sentence, they can use that cap-and-trade money to reimburse money they were already going to be spending on transit vehicles and infrastructure. That’s an absolute fact now.", "It’s funny. We revealed this a couple of weeks ago, and to give it a little credence and a little credibility, the Financial Accountability Officer took it upon himself—he was not asked to; he was not compelled to—to go to the committee hearings on Bill 172and brought up exactly the same fact. He said, on section 68, the section I referred to, that it “may hinder” his “ability to provide you and your fellow members with information on the fiscal impacts of the act ... there could be a case where even if revenues do match expenses there could be an impact on the surplus or deficit of the province. This would occur if some of the expenses were not on new initiatives but were tied to previously planned expenses.”", "The Financial Accountability Officer figured it out; it didn’t take him very long. It didn’t take our caucus very long to figure out as well that just as they did with the Hydro One sale, they had a little clause to allow them quietly to use the money for things they had already budgeted for and use that money that they had already budgeted to lower the deficit. They’ve done it with Hydro One, and now they’re doing it with cap-and-trade.", "That is what this charade is all about. They don’t want us standing here talking about the fact that they’re preying on the goodwill of the public, who want to genuinely do something about the serious issue of climate change. They’re preying on the public to use that as a guise to pay off their deficit, which we all know was accumulated by waste, mismanagement and scandal." ],

Section 347 of the Criminal Code clearly states that if someone charges a criminal interest rate, which is defined as being 60% interest per annum, you can be guilty of an indictable offence that is punishable by up to five years in jail, or through summary conviction with a fine that doesn’t exceed $25,000 or imprisonment that does not exceed six months.", "Despite that, in Ontario, in 2009, the Liberal government placed a cap on payday loans at $21 per $100 loan for two weeks.

They want people who don’t pay their loans, because it doesn’t factor into account late fees, processing fees or compound interest, which also can be accrued. This is literally preying on the vulnerable.", "It’s important to note—a councillor from Hamilton raised this issue—that if you look at the communities where payday loan companies are set up, if you look at where they’re located, it’s in a lower-economic portion of the city. There was some research done by the Social Planning and Research Council of Hamilton. They looked at the community and looked at this lower-income part of the community in the lower city and they found—this report was reported in February 2016, so this year—that over the past 10 years, in the lower city and the lower socio-economic portion of the city, there was almost 20% fewer banks, so access to financial institutions that offer reasonable loans and give you access to finances in a manner that does not exploit you, or not to the same extent, at least, that payday loans do. There were 20% fewer financial institutions like banks, but there were 32% more payday loan businesses in this lower socio-economic part of the community. So there are 32% more of these predatory companies and 20% fewer regular banking financial institutions.", "It’s clear, if you do a Google search, if you look at where you can locate payday loans, generally speaking, in any community, if you look at a city and look at where the folks who are hard hit and who are vulnerable live, you’ll find that’s where the consolidation or the concentration of payday loan companies is. They literally are designed to prey off people, to prey off not anybody but the people who are the most vulnerable.", "On top of that—this is the part that really irks me, that really troubles me in society—it’s folks who actually need lower interest rates who have to pay the highest interest rates. If you are financially secure, you have a good-paying job, you have assets and you have resources, you are offered very reasonable loans. In fact, it’s not hard to get loans that are close to the prime rate. You can get prime rate interest, and sometimes less than prime rate if you secure it with your home. You can end up paying interest rates, per annum, that are hovering around 1%. That’s not unreasonable if you have assets and you have wealth, and maybe even less than that.", "People who have money and people who have assets have access to affordable rates of interest. People who don’t have money, who are struggling to pay their bills, who don’t have property or a home in their own name are forced to pay loans with interest rates that are 500%. It’s just unimaginable. But what does this bill do to address that?", "The bill addresses three components. It looks at collection and debt settlement services, it addresses consumer protection and it addresses payday loans. In the consumer services component, it looks at cashing government cheques. There’s also a component that deals with rent-to-own and paying loans in instalments. The final component, which talks about payday loans, does not address this cap issue at all.", "This could have been a great opportunity to address this outrageous cap, which needs to be addressed.

If you have driven around Quebec, even in the lower socio-economic parts of the city—for example, the city of Montreal or Quebec City—you’ll notice something. Or you’ll notice something that’s not there. There aren’t any payday loan companies, and you’re probably curious. Why is that? Why aren’t there any payday loan companies in Quebec? In Ottawa, cross the river and you’re in Gatineau. Why is it that they can exist in Ontario, but they don’t exist across the river? What’s so different across that one little river?", "I’ll tell you what’s different. The Quebec government imposed a restriction. Their equivalent consumer protection ministry imposed a requirement that they will not issue licences to any payday loan companies that charge interest rates higher than 35% per annum. Guess what happened?", "Thirty-five per cent is still a quite a high interest rate; it’s quite lucrative. If someone offered me a chance to make 35% interest off my investment, I would jump at it; that’s a pretty great investment. But there are no payday loan companies operating in Quebec. There’s no one there offering 35%. They can’t operate on that already extremely high interest rate, because they need to operate on these predatory rates of 500% or 600% for them to be economically viable. That, in and of itself, should say something about this industry. If they can’t exist in a province that has put in a 35% cap, or they don’t want to exist in that province—whatever the case—then there’s clearly something wrong with this industry. If they cannot operate in Quebec at a 35% cap, that means there’s something wrong, and we should be looking to Quebec for leadership on this and implementing something similar.", "I want to give a shout-out to our member from Parkdale–High Park, who has been a champion on this. She has introduced a number of bills on this issue of payday loans going back to 2007, when she raised this issue. In fact, I was just reading a colleague from Niagara Falls’s excerpts from the late, great Mr. Kormos, who raised this issue in Parliament as well. He also credited our member from Parkdale–High Park for her great work in championing this.", "That was back in 2007, more than nine years ago. This issue was raised nine years ago. Nine years ago, the member from the New Democratic Party raised concerns around capping this industry and addressing the fact that this is a predatory form of providing financial resources—financial loans—and it’s not acceptable.", "As a province, people might say, “Well, if the consumer is using this product, that means there’s an interest in this product.” In fact, with the Criminal Code that speaks to the criminal rate—that’s 60% or higher—you would think, then: Why aren’t these payday loan companies being charged with a criminal offence if it’s against the law, if there’s a criminal offence of charging rates of more than 60%?", "Well, it’s because there is an exemption. The federal government placed an exemption that these sorts of companies, payday loan companies, are exempt from that Criminal Code section. They are not subject to that section. They can charge interest rates, again, upwards of hundreds of percentile points and they’re exempt. What they’ve required is that the provinces—they actually noted in a report that there seems to be an interest—payday loan companies are growing—there seems to be a consumer interest in this.", "Mr. Speaker, this is not consumer interest; this is desperation. We have to be able to distinguish between people who are down and out, who are desperate because they can’t afford to pay their next bill and who are willing to take interest rates of 500% plus. If they’re doing that, they’re not doing it because it’s economically sound. It’s not fiscally responsible. It doesn’t make any sense. They’re doing it because they’re desperate.", "If those companies are growing, contrary to what that report stated—that the consumer is interested in this product—the reality is that consumers are desperate. What we should be doing is finding ways for those folks to have access to more affordable forms of credit, if they need credit. More importantly, we need to find ways to ensure that they’re out of poverty and are not reliant on these types of predatory loans. That’s what we need to be doing.", "What does the bill prescribe that’s positive? Let’s talk about some of the positive points of this bill, because in fairness, there are some important points that are raised by it.", "With respect to the Collection and Debt Settlement Services Act portion, the first component of the bill, it seeks to make some changes around collection and debt settlement services.", "One component that I raise as a positive component is that the bill allows for penalties to be applied if someone violates the regulations under collection services. So if there is some impropriety in the way people are conducting their duties, having a penalty that can be assigned—on the surface of it, it may seem like a positive thing, to deter people. But there’s always a catch with the Liberal government. A penalty is important to be able to sanction certain behaviour, but it’s the manner in which this penalty is administered. We’ve seen this government time and time again not preferring the ability to have your day in court, not preferring the ability to have your evidence heard, have an arbiter make a decision, be able to call defence, be able to call evidence, have the prosecution be able to call their case and have the defence be able to mount their defence.", "The way in which these penalties are going to be administered strips people of this important right, and it’s a trend. This is a trend that’s also something we’re seeing in terms of how these administrative penalties are being brought into the traffic court, into the Highway Traffic Act.", "This, as a policy directive, is very troubling. It’s fundamentally important that people have their day in court. Whether there’s someone who’s not very sympathetic, like someone who is a debt collector—that’s not someone who normally inspires a lot of sympathy, but if they have violated a regulation, if they’ve done something improper, they are entitled to have their day in court to ensure that justice is served.", "Contrary to what the government talked about earlier today, when they talked about how, with election rule changes, it’s about the content, the process is the hallmark of just societies. The process is fundamentally important. That we have a process that’s transparent, that’s fair and that allows for both parties in an adversarial system to bring forward their arguments, that’s very fundamentally important. Whether we’re talking about a penalty that’s applied in a case that’s probably not the most sympathetic case—a debt collector—whether it’s someone who has been charged with a speeding ticket, or whether it’s the way we come up—and this is a very important element—with election reform in this province, it’s the process that’s fundamentally important.", "That’s why when we talk about having a process, when it comes to election reform, that is transparent, that is non-partisan, that involves some independence, some elements which—I give credit to Bill Davis for the way he brought about changes to the Election Act, and election reform in general. He brought forward an independent panel that involved an independent chair and non-partisan members of the law society. Those are the hallmarks of a just, transparent and fair process. That is, at the minimum, what we would expect when we’re talking about election reform.", "In this circumstance, it may not garner a lot of attention, but it’s a trend that’s troubling, and we have to be sure that we don’t allow this type of process to move forward, that we don’t allow this type of usurping of the right to trial, as a broader policy, to be expanded. That’s why we have to stop it at this point.", "Beyond that, there are some troubling components of this. While the idea of a sanction is good, the manner in which the sanction is being proposed is bad. But in addition, for some reason, the government is exempting a number of organizations or institutions from the regulations that govern collection services. I don’t understand why the government is doing that.", "For example, under this proposed bill, the government is seeking to exempt a number of players. An authorized foreign bank would be excluded from the regulations for collection agencies. Someone who purchases debt through acquiring or merging with a business in a transaction that includes the transfer of accounts receivable—again, why would this exemption be proposed? It only weakens the protections that are outlined that were supposed to protect consumer from impropriety, from aggressive behaviour on the phone, from sometimes very demeaning experiences that I’m sure some of your constituents have told you about. We don’t want people to be subject to that. It’s inappropriate, from my perspective, that there are these exemptions that allow certain companies, or certain institutions or certain entities, to no longer be covered by these regulations.", "Again, my question to the government is, why? Why are you exempting a number of entities or institutions? To me, it doesn’t make any sense. You would think that you would want to bolster protection, that you’d want to ensure that the regulations that protect people from these types of behaviours that we don’t want people to be engaging in—that collection services regulations should apply to any entity that’s engaging in that activity. Why would you exempt anyone? To me, that doesn’t make any sense. I look forward to the government providing some explanation for that, but I don’t see any reason for it. In fact, what it does is weaken the oversight of these companies, and it weakens the protection for the consumer. I would like to know why certain entities are being exempted. That’s something that, to me, doesn’t make sense.", "There was a regime that was initiated such that people who are debt collectors, who are engaged in collection services, must be registered. This bill seeks to remove that licensing regime. I don’t see how that benefits the consumer. Requiring collection agencies to be registered would ensure that there are some accountability mechanisms, so removing that requirement, to me, is weakening protection of the consumer. Again, I’m concerned with why that’s being proposed and how that strengthens or protects the consumer. Again, I submit, Mr. Speaker, that it doesn’t protect the consumer and, in fact, it weakens protection.", "We’ve talked about this, but again, the introduction of an administrative monetary penalty regime—this is a regime that this government is moving to, more and more. This is something that is unacceptable. It is something that’s offensive to the concept of the rule of law, and it is something that we need to soundly reject as a policy.", "There are some very minor, specific circumstances where people might stomach the notion of administrative monetary penalties. Some of those areas that people don’t have particular ire about are maybe parking tickets. Maybe a parking ticket could be so benign, if it’s a minor fee.", "But then sometimes we have scenarios where you’re potentially liable to pay $100 or $500 for a very egregious parking violation. I think people should be able to mount some sort of defence in those circumstances because the cost is so high. You wouldn’t hire a lawyer, perhaps, but at least you’d be able to mount your own defence in those circumstances. But the convention should be that we do not support administrative monetary penalties as a regime. It is not consistent with the rule of law. It’s not consistent with having your right to a trial.", "There’s another general trend that this government is engaging in, and that trend is that instead of putting forward the substance of the law in the legislation, the government is preferring to put all the actual substance into regulation. Let me give you an example: There is a great issue raised on the cashing of government cheques. There really should not be a significant fee associated with that. If you’re going to cash a government cheque, there is a lot of confidence that that cheque is a solid financial instrument. You know there’s going to be someone who’s going to pay that amount." ],

  "text" : [ "There is a significant signature on these cheques. Whether it’s provincial, municipal or federal, that’s a very serious institution that’s backing it up. That’s a government, so you can rest assured that there will be backing of that instrument. So the idea of regulating the amount that’s charged makes a lot of sense. There should be some limitation. It shouldn’t be the case that people are having to pay astronomical fees to cash a cheque which is pretty secure and there’s really no risk involved.", "But here’s the catch again. The government mentions that there should be limits, and some of the suggestions are that some of these proposed solutions may include a fixed amount, a percentage of the face value, a combination of a fixed amount and a percentage, or “any amount determined by any other prescribed means.” Basically, there is nothing in the bill that says what you’re actually going to do. It just says you’re going to do something. So when we vote on this particular component of the bill, we’re voting on the government saying, “Hey, we’re going to put some limit in.”", "What’s that limit? How is that limit going to be set? What limit is that going to be? Is it going to be a percentage? Is it going to be a fixed amount? Is it going to be a combination or something else? We don’t know, because the way the bill is written, it doesn’t say. It could be any one of those. It could be one. It could be A, B, C or none of the above and a totally different one. That’s the way the bill is written, which again to me is probably not the best way to bring legislation forward, because how can we effectively debate the bill? We don’t really know.", "It’s a trend that’s going on that we’re allowing things to be in regulation. Now, the case for regulation is that there are certain things that fluctuate, there are certain things that are uncertain, and having the flexibility, having the nimbleness of having an option that allows for changes in regulation—sure, it could be an option. But when the entire premise of the bill, or this component or this portion of the bill, is to say, “We are going to put a limitation in place,” but you don’t say how, how do you expect anyone to provide input? We could suggest, “Hey, a percentage is a good idea,” but in terms of voting for this, as it stands it’s difficult to do so. It’s a good idea: We should put a limit. I’m saying I could vote in favour of the idea of putting a limit, but it’s difficult when you don’t provide the actual limit or even a notion of which of the four options it’s going to be. That’s an important issue.", "Now, another component of this bill which, again, is a positive idea but isn’t really fleshed out is that it introduces the notion that if you’re cashing a government cheque, you would require the supplier to provide the customer with mandatory information regarding the cashing of the cheque. Great. Now, what would be that mandatory information, Mr. Speaker? You’re probably wondering, right? We should know what mandatory information the government is requiring the institution to provide. Guess what? It’s left to regulation. The nature, the content, all of that is to be disclosed, is to be determined, is to be announced. Again, we could provide some ideas and say, “Listen, at the minimum you should know what the amount is, why that amount is being charged. You should understand what amount is actually a cost, in terms of a processing cost, and what amount is the profit component”—getting a sense of that. Maybe some sort of disclosure that there are other options for you to cash this cheque where you aren’t going to be charged—you could take it to a bank, for example—maybe some sort of notification that, “Hey, even though you don’t have a bank account, there are other places that will cash this cheque for free. But if you want to do it here, you can still go ahead and do it.” Those are some suggestions off the top of my head.", "This is a bill that you’ve introduced, as a government, and presumably it’s going to go to second reading, and there’s going to be a vote, and you’re going to say, “Hey, can you vote for this bill?” So we’re essentially voting for—“Yes, we believe in the mandatory statement. What’s in that statement?” “We don’t know. We’ll get back to you on it.” It’s a little weird. It’s difficult to conduct a Legislature that way, when you don’t really provide the substance.", "To some extent, there is some consultation going on now with respect to the cashing of the government cheques. There is some suggestion around what the amount should be. There are some ideas being floated. That’s good. I’m hoping the government would make a very clear announcement and say, “These are some of the regulations we’re proposing. If you vote for this bill, this is roughly where we’re going with regulations.” That would be helpful, but what would be more helpful is if, in terms of a general trend, we put more of the substance of the bill in the legislation. Their argument is, “Well, it’s not very nimble. If we need to change it, we’ll have to bring in new legislation.” Maybe that’s not such a bad idea. When you bring legislation forward, it allows for input from the House and it allows for scrutiny. There’s really a lot to be said for scrutiny; that’s what we want to see more of. Accountability, transparency—these are issues that the people of Ontario are concerned about. They’ve seen that this government isn’t very accountable, isn’t very transparent, doesn’t really like to make decisions that are open for people to actually take a look at. It likes to make very closed decisions.", "Another example is election reform. You have all the political parties of the province coming together to say—we’re not saying to listen to our opinion. We’re not saying, “Hey, do it the way we’re saying.” We’re saying, let’s make this non-partisan. The process through which we change laws in this land shouldn’t be partisan.", "You’ve been elected to make decisions around health care, and you’re deciding to make cuts to health care. That’s your decision, and you have a mandate to make those cuts. We oppose that; we think it’s not appropriate. But you have a right to, obviously, make those decisions. You are deciding to make laws that continually cut the benefits that people receive when it comes to auto insurance. You’re making laws that continually cut the benefits people receive and encourage greater profits for the insurance industry—lower costs, greater insurance profits and higher premiums. You’re not bringing the premiums down. Again, you have the mandate to make decisions. We disagree with your decisions, but you’ve been elected to make those decisions—absolutely. But there is something very different about policy decisions when it comes to health care, when it comes to auto insurance and when it comes to the way you govern the province, and the way our election rules are set out. That’s a very different issue. Election rules should be defined and should be set out in a way that’s truly non-partisan because they’re going to impact all parties and they’re going to fundamentally impact democracy.", "When people get up and say, “It’s democratic to let things go to committee”—it is a part of the democratic process, but it’s not a very democratic way to deal with electoral reform when you have a government that’s in majority and when you have a committee that’s in majority. It doesn’t allow for true independence or a true consensus-based decision-making process. That’s why the process is so fundamentally important. That’s why transparency and openness is so important. That’s why the government should consider putting more of the substance of the bill into the legislation, as opposed to leaving everything to regulation.", "I’m sure some of you were worried that I wasn’t going to connect it back to the bill, but I’m sure you’ve seen how I’ve done that.", "The next part of this bill talks about the rent-to-own scenarios. Again, we need to look at the realities of who is being impacted and who is making use of these services, and then look at the laws that we’re going to apply to them. I’m sure you can look at your constituents: Rent-to-own scenarios are mostly impacting people who are of a lower socio-economic background. If you can afford to purchase something or you can afford to rent a place that’s fully furnished, you would choose to do so. The folks who are renting to own often are folks who are in more of a difficult situation.", "As legislators, we have a responsibility to make sure that they’re not being exploited, and that’s where it’s important for the government to make sure that we look at the realities of who is being impacted by this.", "Again, going back to the first point where we talked about the government report that had the audacity to say that it looks like payday loans are increasing and flourishing; that means people are choosing to use payday loans. That’s not the reality. That’s someone who has put blinders on and not looked at—if people are using more food banks, it doesn’t mean people want to use more food banks; that means they’re poor and desperate, and life is difficult. It doesn’t mean people are choosing to use a food bank. It’s something that is a last resort.", "Similarly, if people are using more payday loans, it’s not because that’s their financial institute of choice; it’s because they have nowhere else to go. So, similarly, when we look at rent-to-own, we need to make sure that we analyze whether this is an option for people who have expendable income and are deciding, “Hey, it’s in my benefit right now not to actually purchase something outright, and I’m benefiting from the option of renting it,” or is it actually going to exploit people who are going to pay twice, triple, quadruple the actual cost of that item because they couldn’t afford to buy it outright, and they’re having to rent to own it?", "This is where we need to be legislators and step in and ensure that people are not being exploited and not making choices based on desperation, instead of making choices based on their free will or their actual, genuine free choice.", "There are components of this portion of the bill that are very positive. There is a component of this bill that requires a full disclosure of what the costing is. That’s a positive thing. That’s something that we want to see. We want people to be able to look at the full cost over the lifetime and say, “Hey, if I bought this outright, it would cost me $1,000, but if I rent to own it, I’m going to end up spending $5,000. Maybe I don’t need to rent to own this thing or maybe I shouldn’t rent to own it because that’s pretty crazy for me to spend five times the cost.” People need to know that, and it’s important to have that disclosure.", "Now, you’re wondering, “Are the details of that cost disclosure in this bill? Are the exact components of what the cost disclosure is going to look like in this bill?” Surprise, surprise, Mr. Speaker, they’re not again. Those are going to be, again, left to regulation, and the details are going to be left to regulation. In fact, in this case, the way they’re framed is that it allows the Lieutenant Governor in Council to have control over certain key terms of the lease. It is important to note, though, that they are not required to take action.", "These are the following areas that the Lieutenant Governor in Council has the power to impact, but it’s not, in any way, guaranteeing that there will be any sort of guidance or leadership on this or some sort of requirement. It’s going to allow for the option of taking action on providing a grace period for late payments, limiting the penalty amount for late payments, governing the type of information that may be displayed around a leasable good, restricting the rights of seizure and termination rights and allowing for reinstatement—for example, changing one’s mind.", "These are always examples of areas that regulations may address, but, again, it’s not clear if they will be addressed or not. That’s, again, the major problem with leaving everything to regulation. It leaves a great deal of uncertainty, and we are unable to make an assessment of what we’re actually voting on. What are we actually supporting in this legislation? These are some concerns that I want to raise at this stage.", "There is also a component of this bill that touches on instalment loans. When you make a loan and have the option for instalments, this will allow for some governance around what those agreements can look like. Again, a positive thing—great. We want to ensure that the government makes sure that these types of loan arrangements are not going to exploit people and that they’re going to be fair.", "I’m just going to give you a sense of what the bill tries to do. It’s going to prohibit lenders “from entering into a credit agreement with a borrower if the amount of the credit to be ... lent under the agreement exceeds the prescribed amounts....” What is the prescribed amount? We don’t know, because it’s a prescribed amount. It’s going to be left to regulation.", "The problem, again, is that we don’t know what that regulation is going to look like, and that’s a weakness in terms of allowing various members in this House, particularly the opposition, to provide scrutiny. What if the prescribed amount is not good?", "Right now, we’re in public debate. The public can come and watch in this House or from home. Hansard allows for everything to be displayed in relatively real time. By the end of the day, they’ll be able to see the debate, so people can take a look at what’s going on, if they choose to. It allows for public scrutiny, it allows for scrutiny from the opposition, and it allows that bill to be brought into this House and to be debated and discussed. But when you leave everything to regulation, it doesn’t allow for that same level of scrutiny, it doesn’t allow for that debate, it doesn’t allow for that discussion and, again, it doesn’t allow for transparency and openness.", "I’ll be honest with you: That’s the main concern that people—or one of the main concerns. People are concerned about some other issues, perhaps the mismanagement of funds, perhaps what people are calling—I’m not saying this myself—corruption in this government.

This is where we really need to look at what can be done.", "First and foremost, I think the immediate step is looking at the province of Quebec. What they’ve done is implemented a strong cap on payday loan companies. Let’s go there; let’s go to a strong cap that makes it very clear that in this province, it’s not acceptable for people to be exploited by 500%-plus—even higher than that—interest rates. That is not acceptable in our province. Let’s make that a statement, loud and clear.", "This bill does not include any caps. This bill does not have a cap on the amount that people can charge in terms of interest rates. Instead, let’s work towards making it more accessible for people to have access to affordable interest, looking at ways to make it more accessible—to have access to credit unions, to have access to financial institutions that are in communities, instead of having what we’ve seen in Hamilton and other communities, where there’s been a marked growth of payday loan companies in lower socio-economic parts of the city at the cost of a reduction of actual good financial institutions that provide more accessible and more reasonable levels of interest. Let’s reverse that trend and make it easier for people to access those funds.", "More importantly, let’s take people out of that desperate scenario where they need to access these outrageous types of loans that put people deeper into poverty. Some people might make the argument that this is choice. People who are poor need to be able to have access to credit, and that’s the only form of credit available to them. If a form of credit is going to put you into worse poverty, that is not a real choice. That is not a choice that makes your life any better. That is something we should not be allowing or condoning in our province. So first and foremost, I think our position should be, let’s put a hard cap that precludes people from being exploited. It’s literally outrageous that the rates are so high, so let’s put that in place. Quebec has done it. If they can do it, there’s really no reason why we can’t do it, so let’s look at that. That’s the first step.", "Secondly, when it comes to the actual—oh, let me give you another example. The Ottawa Business Journal had an article on May 24, 2013, by Michael Prentice. The title of the article is “The True Price of Payday Loans.” The bill is looking at what the true cost of these loans really is. What is the true cost? In the article, he came up with the amount of the annual interest, which is 546%. If it’s $21 per $100 amount for two weeks, that’s 546% annual interest.", "He compared it to pawnbrokers. Pawnbrokers are restricted to a 60% per annum interest rate. They are restricted to what’s within the criminal rate of interest. If it exceeds 60%, that’s a criminal rate of interest. That’s what our society has decided. So pawnbrokers are restricted to 60%. They are restricted to stay within the criminal, so they are no longer criminal. They are actually right on the line. Why is it that we can restrict pawnbrokers in terms of their interest and we cannot do so for payday loan companies? I think the case is there for us to do that. That’s one.", "Secondly, what does this bill allow us to do? The bill looks at some of the issues around payday loans. One of the issues is repeat payday loans. People who are in a cycle of poverty get one loan to try to pay off a bill, maybe find a way to pay that loan back, and then have to take out another loan right away. Again, there’s a vast difference between free choice and a choice made out of desperation that is actually harmful and hurtful to your financial position.", "The bill talks about restricting replacement or repeat payday loans. The way the bill is crafted, it allows for the government to redefine the number of days the lender must wait since the borrower has paid in full the outstanding balance under the first agreement. Now, they can redefine the number of days. As it is currently, the status quo is that they must wait at least seven days. This component of the bill allows the government to come up with an increased amount of time perhaps and say, “Okay, we will make them wait longer than seven days,” and say they have to wait 10 days, a month or two months.", "The point is that this is a stopgap measure. This is not a significant way to address the real problems people are facing. This is important in the sense that people do engage in repeat loans and it puts people into a deeper cycle of poverty, but it’s not really addressing the real issue here.", "There are other components of the bill that allow the minister, again, to make regulations that address things like prohibiting the lender from entering into more than the prescribed number of payday loan agreements with the same borrower in a one-year period. So the number of loans that someone can engage in is being potentially limited by the minister, which could be seen as a positive step in terms of protecting. They can prohibit a loan broker from facilitating more than the prescribed number of payday loan agreements between the same borrower and different lenders in a one-year period, and prohibit licensees from offering or providing prescribed goods and services other than payday loans to anyone. It is unclear what these goods or services will be; they could be anything like a gift card, for example.", "All of these prohibitions are incremental steps in terms of providing protection. They are incremental steps in providing some level of, I guess, a limit to which someone would fall into these predatory loans. But it doesn’t address the actual crux of the problem. Limiting the number of loans, limiting the time between one loan and another loan, limiting the number of institutions that loans can be prescribed to: These are all, again, just kind of ancillary issues to the main issue, which is that the problem people are facing is poverty, the problem that people are facing is predatory interest rates, and none of this really gets to the heart of those problems.", "We raised an issue—and this is speaking to the nature of the problem when it comes to this industry—that people were receiving gift cards around Christmastime. I’m sure you’ll remember this. What was happening was that payday loan companies were taking those gift cards and providing half of whatever the value was. So if the gift card was $50, the payday company was saying, “We will give you $25 on that.”", "Looking at that scenario, on an emotional level, people started to think—I mean, these are people who are down and out. They’re looking at this gift card and saying, “Hey, listen, I can’t even use this gift card. There’s no sense in me going out and buying fancy clothes when I can’t even afford to eat food. Let me go and return this and get some money off of it.” The fact that the amount that they were taking was half, 50% of the value when someone was to turn that in, rubbed people the wrong way. People started to feel it was just outrageous that that’s the amount people were taking. What people realized is that that’s inappropriate. There was great media attention on this issue, and that practice stopped.", "That’s an offensive thing, and people were offended by it, but we should feel even more offended that people are being charged this astronomical rate of interest. That should be something that should offend each and every one of us. It should offend us that people, knowing how bad it is, still go to these institutions. We really need to look at what are some real, creative, innovative ways that we can make financial resources available to people who are in difficult circumstances. That’s what we really should be looking at.", "We should be looking at ways to uplift people out of poverty, like having a minimum wage that’s a livable wage. We should look at ways to ensure that people can get good-paying jobs. We should look at ways to take people out of poverty so that they’re not left to these difficult situations.", "We should also look at ways that we can make life more affordable. We should look at, when we look at home heating and how expensive it is, ways to make it more accessible for people to obtain high-efficiency appliances, but more importantly, to insulate their homes. We talk sometimes about reducing the costs by reducing a component of a bill, a percentage of a bill, taking a certain tax off. If we actually looked at the savings that someone could enjoy if they were able to retrofit their home—one, it’s better for the environment, but two, if you look at the cost reductions of simply providing someone with better insulation—in low-income communities, where people are struggling, if they were able to have better insulated homes, that could actually save their home heating bills a 20% or 30% cost, just by having a home that’s better insulated.", "Making those types of programs more available, having innovative ideas around using the existing infrastructure in a home—there is heating available from the sun that hits the roof and there are ways to use that heating to actually heat the home, but it’s something that’s not accessible to most people because they don’t have the resources to do it. Making sure that we look at ways to make life more affordable, that we can reduce their costs, that we can increase their ways of earning, we can increase minimum wage, like I’ve said: These are things that we need to look at if we really want to address the root cause of payday loans.", "The root cause, again, is inequality. The root cause is poverty. The root cause is unfairness. We should do more to ensure that there is more fairness, and we can, we absolutely can. This bill just scratches the surface and talks in kind of a meandering way around the root issues. It talks about issues around the root causes of why people are actually accessing these loans. It looks at some of the disclosure of the loans, it looks at some of the restrictions in terms of how many, when and where, but it doesn’t look at why—why are people actually accessing these loans? That’s really the main problem with this bill. That’s why it’s missing the boat or missing the real opportunity that this bill had.", "There are some other issues that the bill talks about, and they give us some concern. One component is that the bill restricts third-party loan agreements. In these scenarios, this example is if a borrower enters into a third payday loan agreement within 62 days of their first payday loan agreement, the lender is required to ensure a number of conditions are fulfilled. They have to ensure that the term of the third payday loan agreement is at least 62 days so that they ensure that there is that gap that’s been established. Secondly, the agreement provides that the borrower is required to repay the advance and the cost of borrowing to the lender in the prescribed number of instalments and at the prescribed times.", "Again, while it is looking at providing more protection in the case of third payday loan agreements, the problem is that, for us to provide a really detailed analysis about whether this is actually going to be effective, we need to know what are the prescribed number of instalments and what are the prescribed times. Those details are not within the bill.", "There are a number of other regulation-changing opportunities that the bill provides, allowing the Lieutenant Governor in Council to make certain regulation changes. Some of the notable ones are requiring the lender to consider the prescribed factors with respect to a borrower before making a payday loan agreement. This is, again, looking at some of the scenarios around why people are going to a payday loan company. So it requires lenders to consider the prescribed factors. What are those factors? Are they going to look into whether or not this person has the means to pay back the loan, or whether this loan would put them into a financially worse position or will it actually improve them? What are the prescribed factors?", "It prevents a lender from entering into more than the prescribed number of payday loan agreements with the same borrower. What, again, are the prescribed number of payday loan agreements? If the payday loans were at a reasonable interest rate, maybe we would say that there is no limit; that if it’s a reasonable amount of interest, someone could be able to make that decision on their own. The reason why we’re actually limiting this is because it’s such an astronomical, predatory interest rate.", "Again, the party has done a lot of work around this. I first have to give a lot of credit to our member from Parkdale–High Park, who introduced numerous bills on this issue, starting back in 2007. I myself also introduced a motion in this House that would allow for a number of components. One of the things that I included was ensuring that a database was established to ban rollover loans. Rollover loans really exploit people. We need to ensure that there is a database around that and that there is tracking around that.", "Another component that I talked about, and maybe we should get into some detail around this, is that people are accessing payday loan companies because that’s the only option they have. In my motion, I talked about ensuring that the government works with financial institutions to provide alternative services, for example credit unions, and the idea of postal banking in low-income communities. So there are other ways that we can provide opportunities for financial services in communities that are low-income. There are other forms of services that can be established so that people don’t have to go to payday loans. It is incumbent on the government, if we want to address poverty in a meaningful way, that we come up with some strategies that are not just literally Band-Aids to the existing problem. There’s a problem of payday loan companies and people are using them. Let’s put a Band-Aid on it by regulating it.", "Mr. Kormos had a quote around this: that you can’t regulate poverty; you need to uplift people out of poverty. These are all attempts and steps to regulate the conditions and scenarios around poverty. They’re not ways of actually uplifting people out of these desperate situations. What can we do to do that? That’s what this bill really needs to speak to, and this bill doesn’t address that. That’s what we really need to have a discussion about: What can we do as a government to ensure that people have access to resources?", "There’s a great program that I had the opportunity to visit myself. It’s called CEE and it’s based out of the east part of Toronto—a shout-out to CEE, if anyone is listening from CEE. You do phenomenal work. I was really impressed by the work that you do there. One of the projects that they do at CEE is they offer micro-financing or small loans to students who come into their program to give them a chance to start up their own company. What they do with that start-up capital: Is they learn how to start up a company; they’re mentored with other folks; they work on projects—they’re given a small amount to work on a particular project; they learn how to budget; and they learn how to execute a plan.", "With this modern environment that we’re moving into in terms of this new information- and technology-based economy, we have an amazing opportunity. I was in Australia, and Australia has far less access to broadband and to high-quality Internet than we do. We complain that, in Ontario, we sometimes don’t have the best access, and in the north, we have absolutely abysmal access. People are still using dial-up and don’t have access to broadband. But most major cities in the south of Ontario all have excellent access to Internet.", "In Australia, major, fully developed cities—not in rural communities, not in the north, not in the centre where they have the massive desert—don’t actually have broadband Internet. We have infrastructure here which would allow us to be leaders in the world when it comes to information technology, if we provided opportunities to young people and entrepreneurs and gave them opportunities to start up their entrepreneurial endeavors.", "We have a government that’s providing funding without disclosing the list, without disclosing the reasoning, to companies that don’t need any funding. We have some suggestions that there’s a pay-to-play scenario going on, where certain companies that are donating are being provided with funding or provided with grants.", "Instead of that scenario, where the government is providing resources to folks who don’t need it, they could provide a scenario where we provide resources to people who need it. They could actually use those resources to engage in meaningful employment. They could engage in developing some sort of innovative technology. They could engage in starting up a company. These are things that we could do that would reduce the need for people going out to get a loan from a payday loan company.", "There are things that we could do. There are innovative ways that we can approach this problem. It takes some broader vision about what our goals are, and it requires really addressing the problem and not just trying to do something that sounds good, that looks like you’re addressing the issue. On the surface, the government can say, “We’re going to address some of the issues around cashing government cheques. We’re going to address some of the issues around payday loan companies.” But are you really substantially doing something about it? This is a great opportunity to address some problems, but you’re not.", "Anyway, back to CEE: CEE provides resources to at-risk youth, provides opportunities to at-risk youth and provides them with a way to get out of the cycle of poverty, so that they don’t require payday loans and they don’t require making decisions out of desperation. Those are the types of things that we need to see more of.", "When I look in the city of Brampton, in terms of where the locations of payday loans are, I see that they’re all concentrated in the areas of our community which are less well-off, less developed and where people have less opportunities. It’s very stark. It’s very obvious that this is a business that is thriving in areas where people are not doing so well. That’s why it’s so important for us to do all we can to ensure that those people are protected.", "It’s often said that the people who don’t need protection seem to have all the protection in the world, that people who don’t need resources seem to have access to all the resources in the world, that people who don’t need help seem to get all the help. It’s really the responsibility of legislators to reverse that trend and see who needs help—let’s help them; who actually needs access to resources—let’s give them that access; and who can benefit from assistance—let’s ensure that they receive the assistance. That’s our responsibility. That’s what we’re elected to do, and that’s what we should be doing with this opportunity.", "It’s been a pleasure, Mr. Speaker, to address this assembly on this issue, and I thank you for the time." ],

The outcome of that was the eventual demise of that organization. That organization, because I was asked to help wind it down, could not even get a meeting with the NDP minister of consumer affairs to talk about this issue. There were two companies in those days that were involved in those types of loans, and we asked as a consumer organization that rollover loans be controlled and that predatory pricing be controlled, along with a whole bunch of issues. We couldn’t even get a meeting because we were told the government of the day could do a better job, and they did absolutely nothing.", "I’ll tell you, it was pretty infuriating.

Whenever I hear that word “micromanaging,” I automatically think of red tape and what red tape is involved in this. Of course, one of the things that we’re very concerned about, and we’ve heard this many, many times, is that the devil’s in the details. We might suggest that maybe the devil’s right across from us, but it’s in the details, and we don’t always get the details.

I think she’s doing an outstanding job on this portfolio as well as raising the concerns of her constituents from London–Fanshawe.", "I’m thankful to have the opportunity to debate this bill today. I know this government has been making a bit of a habit of cutting debate time in this chamber, and I’ve waited patiently all week, hoping I would have the opportunity to speak to this bill today.", "Given recent actions by this government to stifle important debate, I know we all get excited when they allow us the opportunity to speak to important and, in many cases, life-altering legislation in this chamber without cutting off our ability to debate things democratically and passionately in this chamber.", "After 10 years without a comprehensive immigration policy for this province, I’m glad we are here debating this bill. Broadly speaking, this bill, as several of my colleagues have indicated, provides the authority for Ontario to establish and govern immigrant selection programs. If passed, the bill would empower the province to set target levels of the number of persons chosen by selection programs and give consideration to Ontario’s labour market needs. It would also allow the minister to pursue regulations that can set up registries for both employers and recruiters interested in participating in Ontario’s selection programs under the act.", "This, of course, is not an exhaustive list of what the bill hopes to accomplish, but I think that what I’ve outlined is sufficient, given that my time is limited this morning.", "To add some context to this debate, I would like to bring up a few points that were already raised, but I think they are worth bringing up again. Immigration in this province would need to be more than two and a half times greater than it is today in order to offset the decline in Ontario’s labour force being caused by our aging population.", "Let’s unpack this for a minute. Besides the productivity losses that we may face, we need to consider all of the knowledge that will be lost if we don’t effectively pass it along to our next generation of workers, which includes Ontario immigrants as well as young people. I’m thinking specifically of auto workers and the tool and die makers that are foundational to the success of Windsor and Essex county. These are craftspeople. They employ skills that cannot be learned overnight and, a lot of the time, require extensive on-the-job training. Utilizing the skills of our current workforce to train those who will take over for them is something we need to think seriously about. If the people that will take over these jobs have not even entered this province yet, we need to get them here and we need to set up on-the-job training programs so that Ontario shares its knowledge with the next generation of workers.", "We also need to remember that a number of Ontario immigrants already have the skills they need to be employed in this province. Bill 49 speaks to recruiting and targeting highly trained and employable individuals in Ontario. This initiative is only as good as our ability to recognize their skills.", "We’ve heard this before. It’s not new, and the government has been aware of this trend for over a decade. Yet for over 10 years, we have not seen this government come forward and commit to an Ontario immigration plan. I’m glad that finally we are seeing something today.", "I think that one thing that is not in this bill—and this issue was touched on by a number of my colleagues—is a focus on immigrants who do not fit into the economic class being discussed in this bill. Furthermore, adequate housing is not addressed in this bill.", "All of the concerns I’ve raised thus far are concerns in my community. Windsor welcomes a large number of new Ontarians every year. Unfortunately, over the past few years, we’ve also lost a number of Windsorites to the western provinces. I hope that we can build the economy required to welcome them back one day and reconnect families. Nevertheless, I’m glad to welcome new families to our great city every year.", "We have people coming from all over the world to live in our community, and continue to develop the cultural institutions that allow people to enjoy their unique cultural practices and share them with others.", "I would like to specifically highlight the excellent work done by the Somali Community of Windsor. This community organization services all residents, but specializes in offering social services targeted to at-risk, marginalized communities in the region, specifically residents originating from Somalia or those of Somali heritage. This is a not-for-profit organization of staff and volunteers that works tirelessly in my community.", "Most recently, the Somali Community of Windsor informed me about a project to target Somali youth who have escalating problems of school discipline or are suffering from low self-esteem or delinquency. The program seeks to establish a mechanism for early forms of intervention to help at-risk youth succeed in the community. Programming includes workshop sessions on enhancing social skills and building linkages to provide youth with mentors and support networks.", "I’ve met with this community several times since being elected, and they are motivated, organized and dedicated. I don’t think I will ever forget the lessons I’m learning about community activism and engagement from this organization. I really hope this government is taking note of my remarks here, as the Somali Community’s program is not yet implemented and is an excellent model to be implemented and duplicated elsewhere. I hope the government looks at these programs when they are designing the criteria of what would qualify for settlement services, and I hope they provide specifics very soon.", "I brought up the Somali Community and their work on community programming today because I think it underscores a number of issues yet to be determined in the Ontario Immigration Act. While the goal of bringing more people into Ontario is admirable and needed, we need to look at what support networks we have for these people once they come to our province. We need to assess whether or not those that come here to work have access to affordable housing. We need to look at targeted programming for at-risk youth and how the need for this programming is intensified when we are talking about minority populations.", "Rest assured that I can speak until adjournment and beyond about the ambitions and achievements of all of the cultural institutions in my riding and all of the culture we celebrate in Windsor and Essex county. But somehow I don’t think you would allow me to do that, Mr. Speaker, even though I know all the members of this chamber would enjoy the discussion. Maybe indulge me one last time by allowing me to highlight one more group, and then I’ll bring up the rest at a later date.", "I want to highlight the work being done by the Essex County Chinese Canadian Association. Chinese Canadians have a proud tradition in Windsor. I’m sure we all remember that there was a time in Canada when, if you were Chinese, you were not allowed to immigrate to the country. We can all recall the dark chapter of Canadian history that saw the Chinese Immigration Act in effect from 1923 to 1947.", "The Essex County Chinese Canadian Association has held events in the past celebrating the repeal of this truly discriminatory legislation. I think that remembering how tragic immigration legislation was in the past helps ground us in how far we’ve come and how far we have yet to go when legislating immigration policy in Ontario. I thank the Essex County Chinese Canadian Association for reminding us of this.", "I think my time is coming to an end, Speaker, and I would like to say that I enjoyed my time speaking to this bill today. While I’m glad to see that we’re having a discussion focused on immigration policy for Ontario, I know I am not alone in thinking we should have had some sort of comprehensive immigration plan over a decade ago. Nevertheless, I hope that, moving forward, the government will reflect on my remarks.", "First and foremost, I hope they look at the work being done by organizations in my riding that ease the transition for people new to Ontario, remind us of our past and work to build a more inclusive and thriving Ontario. And, Speaker, this bill is incredibly significant to my riding, as Windsor is a border town. In my riding alone there are two border crossings, whether it’s through the tunnel into Detroit or across the bridge, and, hopefully, a new publicly owned bridge as well very soon.", "More and more, I see that immigrants come across with incredible skills that are not transferable. We need to make sure they have supports in place so that when they come here those skills can be put to work right away and we’re able to support their communities.", "I mentioned the Somali Community in my speech. They’re currently looking to relocate facilities, because they just don’t have the funding in place to run their fantastic program. These are things we need to look at when we welcome people into the country and into Ontario, and make sure they have the supports in place specific to their cultural needs. And we need to make sure that the youth they bring with them are supported, so that when they grow up and go through our education system and move on to work, there are jobs out there for them and they have the skills they need in order to succeed.", "I think that’s just about it for my time, Speaker.

This bill would address establishing settlement integration programs that are targeted at them, and I think this would be very beneficial to them.", "It would also establish, and asks the authority to govern, Ontario’s immigration selection programs. I believe that’s very important. We have communities such as the Italian community and the Portuguese community that, like my family, came much earlier compared to the Somali community and nowadays can’t even come here. There’s just no way that they’re accepted. Even if they would make the selection, we’re just not taking in people from countries that belong to communities that in a way helped to build Canada and helped to build cities like Toronto and the province of Ontario. Sometimes it’s sad to think of it that way.", "I think we do need to shake up the system.

I can’t get over it; every year that I go there I meet new Canadians who have just come to Brockville, who have joined our community and who take great pride in attending that festival and showing the men and women in the city and in the riding as a whole their culture. This is a great event where you’ve got food and music. But most importantly, this group, this multicultural council, has worked for over three decades to help educate the community. I think they’ve done just a tremendous job. I know that they’re very supportive, as our caucus is, of this legislation. We look forward to further debate this morning. Our Conservative caucus is eager and anxious to join in the debate." ],

We are looking for workers. Anybody who is looking to relocate to that area has an opportunity to come to beautiful communities such as White River, Chapleau and Wawa, which are looking to secure individuals to come to their area.", "Having the discussion in regard to setting target levels based on the labour market needs—we’ve been crying and yelling about that for a very long time. Also, to conduct research, organize educational and training programs and have a registry list where both employers and recruiters can actually submit their names—we welcome that opportunity, and it’s long overdue that we should be having this discussion. But—I need to say “but”—a lot of the discussion is failing in that we need to make sure that our federal cousins are on board with this as well.

Unfortunately, an election got in the way, but here we are today debating this bill. It’s such an important bill because it really captures the spirit of who we are as Ontarians.", "You know, over the last few hundred years in this province, we’ve been able to build a province like Ontario because of our immigration. I always say that outside of our aboriginal population every single person in this province has an immigrant past. My father is from Grenada. I was born in England; my mother is from England. We all have an immigrant past, and we need to continue to work on immigration to strengthen the way in which our immigration policies work federally to allow us to meet some of our needs here in the province of Ontario.", "We know that over the next 10 years there will be 2.5 million job openings here in the province of Ontario. We do have a low birthrate and an aging population. It is important for us to continue to attract the best and the brightest from around the world so we can continue to build the type of province that we’ve been so fortunate to have over the many years.", "I know the member from Windsor West talked about programs that we have and making sure we have the right type of programs. I’m so proud that our government has invested almost $1 billion since 2003 into our settlement and retraining programs that work with new Canadians, our bridge training programs and our French- and English-as-a-second-language program, which we have 100,000 people currently in. Our bridge training programs are quite interesting because 50,000 people have successfully accelerated their foreign training credentials so they can work here in the province of Ontario. That’s something I think we have gotten right in this province. I would say that Ontario—when it comes to our settlement services, we are the best in this country." ],

Some choose to stay in Windsor; some use it as a portal to move on to somewhere else in Ontario. Although the Minister of Tourism, Culture and Sport boasted of the investments in programs for immigrants, I will say that from what I’m hearing from my community, there is still a large gap that needs to be addressed, a large gap when it comes to training or being able to transfer their skills.", "I can share a story—it seems like another lifetime ago. I was a dental assistant in an office in downtown Windsor, right in the heart of Windsor. We had two people that would come in to clean the office. We got talking about where they were from, how long they’ve been in Canada and why they chose Windsor to live in. I eventually asked what it was that they did back in the country that they had come from. It was interesting and kind of disheartening to find out that the lady who was cleaning our dental office is actually a trained and licensed dentist back in her own country where she came from. She chose to come to Canada, chose Ontario as her home and chose to stay in Windsor and yet her skills were not transferrable. There was a great barrier for her to go back to school and get the credentials she needed in order to be able to practise here.", "So I think there’s still a lot of work to be done. This is a great step forward. I mentioned Somali Community. Again, the minister had mentioned all the money they’ve thrown into the system and the wonderful things they’re doing, but we still have immigrants who are coming here who have to fund their own programs for their youth." ],

I am pleased to stand and add my comments on Bill 49.", "It’s interesting, and I’m sure you’ve heard these comments before, that we’re all products of immigrants, in this country, who came to this country for a better life. My own ancestors came here about 200 years ago, back in the 1820s. There were about six of them who came over at one time. We’ve certainly done the historical—we’ve looked back in history to see who we’re related to and what branch of the trees and whatever else. We’ve done a pretty good job of it. As they came and settled in the Ottawa area—actually, they settled in North Gower, which is a small community in the Ottawa area. That’s where they settled, and they branched out from there.", "My great-grandfather, I believe, ended up in Essex county, which was where I was born and raised. But they ended up going across to the United States and certainly across Canada.", "I could just imagine, Speaker, when they got off the boat. I can just imagine that. They got off the boat; we don’t know exactly where they got off. We believe it was somewhere around Montreal. But coming from Ireland, which was quite a different country, I suppose, than what Canada was back in the 1820s, I can just imagine what they were anticipating. I don’t know what they were thinking of. I’m sure they were hoping for a better life and an opportunity to raise their families and continue on in this country, which they did. It was about the third generation of those original settlers that started to move across Canada and the United States and settle other regions of the province.", "It’s interesting, as you look back in history or look back in your own history at some events that happened back then that can be related to what I’m doing right now. If you go to Manotick, in Ottawa, you’ll find a street that’s named after us, and it was named for those first settlers who came to that area. There’s also a road north of Rivers, Manitoba, that has our name on it. In fact, there used to be a town out there called Pettapiece at one point.", "The individuals involved in how these things were named, if you read the history, had a lot to do with municipal politics, and they were quite well respected where they lived.", "I’m going to fast-forward to now. There’s a chap I met in Stratford. His name is Gezahgn Wordofa. He’s got quite an interesting history. He’s worked for the United Nations, and he actually came here from Russia. He spent about eight or nine years in Russia. He met his wife, a Canadian girl, in Russia and came to Canada.", "He started the Multicultural Association of Perth-Huron. It’s one thing to get immigrants to come to this country—and a lot of them want to come here because they know that Canada is the land of opportunity, although Ontario is certainly having its issues right now and we lose a lot of these immigrants, who go to the west because of job opportunities.", "Gezahgn has started what they call the Multicultural Association of Perth-Huron. He got me involved. He’s invited me to a couple of meetings, a couple of different functions they’ve had. One of the issues that immigrant people have in Canada, especially in rural areas, is a sense of inclusion in the community. If there are only one or two families of a certain group that come over, they sometimes have problems meeting their neighbours, for example, and things like that, and finding jobs and feeling comfortable in their situation.", "So what Gezahgn has done is started this multicultural association. I was at a celebration they had last fall. There are about 250 members in this association right now. It’s not just one group from one country; it’s countries from all over the world that are involved. I didn’t realize there were that many countries represented in Perth–Wellington because they tend to keep to themselves. They aren’t in the communities as much as we would like them to be. This is not their fault, certainly; it’s just a matter of getting to know who is around you and getting comfortable with who you’re with.", "So he started this association. What he does is, if you’ve been here for a while and you’re having difficulty, say, finding a job, getting your records in order or whatever else, then he and his organization will help you out with these types of things, if you request it. It has grown so much that, actually, this organization is sponsored by the United Way and they’ve taken them under their wing to help them with the organizational part of it and also to get the word out as to what they are doing.", "We welcome these people into our communities. We’re in an enviable position, I think, in Perth–Wellington, where our jobless rate is very low. We’re probably under 4% in our unemployment rate. We are looking for people to fill jobs. In fact, some of the communities in the riding actually go into the larger cities and bus people into some of the places in Perth–Wellington to work for the day and then bus them home, which is quite unusual. But we have an underemployment problem where we are. We welcome these people or anybody who wants to come out into the rural areas because of this unemployment situation that we have.", "Anyway, the multicultural association does exactly that. They will find these people work that they may be interested in. Unfortunately, some of them come here with an education that might not fit the bill; however, they want to work.", "I was told by a Chinese girl at one of these occasions that her father has a degree in agriculture from China and cannot find the employment here that he’s after. I think there’s probably an issue with the language—that’s probably one problem, but he’s still continuing on. There are jobs for these people so at least they can get settled in Ontario and in our riding.", "We are actively seeking people to come out to our riding because there are job opportunities out there. This multicultural association helps people navigate the system. When we see that the province is trying to encourage this, we would ask that they not only encourage them to come to the cities but encourage them to come to rural Ontario, where I think these people can fit into our way of life and certainly be able to progress and have a good life.", "Also, I would like to advise you, Speaker, that our housing costs are probably not as high as in some of the major cities. We do have housing in Perth–Wellington that would probably be affordable to anybody moving to this country as long as they wanted to work hard, and for most people who come to this country that’s exactly what they want to do: work hard and raise their families with a decent income and certainly the security that this country offers.", "Anyway, that’s a little bit about the Huron-Perth multicultural association, which I will be working with on a number of things in the riding just because it’s something that really interests me. Also, Mr. Wordofa, who is running this organization, likes to keep in contact with members of the Legislature, both federally and provincially, just to see if there are any programs coming down the pipeline that might help his organization. Certainly we do that; if he needs some help with something or any of the people involved in that, our phone lines are always open. We try to do as much as we can to make these people more comfortable and welcome in our community.", "That’s a little bit about what’s going on in Perth–Wellington, and I welcome a bill that does encourage immigration. I thank you for your time, Speaker." ],

There has been lots of research that has been done across the Algoma–Manitoulin area, particularly in the northern part, where AWIC has been working tirelessly in order to identify the shortages that they have in regard to support jobs, industry jobs and service jobs.

I’ve been asking the minister—I think we’ve been talking about this for a year or two since I’ve been up here, particularly in regard to my northern region—about why we need this discussion and why this is so important to securing that labour workforce to come up to northern Ontario.", "There are a lot of parts of this province that are really struggling, but we are struggling even more greatly because it is so easy for an individual to leave those communities, because of the downturn in the forestry and mining sectors, that our skilled labour workforce has moved on. The others who were there in support positions are now into those skilled positions. We need a new, fresh influx of individuals to come to northern Ontario.

Why did they decide to stay? Well, they had work, but that wasn’t the only reason they decided to stay. They decided to stay because they felt comfortable in the area because they had a sense of community and because they had supports within that community.", "I think that what this bill does address is part of what is needed to attract skilled immigrants, the best and the brightest, as the minister just said recently.

We certainly want the skills that they are bringing to the north, but if they are not able to complete the required training so that they are allowed to practise, then all is for naught. This family is going to move to Toronto, and Nickel Belt and Sudbury will continue to be underserved. This has to change." ],

As we said earlier in this debate, I think most Ontarians and pretty well everybody in this Legislature is in agreement that Ontario has to play a larger role when it comes to immigration policy in Ontario. If you take a look at the history of Canada, there are a number of provinces like Quebec that play a much larger role when it comes to dealing with the policies and dealing with the various issues having to do with how people immigrate and where they immigrate to. Certainly Ontario, being the province that traditionally gets the greater number of immigrants than any other province in Canada, should have a role, because we’re in great need of people to immigrate to different parts of the province. I’ll speak to that a little bit later.", "I just want to pick up on the honourable minister across the way—minister for something, and I can’t remember the riding, I’m sorry—who got up and said, “Oh, my God, we’ve been debating this bill now for 10 hours, and it’s so important that we pass this bill.” I think he used a word like “imperative” or “urgency.” It was going to be like the end of the world.", "I was sitting back here thinking, “Was it, what, about eight years ago, 10 years ago that the current Liberal government said it was going to do something to deal with foreign-trained doctors, foreign-trained electricians, foreign-trained engineers, foreign-trained all kinds of people that have been trained in Europe and different parts of the world who immigrate to Ontario and Canada and who can’t get a job because their qualifications are not recognized here in Ontario?” If I’m an electrician or I’m a doctor or I’m an engineer from Europe or somewhere else in the world who has been trained, I still have the same problems that I had back in 2007, when the government said they were going to do something. There have been some small steps made, but by and large there has not been the type of change that the government promised would happen when it comes to allowing those people trained in foreign universities and colleges that provide qualifications comparable to Ontario’s to be dealt with.", "I still see people in this city on a daily basis—a lot of them driving taxis, and I’m a good booster of the taxi industry, using taxis almost every day—where I run across them and I say to them, “So what do you do?” They say, “Well, I’m an electrical engineer.” “Oh, and you’ve not been able to get work?” “No, I can’t get my qualifications recognized here in Ontario.”", "Since 2007, this government was supposed to do something, and we’re now being told in this debate today: This bill has to be passed like yesterday so that we can deal with the issues that Ontario needs to deal with when it comes to immigration policy in the province. I’d like to believe the government, I truly would, and I think there’s not a member in this House on either side of the aisle who would not want to believe that in fact passing this legislation three days ago, or this minute or two minutes from now is going to have an immediate change when it comes to immigration policy in this province. I just don’t have confidence, quite frankly, in the government’s ability to deliver, because far too often the government has come to this House—and this is not a prop; it’s our order paper—and brought legislation forward that has a great title, that is accompanied by some of the best press releases I’ve ever seen written, that gives the citizens a sense that something is happening, but in fact, other than the title and the press release, minimal baby steps are being made to address the issue.", "We just saw that with the passage of Bill 40, the Agriculture Insurance Act, yesterday.

But we’re actually possibly taking a step back.", "So I want to believe the minister when he stands in this House and says there is such an urgency to pass this bill. I’m not filibustering; New Democrats are not filibustering this bill. I just want to put this on the record.", "There are some legitimate concerns being raised by members of this House. We just heard from our member from Nickel Belt, who raised issues in regard to doctors in her community who can’t stay because they aren’t able to get their credentials recognized when it comes to the work that they do within the health field. I look at the case that I have in northeastern Ontario, as my good friend from Algoma–Manitoulin does, where we represent large industrial sectors such as mining, forestry and hydro development, and we have people who are trying to get work who are qualified and can’t get jobs because their credentials are not recognized.", "Those people who live in Ontario who do these kinds of jobs are already working, so it’s not as if we’re displacing people who want the job. The people who are able to do the job are working, but there’s a whole bunch of people still needed above and beyond that, and we can’t recognize their qualifications.", "If I thought for one second that the minister was right, that, my God, if we pass this today, tomorrow our problem will at least start to be dealt with, I would have some confidence. But given the track record of this government, I have very little confidence that the government is actually going to move with any kind of speed on this.", "Is this a step in the right direction? Absolutely. Is this something that is long overdue? Darn right it is. But I think the government should maybe take some of their own rhetoric a little bit more seriously and actually try to do something so that we’re able to deal with the issue that has been plaguing us for so long, which is the ability for people trained outside of Ontario, in countries across the world that have education systems, qualifications and regulations that are comparable to Ontario, to be recognized much quicker than they are now.", "Je veux aussi prendre l’occasion de parler de l’immigration francophone dans cette province.

Je regarde la ville de Kapuskasing, la ville de Timmins et beaucoup d’autres communautés à travers le nord-est de l’Ontario, des communautés qui sont vives, qui ont des économies assez fortes, qui ont des emplois disponibles. On a besoin d’être capable de renforcer la communauté francophone dans ces places-là, parce que, comme on le sait, la réalité est que tous les citoyens de cette province, francophones ou anglophones, ont moins d’enfants aujourd’hui qu’ils en avaient dans les générations passées.", "Moi, je pense à pépère et mémère Lehoux sur le bord de ma mère; eux autres, ils ont eu neuf enfants. Sur le bord de mon père, mémère et pépère Bisson ont eu 10 enfants. Si on regarde notre famille, les Bisson de ma génération, on est trois. Et là, moi, j’en ai eu deux et nos filles en ont eu deux. On a moins d’enfants aujourd’hui qu’on en avait dans le passé, et quoi qu’il arrive, ça fait une pression sur la communauté francophone où ça a un effet de réduire le nombre total.", "Donc, oui, il y a un besoin, avec les politiques d’immigration dans cette province, de regarder comment on peut encourager les francophones qui viennent d’outre-mer de venir et de choisir des places comme Timmins, Hearst, Windsor, Sudbury ou d’autres communautés—Welland, par exemple, où il y a beaucoup de francophones—où tu peux vivre en français et de trouver ta place dans cette province.", "Donc, je dis, ce projet de loi, je n’ai pas grande confiance que ça va changer cette affaire-là à la vitesse que, moi, je serais satisfait avec. Mais je veux dire au gouvernement, si on regarde les expériences que le gouvernement a eues quand ça vient à reconnaître les qualifications d’outre-mer à travers les différents secteurs comme la santé, les métiers et autres, on se trouve, depuis 2007, à avoir fait des pas très minimes quand ça vient à être capable d’accepter ces qualifications d’outre-mer quand elles sont comparables à celles de l’Ontario.", "Il est quasiment encore bien proche d’impossible pour ce monde-là de se qualifier. Donc, ils s’établissent où? Ils s’établissent ici à Toronto et ils s’établissent à Ottawa en attendant une bonne journée où ils vont être capables de travailler dans le métier ou la profession de leur choix.", "Again, Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the minister talking about the urgency of this bill and how important it is to be passed. I have no doubt that the government is going to try to invoke closure on this bill when they call the question in the next rotation. But let’s not kid ourselves. The government, since 2007, has said, “We’re going to do something to deal with foreign credentials.” Since 2007, very few steps have been taken to deal with this issue. If anybody believes that the government is going to move at breakneck speed on immigration law for Ontario that deals with issues like foreign qualifications and where people are able to go and establish themselves once they immigrate, you’ve got another think coming.", "This is a great title, tied to a great press release, but I think it’ll have little in the way of action." ],

I think that the added bonus of targeting some francophone immigrants to Ontario isn’t just for the obvious nature of making our francophone community strong. It’s because many of these francophone communities are away from the urban centres, and that’s kind of our target: to try to draw immigrants to Ontario but not necessarily to the large crowded urban centres like Toronto and Ottawa.

Nous devons nous positionner comme chefs de file dans le domaine de la protection de l’eau potable au Canada, et ainsi, donner l’exemple au reste du monde.", "Ontario’s government is committed to protecting and improving the Great Lakes ecosystem and the quality of the water in the lakes. The bill, therefore, complements initiatives taken by the Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change.", "Microplastics are an emerging issue in the Great Lakes, and in recent years, even smaller plastic granules which are less than one millimetre in diameter have been found in bodies of water all over the world. Many of these plastic granules have been identified as synthetic plastic microbeads that are added to personal care products; for example, to help exfoliate skin or clean our teeth. After these shampoos, soaps and toothpastes are washed down the drain, they will make their way into our lakes, rivers and oceans simply because they are too small for our drainage system to catch, and they will be staying there. Microbeads are causing growing environmental concern because of the various marine organisms that are ingesting them. The beads are roughly the same size as sediment, plankton or fish eggs, and are easily mistaken as food.", "A recent study has even concluded that microbeads can be breathed into gills. This ingestion can cause intestinal blockages, internal abrasion and even acts as a magnet to accumulate a high level of toxic chemicals.", "It is clear that this has an impact on the whole food chain, as higher organisms consume microplastics through the fish they eat as prey.", "Malgré le nombre d’études qui ont été faites au sujet des microplastiques, nous avons encore un long cheminement à faire. Au printemps dernier, le ministère de l’Environnement et de l’Action en matière de changement climatique a mené une étude pour recueillir et analyser des échantillons prélevés de l’eau et d’effluents de diverses usines municipales de traitement des eaux usées.", "Le ministère travaille aussi avec l’université Western en leur fournissant des échantillons de sédiments pour les aider avec leurs investigations de la présence de microplastique dans le lac Ontario et le lac Érié.", "In 2012 and 2013, scientific studies from the State University of New York and the 5 Gyres Institute were conducted to record the plastics content of Lake Huron, Lake Erie and Lake Superior. It was found that microplastics are in greater concentrations in Lake Erie than any other body of water on earth. Results such as these, of course, demand action.", "The Microbead Elimination and Monitoring Act has two main functions, as the name suggests. The strength of the bill is that it outright prohibits the manufacturing and addition of microbeads to cosmetics, soaps or similar products. Those who contravene this law will be found guilty of an offence and fined up to $10,000.", "The second part of the bill is that it requires the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change to ensure that water supplies from the Great Lakes are analyzed in accordance with the regulations for the presence of microbeads. These results will be published online for the public.", "If we were to pass this bill, we would be the first jurisdiction in Canada to have specific legislation tackling the problem of microbeads in our water. We need to take a look to the south and follow the example of Illinois and Ohio, which have passed similar legislation banning the use of microbeads in the manufacturing of personal care products. If we’re all to succeed, these states will become our partners in the mission of protecting the Great Lakes.", "Though it is easy to point fingers at personal care product manufacturers, it is important to acknowledge that industry leaders have taken the initiative to stop or have made a pledge to stop using microbeads. Some of these cutting-edge companies include the Body Shop, Colgate-Palmolive, L’Oréal, Johnson and Johnson, and Procter and Gamble." ],

I’ll be sharing my time with my friends and colleagues from Stormont–Dundas–South Glengarry and Thornhill.", "I would like to start off by saying that eliminating microbeads is something that has been happening for years within the industry. It is unfortunate that the member from Ottawa–Orléans would not know this because she consulted with next to no industry at all. In speaking to the Canadian Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association, who represent over 150 companies, I’m sad to say that they were not consulted on this piece of important legislation that will impact their industry. In fact, the companies that they work with have already committed to eliminating microbeads by 2018, with elimination of the products on the shelf by 2019.", "I’m pleased to share with you, Speaker, that the PC caucus agrees with the objective and principle of Bill 75, but as we move forward with this bill, I hope we can work together to make it stronger. To my friend from Ottawa–Orléans, I would like to go as far as to offer to set up a meeting with yourself, myself, our friend from the NDP caucus and industry stakeholders so that even before it gets to committee we can make this initiative stronger.", "We have to work with stakeholders to make sure all legislation gets it right. We all care about our Great Lakes, we care about the environment and we want what’s best for Ontarians, but we cannot put through weak legislation that does nothing to fix the problem.", "I have a number of issues. First off, consumer products and the regulation of consumer products is something that should be done federally, for a number of reasons. These products that contain microbeads are often produced for international markets and exported across many boundaries. They are almost never just manufactured for use in Ontario.", "There’s no mention of how this legislation will deal with counterfeit and non-name brand products coming from offshore and being distributed through discount stores. How will we keep these out? This bill doesn’t address that issue. Who will regulate this legislation? The products with microbeads will come through Canada Border Services, which is managed through trade agreements made in Canada. It is not something necessarily the province should be regulating when really the province has no means to regulate it. So unless we’re talking about creating an enforcement body, which would cost money and therefore question this particular PMB, then I’m not sure how this bill could actually work.", "It has been suggested this action could best be undertaken by the federal government. In late 2014, Canada and Ontario signed an agreement on the Great Lakes water quality and ecosystem health in which each jurisdiction can nominate candidate chemicals for consideration as chemicals of concern under this annex. This is part of what the Ontario-Canada commitment is doing in terms of reducing harmful pollutants to the Great Lakes.", "Another concern I have brings me to Bill 66, the Great Lakes Protection Act, introduced just weeks prior to this. Surely, I trust the member from Ottawa–Orléans would have known Bill 66 was coming forth. If it was an important issue, Speaker, why did she not work with her colleague to include this issue in Bill 66? Look, it’s quite clear what’s happening here: It’s a media hit for a newly elected backbench MPP. But the issue of microbeads is so much more than a media hit. I’m truly concerned that this bill is for show rather than tangible results.", "Another concern of mine is the way this bill is written and its definitions. It states, “The bill prohibits the manufacture of microbeads and the addition of microbeads to cosmetics, soaps or similar products.” The problem is that many of these products are not manufactured here in Ontario but rather shipped from other countries. Therefore, this legislation truly isn’t prohibiting anything.", "Another concern is the lack of definitions in the bill. Consider the definition of a cosmetic by the Food and Drug Administration, where the term “cosmetic” means “articles intended to be rubbed, poured, sprinkled, or sprayed on, introduced into, or otherwise applied to the human body or any part thereof for cleansing, beautifying, promoting attractiveness, or altering ... appearance.” That being said, if producers want to get around this, they could, because the terms used in this bill are not clearly defined.", "Another concern on definition with regard to microbeads is the specs, defined at one millimetre or smaller. However, when speaking to stakeholders, they’re using a definition based on the Illinois model, which is proving to be held as a standard worldwide, where you see microbeads being defined as five millimetres or under. Really, industry is being more progressive than this Liberal bill.", "I would like to suggest that we need to work together prior to this bill going to committee and get this thing right, because we know that your government hasn’t gotten it right in the past: green energy, gas plants etc. If we can work together, then we can have a good chance at ensuring that the strongest piece of legislation is produced to protect the Great Lakes while also ensuring that industry is on side and has realistic deadlines." ],

To go back to the member from Huron–Bruce, of course there is a federal component, and we have to work together with them to give this some teeth.", "I want to segue from this to say that it’s also educational. This is the first time I have actually been introduced to the topic. I’m not the environment critic, although I—like most Ontarians, I think—care very deeply about the environment and climate change. I want to urge the member, because that’s her passion, to bring forward some of the issues that are the passion of folk from my riding as well. It’s not just about microbeads; it’s also about, for example, environmental assessments for Line 9. If you drive or walk through my riding, you will see a number of signs on front lawns. You won’t see any for microbeads, but you will see them for Line 9. “Stop Line 9,” they say. This is not a federal issue only, although it is. We can do an environmental assessment here. We’re demanding that in Parkdale–High Park.", "We’re also demanding “NoJets TO.” You’ll see those signs on the front lawns of my residents. Again, the provincial government has a role to play in stopping that. Again, that’s something we can do an environmental assessment around.", "I know that some of my northern members might want to talk about environmental assessments on the rail traffic that’s going through their districts, but in my district, the rail traffic that’s about to go through is tier 4 diesel trains. Just like microbeads, I have to say that there is no clean diesel. These trains will be running every 15 minutes. There is an article in the Sun today that talks about how two people can take a cab door to door from Pearson to anywhere in Toronto cheaper than they can ride the UP Express—and cleaner, I might add; cleaner, too—because those trains that we’re going to subsidize with more and more tax dollars, because they’re not going to be filled, that could be modes of transportation, that could have stops and that could transport people, will, in fact, be running through the backyards of people in Liberty Village, York South–Weston, Trinity–Spadina, Davenport and Parkdale–High Park. They will be running through their backyards, through school territories, and they will be destroying the air quality of the communities they run through.", "They will not be providing transportation to those communities because they’re too expensive. They’re not a relief line. And they won’t be providing adequate transportation for those who get off at Pearson and just want to get downtown, even for the Pan Am Games, because you can do it cheaper with a cab.", "Those are the three issues that are most pertinent, environmentally, to those in downtown Toronto and to my riding. I would just advise the member, with her passion for the environment, please keep on being passionate. I’m looking at the member from Burlington, too—and I’m sad that I missed the all-party cycle breakfast this morning, I couldn’t help it, but my heart was there.", "Again, there’s so much more we could do to get people out of their cars and onto their bikes in downtown Toronto, and we don’t do it. There’s a portion of that that is a provincial responsibility. You can’t just say everything is federal; you can’t just say everything is city. We need to do what we can in this chamber.", "Suffice to say, I applaud the member for bringing her passion here: Do not be deterred. I can tell you that trying to get legislation through this place is a little like swimming through Jell-O, you know? It’s difficult, but you keep swimming, and eventually you get there. I remember the member from Nepean–Carleton once quoted Winston Churchill—I love this quote—and it very much pertains to this place: “If you find yourself going through hell, keep on going,” because my friend, welcome to the Legislature; welcome to tabling your first private member’s bill. You will find yourself swimming through Jell-O and going through hell, but keep on going, because it requires all of us in this chamber to keep on keeping on if we’re going to make a difference." ],

What a delight to have such a wonderful, worthwhile bill, that should be non-partisan, coming forward from a new member. So I would like to congratulate her.", "Many Ontarians may be surprised to learn that they’re causing harm to fish and wildlife by using personal care products that contain microbeads. Since they are too small to be filtered out by waste water treatment plants, they make their way into the world’s waterways and oceans. Recent research has shown them in alarming abundance in Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River sediments.", "Microbeads are a serious concern to the environment and human health because they absorb persistent organic pollutants, including carcinogens and hormone disrupters, which, when ingested by fish and other wildlife, can bioaccumulate up the food chain. Organisms that have ingested microplastics experience compromised immune function and higher mortality. Over 250 species have been impacted.", "Professor Sherri Mason from the State University of New York conducted the first study that found microbeads floating in the Great Lakes. As one would expect, she found that concentrations increased downstream, with the highest numbers in Lake Ontario.", "Last year, McGill University researchers collected sediment from 10 locations along a 320-kilometre stretch of the St. Lawrence River to Quebec City. At some locations, they measured over 1,000 microbeads per litre of sediment, a magnitude that rivals the world’s most contaminated ocean sediments. These important findings prove that rivers can act as a sink for this form of pollution.", "As with all cross-border multi-source environmental issues, we need to address microbead pollution collectively, as the other members have stated. The Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Cities Initiative, a coalition of US and Canadian mayors and other local officials, including my hometown of Kingston and the Islands, has been instrumental in raising awareness and calling for action on microbead pollution.", "We’re taking an important step today. If the act is passed, which I hope it will be, Ontario will join Illinois, the first jurisdiction in the world to ban microbeads. Our purchasing decisions have a strong influence on manufacturers. So regardless of where those products come from, we have the ability to make a difference.", "Apps such as Beat the Microbead have made it easier to identify products containing microbeads by simply scanning the bar code. Microbead ingredients are listed as polyethylene or polypropylene.", "There are now more than 2,000 products on the market using microbeads in North America. I urge all manufacturers to join the industry leaders like the ones that have already been mentioned and add to those Unilever, Aveda and Lush, who have already phased out their use.", "In closing, microbeads are of great concern for the well-being of fish and wildlife, and pose a threat to human health. They are unnecessary and, as we’ve already heard, natural alternatives are possible to purchase. They must be eliminated as soon as possible.", "Mr. Speaker, I urge the members of this House to show leadership in the environmental stewardship of our Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River by supporting this bill.", "I will be sharing my time today with my colleague.

With legislation like this, it’s important that we look at it and consider what we’re doing before we jump into it. I commend the goal of what we’re doing, but again, it’s the way it’s being done that causes a lot of grief, and not only to the industry. We don’t achieve what, really, our goal is.", "In this case here, we’ve seen that there has been no consultation with the industry, even though the industry has been working hard to make changes, as my colleague said before, involving over 100 different businesses. They’re taking steps. They’re working internationally. I think that if we really want to get benefits, we have to work not only with industry and our stakeholders but internationally, so that we get meaningful change.", "It’s important if we really want to—especially in the environment. The environment doesn’t know borders, and if we want to see change, we have to work collaboratively. The industry has been working with governments around the world to ensure that there’s a common approach to the regulatory and legislative approach that they’re taking. This is important if you really want to get change.", "Bill 75 does not take into account efforts that are currently under way in different jurisdictions; for instance, the Council of State Governments, which includes our neighbouring states and our neighbouring provinces, as well as Ontario. They’re taking steps, looking at what needs to be done on a lot of common issues. I had the benefit of joining their conference last summer and seeing some of the good work they’re looking at. They’re looking at issues, whether it be climate control or legislation that would benefit both countries, and this is just another example. We have to make sure we don’t go at it alone.", "We look at the record of this government. We look at the failed Green Energy Act. Again, it was a novel idea. I think maybe it was more of an effort in public relations, because it really didn’t get any appreciable benefits. Sure, we closed five or so coal plants, but in the world, at the same time, over 1,200 were opened. So if you look at that impact, what did we do? By not talking to our neighbours around the world—a huge negative impact, and we took the hit. All we’ve done, really, is chase business and manufacturing out of this province and left ourselves less able to have resources to actually have a meaningful impact on the future.", "I know my time is up. I think we need to work with our partners. I think this is a good opportunity. It didn’t make it into the Great Lakes Protection Act, which one would have thought it would have, but I think we have to work with the two amendments. We’ll be supporting it at second reading." ],

I think the member from Ottawa–Orléans has done that, in the spirit of this bill, and she has put forward something that she truly believes in and that our party believes in.", "I don’t profess to be an expert on microbeads, but I can remember watching TV commercials where it was advertised that some products had microbeads in them and the reason you should have bought them was because they had microbeads. It was something that was better than the other products. I remember I was coming home to my riding from Toronto a few weeks ago, and there was a documentary about them. That’s the first time I realized that microbeads were plastic.", "Once again, it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out that if you put very small pieces of plastic in products that end up in the water system and in the environment, they’re going to stay in the environment.", "Is taking them out of products a good idea? Definitely. You always have to look at the positives and negatives and the ramifications of doing A or B. But if you look at the balance of things, I don’t think that there are any really bad ramifications of taking them out of the system. They can be replaced. You can replace microbeads with natural material, like corn husks. So it’s not that you would be disadvantaging anyone.", "Should this bill proceed? Yes. It’s a good thing. One of the reasons people put private members’ bills forward is not only that they want their bill to proceed, but they are trying to influence the direction of the government. In the case of a private member’s bill from the governing side, we’re hoping that this truly does influence the direction of the government.", "As we all know, on the opposition side, in a majority government, there’s not a lot of hope of getting a private member’s bill through. It takes a lot of work, perseverance and sometimes many tries. But on the government side, it shouldn’t be quite as tough. If the government was truly supportive, it should come forward as part of the government’s program. With this bill, hopefully, that is the case—that this is the first iteration brought forward by the member to influence the government to work on this.", "There are companies already—as has been mentioned, states in the United States, like Ohio and Illinois, have already moved. So it’s not that no one else has moved.", "Many of the bigger manufacturers who use these products have already made it very apparent that they are planning on removing them from the system. There are some smaller manufacturers who have never used them.", "I don’t use any of these products; I’m not going to be an advertisement.", "This is a bill and this is an issue where you actually could move very quickly. On the governing side, you don’t really have to worry about the machinations of how private members’ bills work. If it’s a good idea, you can take it.", "An example that the government should move on: the tip-out bill of the former member from Beaches–East York, Michael Prue.

On trouve ces petites particules de plastique dans pratiquement toutes les parties du réseau des Grands Lacs et dans de nombreux plans d’eau.

Johnson and Johnson is one such manufacturer, voluntarily removing microbeads from their products with the intention of having all of their products microbead-free by 2018. Why do we know this? Because we consulted with them. I have a constituent who works with Johnson and Johnson. I consulted him, and he I, on this legislation. He shared this information with me, and then I shared it with my colleague the member for Ottawa–Orléans, as part of our consultation with industry. In fact, J&J have already stopped developing new products containing microbeads and have been conducting environmental safety assessments of other alternative ingredients. Their goal is to complete the first phase of reformulations by the end of this year, which represents about half of the products sold that contain microbeads. This, together with the other stakeholders that my colleague mentioned, represents a spirit of collaboration that industry is bringing to the conversation.", "Notre gouvernement s’est engagé à protéger l’environnement de l’Ontario et à veiller à ce que la santé et le bien-être des générations futures soient préservés dans toute la mesure du possible.

As a past president of Heritage Cambridge, now known as ACO Cambridge—it’s the Cambridge branch of the Architectural Conservancy of Ontario—I really do understand the need to preserve and protect culture in this province. At Heritage Cambridge, we work to do just that: to preserve culture in order to enrich my riding of Cambridge.", "Bill 71 aims to promote literacy in the arts in Ontario, which is a very noble cause. We must understand that encouraging the public to immerse themselves in the written word contributes to a richer and more inquisitive society. I would say to the member from Windsor–Tecumseh that his quotes today certainly enriched the debate in this House this afternoon.", "Our government certainly understands how important this is. Our government has worked diligently to support and enhance arts and culture in Ontario. In 2007, the Status of Ontario’s Artists Act was passed. It indicated a commitment to the recognition of contributions that artists make to Ontario through enhancing our culture, brightening communities and fostering citizen involvement in arts and culture. This legislation marked a momentous occasion for the province and truly exemplified how dedicated we are as a society to our artists and creative folks. The dedication is long-standing.", "Since 2003, the government of Ontario has invested $6.6 billion in the sector of arts and culture. This investment has shown incredible payoff: the culture sector contributes around $22 billion to our economy each year, and this number continues to grow annually. Arts and culture also enhance our society in an incalculable way, and we’re all better off for this growing area.", "The Minister of Tourism, Culture and Sport and the member from Kingston and the Islands have done a wonderful job during this session of promoting arts and culture in our province. I’d like to thank them for their invaluable work in furthering the legacy of this government.", "There are many factors of this bill that I support. The commitment to the literary arts is important. It was first presented by the member from York Centre in 2009 when he introduced a similar motion proposing that the Legislative Assembly introduce a poet laureate of Ontario to help promote the arts and literacy.", "Bill 71 would introduce a poet laureate of Ontario as an officer of the Legislative Assembly. She or he would write poetry, visit schools, advise the legislative library and generally contribute to literacy and the literary arts in this province.", "I do thank the member from Windsor–Tecumseh for drawing attention to the arts, but there are several important issues with the bill that I want to bring up.", "Firstly, the establishment of a poet laureate as an officer of the Legislative Assembly would contradict the typical role of parliamentary officers in Ontario. In general, officers carry out duties that the Legislative Assembly may do, but in a way that is independent of government. There is currently no officer similar to the one proposed by Bill 71.", "I also have some concerns about the potential for financial implications in Bill 71. Across Canada, poet laureates often receive stipends for their duties. The federal poet laureate, for example, receives a stipend of $20,000 per year. The bill states that the costs related to the appointment of the poet laureate of Ontario may be placed upon the Ministry of Tourism, Culture and Sport. Private members’ bills may not call for the allocation of funds, so this might be an inappropriate stipulation.", "Finally, the Ontario Arts Council has been consulted and has some apprehension with the particulars of Bill 71. The OAC would prefer to see a better system of peer assessment in candidate selection for the poet laureate.", "I certainly thank the member from across the aisle for introducing this bill and shedding light on the important role of the literary arts in this province. I, too, look forward to the ongoing conversation on Bill 71." ],

I think we sound like we’re all in favour so far, Percy, so it seems very good. As critic for tourism and culture, I’m certainly very pleased to see this come forward again.", "The Lieutenant Governor would appoint a poet laureate, responsible for promoting art and literacy, celebrating Ontario and its people, and raising the profile of Ontario poets. The official appointment is done by government or a conferring institution.", "They are often expected to compose poems for special events and occasions. I know that some members—I think the former member from Halton would often have his member’s statements in poem fashion, so maybe they will look to him, Mr. Ted Chudleigh.", "Visiting schools, presenting or arranging poetry readings, and assisting with writing workshops or other activities would be part of the poet laureate’s job description, we can say, as well as advising the legislative library regarding the collection of the library and acquisitions that may enrich its cultural holdings, and performing other duties as requested by the Speaker—maybe not the Speaker in the chair at the moment, but the Speaker of the assembly—the Lieutenant Governor, or the legislative library in relation to this act, which is a wonderful resource for us as members. But they would be influential, and I think that’s a fabulous idea. They would be a literary ambassador.", "Culture is one of the fastest-growing sectors and contributes more than $22.6 billion annually to Ontario’s economy.

They are masters in their craft, in their profession, and I think it’s an excellent idea to bring them to Queen’s Park and give everybody in Ontario an opportunity to read and hear what they have to say. This is something that is worth doing.", "On Monday, I was at the Speaker’s Book Award, and I was really pleased to see one of my ex-constituents, who used to live in my riding with his parents, who have moved to Ottawa. Daniel Groleau Landry’s Rêver au réel, which is a book of poetry, was selected and made it to the final list. I will tell you a little bit about what it is. Rêver au réel is a collection of poems that explore four states of being: “Each ponders physical closeness, the emptiness that follows fleeting, fiery moments, and fetuses that continue to spin themselves into constellations, in rhyme and alliteration that reveal the sinuous thoughts of the poet. Landry manipulates sonorities to evoke images that grip our subconscious, that push the magical toward reality. His words blend body and spirit, mingle beauty and madness, and walk the line between dreams and wakefulness, truths and untruths.” This is certainly a book I would recommend to all of you if you have a chance to read it.", "April is the celebration of National Poetry Month. April is coming next month, Speaker. What a great gift to this Legislative Assembly if we could all agree that, during poetry month, this Legislative Assembly would agree to put into motion whatever steps need to happen so that we select our first poet laureate. I would add a little parenthesis, a favour that I ask of all my colleagues: that when—and I know that we will; I don’t know when it will happen, but it will happen—once we decide to have a poet laureate here at Queen’s Park, that we make sure we recognize that we have some very good Franco-Ontarian poets as well; and to make sure that through the rotation, there is a system in place so that they, too, have an opportunity to be heard.", "Ça me fait extrêmement plaisir d’appuyer le projet de loi. J’espère que tout le monde va se rallier pour avoir un poète lauréat ici à Queen’s Park et que, lorsqu’il sera en place, un mécanisme soit mis en place pour s’assurer que des poètes franco-ontariens ont également la chance d’être choisis. C’est une bonne idée. Let’s move on with it." ],

I think it would be a very welcome respite for many of us, perhaps, to listen to him read poetry for half an hour or so every Thursday afternoon, or maybe during question period; that might be even better.", "Seriously, Mr. Speaker, I do congratulate the member for his proposal. It’s unfortunate that the previous attempt from the member for York Centre did not come to fruition. Many assemblies have poets laureate. These are people who are able to speak the stories of their countries, their provinces, their regions or their municipalities, and that adds a great deal. The ability they have to share those stories, especially with young people, and strengthen literacy and strengthen the importance of the written and spoken word, is very important. I think this is an initiative that we should all support, and I look forward to it coming into reality.", "I believe that honouring and highlighting the achievements of our artists, and particularly our Ontario poets, is a very important part of our service to the province. Poets are extraordinary components of our literary world. I’m pleased that in 2007 the government of Ontario passed a historic piece of legislation, the Status of Ontario’s Artists Act, which committed the government to recognize the fact that artists make significant contributions to Ontario’s economy and quality of life. I know that both Minister Coteau and MPP Kiwala are working very hard to celebrate and highlight the profile of artists in Ontario.", "The bill proposed by the member for Windsor–Tecumseh will only serve to underscore the government’s commitment to the literary arts and to culture more generally. Speaking of literary culture, there is a very vibrant and lively arts community in my own riding of Etobicoke–Lakeshore. There are a number of organizations that promote not only visual arts but the written word and poetry. There’s the Arts Etobicoke organization, which has been established since 1973, and it has over 55 member groups, many of which are involved in poetry and the written word. I have the Lakeshore Arts organization in my community, which sponsors literary readings and other cultural events. I also have a very extraordinary school in Etobicoke–Lakeshore, the Etobicoke School of the Arts, which attracts some of the most talented young people from across the city of Toronto in their pursuit of artistic excellence, and many of them are poets. So this is something that in my community would be greatly valued and embraced.", "I’m very pleased with the proposal from the member for Windsor–Tecumseh, notwithstanding a few concerns that we have on this side of the House about how the private member’s bill has been written: the nature of the office that he’s proposing and the financial commitment that he’s trying to impose. But those aside, I think it’s a very laudable goal and one that I certainly will be supporting.", "I’m looking forward to the rest of the debate.

They had a venture fair at the city of Vaughan’s new city hall. It was really great to see so many young people, and some maybe not so young, with their initiatives specifically in the non-profit sector—very innovative.", "There was one presentation about a group of actors who do dinner theatre. They do corporate dinner theatre. They’re professional actors, and they incorporate people—maybe it’s something we can do here for some bonding exercises. They incorporate people to participate in the plays. It’s very interactive, and it’s wildly successful.", "People do want culture in their lives, and they want it to be something that’s part of different aspects of their lives; not just something they share within their family but maybe with their colleagues at work, their neighbours and just on the street.", "Not too far from Queen’s Park, we have a coffee shop called Snakes and Lattes.

There’s no alcohol there, and it’s busy. People like to interact, to have fun. There are other places where people are sharing their music and their poetry.", "I want to tell you a little bit about an experience I had when I went to Ireland. We all know there are musical pub crawls. But in Dublin, my husband, my eldest son and I participated in a literary pub crawl. Three actors accompanied us. I have to say that I’m not a big beer drinker, so I wasn’t there for the beer. But it was an eclectic group of people who signed up for this. The three actors who accompanied us stayed in their roles. One specifically was Oscar Wilde. They took us through the grounds of Trinity College. They told us stories of their time at Trinity College and their experiences in the neighbourhood.", "The highlight of the whole evening was Oscar Wilde; I’m going to call him Oscar Wilde because as far as I was concerned, he was Oscar Wilde. He told us a tale about being invited to bring a little culture to the miners in Colorado. He was invited by a sort of church group, I guess, of women who wanted to get those miners to be a little bit more broad in their culture. Oscar Wilde was having some difficulties back home, something about the son of an aristocrat and some legal issues—I won’t get into that. He decided that maybe he would take this group of women up on their wonderful offer to visit Colorado and bring some culture to the miners.", "They have preserved the letters he wrote back home to his friends. One of the letters was about how he got up on a stage in a little community hall. He told his friends back home, “Well, I wore my purple velvet suit. You know the one; it fits me so well. I put my biggest silver buckles on my shoes. I got up in front of the miners, who didn’t seem overly impressed with my outfit, and I was feeling a little nervous. They had their arms crossed and their suspenders were bursting and their flannel shirts were bursting at the buttons.” The actor was very eloquent in his description; we could all picture it quite clearly. He said that he told his best salon stories and regaled them with all sorts of interesting literary soliloquies, and the miners barely cracked a smile and didn’t seem terribly interested.", "But as soon as he got off the stage, they swarmed him. He thought, “Well, maybe I did get through to them.” No, no. They swarmed him and they took him: “We want to show you our life. We want to show you the mines.” They loaded him into a basket and pulled the ropes and lowered him down into the mine. He didn’t feel he had a choice. I guess there were no OPP officers in those days to help him out.", "He went along. He went down in the mine, and immediately they pulled out bottles of whisky. They passed around the first bottle and then the second bottle. At the end of the evening, as he reports, Oscar Wilde had to put the miners in the basket and load them up the ropes because, as he put it, “You’re not going to drink an Irishman under the table.”", "It was such a great experience. I think that we want to bring tourists to Toronto, and not just that: We want them to come back again and again. The way to do that isn’t just with restaurants, and it isn’t with casinos; it’s with bringing something meaningful to their lives, something they experience, something outdoors, something unusual, some kind of activity that they can really enjoy across different generations, across different cultures. That’s our challenge: how to make Toronto a first-rate city in terms of culture as well as so many other things.", "We all have visitors who come from out of town, and I think we all scratch our heads sometimes about what we can do with these visitors that isn’t going to cost us a week’s salary. It’s so nice that we do often have the fairs. I attended the Ashkenaz Festival, and I think it’s really well planned. At Harbourfront, I’ve been to milk festivals. We have Exhibition Place, and we used to have interesting things going on in different areas downtown. We have Luminato and Nuit Blanche. We have so many great things that it’s really up to us to help promote and to participate in. That’s what we can do as legislators and as members of our own communities and oftentimes as people with large Twitter followings and Facebook followings. When we promote an event, it’s very helpful to the organizers of the event to have us help promote it and bring people out.", "So I’m looking forward to not just having a poet laureate here in Ontario—I think it’s not just about the poet laureate; it’s about what it says about moving forward, what we can do to make this a destination not just where you have to go to the art gallery to see art, but where we can have art that moves around, art that’s interactive.", "We have long winters; this winter was quite brutal for a lot of people. So what can we do to bring local artists to the community centres, to the city halls, to the schools and, yes, to our seniors? We all know it’s not enough just to hire caregivers for our seniors. They want a good quality of life. They don’t want to be taken care of by a troupe of babysitters marching in and out. They want to be participating in the arts and in the culture, and I think that there’s so much more we can do.", "I’m looking forward to hearing from all the creative people, both inside and outside this House, as to what we can do to bring Ontario to be recognized as a place to visit that’s fun and educational and has that higher level of culture and history that I know we could achieve." ],

Thousands of scientists helped develop the report, which is the first since 2007, to bring together all aspects of tackling climate change.", "I want to take this opportunity right now for another quote, Mr. Speaker, from a very honourable individual, an environmental expert, Mr. David Suzuki.

The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ... is one of the largest bodies of international scientists ever assembled to study a scientific issue, involving more than 2,500 scientists from more than 130 countries. The IPCC has concluded that most of the warming observed during the past 50 years is attributable to human activities. Its findings have been publicly endorsed by the national academies of science of all G8 nations, as well as those of China, India and Brazil.”", "Speaker, this is also from David Suzuki’s website. He states, “The debate is over about whether or not climate change is real. Irrefutable evidence from around the world—including extreme weather events, record temperatures, retreating glaciers and rising sea levels—all point to the fact that climate change is happening now and at rates much faster than previously thought.”", "Additionally, I want to read an excerpt from a recent National Geographic edition, which kind of outlines some of the doubt that is being cast on whether or not climate change is real. It’s the same edition that talks about the Anti-Evolution League. The deputy House leader has a copy himself. I congratulate him on that, for taking the time to peruse that.", "The Anti-Evolution League is discussed in there. Of course, we all know that they were the force behind the monkey trial, where John T. Scopes was teaching evolution in Tennessee in 1925.

Many people in the United States—a far greater percentage than in other countries—retain doubts about that consensus or believe that climate activists are using the threat of global warming to attack the free market and industrial society generally. Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma, one of the most powerful Republican voices on environmental matters, has long declared global warming a hoax.", "“The idea that hundreds of scientists from all over the world would collaborate on such a vast hoax is laughable—scientists love to debunk one another.”", ".

From 1900 to 2015, we saw a 1.3-degree Celsius increase in Ontario’s average temperature. Scientists are predicting a 7.7% increase by the year 2100. As far as precipitation goes, there has been an 11.8% increase in precipitation in the last 100 years, but they’re forecasting 16.7% in the next 100 years.", "The points I’m trying to make now are that global warming is real, climate change is real, and we need to be taking action.", "Before I go any further, I want to talk about a tweet I received this morning after a press conference that I had the privilege of doing with the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change.

He provided a lot of insight on how the province is going to transform and what’s going to be needed as far as adjustments in our agricultural industry. With a two-degree increase in the temperature, lots of things are going to change agriculturally. I could go on on those particular aspects. We’re going to have longer growing seasons. We’re going to experience earlier planting. We’re going to experience what the Minister of Environment and Climate Change spoke about earlier in the House, how the apple industry was devastated two years ago in 2012: an early thaw, the trees budded, another frost. The impact that that had on the supply of apples and the actual costs in our local grocery stores was quite substantial. That’s just one example.", "Agriculture—I talked about that. But what about irrigation, Speaker? Irrigation, the watering of our crops, the water required for our livestock: These are all important issues that I think we have to start having a discussion about today. That’s why I brought forward this particular private member’s bill.", "Global warming is causing extreme weather events. I can recall, back in my hometown of Alexandria, in the great riding of Glengarry–Prescott–Russell, in July 2012 a hailstorm damaged both my vehicles extensively. As well, local wheat fields were completely devastated; they were flattened. That’s one. We’ve had record temperatures. That’s another reason why I brought this private member’s bill forward: because we just experienced the coldest February in the history of the province. There’s a reason for that. We’re going to be seeing more of these events, whether it’s snow in Buffalo, which is just next door; an ice storm in 2013, just before Christmas, right here; or constant flooding. The costs to the province of Ontario and insurance companies—that’s going to be quite an impact. So I think it’s important that we highlight that today as we debate this motion.", "I’m a qualified golf course construction supervisor and superintendent by trade. I’m concerned about the impact on our golf industry. We’re going to see an earlier season to golf in the spring and in the fall, but in the middle of summer, we’re going to experience longer periods of heat, which are going to affect revenues, because people are not going to go out and golf when those revenues are expected. I know that the Minister of Municipal Affairs is a huge golfer, and I look forward to golfing with him this summer.", "Ski hills: They’re going to have to be innovative because there are going to be ski hills across this province where in 50 years there’s going to be very limited snow, so there are going to be extra costs and demand on water to produce that snow. What about the jobs? They’re going to have to diversify as we continue to move forward.", "I really congratulate the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change for his passion on making the public more aware of what is going to be happening. I’m concerned for my children and my grandchildren, who are between three and seven. I’m concerned about the impacts that this is going to have on their lives as they move forward. I think it’s a responsible thing for us to do, to take action now, take it in a serious and thoughtful manner as well, and also to take the lead, which we already have on a number of issues that I’m sure the minister is going to talk about, whether it’s closing the coal-fired plants that have generated electricity for decades in this province.", "As we continue to move forward, I’m concerned about the impact these extreme weather events are going to have on the north, with drier seasons and forest fires. I’m concerned about the Great Lakes. That’s why we’re putting forward the Great Lakes Protection Act. So we have a number of initiatives here.", "I’m proud to stand today.

Internationally, the scientific community has accepted that many of these aspects that contribute to climate change have been caused by the buildup of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere. We must acknowledge that human activities are the source of these greenhouse gases, be it through the burning of fossil fuels or the conversion of land once used for forestry and agriculture.", "Though carbon dioxide is the main cause of human-induced climate change, it’s far too simplistic to suggest that greenhouse gases are solely responsible for climate change. The member from Glengarry–Prescott–Russell fails to acknowledge in this motion natural factors such as changes in volcanic activity, solar output and the earth’s orbit around the sun, which can all contribute to the climate change around the world. Climate change is a complex issue, and it’s not just one factor that contributes to it.", "Climate changes affect us, not just here in Ontario but all across Canada and the globe.

It’s something that affects everyone around the globe, and I do believe we need to do our part to reduce emissions. I consider protecting our environment an important part of government’s responsibilities. But I have to be clear in stating that implementing a carbon tax does not achieve this. We can help our environment without hurting our economy and industry here in Ontario, and there are ways to accomplish this.", "To be honest, I have to highlight the cheap political games that were being played earlier today by the Liberal government. Climate change is too important of an issue and we cannot play games with it.

Take your time, do your homework. I fear this cash-strapped government will rush into a carbon tax to fund their mismanagement of taxpayer dollars.", "It doesn’t have to be this way, but knowing this government’s track record, I don’t trust them. Again, I don’t trust this government to manage this file. They will quickly implement a devastating tax to Ontarians and hope that the people of Ontario forget about it by 2018.", "But you know what, Speaker? People will not forget. They will not forget when they go to the gas pumps and realize that gas prices have increased 7% to 10% per litre. They will not forget when they’re getting their dinner for their families and their grocery bills have increased. They will not forget what this government has done when they’re paying for their heating and hydro bills at the end of the month.", "Under the federal Liberal plan, in 2008 it was estimated that a family using roughly 1,800 litres of heating oil per year would see their costs jump by $50 per year in the first year of the plan, increasing to $2,003 in the fourth year.", "The introduction of a carbon tax to Ontarians will be devastating. This will be nothing more than a cash grab to fund more Liberal wasteful spending and mismanagement. Ontario families and Ontario businesses cannot afford another tax.", "Let me be clear: I am not against cutting greenhouse gases. What I am against is irresponsible taxation. We don’t have to raise the cost of everything, shut down certain industries and kill thousands of jobs in the manufacturing sector in order to be good environmental stewards. Industry on its own wants to be a good steward, and they are. In fact, in the last decade, Stats Canada reports that 26% of Canadian industries adopted new systems or equipment to reduce GHG emissions. Of these industries, 50% indicated that the improvements had a moderate or large impact in that reduction of GHG emissions.", "and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.", "Industry is doing their part. I spoke just this week to a chemical industry that has reduced their emissions by 20% in the last 15 years, a goal they set entirely on their own. The car industry, as well, is adapting. By 2025, passenger vehicles and light trucks will emit about half as many GHGs as 2008 models. In 2025, vehicles will also consume up to 50% less fuel than 2008 vehicles. GHG emissions from the 2018 heavy-duty vehicle models will be reduced by up to 23%. Again, I stress that industry is already doing their part. They want to help, but reckless policy, like adding a carbon tax, will not help them.", "Liberal history shows that we can’t believe the Liberal carbon tax will accomplish any objective other than picking everyone’s pockets. For example, they brought in a costly health premium tax; however, we see health services being cut across Ontario. They spent $2 billion on smart meters that didn’t result in conserving energy. A Liberal carbon tax will be nothing more than a cash grab, sold as an environmental measure by a government that’s desperate for money due to their incompetent management of Ontario’s finances.", "It is a shame that the members opposite decided this morning to play games with this important issue.

We see this time and time again, Speaker, and that is why I don’t buy how committed the Liberals claim to be to the health of the environment.

To address climate change, we need to find a balance. We do not need to sacrifice our economy to protect the environment. We can have both. There’s no shortage of solutions to reduce emissions.

Certainly, the new minister is extremely committed to that.", "Even those you might expect would not be accepting this—Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey, for instance, would not normally be a person you’d expect to be talking about climate change, except that his state was devastated by some weather conditions that were very detrimental to New Jersey, and he has now accepted the fact that climate change does exist.", "The single thing it has done the most, in this regard, to deal with it to this point in time has been the closing of the coal-fired plants. That was fought. There were many people who didn’t want to hear about closing those plants: It was going to cause job losses and other great problems out there, and it would be more costly to produce electricity. But I think there’s a pretty good consensus. In fact, John Baird, when he was the federal minister, used to extol the virtues of closing coal-fired plants. That was in the province of Ontario, and he gave it as Canada’s good record in that regard.", "The melting of the ice caps that we see—you see the ice caps in the north and the south, and the alarming state of melting taking place in Greenland and other places—would certainly provoke worry in all of us. The impact on homes and businesses is rather dramatic. We now see more flooding of homes and businesses taking place.", "That reminds me, it’s why we have conservation authorities that have—or used to have, in many cases—scientific and environmental people who advise on how to avoid this. It’s not good when we see, in some parts of the province, those environmental and scientific people being replaced with political cronies on things such as conservation authorities, because they have to take some strong stands about where people can build in order to ensure there is not a very significant problem arising there.", "There are many other people, I think, who want to make a presentation on this, but the last thing I’ll mention is insurance.

I’m going to go back to the comments of the Environmental Commissioner, the 2012 report from the Environmental Commissioner. “Ontario Government Retreats on Climate Change.” That was the headline of their media release. He talked about the recent government decisions to roll back programs, to not complete commitments, and said, “Where are we going? We thought we were moving forward on climate change. This government is retreating on climate change.”", "In 2013, the title of the study: “Failing Our Future.”", "“Ontario’s Environmental Commissioner, Gord Miller, says the government’s long-term energy policy could wipe out some of the gains that have been made in reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.”", "He said, “There has been little progress to report this year.”", "I have to tell you, Speaker, that everyone on those benches who knows about climate change knew about it in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013. They didn’t find out this week; they’ve known for a while. Yet the Environmental Commissioner has been saying regularly that you guys are failing. You’re retreating. You’re not doing what has to be done.", "In 2014, the headline in the media release: “Ontario Failing in Fight Against Climate Change.”", "Miller said, “It’s not going to meet its 2020 target because it has taken very little additional action to implement the climate change action plan it released seven years ago.”", "We have a resolution talking about how dire the situation is, and we have a litany of reports by our independent officer, the Environmental Commissioner, showing that this government has dragged its feet; gone backwards; failed to act. If you know that someone is going to be harmed and you don’t take action to prevent that harm, what is your moral standing?", "Speaker, one of the Liberals who spoke earlier mentioned flooding. In that 2014 report from the Environmental Commissioner, he talked about the failure of this government to adapt to climate change—a profound crisis our society is facing that it is fully aware of. It cannot claim ignorance on this subject.", "He noted in his report that Ontario’s flood plain maps urgently need updating because, frankly, they’re old—they’re decades old. They aren’t getting updated. The insurance industry is worried that smaller towns will not have the political muscle to push back against developers who want to build on flood plains.", "Speaker, talk to people who lived through the floods in High River, who had to deal with the mass disruption in their lives, and ask, is the government being responsible if it’s not actually putting adaptation in place?", "A last commentary from the Environmental Commissioner: “Conservation First needs more work.” In talking about the Conservation First program brought forward by the government, this is what the Environmental Commissioner had to say: “The vast majority of local electricity distribution utilities will miss their target for peak reduction. About half are expected to miss their target for reducing overall consumption.", "“The government has eliminated all of the interim electricity conservation targets that were used to measure the progress towards meeting its overall goals.” So the target that’s left is the one—I think it was 2030 or 2032.", "This government knows what’s happening, could act, has been in a position to act for over a decade and is not doing what Ontarians need. I look forward to debating substantive legislation. I think if you want to wedge an issue, you can do it with substantive legislation. This motion—really, Speaker, do we need to vote on the earth being round? Seriously?", "Anyway, I’ll leave it at that—a few moments for my colleague to comment." ],

He’s a friend and a long-time committed advocate for some of the issues that are near and dear to my heart, including cycling, as the House will know. This morning, in fact, we had the first meeting of our all-party cycling caucus. It was extremely successful, I think, and very well done. It was the kind of non-partisan co-operation that issues like climate change demand.", "that are already being reached. To delay will be more costly than tackling it now.", "Cycling as a contribution to this is a highly efficient transportation form. Indeed, before cars came along, it was already a highly efficient form of transportation. It remains today, in a growing number of cities, a primary mode of transportation, increasing in popularity because of its contribution to lowering greenhouse gas emissions as part of the climate change conversation. Carbon-intensive travel contributes about 24% of emissions in greenhouse gases. It’s worth noting that cycling, which our government supported—the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change, along with myself, launched a cycling strategy, the first in 20 years, in September 2013. I stood shoulder to shoulder with him then, and I stand shoulder to shoulder with him now.", "Of course, cycling is also the simplest choice that individuals can make to reduce their carbon footprint. Very easy to do, it has huge benefits for your health, your wallet. It has great benefits for neighbourhoods. It decreases greenhouse gases from transportation, as I mentioned. Encouraging cycling as a zero-carbon option will make an important contribution to climate change.", "I’m very proud on a local basis of my local chamber. Why? Because at the national chamber of commerce meeting, they had a policy resolution that was passed at the Ontario chamber. It went to the national chamber meeting, and it passed. What did it call for? It called for the federal government to enact a climate change adaptation strategy for Canada. This resolution was debated and adopted by delegates from across Ontario and from across the country. It calls on the Canadian government to develop and implement a national strategy on climate change that is based on scientific and socio-economic research.", "So to think that business isn’t interested in this conversation—you bet they are. They’re worried about it. People in my riding are worried about it. Businesses in my riding are showing leadership at the national level.", "I think we can all agree, Speaker.

I think we can all agree that the right has just abandoned this issue.", "But if we want to look at records, let us just wonder why we’re looking to the NDP to support this motion today. When the first effort at putting a price on carbon started in Canada, it started in British Columbia, under Gordon Campbell. What party nearly crushed out the first, most important climate change agenda at the provincial level and the first attempt to get a price on carbon? It was the BC New Democrats, who famously led a vicious attack on the government and nearly undermined it. And what happened when that price came on carbon? BC saw its highest per capita GDP growth. So tragic was it that the best environmentalist in BC, the former mayor of Vancouver and the former BC Premier, who was one of the great green activists in the tradition that you and I like to respect, tore up his NDP card over this complete nonsense and left the party.", "Second of all, when I was mayor of Winnipeg, Al Duerr and I worked with Jack Layton to try to broker a national climate change strategy. Who was our friend in the west? Gord Campbell. Did Gary Doer take a meeting with us? No. Did Gary Doer support it? No. Now we know why. The former NDP Premier is now the voice of Stephen Harper, attacking the Obama administration and trying to enable the XL pipeline. So maybe we have a few questions for the NDP.", "If my party carries baggage because we didn’t do enough, in your mind, through the recession, you are going to need a train full of porters to carry the baggage the NDP has.", "Yes, this is a serious problem. I loved it when you talked. We just had a briefing from Gord Miller, the Environmental Commissioner, who says that since Premier Wynne has come into this government—he went through the list of all the things that we were doing and said how remarkably impressed he was with this very reinvigorated commitment to do that. So you can quote two- or three-year-old statements from the Environmental Commissioner.", "My friends in the Conservatives: We searched. I tried to find a single, unsolicited statement by any member of the Conservative Party on climate change. Do you know how many there are? None. Zero. The only comments you’ve made are anti- ones.", "My critic is saying, “Just slow down. Don’t rush. Don’t do this.” We’ve had 20 years of climate negotiations. The last five years have seen the highest GHG emissions. We are one of only about five jurisdictions in the Americas that are below our 1990 levels.", "Mr. Speaker, we all went through the recession.

If you actually read the research, you’re completely correct: It was certainly a significant factor and an unwelcome one. But it was also part of the reason other measures were slowed down. You might have noticed that revenues for governments in all these jurisdictions kind of collapsed. Now that we’re getting back, we have reinvigorated. We were hoping that this would be a bit of a New Zealand, Norwegian or British commitment to actually elevate this above partisan politics—but clearly we’re not. So this government is quite happy to take the other tack.", "This is the seventh time I’ve stood in this House to ask for non-partisan co-operation on this issue—not even any positive response. My favourite is when I met with my critic in the Conservatives, who said, “Well, we really don’t know what we’re doing. Wait till May 9 and you can talk to our leader.” I have waited patiently for Ms. Elliott, for any of my colleagues in the opposition to say the word during the leadership bid.
